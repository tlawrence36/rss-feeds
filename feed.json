      "While Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs awaits a jury\u2019s verdict in his high-stakes federal sex trafficking trial, the once-celebrated music mogul has seen his business empire rapidly unravel",
      "LOS ANGELES -- While Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs awaits a jury\u2019s verdict in his federal sex trafficking trial, the once-celebrated music mogul has seen his business empire rapidly unravel.",
      "Combs, 55, who is one of the most influential figures in hip-hop history, now faces charges, including racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking involving two former partners and transporting people across state lines for prostitution. Prosecutors have painted a dark portrait of the mogul, whose alleged pattern of violence included drug-fueled sex parties he reportedly called \u201cfreak-offs\u201d or \u201chotel nights.\u201d",
      "If convicted, the three-time Grammy winner could face life in prison. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Here\u2019s a closer look at how Combs\u2019 business portfolio and public image have crumbled under the weight of the allegations.",
      "Before Combs was arrested and charged, his major business ventures had collapsed: He stepped down and later fully divested from Revolt TV, which was founded in 2013. The network offered a mix of programming focused on hip-hop culture, R&B music, social justice and documentaries.",
      "He also reportedly lost a Hulu reality series deal and saw his once-iconic fashion brand Sean John vanish from Macy\u2019s shelves.",
      "After surveillance footage surfaced last year showing Combs physically assaulting singer Cassie, his then-girlfriend, in 2016, consequences mounted: New York City revoked his ceremonial key, Peloton pulled his music, Howard University rescinded his honorary degree and his charter school in Harlem cut ties.",
      "Last year, Combs settled a legal dispute with Diageo, relinquishing control of his lucrative spirits brands, Ciroc and DeLe\u00f3n. While many of his ventures have unraveled, his music catalog \u2014 for now \u2014 remains intact.",
      "Bad Boy Records may be synonymous with 1990s icons like The Notorious B.I.G., Faith Evans, Ma$e, and 112, but Combs kept the label relevant before his arrest with high-profile releases.",
      "In 2023, Combs dropped \u201c The Love Album: Off the Grid,\u201d which was his first solo studio album in nearly two decades, and Janelle Mon\u00e1e released her critically acclaimed project \u201d The Age of Pleasure \" through Bad Boy. Both albums earned Grammy nominations, with Mon\u00e1e\u2019s effort recognized in the prestigious record of the year category.",
      "Ahead of the \u201cThe Love Album\u201d release, Combs made headlines by returning Bad Boy publishing rights to several former artists and songwriters, years after he was criticized for how he handled their contracts.",
      "Bad Boy Records remains operational, but the label has been significantly shaken by Combs' legal firestorm and it hasn't announced any major upcoming releases.",
      "Last week, a surprise EP called \u201cNever Stop\u201d released by his son, King Combs, and Ye (formerly Kanye West), showed support for the embattled mogul. The project was released through Goodfellas Entertainment.",
      "Bad Boy Records remained active through 2022, backing Machine Gun Kelly\u2019s \u201cMainstream Sellout\u201d under the Bad Boy umbrella. He was a producer on MTV\u2019s reality television series \u201cMaking the Band,\u201d and \u201cMaking His Band,\u201d launching the careers of artists like the girl group Danity Kane and male R&B group Day 26.",
      "Combs has been sued by multiple people who claim to have been victims of physical or sexual abuse. He has already paid $20 million to settle with one accuser, his former girlfriend Cassie. Most of those lawsuits, though, are still pending. It isn\u2019t clear how many, if any, will be successful, or how much it will cost Combs to defend himself in court. Combs and his lawyers have denied all the misconduct allegations and dismissed his accusers as out for a big payday.",
      "Federal prosecutors have also informed the court that if Combs is convicted, they would seek to have him forfeit any assets, including property, \u201cused to commit or facilitate\u201d his crimes. They won\u2019t detail exactly what property that might involve until after the trial is over.",
      "Despite the legal turmoil surrounding Combs, his music catalog remains widely available on major streaming platforms including Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon Music. None of the streamers have publicly addressed whether they plan to adjust how his music is featured if Combs is convicted.",
      "Interestingly, Combs\u2019 music saw a roughly 20% boost in U.S. streaming between April and May 2025, his biggest monthly spike this year, according to Luminate. The numbers jump coincided with key moments in the trial, including testimonies from Cassie and Kid Cudi.",
      "However, there was a slight drop-off with a 5 to 10% decrease in June compared to the previous month\u2019s streams.",
      "Streaming makes up a fraction of an artist's revenue and is calculated through a complicated process called \u201cstreamshare.\" Most artists see very little pay from digital services.",
      "Sean John, founded in 1998, has gone largely dormant, with its presence disappearing from major retailers like Macy's. There are no clear signs of a relaunch on the horizon.",
      "In 2023, Combs launched Empower Global, an online marketplace designed to uplift Black-owned businesses and strengthen the Black dollar. He positioned the platform as a modern-day \u201cBlack Wall Street,\u201d backing it with a reported $20 million of his own investment.",
      "The platform debuted with 70 brands and planned to expand by onboarding new Black-owned businesses each month, aiming to feature more than 200 by year\u2019s end.",
      "However, as 2023 came to a close, several brands cut ties with Empower Global. It was reported that some cited disappointing performance and growing concerns over the misconduct allegations surrounding Combs.",

      "NEW YORK -- The Detroit Tigers' Double-A Erie Seawolves will be renamed the Erie Moon Mammoths after being picked by John Oliver of HBO\u2019s \u201cLast Week Tonight.\u201d",
      "Oliver devoted a May 4 segment to names and promotions of minor league baseball teams, announcing: \u201cWe are willing to use all of our resources and stupidity to give one Minor League Baseball team a total rebrand. We will give you a new team name, a new mascot. We will even throw you a theme night. It will be personalized and it will be bespoke.\u201d",
      "Two weeks later, Oliver selected Erie from among 47 team submissions. Oliver said the northwestern Pennsylvania team had given 11 reasons it should be picked, including the team had pioneered cotton candy hot dogs and pointed out \u201cThe SeaWolves play baseball nowhere near the sea.\u201d",
      "Oliver announced Sunday he had chosen Moon Mammoths, using Bob Costas' voice as narrator of a promotional video introducing the moniker.",
      "The name was inspired by the 1991 discovery of woolly mammoth remains by George Moon, a Summit Township resident who found a bone while scuba diving in Lake Pleasant, about 8 miles south of Erie. The mammoth remains are housed in the State Museum of Pennsylvania in Harrisburg.",
      "Erie, which has won the past two Eastern League championships, will be renamed the Moon Mammoths for games on July 19, Aug. 19, Sept. 12 and Sept. 13.",
      "Major League Baseball said Monday the team will wear jerseys with a rising moon with the team\u2019s name across the chest, a moon on sleeves and a patch with a woolly mammoth wearing a space helmet.",
      "Oliver is expected to attend the July 19 game against Chesapeake, called a \u201cMammoth Fun\u201d night. The first 1,000 ticketed fans will receive a Moon Mammoths squishy toy and there will be postgame fireworks. George Moon was also invited to attend.",

      "The Glastonbury Festival is making headlines for controversy rather than music",
      "LONDON -- The Glastonbury Festival is making headlines for controversy rather than music.",
      "The likes of Olivia Rodrigo, Rod Stewart, Neil Young, Charli XCX, Busta Rhymes and Doechii played to tens of thousands onsite, and millions more on TV, during Britain\u2019s biggest and most famous music extravaganza. But it\u2019s little-known rap-punk duo Bob Vylan attracting politicians\u2019 ire \u2014 and a police probe \u2014 after leading a chant calling for \u201cdeath\u201d to the Israeli military.",
      "This isn\u2019t the first time politics has collided with pop at the festival. For half a century, Britain\u2019s big political and cultural divides have found their way onstage at Glastonbury.",
      "The Glastonbury Festival of Contemporary Performing Arts, to give it its full name, was founded by Michael Eavis in 1970 on his Worthy Farm, 120 miles (some 200 kilometers) southwest of London. It\u2019s still run by the 90-year-old farmer and his daughter, Emily Eavis.",
      "Originally a hippie happening with a 1 pound ticket price (about 20 pounds or $27 today), Glastonbury has largely shed its counterculture cachet. These days, tickets for the three-day event cost close to 400 pounds. But it remains famous for its eclectic lineup, unique atmosphere and commitment to environmentalism and other progressive causes.",
      "This year\u2019s event drew about 200,000 people to see almost 4,000 performers on 120 stages, alongside film screenings and live debates on a variety of issues.",
      "Glastonbury was founded in a spirit of hippie idealism that has never entirely faded. In the 1980s, the festival donated some of its profits to the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, which protested U.S. nuclear weapons on British soil. It continues to support charities including Oxfam and Greenpeace.",
      "By the late 1980s, attendees included New Age \u201ctravelers\u201d involved with the U.K.\u2019s unofficial and anarchic rave scene. In 1990, some travelers clashed with security at the site, leading to significant damage and more than 200 arrests.",
      "Since then, the festival\u2019s security and organization have grown increasingly professional, sparking regret from some fans who feel it has lost its alternative spirit.",
      "The 2016 festival coincided with the U.K.\u2019s referendum on European Union membership, and the decision to leave the bloc \u2014 which most young people opposed \u2014 overshadowed the event. Many performers mentioned Brexit and the dispirited mood, including headliner Adele, who urged people to \u201clook after each other.\u201d",
      "Performers have often vented their opposition to politicians from the stage. In 2019, rapper Stormzy led the crowd in \u201cF___ Boris\u201d chants aimed at then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson. This year, Irish rappers Kneecap directed the same expletive at Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",
      "In contrast, then-Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn was warmly received at the festival in 2017 after doing better than expected against the Conservatives in a general election.",
      "Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in Gaza has provoked heightened emotions that spilled over onto Glastonbury\u2019s stages.",
      "Before the event, some politicians called for Glastonbury to cancel a performance by Irish-language hip-hop trio Kneecap, whose pro-Palestinian comments, critics say, have crossed a line into support for violence.",
      "Kneecap member Liam \u00d3g \u00d3 hAnnaidh has been charged under the Terrorism Act with supporting a proscribed organization for allegedly waving a Hezbollah flag at a concert in London in November. He denies the charge, and Kneecap has accused critics of trying to silence the band because of its support for the Palestinian cause.",
      "Kneecap\u2019s energetic set included plenty of pro-Palestinian comments and criticism of the government. But it was the act that preceded them, Bob Vylan, that caused a furor when a member of the duo led chants of \u201cdeath to the IDF,\u201d the Israel Defense Forces.",
      "The Avon and Somerset Police force said officers would review video evidence \u201cto determine whether any offenses may have been committed that would require a criminal investigation.",
      "Michael and Emily Eavis said Bob Vylan had \u201cvery much crossed a line.\u201d They said \u201cthere is no place at Glastonbury for antisemitism, hate speech or incitement to violence.\u201d",
      "Britain\u2019s publicly funded national broadcaster is under fire for showing Bob Vylan\u2019s set, one of dozens of Glastonbury performances it streamed live online.",
      "The BBC said Monday that it should have cut off the broadcast after the \u201cantisemitic\u201d and \u201cutterly unacceptable\u201d comments, and has removed the performance from its website. But the government is demanding to know what \u201cdue diligence\u201d it did on Bob Vylan before the broadcast.",
      "Some media experts say the broadcaster is in a difficult position. Steven Barnett, professor of communications at the University of Westminster, said Britain\u2019s influential right-wing press,\u201d including newspapers such as the Daily Mail and The Sun, frequently attack the BBC, \u201cfor both commercial and ideological reasons.\u201d",
      "Right-leaning newspapers featured the Bob Vylan story prominently, and Barnett said that attention \u201cputs any political leader under enormous pressure\u201d to express an opinion.",

      "KALOBEYEI, Kenya -- Beads of sweat drip from the faces of young girls and boys as they dance to the rhythm of traditional drums and open calabashes, while their peers watch them in awe.",
      "These are refugee children, some who were born in one of Africa\u2019s largest camps \u2014 Kakuma, located in northern Kenya, where more than 300,000 refugees\u2019 livelihoods have been affected by funding cuts that have halved monthly food rations.",
      "The children use the Acholi traditional dance as a distraction from hunger and have perfected a survival skill to skip lunches as they stretch their monthly food rations that are currently at 30% of the U.N nutritional recommendation per person.",
      "The Acholi people, mostly from Uganda and South Sudan, are among refugees who live in Kakuma camp, which was established in 1992 as a safe haven for people fleeing conflict from dozens of east African countries.",
      "For a moment, the melodious sound of one of the refugee mothers stops the playground buzz of activity as dozens of children sit down to enjoy the traditional dance performance.",

The sky itself is no limit for this couple who have traveled into space, and expectations are about as high.",

      "Beyond that, the team of the world\u2019s fourth-richest man has kept details under wraps. Still, whispers point to events spread across the lagoon city, adding complexity to what would have been a massive logistical undertaking even on dry land.",
      "On Thursday, dozens of private jets touched down at Venice\u2019s airport as yachts pulled into the city\u2019s famed waterways. Aboard were athletes, celebrities, influencers and business leaders, converging to revel in extravagance that is as much a testament to the couple\u2019s love as to their extraordinary wealth.",

      "Still, any desire to dampen the prevailing fever pitch has yet to materialize. Instead, the glitterati were set to party, and the paparazzi jostling for glimpses of the gilded gala.",
      "Whatever happens, it will be a wedding for the ages.",
      "Venice is famed for its network of canals, where gondoliers croon for lovestruck couples and even ambulances are aquatic. But water transport of everything from bouquets to guests makes Venice among the world's most challenging cities for a party, according to Jack Ezon, CEO of luxury travel advisory and event planner Embark Beyond.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very tight-knit community; everyone there knows everyone, and you need to work with the right people,\u201d said Ezon, whose company has put on a dozen high-end events in Venice. \"There\u2019s very tight control, especially on movement there with boats.\u201d",
      "It at least triples the cost versus staging the same soiree in Rome or Florence, he said.",
      "Veneto Gov. Luca Zaia was first to give an estimated tally for the Bezos/S\u00e1nchez bash: He told reporters this week the most recent total he saw was between 40 million and 48 million euros (up to $56 million).",
      "It\u2019s an eye-popping, jaw-dropping figure that's over 1,000 times the $36,000 average cost of American couples' weddings in 2025, according to wedding planning website Zola\u2019s annual report.",
      "Bezos\u2019 team has been tight-lipped about where these millions are going. When the youngest son of Asia\u2019s richest man married last July, performances by pop stars Rihanna and Justin Bieber pushed up the price tag.",
      "\u201cHow do you spend $40 million on a three- or four-day event?\u201d Ezon said. \u201dYou could bring headliners, A-list performers, great DJs from anywhere in the world. You could spend $2 million on an incredible glass tent that\u2019s only there for 10 hours, but it takes a month to build,\" or expand the celebration to local landmarks.",
      "There's no sign S\u00e1nchez and Bezos, the former CEO of Amazon, intend to take over any of Venice\u2019s tourist-thronged hotspots. Still, intense hand-wringing about the prospect prompted their wedding coordinator, Lanza & Baucina, to issue a rare statement calling those rumors false.",
      "On Thursday, a string of water taxis cut through the lagoon to bring Bezos, S\u00e1nchez and guests to the Madonna dell\u2019Orto cloister as some onlookers cheered. Paparazzi followed in their own boats, trying to capture guests on camera \u2014 Oprah Winfrey, Kim Kardashian, Ivanka Trump, Tom Brady, Orlando Bloom \u2014 as police on jet skis patrolled.",
      "Local media have reported the couple will hold a ceremony Friday on San Giorgio island, across the lagoon basin from St. Mark\u2019s Square. Associated Press journalists circling the island Thursday saw workers assembling tents and private security personnel stationed at every pier, including a newly built one.",
      "Media have also reported a reception Saturday in the Arsenale, a former navy base best known as a primary venue for the Venice Biennale.",
      "There are some who say these two should not be wed in this city.",
      "They characterize the wedding as a decadent display of wealth in a world with growing inequality, and argue it's a shining example of tourism taking precedence over residents\u2019 needs, particularly affordable housing and essential services. Venice is also one of the cities most vulnerable to rising sea levels from climate change.",
      "About a dozen Venetian organizations \u2014 including housing advocates, anti-cruise ship campaigners and university groups \u2014 are protesting under the banner \u201cNo Space for Bezos,\u201d a play on words referring to his space exploration company Blue Origin and the bride\u2019s recent space flight.",
      "Greenpeace unfurled a banner in St. Mark\u2019s Square denouncing Bezos for paying insufficient taxes. Activists floated a bald-headed Bezos-inspired mannequin down a Venice canal atop an Amazon delivery box, its hands clenching fake cash.",
      "Authorities \u2014 from Venice's mayor to the nation\u2019s tourism minister \u2014 have dismissed the outcry, saying it ignores the visibility and economic boost the wedding brings.",
      "\u201cThere will be photos everywhere, social media will go wild over the bride\u2019s dress, over the ceremony,\u201d Italy\u2019s tourism minister, Daniela Santanch\u00e8, told the AP.",
      "\u201cAll of this translates into a massive free publicity campaign. In fact, because they will spend a lot of money, they will enrich Venice \u2014 our shopkeepers, artisans, restauranteurs, hotels. So it\u2019s a great opportunity both for spending and for promoting Italy in the world.\u201d",
      "As Amazon\u2019s CEO, Bezos usually avoided the limelight, frequently delegating announcements and business updates to his executives. Today he has a net worth of $231 billion, according to Forbes.",
      "In 2019, he announced he was divorcing his first wife, MacKenzie Scott, just before the National Enquirer published a story about an affair with S\u00e1nchez, a former TV news anchor. S\u00e1nchez filed for divorce the day after Bezos\u2019 divorce was finalized.",
      "He stepped down as CEO in 2021, saying he wished to spend more time on side projects, including Blue Origin, The Washington Post, which he owns, and his philanthropic initiatives.",
      "Sitting beside S\u00e1nchez during an interview with CNN in 2022, he announced plans to give away the majority of his wealth during his lifetime.",
      "Last week, a Venetian environmental research association issued a statement saying Bezos\u2019 Earth Fund was supporting its work with an \u201cimportant donation.\u201d CORILA, which seeks protection of the Venetian lagoon system, said contact began in April, well before any protests.",

      "Lalo Schifrin, the composer who wrote the endlessly catchy theme for \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d and more than 100 other arrangements for film and television, died Thursday. He was 93.",
      "Schifrin\u2019s sons William and Ryan confirmed his death to trade outlets. The Associated Press\u2019 messages to Schifrin\u2019s publicist and representatives for either brother were not immediately returned.",
      "The Argentine won four Grammys and was nominated for six Oscars, including five for original score for \u201cCool Hand Luke,\u201d \u201cThe Fox,\u201d \u201cVoyage of the Damned,\u201d \u201cThe Amityville Horror\u201d and \u201cThe Sting II.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery movie has its own personality. There are no rules to write music for movies,\u201d Schifrin told The Associated Press in 2018. \u201cThe movie dictates what the music will be.\u201d",
      "He also wrote the grand finale musical performance for the World Cup championship in Italy in 1990, in which the Three Tenors \u2014 Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, Luciano Pavarotti and Jos\u00e9 Carreras \u2014 sang together for the first time. The work became one of the biggest sellers in the history of classical music.",
      "Schifrin, also a jazz pianist and classical conductor, had a remarkable career in music that included working with Dizzy Gillespie and recording with Count Basie and Sarah Vaughan. But perhaps his biggest contribution was the instantly recognizable score to television\u2019s \u201cMission: Impossible,\u201d which fueled the just-wrapped, decades-spanning feature film franchise led by Tom Cruise.",
      "Written in the unusual 5/4 time signature, the theme \u2014 Dum-dum DUM DUM dum-dum DUM DUM \u2014 was married to an on-screen self-destruct clock that kicked off the TV show, which ran from 1966 to 1973. It was described as \u201conly the most contagious tune ever heard by mortal ears\u201d by New Yorker film critic Anthony Lane and even hit No. 41 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1968.",
      "Schifrin originally wrote a different piece of music for the theme song but series creator Bruce Geller liked another arrangement Schifrin had composed for an action sequence.",
      "\u201cThe producer called me and told me, \u2018You\u2019re going to have to write something exciting, almost like a logo, something that will be a signature, and it\u2019s going to start with a fuse,\u2019\u201d Schifrin told the AP in 2006. \u201cSo I did it and there was nothing on the screen. And maybe the fact that I was so free and I had no images to catch, maybe that\u2019s why this thing has become so successful \u2014 because I wrote something that came from inside me.\u201d",
      "When director Brian De Palma was asked to take the series to the silver screen, he wanted to bring the theme along with him, leading to a creative conflict with composer John Williams, who wanted to work with a new theme of his own. Out went Williams and in came Danny Elfman, who agreed to retain Schifrin\u2019s music.",
      "Hans Zimmer took over scoring for the second film, and Michael Giacchino scored the next two. Giacchino told NPR he was a hesitant to take it on, because Schifrin\u2019s music was one of his favorite themes of all time.",
      "\u201cI remember calling Lalo and asking if we could meet for lunch,\u201d Giacchino told NPR. \u201cAnd I was very nervous \u2014 I felt like someone asking a father if I could marry their daughter or something. And he said, \u2018Just have fun with it.\u2019 And I did.\u201d",
      "\u201cMission: Impossible\u201d won Grammys for best instrumental theme and best original score from a motion picture or a TV show. In 2017, the theme was entered into the Grammy Hall of Fame.",
      "U2 members Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr. covered the theme while making the soundtrack to 1996\u2019s first installment; that version peaked at No. 16 on the Billboard 200 with a Grammy nomination.",
      "A 2010 commercial for Lipton tea depicted a young Schifrin composing the theme at his piano while gaining inspiration through sips of the brand\u2019s Lipton Yellow Label. Musicians dropped from the sky as he added elements.",
      "Born Boris Claudio Schifrin to a Jewish family in Buenos Aires \u2014 where his father was the concertmaster of the philharmonic orchestra \u2014 Schifrin was classically trained in music, in addition to studying law.",
      "After studying at the Paris Conservatory \u2014 where he learned about harmony and composition from the legendary Olivier Messiaen \u2014 Schifrin returned to Argentina and formed a concert band. Gillespie heard Schifrin perform and asked him to become his pianist, arranger and composer. In 1958, Schifrin moved to the United States, playing in Gillespie\u2019s quintet in 1960-62 and composing the acclaimed \u201cGillespiana.\u201d",
      "The long list of luminaries he performed and recorded with includes Ella Fitzgerald, Stan Getz, Dee Dee Bridgewater and George Benson. He also worked with such classical stars as Zubin Mehta, Mstislav Rostropovich, Daniel Barenboim and others.",
      "Schifrin moved easily between genres, winning a Grammy for 1965\u2019s \u201cJazz Suite on the Mass Texts\u201d while also earning a nod that same year for the score of TV\u2019s \u201cThe Man From U.N.C.L.E.\u201d In 2018, he was given an honorary Oscar statuette and, in 2017, the Latin Recording Academy bestowed on him one of its special trustee awards.",
      "Later film scores included \u201cTango,\u201d \u201cRush Hour\u201d and its two sequels, \u201cBringing Down The House,\u201d \u201cThe Bridge of San Luis Rey,\u201d \u201cAfter the Sunset\u201d and the horror film \u201cAbominable.\u201d",
      "Writing the arrangements for \u201cDirty Harry,\u201d Schifrin decided that the main character wasn\u2019t in fact Clint Eastwood\u2019s hero, Harry Callahan, but the villain, Scorpio.",
      "\u201cYou would think the composer would pay more attention to the hero. But in this case, no, I did it to Scorpio, the bad guy, the evil guy,\u201d he told the AP. \u201cI wrote a theme for Scorpio.\u201d",
      "It was Eastwood who handed him his honorary Oscar.",
      "\u201cReceiving this honorary Oscar is the culmination of a dream,\u201d Schifrin said at the time. \u201cIt is mission accomplished.\u201d",
      "Among Schifrin\u2019s conducting credits include the London Symphony Orchestra, the Vienna Symphony Orchestra, the Israel Philharmonic, the Mexico Philharmonic, the Houston Symphony Orchestra, the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. He was appointed music director of Southern California\u2019s Glendale Symphony Orchestra and served in that capacity from 1989-1995. Schifrin also wrote and adapted the music for \u201cChristmas in Vienna\u201d in 1992, a concert featuring Diana Ross, Carreras and Domingo.",
      "He also combined tango, folk and classical genres when he recorded \u201cLetters from Argentina,\u201d nominated for a Latin Grammy for best tango album in 2006.",
      "Schifrin was also commissioned to write the overture for the 1987 Pan American Games, and composed and conducted the event\u2019s 1995 final performance in Argentina.",
      "And for perhaps one of the only operas performed in the ancient Indigenous language of Nahuatl, in 1988 Schifrin wrote and conducted the choral symphony \u201cSongs of the Aztecs.\u201d The work premiered at Mexico\u2019s Teotihuacan pyramids with Domingo as part of a campaign to raise money to restore the site\u2019s Aztec temple.",
      "\u201cI found it to be a very sweet, musical language, one in which the sounds of the words dictated interesting melodies,\u201d Schifrin told The Associated Press at the time. \u201cBut the real answer is that there\u2019s something magic about it. ... There\u2019s something magic in the art of music anyway.\u201d",
      "In addition to his sons, he\u2019s survived by his daughter, Frances, and wife, Donna.",

    "story": [
      "Bill Moyers, the former White House press secretary who became one of television\u2019s most honored journalists, has died at 91",
      "NEW YORK -- Bill Moyers, the former White House press secretary who became one of television\u2019s most honored journalists, masterfully using a visual medium to illuminate a world of ideas, died Thursday at age 91.",
      "Moyer died in a New York City hospital, according to longtime friend Tom Johnson, the former CEO of CNN and an assistant to Moyers during Lyndon B. Johnson's administration. He did not cite Moyers' cause of death.",
      "Moyer\u2019s career ranged from youthful Baptist minister to deputy director of the Peace Corps, from Johnson\u2019s press secretary to newspaper publisher, senior news analyst for \u201cThe CBS Evening News\u201d and chief correspondent for \u201cCBS Reports.\u201d",
      "But it was for public television that Moyers produced some of TV\u2019s most cerebral and provocative series. In hundreds of hours of PBS programs, he proved at home with subjects ranging from government corruption to modern dance, from drug addiction to media consolidation, from religion to environmental abuse.",
      "In 1988, Moyers produced \u201cThe Secret Government\u201d about the Iran-Contra scandal during the Reagan administration and simultaneously published a book under the same name. Around that time, he galvanized viewers with \u201cJoseph Campbell and the Power of Myth,\u201d a series of six one-hour interviews with the prominent religious scholar. The accompanying book became a best-seller.",
      "His televised chats with poet Robert Bly almost single-handedly launched the 1990s Men\u2019s Movement, and his 1993 series \u201cHealing and the Mind\u201d had a profound impact on the medical community and on medical education.",
      "In a medium that supposedly abhors \u201ctalking heads\u201d \u2014 shots of subject and interviewer talking \u2014 Moyers came to specialize in just that. He once explained why: \u201cThe question is, are the talking heads thinking minds and thinking people? Are they interesting to watch? I think the most fascinating production value is the human face.\u201d",
      "Demonstrating what someone called \u201ca soft, probing style\u201d in the native Texas accent he never lost, Moyers was a humanist who investigated the world with a calm, reasoned perspective, whatever the subject.",
      "From some quarters, he was blasted as a liberal thanks to his links with Johnson and public television, as well as his no-holds-barred approach to investigative journalism. It was a label he didn\u2019t necessarily deny.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m an old-fashion liberal when it comes to being open and being interested in other people\u2019s ideas,\u201d he said during a 2004 radio interview. But Moyers preferred to term himself a \u201ccitizen journalist\u201d operating independently, outside the establishment.",
      "Public television (and his self-financed production company) gave him free rein to throw \u201cthe conversation of democracy open to all comers,\u201d he said in a 2007 interview with The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cI think my peers in commercial television are talented and devoted journalists,\u201d he said another time, \u201cbut they\u2019ve chosen to work in a corporate mainstream that trims their talent to fit the corporate nature of American life. And you do not get rewarded for telling the hard truths about America in a profit-seeking environment.\u201d",
      "Over the years, Moyers was showered with honors, including more than 30 Emmys, 11 George Foster Peabody awards, three George Polks and, twice, the Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Gold Baton Award for career excellence in broadcast journalism. In 1995, he was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame.",

      "Bruce Springsteen isn't the only musician to complete or launch anticipated album projects, then to see it never see the light of day",
      "NEW YORK -- The idea that Bruce Springsteen wrote, recorded and ultimately shelved entire albums of music may seem odd to the casual listener. Why put yourself through all that work for nothing?",
      "Yet \u201clost albums\u201d are embedded in music industry lore. Some were literally lost. Some remained unfinished or unreleased because of tragedy, shortsighted executives or creators who were perfectionist \u2014 or had short attention spans.",
      "Often, the music is eventually made public, like Springsteen is doing now, although out of context from the times in which it was originally made.",
      "So in honor of Springsteen's 83-song \u201cTracks II: The Lost Albums\u201d box set being released Friday, The Associated Press has collected 10 examples of albums that were meant to be but weren't.",
      "Back in the news with the death of Brian Wilson, this album \u201cinvented the category of the lost masterpiece in popular music,\u201d says Anthony DeCurtis, contributing editor at Rolling Stone. Some of the material that surfaced suggested Wilson, the Beach Boys' chief writer, was well on his way: the majestic single \u201cGood Vibrations,\u201d the centerpiece \u201cHeroes and Villains\u201d and the reflective \u201cSurf's Up.\u201d Wilson succumbed to internal competitive pressure worsened by mental illness and drug abuse while making it in 1966 and 1967, eventually aborting the project. He later finished it as a solo album backed by the Wondermints in 2004. The better-known songs were joined with some psychedelic-era curios that displayed Wilson's melodic sense and matchless ability as a vocal arranger, along with lyrics that some fellow Beach Boys worried were too \u201cout there.\u201d",
      "The mercurial Prince pulled back this disc, set for release in December 1987, at the last minute. Some promo copies had already slipped out, and it was so widely bootlegged that when Warner Bros. officially put it out in limited release in 1994, the company billed it as \u201cThe Legendary Black Album.\u201d Encased in an all-black sleeve, the project was said to be Prince's nod to Black fans who may have felt they had lost him to a pop audience. It's almost nonstop funk, including a lascivious Cindy Crawford tribute and the workout \u201cSuperfunkycalifragisexy.\u201d The maestro's instincts were well-placed, though. Coming after \u201cSign O' the Times\u201d \u2014 arguably his peak \u2014 this would have felt like a minor project.",
      "Written and recorded in 2003, Green Day's \u201cCigarettes and Valentines\u201d was actually lost; someone apparently stole the master tapes. Feeling on a creative roll, the rock trio decided against recreating what they'd done and pressed on with new material. Smart move. The result was \u201cAmerican Idiot,\u201d the band's best work. Perhaps the robbery was \u201cjust a sign that we made a crappy record and we should make a better one,\u201d songwriter Billie Joe Armstrong told MTV. The title cut later surfaced on a 2010 live album. The rest was lost to time.",
      "To say anticipation was high for Dr. Dre\u2019s third album when he started recording in 2002 puts it mildly. The theme disc about a hitman, which Dre described as a \u201chip-hop musical,\u201d had an all-star squad of contributors including Eminem, 50 Cent, Mary J. Blige, Busta Rhymes and Kendrick Lamar. \u201cI\u2019d describe it as the most advanced rap album musically and lyrically we\u2019ll probably ever have a chance to listen to,\u201d co-producer Scott Storch told MTV. But we never have. When he announced a different third album in 2015, Dre explained on his radio show what happened to \u201cDetox\u201d: \u201cI didn\u2019t like it. It wasn\u2019t good. ... I worked my ass off on it, and I don\u2019t think I did a good enough job.\u201d",
      "A series of unfinished demos, \u201cBlack Gold\u201d was a taste of where guitar god Jimi Hendrix might have gone creatively if he hadn't died at 27 in 1970. He was composing a song suite about an animated Black superhero, says Tom Maxwell, whose podcast \u201cShelved\u201d unearths stories behind lost music. Hendrix sent a tape of his work to longtime drummer Mitch Mitchell for advice on fleshing it out. That music was set aside at Mitchell's home and forgotten for two decades after Hendrix died. To date, Hendrix's estate has made only one of these recordings public, a song called \u201cSuddenly November Morning.\u201d Hendrix, after clearing his throat, slips in and out of falsetto while accompanying himself on an acoustic guitar.",
      "Written while Yoko Ono was separated from John Lennon during his infamous \u201clost weekend\u201d in 1973-74, \u201cA Story\u201d had the potential of changing the musical narrative around her. It was a strong album \u2014 without the avant-garde stylings that made Ono a challenge for mainstream listeners \u2014 recorded with musicians who worked on Lennon's \u201cWalls & Bridges.\u201d Maxwell calls it \u201can emancipation manifesto\u201d that was set aside when Ono reconciled with Lennon. She's never publicly explained why, Maxwell says, although one song seems clearly about an affair she had while Lennon was away. Some of the material from \u201cA Story\u201d was included as part of the \u201cOnobox\u201d project that came out in 1992, and the album was released separately in 1997. Ono also re-recorded some of its songs in 1980, and Lennon was holding a tape of her composition \u201cIt Happened\u201d when he was shot and killed. In it, she sings about an unspecified, seemingly traumatic event: \u201cIt happened at a time of my life when I least expected.\u201d That wasn't even the most chilling premonition. Her song \u201cO'Oh\u201d ended with firecrackers that sound like gunshots. It was left off the 1997 release.",
      "Guns N' Roses was at the top of the hard rock world when they began recording a new album in 1994. It didn't go well. Inconclusive sessions slogged on for years, and all but singer Axl Rose left the group. Recording costs exceeded a staggering $13 million, by some accounts the most expensive rock album ever. One witness told The New York Times in 2005: \u201cWhat Axl wanted to do was to make the best record that had ever been made. It's an impossible task. You could go on indefinitely, which is what they've done.\u201d When \u201cChinese Democracy\u201d was finally released in 2008, the world yawned.",
      "Not even a decade after the triumph of \u201cWhat's Going On,\u201d Marvin Gaye was floundering. His \u201cHere, My Dear\u201d divorce album flopped, he struggled with drugs and searched for relevance in the disco era. The single \u201cEgo Tripping Out,\u201d meant to herald a new album, laid bare the problems: Over a melody cribbed from Donna Summer's \u201cHot Stuff,\u201d the famously cool \u201cLove Man\u201d boasted like an insecure rapper. He scrapped the album, repurposing some its material for the 1981 disc \u201cIn Our Lifetime,\u201d a process so fraught he bitterly left his longtime label Motown. Gaye went to CBS, made a huge comeback with \u201cSexual Healing,\u201d then was shot dead by his father in 1984.",
      "Neil Young rivals Prince in the volume of material left in his vault, and he's been systematically releasing much of it. The mostly acoustic \u201cHomegrown\u201d was recorded as 1974 bled into 1975, during Young's breakup with actor Carrie Snodgress. Instead of releasing it in 1975, he put out another heartbreak album, the well-regarded \u201cTonight's the Night,\u201d about losing friends to drug abuse. When Young finally dropped \u201cHomegrown\u201d in 2020, he wrote in his blog, \u201cSometimes life hurts. This is the one that got away.\u201d",
      "Of the discs included in Springsteen's \u201cTracks II\u201d set, this was reportedly the closest to being released, in the spring of 1995. After the success of the Oscar-winning song \u201cStreets of Philadelphia,\u201d Springsteen recorded an album in the same vein, with a synthesizer and West Coast rap-inspired drum loops setting the musical motif. Strikingly contemporary for its time, Springsteen ultimately felt it was too similar to previous releases dominated by dark stories about relationships. \u201cI always put them away,\u201d he said of his lost albums. \u201cBut I don't throw them away.\u201d",

      "In the 50-plus years of James Bond, the wait between films has never gone longer than six years",
      "In the 50-plus years of James Bond, the wait between films has never gone longer than six years. The next entry, and first since Daniel Craig's dramatic exit, may test that \u2014 but things are speeding up.",
      "On Wednesday, Amazon MGM Studio announced that Denis Villeneuve will direct the 26th Bond movie, putting the franchise in the hands of one of the most respected big-budget filmmakers. Here's what to know about that decision, and where things stand for 007.",
      "Villeneuve, the 57-year-old French Canadian director, edged out other filmmakers who were reportedly eyed for the gig, including Edward Berger (\u201cConclave\u201d) and Paul King (\u201cPaddington 2\u201d). Since emerging with 2010's \u201cIncendies,\" Villeneuve has established himself as a steward of cinematic IP (\"Blade Runner 2049,\" \u201cDune\u201d) and a specialist in dark, doom-laden spectacle (\"Sicaro,\" \u201cArrival\u201d).",
      "\u201cJames Bond is in the hands of one of today\u2019s greatest filmmakers,\u201d said Mike Hopkins, head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios.",
      "The culmination for Villeneuve has been the \u201cDune\u201d films. His first two entries have surpassed $1 billion in box office and gathered a combined 15 Academy Award nominations, winning seven. Villeneuve is expected to begin shooting the third \u201cDune\u201d film this summer, with a cast including Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Florence Pugh, Zendaya and Javier Bardem.",
      "\"I\u2019m a die-hard Bond fan. To me, he\u2019s sacred territory,\u201d said Villeneuve. \u201cI intend to honor the tradition and open the path for many new missions to come. This is a massive responsibility, but also, incredibly exciting for me and a huge honor.\u201d",
      "Amazon, which bought MGM Studios in 2022 for $8.5 billion, hasn't set a release date yet or announced a screenwriter. Producers Amy Pascal and David Heyman are shepherding the movie for the first time. In February, Amazon MGM Studios secured creative control of the franchise from Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, whose family has presided over Bond since the first film, 1962's \u201cDr. No.\u201d",
      "The most likely timing would be production starting in 2026 and the film being released sometime in 2027.",
      "No new 007 has been named, but that hasn't stopped rumors and conjecture from running rampant.",
      "It's pure speculation buts oddsmakers have a few expected contenders for the martini-sipping role. Those include Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Theo James, Aaron Pierre, Henry Cavill, James Norton and Jack Lowden. Expectations are that the new Bond will remain male and British, but producers have said nothing publicly to tip their hand.",
      "Whoever it is will have big shoes to fill. In his five-film, 15-year stretch in the tuxedo, Daniel Craig was widely seen as one of the best Bonds, including the high point of \u201cSkyfall\u201d (2012) and the swan song of \u201cNo Time to Die\u201d (2021).",
      "Since Albert \u201cCubby\u201d Broccoli obtained the movie rights to Ian Fleming's books, James Bond has been a family business. That didn't change after Amazon bought MGM, but it did earlier this year when Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli agreed to let the studio take creative control.",
      "That handoff stoked concern from many Bond fans that 007 would be picked apart for spinoffs, series and the kind of intellectual property strip mining Hollywood has been known for in other franchises like \u201cStar Wars.\u201d So far, though, Amazon MGM has made no announcement about any spinoffs, and is prioritizing the 26th Bond movie.",

      "A prosecutor began two days of closing arguments at Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs' sex trafficking trial by telling a jury that the music mogul used \u201cpower, violence and fear\u201d to rule a criminal enterprise for two decades",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs \u201ccommitted crime after crime\u201d but thought his \u201cfame, wealth and power\u201d put him above the law, a prosecutor told jurors Thursday as the hip-hop mogul\u2019s sex trafficking trial shifted to closing arguments.",
      "\u201cThat ends now,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to find the defendant guilty.\u201d",
      "Combs, 55, sat with his head down as Slavik highlighted testimony and evidence from the seven-week trial that she said proved sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy and other charges. Wearing a sweater and khakis, he sometimes scribbled notes to his lawyers and shook his head as Slavik played one of his audio messages for the jury.",
      "\u201cOver the last several weeks, you\u2019ve learned a lot about Sean Combs,\u201d Slavik said, launching into a nearly five-hour presentation. \u201cHe\u2019s the leader of a criminal enterprise. He doesn\u2019t take no for an answer. And now you know about many crimes he committed with members of his enterprise.\u201d",
      "Among the proof, Slavik argued, was evidence that Combs kidnapped an employee, was involved in setting rapper Kid Cudi\u2019s convertible ablaze, bribed a hotel guard and carried out \u201cbrutal crimes at the heart of this case.\u201d",
      "Combs \u201cagain and again forced, threatened and manipulated\u201d his ex-girlfriends Cassie and Jane into \u201chaving sex with escorts for his own entertainment,\u201d Slavik said, her lectern directly in front of jurors.",
      "The prosecutor said Combs forced or coerced Cassie, whose real name is Casandra Ventura, and Jane, who testified under a pseudonym, to engage in dayslong sex marathons known as \u201cfreak-offs\u201d or \u201chotel nights\u201d with drugs, violence, or by threatening financial harm or the release of video recordings of some of the hundreds of encounters.",
      "\u201cUp until today, the defendant was able to get away with these crimes,\u201d Slavik said.",
      "Bookending the trial\u2019s start, jurors again saw now-infamous security footage of Combs hitting, kicking and dragging Cassie at the Intercontinental Hotel in Los Angeles in 2016 after she tried to leave a freak-off with a male sex worker.",
      "\u201cHe knew exactly what he was doing. That is sex trafficking,\u201d Slavik told the jury, adding that Combs was \u201cknowingly using force and coercion to get Cassie back to that room where the escort was waiting.\u201d",
      "Slavik said Combs \u201ccounted on silence and shame\u201d to enable and prolong his abuse. He used a \u201csmall army\u201d of employees, including personal assistants and bodyguards, to harm women and cover it up, she said.",
      "The theory of racketeering law is that \u201cwhen someone commits crime as part of a group, they\u2019re more powerful and dangerous,\u201d Slavik said. \u201cThe defendant was a powerful man, but he became more powerful and dangerous because of his inner circle, his businesses \u2014 the enterprise.\u201d",
      "Combs and his inner circle \u201ccommitted hundreds of racketeering acts,\u201d she said.",
      "Members of Combs\u2019 family, including several of his children, watched from wooden benches in the packed courtroom. At one point, he gave them a thumbs-up.",
      "Since his arrest at a Manhattan hotel last September, Combs and his lawyers have insisted he is innocent, though they conceded at trial that domestic violence occurred.",
      "Combs \u201cwas abusive: physical, emotional, psychological, sexual abuse,\u201d Slavik said. \u201cThe defendant doesn\u2019t deny the abuse. They just want to call it \u2018domestic violence\u2019 and claim it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the crimes charged.\u201d",
      "The defense will give its closing argument on Friday, followed by a prosecution rebuttal argument. Then, Judge Arun Subramanian said, he will instruct jurors on the law before deliberations begin.",
      "Combs\u2019 lawyers built their case for acquittal through lengthy cross-examinations of government witnesses. Some testified only in response to subpoenas and insisted they didn't want to be there.",
      "Combs\u2019 lawyers contend there was no racketeering conspiracy because no employees agreed to join any conspiracy.",
      "In her closing, Slavik said employees repeatedly agreed to commit crimes for Combs, including delivering him drugs; accompanying him to kidnap his personal assistant; and locking Cassie in a hotel room after he stomped on her face.",
      "As Slavik returned repeatedly to the topic of Combs\u2019 sex marathons, jurors saw a slide that said \u201cThe Freak Offs\u201d next to a photo of him laying on a bed bathed in red light.",
      "Slavik reminded jurors of text messages and testimony that showed that the women didn't want to participate, including one in which Jane told Combs that she felt he gave her no choice.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s dark, sleazy and makes me feel disgusted with myself. I feel it\u2019s the only reason you have me around and why you pay for the house,\u201d Jane wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t want to feel obligated to perform these nights with you in fear of losing the roof over my head.\u201d",

      "Issey Miyake\u2019s menswear line has returned to Paris Fashion Week with a dazzling show at the Cartier Foundation",
      "PARIS -- As Paris wilted under the ruthless June sun, Issey Miyake sent out a battalion of intergalactic fashion soldiers at the Cartier Foundation Thursday, shimmering between art and menswear apparel in a spectacle where even the light was a player. The late-morning sun bounced sharply off the art museum's monumental steel pillars, forcing some guests to slide their seats to escape the dazzling reflections \u2014 an impromptu game of musical chairs set to a pulsing, kinetic soundtrack.",
      "This Paris Fashion Week season finds the Miyake house in the midst of transition. In January, Paris bid adieu to Homme Pliss\u00e9 \u2014 Miyake\u2019s pleated cult favorite that had anchored the city\u2019s menswear calendar since 2019 \u2014 as the brand shifted its focus to nomadic shows, most recently appearing under the Tuscan sun. The torch in Paris has now been passed to IM Men, the last line personally conceived by Issey Miyake before his death in 2022. Thursday\u2019s show marked IM Men\u2019s return to the Paris stage, under the direction of designers Sen Kawahara, Yuki Itakura, and Nobutaka Kobayashi.",
      "The theme, \u201cDancing Texture,\u201d nodded to the ceramic artistry of Shoji Kamoda, but also to the surreal choreography on display. Models appeared to roll, tilt, and swing through the light, their movements somewhere between ballet and a slow-motion video game. Occasionally, a guest would squint, unsure if they were watching a runway show or a heat-induced hallucination.",
      "The crowd \u2014 equal parts Parisian cool, visiting editors, and those for whom a pleated culotte is a spiritual calling \u2014 dodged the sun's glare and fanned themselves in the heat, shifting for both comfort and the best sightline. The first model glided out in a mad, angular hat, setting the tone for a parade of tin man-meets-space ninja silhouettes designed for dance floors or distant planets.",
      "The clothes themselves looked as if they had been engineered for a new climate \u2014 or perhaps a new species. Surfaces peeled, rippled, and shimmered, metallic foils flashed against the sun, and jacquard weaves evoked the carved waves of Kamoda\u2019s ceramics. Vermilion and white motifs burst forth alongside a near-neon green, courtesy of upcycled fishing nets. A coat unzipped into a dramatic collar while some blousons and pants, when laid flat, formed perfect circles \u2014 a wink at Kamoda\u2019s wheel-thrown plates.",
      "Miyake, who died in 2022, loomed large over the collection, his vision unmistakable in every engineered pleat and playful transformation. IM Men is the last line he conceived \u2014 a living laboratory for innovation, risk, and occasional absurdity, now energetically interpreted by a younger team. Even in his absence, his legacy is alive in every joke, fold, and jolt of surprise on the runway.",
      "Born in Hiroshima in 1938, Miyake rose from postwar Japan to become a global force, transforming fashion in the 1980s and \u201990s with his radical, sculptural vision. He pioneered heat-set pleating and created lines like Pleats Please and A-POC that blurred the boundaries between art, science, and daily life. Miyake\u2019s designs liberated fabric, allowing it to move with the body and imagination alike.",
      "Of course, the fashion house\u2019s embrace of the avant-garde still courts danger. Thursday's spectacle occasionally veered into excess, with kinetic art and sci-fi headgear that threatened to upstage the clothes themselves \u2014 a familiar Miyake risk. But the best moments, like a pared-back tangerine overcoat that floated past, proved restraint can sometimes steal the show.",

      "U.S. District Judge Melissa DuBose granted the preliminary injunction sought by a coalition of attorneys general from 19 states and the District of Columbia in a lawsuit filed in early May.",
      "DuBose said the states had shown \u201cirreparable harm,\u201d from the cuts and were likely to prevail in their claims that \u201cHHS\u2019s action was both arbitrary and capricious as well as contrary to law.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe executive branch does not have the authority to order, organize, or implement wholesale changes to the structure and function of the agencies created by Congress,\u201d DuBose wrote in a 58-page order handed down in U.S. district court in Providence.",
      "Her order blocks the Trump administration from finalizing layoffs announced in March or issuing any further firings. HHS is directed to file a status report by July 11.",
      "The ruling applies to terminated employees in four different divisions of HHS: the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the Center for Tobacco Products within the Food and Drug Administration; the Office of Head Start within the Administration for Children and Families and employees of regional offices who work on Head Start matters; and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation.",

      "He has remained in jail and has been barred from practicing medicine. Cheng faces up to 24 years in prison at sentencing, prosecutors said.",
      "\u201cThe level of violence and perversion displayed by Zhi Alan Cheng in sexually abusing multiple victims is compounded by the fact that he took an oath to do no harm as a medical professional,\" said District Attorney Melinda Katz. \u201cI thank the brave victim who initially came forward and exposed this abuse.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors alleged Cheng abused an eighth woman who was a patient at the hospital. He entered an Alford plea on that charge, meaning that he did not admit guilt but acknowledged that prosecutors have enough evidence to convict them.",
      "Most of the victims had no memory of the abuse and were sedated. One of the women woke up to in the middle of an assault after she had been sedated for a gastrointestinal procedure, prosecutors said.",
      "Prosecutors have said that New York-Presbyterian officials cooperated in the criminal investigation.",
      "\u201cAs caregivers, we are responsible for the safety and wellbeing of our patients. It is a sacred trust. The crimes committed by this individual are heinous, despicable, and a fundamental betrayal of our mission and the patients\u2019 trust. We are deeply sorry for all that the victims and their families have endured,\u201d New York-Presbyterian hospital spokesperson Angela Karafazli said in a statement.",
      "Chen's attorney, Jeffrey Einhorn, thanked prosecutors for the plea agreement and said: \u201cThe charges to which Mr. Cheng has pleaded guilty today are extraordinarily serious.\"",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday threw out appellate rulings in favor of transgender people in four states following the justices' recent decision upholding a Tennessee ban on certain medical treatment for transgender youths.",
      "But the justices took no action in cases from Arizona, Idaho and West Virginia involving the participation of transgender students on school sports teams. The court could say as soon as Thursday whether it will take up the issue in its next term.",
      "The high court ordered appellate judges to reexamine cases from Idaho, North Carolina, Oklahoma and West Virginia involving access to medical care and birth certificates.",
      "The action was unsurprising because the court had set the cases aside until after it decided the Tennessee case, as typically happens when the same legal issue is being considered.",
      "The rulings all included findings that the restrictions on transgender people imposed by the states violate the Constitution's equal protection clause.",
      "In the Tennessee case, the Supreme Court ruled that there was no constitutional violation in a state law prohibiting puberty blockers and hormone therapy to treat gender dysphoria in people younger than 18.",
      "The justices ordered the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, to review its decision that West Virginia\u2019s and North Carolina\u2019s refusal to cover certain health care for transgender people with government-sponsored insurance is discriminatory.",

      "A Ukrainian woman, Olha Kurtmalaieva, has endured cancer and war while fighting to bring her husband home from Russian captivity",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 \u201cYou have no moral right to die.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s what Olha Kurtmalaieva told herself as she lay in intensive care, her body shutting down after emergency chemotherapy. Her cancer had progressed to Stage 4, meaning it had spread to other parts of her body and was now incurable. The pain was unbearable. The doctors weren\u2019t sure she\u2019d make it through the night.",
      "She was facing death alone in the Ukrainian capital, while her soldier husband was in Russian captivity in the more than three-year war.",
      "\u201cIf I die now, who will bring him back?\" Olha thought to herself. \"He has no one else in Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Against the odds, she learned she was in remission last year. But even after multiple prisoner exchanges, including one that freed over 1,000 people, her husband, a Ukrainian marine, remains a captive.",
      "She hasn\u2019t given up. At nearly every exchange, she\u2019s there waiting, one of hundreds of Ukrainian women still trying to bring home their husbands, sons and brothers.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s everywhere in my life,\u201d Olha said. \u201cHis (photo) is on my phone screen, in my wallet, on the kitchen wall, in every room.\u201d",
      "Day and night, questions circled in her mind: \u201cWhat can I do to speed this up? What did I do today to bring him home?\u201d",
      "Olha was just 21 when she learned she had cancer. It was Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, Stage 2. The tumors were growing but were still treatable.",
      "\u201cAt that age, you\u2019re thinking: cancer? Why me? How? What did I do?\u201d she recalled. Her husband, Ruslan Kurtmalaiev, promised to stay by her side through every round of chemotherapy.",
      "When they met, in 2015, he was 21 and she was just 15. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t love at first sight,\u201d she said with a wide smile, eyes sparkling.",
      "Their attraction blossomed gradually that summer in Berdiansk, in what is now the Russian-occupied zone in the southern Zaporizhzhia region. Three years later, as soon as she turned 18, they wed.",
      "When they first met, it was not long after Russia illegally seized Crimea, Ruslan's homeland, in 2014, and also invaded eastern Ukraine. Ruslan, a professional soldier, had already served on the front line.",
      "From the beginning, Olha understood that life as a military wife meant constant sacrifice \u2014 long separations, missed milestones, and the uncertainty of war. But she never imagined that one day she would be waiting for her husband to return from captivity.",
      "When she describes Ruslan, tears well up in her eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s kind, he has a heightened sense of justice,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cFor him, it was a matter of principle to return home and bring our Crimea home,\u201d she said, a loss she fully comprehended only after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "\u201cOnly when I lost my home did I fully understand him.\"",
      "Olha managed to complete only two sessions of chemo before the full-scale invasion. When her long hair began to fall out, she shaved her head. When she sent Ruslan a photo, he didn\u2019t hesitate: \u201cGod, you\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d he told her.",
      "Later, he made a confession.",
      "\u201cHe told me, \u2018Yeah, I saw your hair falling out in the mornings. I gathered it all from your pillow before you woke up \u2014 so you wouldn\u2019t get upset.\u2019\u201d",
      "At the time, she believed that losing her hair was the worst thing that could happen to her. But soon after, she discovered what real tragedy meant.",
      "Olha never made it to her third round of chemo.",
      "She stayed in Berdiansk, which was seized by Russian forces in the early days of the war. Cut off from medical care and waiting for news of Ruslan, she quietly began helping the Ukrainian military from inside occupied territory.",
      "\u201cThere was no oncology department in Berdiansk. There was simply nowhere to get treated,\u201d she said. \u201cBut honestly, I didn\u2019t even care that much at the time.\u201d",
      "In early April, she discovered that Russians had captured Ruslan and others from his marine forces\u2019 unit.",
      "\u201cI started to cry, but then I stopped myself. I thought, \u2018Wait. Is this something to cry about? He\u2019s alive. That\u2019s what matters.\u2019\u201d",
      "At the time, she said, their idea of Russian captivity was naive. Only later did it become synonymous with torture, starvation and medical neglect.",
      "Olha left Berdiansk in June of 2022.",
      "\u201cWalking through your own city, but feeling like it\u2019s someone else\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s horrifying,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were Russian flags everywhere. I kept Ukrainian music in my headphones. I was scared my Bluetooth might disconnect, and they\u2019d kill me. But it was worth it.\u201d",
      "She spent several months moving between cities, helping to organize peaceful rallies to raise awareness about Ukrainian POWs. Eventually, she settled in Kyiv. Throughout that time, she paid little attention to her cancer diagnosis, even as her health steadily declined.",
      "Then her condition worsened sharply. Her temperature spiked to 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit).",
      "\u201cWhen the doctor looked at my test results, she said, \u2018How are you even walking?\u2019\u201d she recalled.",
      "Her lymphoma, left untreated during occupation, had progressed to Stage 4. Emergency chemotherapy began \u2014 and it hit her hard.",
      "\u201cMy second round of chemo was disastrous,\u201d she said. She developed an intestinal blockage, couldn\u2019t digest food, and was rushed to intensive care. \u201cIt was morphine all night from the pain. I couldn\u2019t stand. I couldn\u2019t sit. They moved me like a dead body.\u201d",
      "In the hospital, she overheard doctors say her condition was inoperable. Then a nurse came to her bedside and spoke plainly.",
      "\u201c\u2018We\u2019re going to try to restart your system manually,\u2019 she told me. \u2018But if it doesn\u2019t work, you may not wake up tomorrow. You must help us however you can.\u2019\u201d",
      "It was the thought of Ruslan, still in captivity, that helped Olha survive.",
      "In April 2024, five days before her birthday, Olha was told she was in remission. Now she juggles civic activism with running an online cosmetics store. She co-founded the Marine Corps Strength Association, representing over 1,000 Ukrainian POWs still in captivity.",
      "In close contact with former prisoners, Olha gathers fragments of information about Ruslan \u2014 she has had only one phone call with him in the past three years. She sent several letters but never received a reply.",
      "Like an investigator, she pieces together every detail. That\u2019s how she discovered that Ruslan had broken ribs and a crushed arm during regular beatings, according to the testimony of one of the POWs.",
      "As part of the psychological torture, he is made to listen to the Russian national anthem repeatedly. A Crimean Tatar and a Muslim, he is given only Christian religious texts to read \u2014 not the worst form of pressure, Olha acknowledges, but still a clear violation of his faith.",
      "One day, a Russian guard struck him eight times on the head with a hammer.",
      "\u201cThe other prisoners said they had never seen bruises like that in their lives,\u201d she said.",
      "Ruslan spent months in solitary confinement. And yet, somehow, he remains emotionally strong.",
      "\u201cHe tells the others about me,\u201d Olha said, her voice softening. \u201cOne of the guys who came back said (Ruslan) told him: \u2018She\u2019s your age, but she\u2019s got a business, she\u2019s strong, she\u2019s fighting for us. She\u2019ll get us out.\u2019\u201d",
      "That story stayed with her.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t afford to be weak. How can a marine\u2019s wife be weak?\u201d Olha said. \u201cWhat matters is that he knows I\u2019ll keep fighting for him \u2014 until the very end.\"",

      "A new Idaho law restricting public benefits for undocumented immigrants is facing a legal challenge",
      "BOISE, Idaho -- An Idaho doctor and four residents are challenging a new state law that halts some of the few public benefits available to people living in the U.S. unlawfully, including a program that provides access to life-saving HIV and AIDS medication for low income patients.",
      "The ACLU of Idaho filed the federal lawsuit Thursday night on behalf of Dr. Abby Davids and four people with HIV who are not named because they are immigrants without lawful permanent residency.",
      "The complaint says the new law is vague, contradicts federal law and makes it impossible for health care providers to determine exactly what kind of immigration status is excluded and how to verify that status for patients. They want a judge to grant them class-action status, expanding any ruling to other impacted people.",
      "Dozens of patients treated by one Boise-area clinic stand to lose access to HIV and AIDS medication under the law, according to the complaint, including several cared for by Davids.",
      "\u201cWithdrawing HIV treatment from her patients will not only have devastating consequences on their health, it raises the public health risk of increased HIV transmission,\u201d the ACLU wrote in the lawsuit. \u201cWhen her patients are undetectable, they cannot transmit the virus. Without HIV treatment, however, they cannot maintain an undetectable viral level and therefore are able to transmit the virus to others.\u201d",
      "The new Idaho law takes effect July 1, and appears to be the first limiting public health benefits since President Donald Trump ordered federal agencies to enhance eligibility verification and ensure that public benefits aren't going to ineligible immigrants.",
      "The law requires people to verify that they are legal U.S. residents to receive public benefits like communicable disease testing, vaccinations, prenatal and postnatal care for women, crisis counseling, some food assistance for children and even access to food banks or soup kitchens that rely on public funding.",
      "Federal law generally prohibits immigrants in the U.S. illegally from receiving taxpayer-funded benefits like Medicare, Medicaid, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and Social Security. But there are some exceptions for things like emergency medical care and other emergency or public health services.",
      "Idaho\u2019s law still allows for emergency medical services. But in a June 18 letter to health care providers, Idaho Division of Public Health administrator Elke Shaw-Tulloch said HIV is a long-term condition and not an emergency \u2014 so people must verify their lawful presence in order to get benefits through the federal Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program.",
      "The HIV patients challenging the new law include a married couple from Columbia with pending asylum applications, a man who was brought to the U.S. when he was just 4 years old and has Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals status until next year, and a man from Mexico who has been living and working in Idaho since 2020.",
      "One of the patients said she and her husband were diagnosed with HIV in 2019 and immediately started antiretroviral therapy, receiving the medications at no cost through the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program. The medication has lowered the viral load in her body enough that it is now undetectable, she wrote in a court filing, ensuring that she won't transmit the virus to others.",
      "\u201cMy medication protected my daughter while I was pregnant because it prevented me from transmitting HIV to her during pregnancy,\u201d she wrote.",
      "The treatment allows her to be with her child, watching her grow, she said.",
      "Davids has been trying for weeks to get clarity from the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare about exactly what kind of verification her patients will have to show, and exactly which kinds of immigration status are considered \u201clawful.\u201d But the state has yet to provide clear direction, according to the complaint.",
      "\u201cI am really scared about what this means for many of our patients. Their lives will now be in jeopardy,\u201d Davids wrote in a May 30 email to the Department of Health and Welfare.",

      "Prosecutors said it was the first time a school district in the U.S. has faced such environmental criminal allegations.",
      "The district is charged with eight counts of violating the federal Toxic Substances Control Act for allegedly failing to perform inspections in a timely manner during a recent five-year period.",

      "Asbestos, a construction material in wide use until the 1980s, has been linked to cancer and lung disease.",

      "The Trump administration's vaccine advisers are bringing up an old flu-shot debate: Whether it's time to wipe out the last small fraction of those vaccines that contain a controversial preservative",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s vaccine advisers are bringing up an old flu-shot debate: whether it\u2019s time to wipe out the last small fraction of those vaccines that contain a controversial preservative called thimerosal.",
      "It\u2019s a question seemingly laid to rest years ago, as studies showed no evidence that the preservative causes any health problems.",
      "\u201cThis is really a nonissue,\u201d said Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "Here are some things to know about the substance.",
      "Thimerosal is a preservative used in certain vaccines since the 1930s, as well as in some other medical products.",
      "It was mostly used in multi-dose vials of vaccine, to prevent bacterial contamination as the vessel was repeatedly punctured to withdraw a dose.",
      "Questions about thimerosal were raised in the late 1990s because it contains a form of mercury.",
      "It\u2019s not the same as the toxic type found in some seafood, called methylmercury. Instead, it\u2019s a different type called ethylmercury that the body can excrete, O\u2019Leary explained.",
      "The amount of ethylmercury per vaccine dose was small and studies found no evidence of harm. Nor was it used in all vaccines. For example, vaccines for chickenpox, polio and measles, mumps and rubella never contained it, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "But as a precaution, the U.S. phased the preservative out of childhood vaccines. Since 2001, all vaccines routinely recommended for children age 6 and younger in the U.S. come in formulas that don\u2019t contain thimerosal.",
      "The exception is a small subset of flu shot formulas in multi-dose vials that could be used for adults or kids. The vast majority of children, however, get their flu vaccination from a single-dose shot instead, O\u2019Leary said.",
      "According to the CDC, 96% of all flu vaccines in the U.S. administered last fall and winter \u2014 and an even higher share of those used in federally funded programs \u2014 were thimerosal-free.",
      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is a longtime antivaccine activist, and he has long contended there was a tie between thimerosal and autism.",
      "On Thursday, his newly appointed vaccine advisers were set to hear a presentation from Lyn Redwood, a nurse practitioner who once ran the antivaccine group that Kennedy founded.",
      "She will suggest that the remaining thimerosal-containing flu shots should be removed, according to meeting materials posted earlier this week. Among the claims were that they could be a risk to pregnant women.",
      "A new CDC staff analysis prepared for the meeting again showed no link between the preservative and autism or any other neurodevelopmental disorders.",
      "Some experts note that autism rates rose after thimerosal was removed from young children's vaccines in the U.S.",

      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F",
      "ATLANTA -- U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s new vaccine advisory committee backed another option to protect infants against a dangerous virus \u2014 before turning to questions about fall flu vaccines and a preservative in a small fraction of them that some antivaccine groups have falsely tied to autism.",
      "The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on Thursday took up protections against RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, a common cause of cold-like symptoms that can dangerously inflame infants' tiny airways.",
      "In 2023, U.S. health officials began recommending two new measures to protect infants \u2014 a lab-made antibody for newborns and a vaccine for pregnant women \u2014 that experts say likely drove an improvement in infant mortality. That first antibody, called nirsevimab, proved to be 63% to 76% effective against emergency department visits for infants over the last year.",
      "On Thursday, the vaccine panel voted 5-2 that another newly approved antibody shot, Merck\u2019s clesrovimab, should be used similarly.",
      "The ACIP, created more than 60 years ago, helps the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determine who should be vaccinated against a long list of diseases, and when. Those recommendations have a big impact on whether insurance covers vaccinations and where they\u2019re available.",
      "Kennedy was a leading voice in the antivaccine movement before becoming the nation\u2019s top health official. He fired the previous 17-member panel this month and replaced it with a seven-member group that includes several vaccine skeptics.",
      "At its June meetings, the committee usually refreshes guidance for Americans 6 months and older to get a flu shot, and helps propel the annual fall vaccination campaign.",
      "Presentations prepared for Thursday's meeting suggest that the panel may do much the same this year. But there's also a flu-related vote that promises controversy.",
      "It concerns thimerosal, a form of mercury that\u2019s been added to vaccines since the early 20th century to preventing bacterial contamination in multi-dose vials.",
      "Kennedy has long held there was a tie between thimerosal and autism, and also accused the government of hiding the danger. Study after study has found no evidence that thimerosal causes autism. But since 2001, vaccines manufactured for the U.S. market and routinely recommended for children 6 years or younger have contained no thimerosal or only trace amounts, with limited exceptions.",
      "Thimerosal was placed on the meeting agenda shortly after Kennedy\u2019s new vaccine advisory was named last week.",
      "Before the vote, the committee will hear from Lyn Redwood, the former president of what is now known as Children\u2019s Health Defense \u2014 an antivaccine group founded by Kennedy.",
      "Some public health experts contend the thimerosal discussion will unnecessarily raise doubt in vaccines while possibly also making them more expensive and harder to get this fall.",
      "At the panel's meeting Wednesday, Chrissie Juliano, executive director of the Big Cities Health Coalition, lamented the ouster of the former ACIP panel and the agenda of the new one.",
      "Her organization, which represents large city health departments, \u201cis deeply concerned that many routine vaccines may soon become inaccessible or unaffordable for millions of Americans if ACIP makes changes based on ideology rather than science,\" she said. \"The stakes are simply too high to let that happen.\u201d",

      "Hong Kong\u2019s government has proposed a registration system to recognize same-sex partnerships formed overseas",
      "HONG KONG -- Hong Kong\u2019s government on Wednesday proposed a registration system that would recognize same-sex partnerships formed overseas, granting such couples more rights in the city.",
      "In a document submitted to the legislature, the Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau said the proposed system would allow registration for same-sex adult couples who have married, formed civil partnerships or civil unions overseas, provided these relationships were legally recognized in those jurisdictions and one of them is a Hong Kong resident.",
      "After the registration, the couples would have rights including the ability to participate in medical decisions for their loved ones, provided consent is given. For mentally incapacitated adult patients, their partners can take part in the decisions as guardians.",
      "They would also enjoy the right to handle after-death matters for their partners, including claiming the bodies and deciding whether their remains can be used for medical treatment, education or research.",
      "Same-sex couples cannot get married or register for civil partnerships in Hong Kong. But authorities recognize same-sex marriages registered abroad for taxation and civil service benefits and other practical reasons, such as dependent visas.",
      "Many of the government\u2019s concessions were won through legal challenges and the city has seen growing social acceptance toward same-sex marriage in recent years.",
      "The government proposal came in response to the top court's landmark ruling in 2023 in favor of a framework for recognizing same-sex couples' rights. The ruling did not grant full marriage rights to same-sex couples but was a partial victory for prominent pro-democracy activist Jimmy Sham, who fought a five-year legal battle over the recognition of same-sex marriages registered overseas.",
      "Sham, who was sentenced to over four years for his role in an unofficial primary under a Beijing-imposed national security law, was released from prison in May.",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press, Sham said heterosexual couples were not required to register their marriages overseas to get the recognition locally and questioned why same-sex couples had to do so.",
      "He also suggested that the government allow same-sex couples to enjoy equal prison visiting rights as heterosexual couples.",
      "\u201cI hope the government will listen to opinions from society and the community, and try to develop a solution that doesn\u2019t exceed society\u2019s acceptance level, while meeting the expectations of same-sex couples and avoiding legal challenges,\u201d he said.",
      "Jerome Yau, co-founder of non-governmental organization Hong Kong Marriage Equality, said the government document was \u201cvery conservative\u201d and \u201cfar from acceptable.\u201d",
      "He said he failed to see the logic of only making those who are married or have formed partnerships overseas eligible for the measures.",
      "\u201cWe believe that will create an obvious inequality in the sense of local same-sex couples who are not married overseas won't be eligible to register the relationships. I think that\u2019s unfair, and potentially that will lead to further litigation,\u201d he said, adding that he hoped the bill would come with more details.",
      "The government is expected to table a bill in the legislature at a later date. Lawmakers will discuss the document on Thursday.",
      "Some pro-Beijing legislators have spoken out against granting same-sex couples equal rights, upholding the traditional view that marriage should only be between men and women.",
      "The government said its proposals were made after considering the city\u2019s actual situation, adding that there are different views over the recognition of same sex partnerships and it would have to strike a balance to avoid dividing society.",

      "TOKYO -- Japan's Emperor Naruhito said Wednesday that he will honor thousands of Japanese prisoners of World War II who were held under harsh conditions in Mongolia when he visits the country next week.",
      "Naruhito, marking the 80th anniversary of the end of WWII, has been visiting some of the places where the bloodiest battles and bombings occurred, including Iwo Jima, Okinawa and Hiroshima. It's part of his effort at atonement and remembrance of the tragedy of war fought in the name of his grandfather, Emperor Hirohito.",
      "\u201cI will pay tribute to the Japanese people who unwillingly died in the distant land away from home, and think of their hardships,\u201d Naruhito said at a news conference ahead of his July 6-13 trip to Mongolia. His Harvard-educated former diplomat wife, Empress Masako, will accompany him.",
      "Just before the end of the hostilities in 1945, the Soviet Union had declared war on Japan, taking most of about 575,000 Japanese POWs to Siberia. But around 12,000 to 14,000 of them were taken to Mongolia, which was fighting alongside the Soviets against Japan.",
      "Most of the POWs were put to hard labor and construction work for the Mongolian government's headquarters, a state university and a theater that are still preserved in the capital Ulaanbaatar. The prisoners toiled under harsh conditions and scarce food. Japanese records show about 1,700 of them died in Mongolia.",
      "\u201cAs we mark the 80th anniversary of the end of the war this year, we should never forget the pain and sorrow of the people,\u201d Naruhito said. \u201cI believe it is important to not forget those who died, deepen understanding of the wartime past and to nurture the peace-loving heart.\u201d",
      "Naruhito has repeatedly stressed the importance of telling the war's tragedy to younger generations, pledging to contribute to efforts to promote the understanding of history and the determination for peace.",

    "story": [
      "The debate in the Catholic Church over the celebration of the old Latin Mass is heating up just as Pope Leo XIV\u2019s pontificate is getting under way",
      "ROME -- The debate in the Catholic Church over the celebration of the old Latin Mass is heating up just as Pope Leo XIV\u2019s pontificate is getting under way, with the apparent leak of Vatican documents that undermine the stated reason of his predecessor Pope Francis for restricting access to the ancient liturgy.",
      "The documents suggest that the majority of Catholic bishops who responded to a 2020 Vatican survey about the Latin Mass had expressed general satisfaction with it, and warned that restricting it would \u201cdo more harm than good.\u201d",
      "The texts from the Vatican\u2019s doctrine office were posted online Tuesday by a Vatican reporter who has followed the Latin Mass dispute, Diane Montagna. The Vatican spokesman and prefect of the doctrine office didn\u2019t immediately respond when asked Wednesday to confirm their authenticity, or comment.",
      "If confirmed, the documents could add pressure on Leo to try to pacify the liturgical divisions that spread, especially in the United States, during Francis\u2019 12-year papacy. Since the start of his pontificate, Leo has said his aim is unity and reconciliation in the church, and many conservatives and traditionalists have pointed to the Latin Mass dispute as an area that requires urgent resolution.",
      "In one of his most controversial acts, Francis in 2021 reversed Pope Benedict XVI\u2019s signature liturgical legacy and restricted access for ordinary Catholics to the old Latin Mass. The ancient liturgy was celebrated around the world before the modernizing reforms of the 1960s Second Vatican Council, which allowed Mass to be celebrated in the vernacular, with the priest facing the pews.",
      "Francis said he was cracking down on the spread of the old liturgy because Benedict\u2019s decision in 2007 to relax restrictions had become a source of division in the church. Francis said at the time he was responding to \u201cthe wishes expressed\u201d by bishops around the world who had responded to the Vatican survey, as well as the Vatican doctrine office\u2019s own opinion.",
      "\u201cThe responses reveal a situation that preoccupies and saddens me, and persuades me of the need to intervene,\u201d Francis wrote at the time. Benedict's relaxation had been \"exploited to widen the gaps, reinforce the divergences, and encourage disagreements that injure the church, block her path, and expose her to the peril of division,\u201d he said.",
      "The documents posted online, however, paint a different picture. They suggest the majority of bishops who responded to the Vatican survey had a generally favorable view of Benedict\u2019s reform and warned that suppressing or weakening it would lead traditionalist Catholics to leave the church and join schismatic groups. They warned any changes \u201cwould seriously damage the life of the church, as it would recreate the tensions that the document had helped to resolve.\u201d",
      "The documents include a five-page \u201coverall assessment\u201d of the survey findings, written by the Vatican\u2019s doctrine office, as well as a seven-page compilation of quotes from individual bishops or bishops\u2019 conferences.",
      "The documents contain some negative and neutral opinions, and say some bishops considered Benedict\u2019s reform \u201cinappropriate, disturbing,\u201d dangerous and worthy of suppression. But the Vatican's own assessment said the majority of bishops who responded expressed satisfaction. It cited the rise in religious vocations in traditionalist communities and said young Catholics in particular were drawn to the \u201csacredness, seriousness and solemnity of the liturgy.\u201d",
      "It's not clear what other evidence, anecdotes or documentation informed Francis\u2019 decision to reverse Benedict. But from the very start, Francis was frequently critical of traditionalist Catholics, whom he accused of being navel-gazing retrogrades out of touch with the evangelizing mission of the church in the 21st century.",
      "The new documents have comforted traditionalists who felt attacked and abandoned by Francis.",
      "\u201cThe new revelations confirms that Pope Francis restricted the Traditional Mass at the request of only a minority of bishops, and against the advice of the dicastery in charge of the subject,\u201d said Joseph Shaw, of the Latin Mass Society of England and Wales. \u201cThe majority view of the bishops, that restricting the TLM would cause more harm than good, has sadly been proved correct.\u201d",
      "In an email, he said Leo should address the issue \u201curgently.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s nothing peaceful when you see water cannons being used against peaceful fishermen and there\u2019s nothing peaceful about ramming the ships of Philippines in the territorial waters of the Philippines,\" she added.",

      "\"Pressure, coercion and threats is their usual method of operation,\u201d she said.",
      "Chinese officials did not immediately comment on \u0160akalien\u0117\u2019s remarks.",
      "During President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s administration, which began in mid-2022, the Philippines invited Filipino and foreign journalists to join its coast guard and navy patrols in the disputed South China Sea. They have witnessed an increasingly alarming spike of confrontations in the waters in recent years, with China using water cannons and dangerous maneuvers to defend its claim to the global trade route.",
      "China blames the Philippines for instigating the clashes. A 2016 international arbitration decision invalidated China\u2019s claims based on the 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, but Beijing has rejected the ruling and continues to defy it.",
      "\u0160akalien\u0117 said that in the Baltic Sea, Chinese ships and crew members have helped suspected Russian fleets damage undersea oil pipelines, and data and electricity cables belonging to rival European nations like Lithuania by dragging steel anchors on the seafloor. She warned that such acts of sabotage could also be carried out in Asia by China and Russia.",
      "Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have also been involved in the long-simmering territorial disputes in the South China Sea but they have not been as vocal against China\u2019s aggression as the Philippines.",
      "The United States does not lay claim to the disputed waters but has repeatedly warned that it is obligated to defend the Philippines \u2014 Washington\u2019s oldest treaty ally in Asia \u2014 if it comes under an armed attack.",

      "BARCELONA, Spain -- A relentless European heat wave helped fuel a deadly wildfire in Spain while the European Union presented plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions under scorching temperatures on Wednesday.",
      "The blaze that broke out late on Tuesday created an enormous thick plume of ash and smoke that reached 14,000 meters (45,000 feet) of altitude, making it the largest registered by firefighters in Catalonia, a northeastern region of Spain.",
      "Two farmers were killed while apparently trying to flee in a vehicle, local authorities said Wednesday.",
      "Firefighters said that the fire spread at 28 kph (17 mph) at one point as it consumed 6,500 hectares (16,000 acres) mostly of grain fields, making it one of the fastest fires registered in Europe.",
      "\u201cWildfires today are not like they were before,\u201d Salvador Illa, the regional president of Catalonia, said. \u201cThese are extremely dangerous. From the very first moment, it was considered to be beyond the capacity of extinction. I mean that not even with two or three times the number of firefighters, they have told me, it would have been possible to put out.\u201d",
      "Firefighters credited a rainstorm later on Tuesday for having \u201cquickly changed the situation and helped speed up getting the fire stabilized.\u201d",
      "Two of the 500 firefighters who deployed needed treatment at a local hospital for their injuries. Some 14,000 residents were ordered to stay indoors for several hours on Tuesday night.",
      "More hot weather is expected on Wednesday with temperatures in the Lleida region forecast to reach a high of 39 C (102 F).",
      "The European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts said that it was closely monitoring the abnormally hot temperatures. Weather experts link the heat wave to climate change.",
      "As much of Europe was scorched by torrid weather, the European Commission unveiled proposals to reduce emissions by 90% by 2040 as the 27-nation bloc aims to be fully carbon-neutral by 2050.",
      "\u201cWe are finally here on a very hot day, and some would call that very timely,\u201d Climate Commissioner Wopke Hoekstra told reporters in Brussels.",
      "The proposals include allowing businesses to use international carbon credits to offset their emissions. Under the plan, international carbon credits could be used \u2014 starting in 2036 and limited to 3% of benchmark 1990 EU emissions \u2014 to reach the 2040 emission reduction target.",

      "Heat alerts were issued for 17 Italian cities Wednesday. The corresponding surge in air conditioning was straining the electric grid and causing periodic blackouts.

    "story": [
      "Iran\u2019s president has ordered the country to suspend its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency after American airstrikes hit its most-important nuclear facilities",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Iran\u2019s president on Wednesday ordered the country to suspend its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency after American and Israeli airstrikes hit its most-important nuclear facilities, likely further limiting inspectors' ability to track Tehran's program that had been enriching uranium to near weapons-grade levels.",
      "The order by President Masoud Pezeshkian included no timetables or details about what that suspension would entail. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi signaled in a CBS News interview that Tehran still would be willing to continue negotiations with the United States.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think negotiations will restart as quickly as that,\u201d Araghchi said, referring to Trump's comments that talks could start as early as this week. However, he added: \u201cThe doors of diplomacy will never slam shut.\u201d",
      "Iran has limited IAEA inspections in the past as a pressure tactic in negotiating with the West \u2014 though as of right now Tehran has denied that there's any immediate plans to resume talks with the United States that had been upended by the 12-day Iran-Israel war.",
      "Iranian state television announced Pezeshkian's order, which followed a law passed by Iran\u2019s parliament to suspend that cooperation. The bill already received the approval of Iran's constitutional watchdog, the Guardian Council, on Thursday, and likely the support of the country's Supreme National Security Council, which Pezeshkian chairs.",
      "\u201cThe government is mandated to immediately suspend all cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency under the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons and its related Safeguards Agreement,\u201d state television quoted the bill as saying. \"This suspension will remain in effect until certain conditions are met, including the guaranteed security of nuclear facilities and scientists.\u201d",
      "It wasn\u2019t immediately clear what that would mean for the Vienna-based IAEA, the United Nations\u2019 nuclear watchdog. The agency long has monitored Iran\u2019s nuclear program and said that it was waiting for an official communication from Iran on what the suspension meant.",
      "A diplomat with knowledge of IAEA operations, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the situation in Iran, said that IAEA inspectors were still there after the announcement and hadn\u2019t been told by the government to leave.",
      "Iran's decision drew an immediate condemnation from Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar.",
      "\u201cIran has just issued a scandalous announcement about suspending its cooperation with the IAEA,\u201d he said in an X post. \u201cThis is a complete renunciation of all its international nuclear obligations and commitments.\u201d",
      "Saar urged European nations that were part of Iran's 2015 nuclear deal to implement its so-called snapback clause. That would reimpose all U.N. sanctions on it originally lifted by Tehran\u2019s nuclear deal with world powers, if one of its Western parties declares the Islamic Republic is out of compliance with it.",
      "Israel is widely believed to be the only nuclear-armed state in the Middle East, and the IAEA doesn't have access to its weapons-related facilities.",
      "Iran's move so far stops short of what experts feared the most. They had been concerned that Tehran, in response to the war, could decide to fully end its cooperation with the IAEA, abandon the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and rush toward a bomb. That treaty has countries agree not to build or obtain nuclear weapons and allows the IAEA to conduct inspections to verify that countries correctly declared their programs.",
      "Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal allowed Iran to enrich uranium to 3.67% \u2014 enough to fuel a nuclear power plant, but far below the threshold of 90% needed for weapons-grade uranium. It also drastically reduced Iran\u2019s stockpile of uranium, limited its use of centrifuges and relied on the IAEA to oversee Tehran\u2019s compliance through additional oversight. The IAEA served as the main assessor of Iran's commitment to the deal.",
      "But U.S. President Donald Trump, in his first term in 2018, unilaterally withdrew Washington from the accord, insisting it wasn\u2019t tough enough and didn\u2019t address Iran\u2019s missile program or its support for militant groups in the wider Middle East. That set in motion years of tensions, including attacks at sea and on land.",
      "Iran had been enriching up to 60%, a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels. It also has enough of a stockpile to build multiple nuclear bombs, should it choose to do so. Iran has long insisted its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, but the IAEA, Western intelligence agencies and others say Tehran had an organized weapons program up until 2003.",
      "Israeli airstrikes, which began June 13, decimated the upper ranks of Iran\u2019s powerful Revolutionary Guard and targeted its arsenal of ballistic missiles. The strikes also hit Iran\u2019s nuclear sites, which Israel claimed put Tehran within reach of a nuclear weapon.",
      "Iran has said the Israeli attacks killed 935 \u201cIranian citizens,\u201d including 38 children and 102 women. However, Iran has a long history of offering lower death counts around unrest over political considerations.",
      "The Washington-based Human Rights Activists group, which has provided detailed casualty figures from multiple rounds of unrest in Iran, has put the death toll at 1,190 people killed, including 436 civilians and 435 security force members. The attacks wounded another 4,475 people, the group said.",
      "Meanwhile, it appears that Iranian officials now are assessing the damage done by the American strikes conducted on the three nuclear sites on June 22, including those at Fordo, a site built under a mountain about 100 kilometers (60 miles) southwest of Tehran.",
      "Satellite images from Planet Labs PBC analyzed by The Associated Press show Iranian officials at Fordo on Monday likely examining the damage caused by American bunker busters. Trucks could be seen in the images, as well as at least one crane and an excavator at tunnels on the site. That corresponded to images shot Sunday by Maxar Technologies similarly showing the ongoing work.",

      "Japan\u2019s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba faces a tough test in an upper house election this month as his minority government struggles after its major defeat in last year\u2019s snap election",
      "TOKYO -- Japan\u2019s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba faces a tough test in an upper house election later this month as his minority government struggles after its major defeat in last year's snap election.",
      "Ishiba has survived so far, though he had to make some concessions to the opposition \u2014 an unusual step for the Liberal Democratic Party that has dominated Japan\u2019s postwar politics.",
      "Official campaigning begins Thursday for the July 20 vote for the upper house, the less powerful of Japan\u2019s two parliamentary chambers.",
      "Ishiba has modest goals for the election and the opposition is divided, so the outcome is unlikely to force an immediate change of government. But it will be a tough test on Ishiba\u2019s handling of economic woes at home and global challenges such as U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff war.",
      "\u201cI will defend Japan\u2019s national interest at all cost,\u201d Ishiba said Wednesday, reiterating his determination to not make any concession on safety or other areas in the tariff negotiations despite Trump\u2019s new threat. \u201cJapan has its own national interest and I will do my utmost to protect it.\u201d",
      "Ishiba\u2019s goal is a simple majority. Half of the 248 seats for six-year terms in the upper house are being decided, and the LDP and its junior coalition partner Komeito would need to win 50 combined. That's on top of their 75 seats that are not being contested in this election.",
      "That would be a retreat from their current number of 141 seats. \u201cIt won't be easy. But in this difficult situation, it is a must-attain goal,\" Ishiba said Wednesday, without saying how he would take responsibility if he doesn't meet his goal.",
      "A poor result in the upper house election would not immediately cause a change of government but could trigger a LDP leadership change or regrouping of a governing coalition.",
      "The LDP was defeated in the previous election largely because many of its usual supporters voted for centrist to conservative opposition groups to punish the governing party over its corruption scandals. The main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, or CDPJ, and the surging Democratic Party for the People, or DPP, as well as an emerging right-wing populist Sanseito have significantly gained ground.",
      "But the opposition groups are too fractured to find a common platform to gain voter support as a viable alternative.",
      "When Ishiba lost big in October, there was speculation of a trilateral coalition government with the DPP or another conservative Japan Innovation Party, but they have cooperated only on certain legislation. A loss of majority in the upper house by Ishiba\u2019s party could reignite momentum for coalition regroupings.",
      "Opposition CDPJ leader Yoshihiko Noda has said a loss of majority in both houses would help opposition parties to push policies blocked by the LDP, such as consumption tax cuts.",
      "Measures to mitigate soaring prices, dwindling wages and burdens of social security payment are the top focus of frustrated voters hit by economic woes.",
      "Ishiba\u2019s handling of the recent rice panic will be tested. Rice prices have doubled since last year due to supply shortages, complex distribution systems and other reasons related to Japan\u2019s farming policies, adding to consumer concern and frustration.",
      "The rice crisis cost Ishiba's government one farm minister, but the replacement, Shinjiro Koizumi, took rapid and bold measures including the unprecedented release of emergency reserves that brought the staple back to normal prices, just in time for the election.",
      "In another setback, Trump complained about little progress in trade negotiations with Ishiba's government, saying Japan is not only not buying automobiles, but is also not buying enough U.S. rice despite its rice shortage.",
      "While NATO leaders recently adopted a massive hike in defense spending after pressure from Trump, Ishiba said Japan should make its own decision on any such spending.",
      "Ishiba\u2019s party adopted a campaign platform that included cash payouts to cushion the impact of inflation and dwindling wages, which opposition parties criticized as pork. The main opposition CDPJ calls for increased welfare spending, while DPP focuses on wage increase.",
      "Ishiba also needs to offset consumer worries over uncertainty in the Middle East and its impact on energy costs.",

      "An emboldened Russia has ramped up military offensives on two fronts in Ukraine",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- An emboldened Russia has ramped up military offensives on two fronts in Ukraine, scattering Kyiv\u2019s precious reserve troops and threatening to expand the fighting to a new Ukrainian region as each side seeks an advantage before the fighting season wanes in the autumn.",
      "Moscow aims to maximize its territorial gains before seriously considering a full ceasefire, analysts and military commanders said. Ukraine wants to slow the Russian advance for as long as possible and extract heavy losses.",
      "Kremlin forces are steadily gaining ground in the strategic eastern logistics hub of Pokrovsk, the capture of which would hand them a major battlefield victory and bring them closer to acquiring the entire Donetsk region. The fighting there has also brought combat to the border of the neighboring Dnipropetrovsk region for the first time.",
      "In an effort to prevent Moscow from bolstering those positions in the east, Ukrainian forces are trying to pin down some of Russia\u2019s best and most battle-hardened troops hundreds of kilometers away, in the northeast Sumy region.",
      "\u201cThe best-case scenario for Ukraine,\" said Russian-British military historian Sergey Radchenko, \"is that they\u2019re able to stall or stop the Russian advance\" in the Ukrainian industrial heartland known as Donbas, which includes the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Then Ukraine could \"use that as the basis for a ceasefire agreement.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a better chance for Russia to come to some kind of terms with Ukraine\" in the fall when the Russians \"see the extent of their offensive,\u201d Radchenko added.",
      "While the battles rage, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is waiting to learn whether the Trump administration will support tougher sanctions against Russia and back a European idea to establish a \u201creassurance force\u201d to deter Moscow.",
      "A setback came with the U.S. decision Tuesday to halt some weapons shipments to Ukraine out of concern over America's own depleted stockpiles.",
      "In the Sumy region, Ukrainian forces face a constant barrage of aerial glide bombs, drones and relentless assaults by small groups of Russian infantrymen. They endure the attacks to prevent Russian forces from being moved to other battlegrounds in the eastern Donetsk region.",
      "Ukrainian forces intensified their own attacks in Sumy in April and even conducted a small offensive into Russia's neighboring Kursk region to prevent up to 60,000 battle-hardened Russian forces from being moved to reinforce positions in the Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, Ukraine\u2019s top army commander, Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, said last week.",
      "If those troops had been moved, they could have increased the tempo of Russian attacks across the front line and stretched Ukrainian forces thin.",
      "The strategy did not come without criticism. Commanders who were ordered to execute it complained that it resulted in unnecessary loss of life.",
      "Russian forces have penetrated up to 7 kilometers (4 miles) into the northern Sumy region from different directions along the border.",
      "Ukrainian forces are determined to keep them there to avoid freeing up Russian forces to fight in the east. So far they have succeeded, locking up to 10,000 Russian troops in the Glushkovsky district of the Kursk region alone, where Ukraine maintains a small presence after being mostly forced out by Russian and North Korean troops earlier in the year.",
      "The war's largest battle is being waged in Donetsk as Russia inches toward its stated goal of capturing all of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.",
      "Unable to tackle the strategically significant logistical hub of Pokrovsk directly, Russian forces are attempting to encircle the city, a maneuver that requires encroaching on the borders of the Dnipropetrovsk region. Bringing the war to a sixth Ukrainian region would be detrimental for Ukrainian morale and give Russia more leverage in negotiations if its forces manage to carve out a foothold there.",
      "Sabotage groups have crossed the border, only to be eliminated by Ukrainian forces.",
      "But in time, commanders fear that Russia will advance as Ukraine continues to grapple with severe shortages.",
      "Lack of soldiers and supplies across the 1,200-kilometer (745-mile) front line mean that Ukrainian forces must concentrate on holding their positions and conserving resources rather than advancing, said Oleksii Makhrinskyi, deputy commander of the Da Vinci Wolves battalion.",
      "Commanders describe battles so intense under drone-saturated skies that rotating forces in and out of position has become a deadly operation. Ukrainian forces remain in combat positions for several weeks at a time or more, relying on supplies carried in by drones.",
      "The Russians' goal \"is just to enter Dnipropetrovsk region, to have a good position politically if the presidents negotiate peace,\u201d said Andrii Nazerenko, a commander of the 72nd Brigade, a drone unit in eastern Ukraine, referring to potential talks between Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re really close to getting what they want,\u201d he said.",
      "Zelenskyy hopes U.S. President Donald Trump will move away from his administration's past ambivalence toward Ukraine and signal his intention to continue American support, a move that could also alter Moscow\u2019s calculations.",
      "The two presidents met last week on the sidelines of a NATO summit and discussed a possible weapons package, including Patriot missile systems that Ukraine intends to purchase with European support.",
      "The U.S. Defense Department announcement now calls that into question although it did not specify which weapons were being held back when it disclosed the Pentagon review of American weapons stockpiles Tuesday. The halt of any weapons from the U.S. would be a blow to Ukraine as it struggles to confront Russia\u2019s daily aerial barrages.",
      "Zelenskyy also hopes Trump will punish Russia by imposing harsher sanctions on its energy and banking sectors, which bankroll the Kremlin\u2019s war effort.",
      "Europe and the U.S. have imposed successive sanctions on Russia since the full-scale invasion in 2022, but Zelenskyy says those measures have not been enough to pierce Moscow\u2019s war machine. He has proposed a $30 per barrel price cap on Russian oil.",
      "EU sanctions envoy David O\u2019Sullivan said Europe needs to maintain the sanctions pressure while also \u201cholding out the prospect that if Russia behaves correctly, we could have some kind of ceasefire and some kind of sense of negotiation, but for the moment Russia doesn\u2019t seem to want that.\u201d",
      "Kyiv\u2019s closest European allies are also awaiting a sign from Trump that he will support a plan to deploy foreign troops in Ukraine to guard against future Russian aggression after a ceasefire agreement. That is likely the best security guarantee Ukraine can hope for in lieu of NATO membership.",
      "Meanwhile on the battlefield, Russian forces appear increasingly confident.",
      "Nazerenko noticed a shift in the morale of advancing Russian infantrymen in recent months. Instead of running away while being assailed by Ukrainian drones, they keep pushing forward.",
      "Nazerenko could not help but ask a Russian prisoner: \u201cYou know you will die. Why go?\u201d",

      "The drilling ship overturned Tuesday evening off the city of Ras Ghareb, on the African side of the Gulf of Suez, the Red Sea\u2019s northwestern arm and a crucial shipping route, the Petroleum Ministry said in a statement.",
      "There were 30 workers on board when the drilling ship capsized, said Amr Hanafy, governor of the Red Sea province.",

      "Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama has said the centuries-old Tibetan Buddhist institution will continue after his death, ending speculation ignited by his remark that he might be the last person to hold the role",
      "DHARAMSHALA, India -- Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama on Wednesday said the centuries-old Tibetan Buddhist institution will continue after his death, ending years of speculation that started when he indicated that he might be the last person to hold the role.",
      "Speaking at prayer celebrations ahead of his 90th birthday on Sunday, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning spiritual head of Tibetan Buddhism said that the next Dalai Lama should be found and recognized as per past Buddhist traditions, while signalling that China should stay away from the process of identifying his successor.",
      "The Dalai Lama\u2019s succession plan is politically consequential for most Tibetans who oppose China\u2019s tight control of Tibet and have struggled to keep their identity alive, in their homeland or in exile. It is also profound for Tibetan Buddhists who worship him as a living manifestation of Chenrezig, the Buddhist god of compassion.",
      "The decision, however, is expected to irk China, which has repeatedly said that it alone has the authority to approve the next religious leader. It insists the reincarnated figure must be found in China\u2019s Tibetan areas, giving Communist authorities power over who is chosen.",
      "Many observers believe there eventually will be rival Dalai Lamas \u2014 one appointed by Beijing, and one by senior monks loyal to the current Dalai Lama.",
      "Tenzin Gyatso became the 14th reincarnation of the Dalai Lama in 1940. He fled Tibet when Chinese troops crushed an uprising in the Tibetan capital Lhasa in 1959 and has been living in the town of Dharamshala in India since then, helping establish a democratic government-in-exile while also traveling the world to advocate autonomy for the Tibetan people.",
      "Tibetan Buddhists believe the Dalai Lama can choose the body into which he is reincarnated, as has happened on 14 occasions since the creation of the institution in 1587. He has reiterated in the past that his successor would be born outside China.",
      "The Dalai Lama laid out his succession plan in a recorded statement that was televised at a religious gathering of Buddhist monks in Dharamshala. He said the process of finding and recognizing his reincarnation lies solely with the Gaden Phodrang Trust \u2014 a non-profit he founded in 2015 that oversees matters related to the spiritual leader and the institute of the Dalai Lama.",
      "\u201cNo one else has any such authority to interfere in this matter,\u201d he said, adding that the search for a future Dalai Lama should be carried out in \u201caccordance with past tradition.\"",
      "Asked Wednesday about the Dalai Lama's announcement, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning at a daily news briefing said \u201cthe reincarnation of the Dalai Lama must adhere to the principles of domestic search in China\u201d and \"approval by the central government.\u201d",
      "Mao said the process must \u201cfollow religious rituals and historical settings, and be handled in accordance with national laws and regulations.\u201d",
      "Separately, Amnesty International\u2019s China Director, Sarah Brooks, in a statement Wednesday said the efforts by Chinese authorities to control the selection of the next Dalai Lama was a \u201cdirect assault\u201d on the right to freedom of religion.",
      "\u201cTibetan Buddhists, like all faith communities, must be able to choose their spiritual leaders without coercion or interference by the authorities,\u201d Brooks said.",
      "The Dalai Lama has often urged his followers to reject anyone chosen by Beijing. The self-proclaimed Tibetan government-in-exile he once headed before relinquishing his political role in 2011 also supports this stance.",
      "Penpa Tsering, the president of the government-in-exile, said Tibetans from around the world made \u201can earnest request with single-minded devotion\u201d that the position of the Dalai Lama should continue \u201cfor the benefit of all sentient beings in general and Buddhist in particular.\"",
      "\u201cIn response to this overwhelming supplication, His Holiness has shown infinite compassion and finally agreed to accept our appeal on this special occasion of his 90th birthday,\u201d he said at a press conference.",
      "Tsering, however, warned China not to meddle in the process of the Dalai Lama's succession, saying it is a \u201cunique Tibetan Buddhist tradition.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe not only strongly condemn the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s usage of reincarnation subject for their political gain, and will never accept it,\u201d he said.",
      "The search for a Dalai Lama\u2019s reincarnation begins only upon the incumbent\u2019s death.",
      "In the past, the successor has been identified by senior monastic disciples, based on spiritual signs and visions, and it can take several years after the next Dalai Lama is identified as a baby and groomed to take the reins.",

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- An Australian domestic flight was delayed for two hours after a stowaway snake was found in the plane\u2019s cargo hold, officials said on Wednesday.",
      "The snake was found on Tuesday as passengers were boarding Virgin Australia Flight VA337 at Melbourne Airport bound for Brisbane, according to snake catcher Mark Pelley.",
      "The snake turned out to be a harmless 60-centimeter (2-foot) green tree snake. But Pelly said he thought it could be venomous when he approached it in the darkened hold.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until after I caught the snake that I realized that it wasn\u2019t venomous. Until that point, it looked very dangerous to me,\u201d Pelley said.",
      "Most of the world\u2019s most venomous snakes are native to Australia.",
      "When Pelley entered the cargo hold, the snake was half hidden behind a panel and could have disappeared deeper into the plane.",
      "Pelley said he told an aircraft engineer and airline staff that they would have to evacuate the aircraft if the snake disappeared inside the plane.",
      "\u201cI said to them if I don\u2019t get this in one shot, it\u2019s going to sneak through the panels and you\u2019re going to have to evacuate the plane because at that stage I did not know what kind of snake it was,\u201d Pelley said.",
      "\u201cBut thankfully, I got it on the first try and captured it,\u201d Pelley added. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t get it that first time, the engineers and I would be pulling apart a (Boeing) 737 looking for a snake still right now.\u201d",
      "Pelley said he had taken 30 minutes to drive to the airport and was then delayed by security before he could reach the airliner.",
      "An airline official said the flight was delayed around two hours.",
      "Because the snake is native to the Brisbane region, Pelley suspects it came aboard inside a passenger\u2019s luggage and escaped during the two-hour flight from Brisbane to Melbourne.",
      "For quarantine reasons, the snake can\u2019t be returned to the wild.",
      "The snake, which is a protected species, has been given to a Melbourne veterinarian to find a home with a licensed snake keeper.",

      "\u201cThe steamroller of repressions doesn't stop, and the authorities continue to stifle any dissent in Belarus, opening new high-profile cases,\u201d Sapelka told the AP on Tuesday. \u201cNo one, absolutely no one can feel safe in Belarus.\u201d",
      "Mass arrests and convictions of government critics in Belarus have continued since 2020, when Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko was handed a sixth term in office in an election that the opposition and the West denounced as rigged.",
      "Tens of thousands of people took to the streets in protest, in the biggest demonstrations that the country\u2019s ever seen. Authorities unleashed a violent crackdown in response, detaining and beating thousands and driving many more into exile abroad. The crackdown drew international condemnation, and the U.S. and the European Union imposed sanctions on Belarus.",
      "Viasna has recorded 1,174 people behind bars as political prisoners. The number includes 38 journalists and the group's founder, Ales Bialiatski, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2022. At least eight political prisoners have died behind bars.",
      "Lukashenko, who in January secured another term in office in another election the opposition denounced as a sham, has recently been pardoning some of the political prisoners, seeking to improve ties with the West. In total, he has pardoned and freed more than 300 prisoners since July 2024, including some U.S. citizens and other foreigners.",
      "Last month, Belarusian authorities released prominent opposition figure Siarhei Tsikhanouski and 13 others and brought them to Lithuania. Their release came just hours after Belarusian authorities announced that Lukashenko met with U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, in the Belarusian capital, Minsk.",
      "But rights advocates argue that the situation in Belarus hasn't changed, and authorities have recently opened several new high-profile cases, which indicates their intention to continue the crackdown.",
      "At least 20 people have been arrested in the case against Belaruski Hajun, a Belarusian activist group that monitors troops movements in Belarus, Sapelka said.",
      "Viasna on Monday also reported the arrest of popular Belarusian signer Aleh Hamenka, who is being accused of taking part in anti-government protests. Another case involves sociologists from the Wardomacki sociological research laboratory, according to Sapelka.",
      "Nils Mui\u017enieks, U.N.'s special rapporteur for human rights in Belarus, has recently said that \u201cthere is no sign of improvement in the human rights situation in Belarus, and the authorities are disregarding offers of cooperation.\u201d",

      "A 92-year-old former railway worker has been sentenced to life in a British prison for raping and murdering a woman in 1967",
      "LONDON -- For more than a half-century, Ryland Headley got away with murder. When justice finally caught up to the former railway worker Tuesday in a British courtroom, he was 92 years old and using hearing aids to listen to his fate.",
      "A judge sentenced Headley to life in prison for the rape and murder of Louisa Dunne, a 75-year-old widow and grandmother who was strangled in her home in western England in 1967. It is believed to be the longest time in the U.K. between crime and conviction.",
      "\u201cThe violation of her home, her body and, ultimately, her life was a pitiless and cruel act by a depraved man,\u201d Justice Derek Sweeting said in Bristol Crown Court.",
      "Headley broke into Dunne\u2019s home through a window and left a palm print on the glass. Police took the hand prints of 19,000 men and boys in the area to try to solve the crime, but did not find a match at the time.",
      "Headley moved out of the area and went on to rape two older women in similar circumstances in the late 1970s and serve time in prison. But his DNA was not collected until an unrelated arrest in 2012.",
      "Last year, semen found on the blue skirt that Dunne had been wearing when she was killed was found to match Headley's DNA. His palm print was found to match the one on her window.",
      "At his trial, prosecutors had read testimony from the victims of his previous rape convictions, providing jurors with an insight into what happened when he broke into Dunne's home, said Det. Insp. Dave Marchant.",
      "\u201cHearing the voices of the victims of his 1977 offenses, is just incredibly powerful and harrowing,\u201d Marchant said.",
      "Dunne\u2019s granddaughter, Mary Dainton, who is now about the age her grandmother was when she was killed, said she had been stunned to learn of Headley's arrest in November.",
      "\u201cI accepted that some murders just never get solved and some people have to live with that emptiness and sadness,\u201d she said.",
      "On Tuesday, Dainton told the court that her grandmother's murder and rape had cast a cloud over the rest of her mother's life.",
      "\u201cThe fact the offender wasn\u2019t caught caused my mother to become and remain very ill,\" she said. \"It saddens me deeply that all the people who knew and loved Louisa are not here to see that justice is being done.\u201d",
      "Sweeting said that by escaping punishment for so long, Headley had compounded the suffering of Dunne's family.",
      "He told Headley he had to serve a minimum of 20 years in prison and would normally spend time explaining the effect of such a term. But he was blunt in this case.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ll never be released and you will die in prison,\u201d Sweeting said.",

      "Timur Ivanov is the most visible figure in a far-ranging probe into alleged military graft that also targeted several other top officials close to former Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu. Shoigu, a veteran official who had personal ties to President Vladimir Putin, survived the purges of his inner circle and was given the new high-profile post of secretary of Russia\u2019s Security Council.",
      "Ivanov, 49, was named deputy defense minister in 2016 and oversaw military construction projects, as well as property management, housing and medical support for the military. He was known for his lavish lifestyle that outraged many in Moscow just as the fighting in Ukraine exposed glaring deficiencies in Russian military organization and supplies that resulted in battlefield setbacks.",
      "Ivanov, who has been in custody since his arrest in April 2024, was convicted by the Moscow City Court of embezzling 3.9 billion rubles (about $50 million), the charges that he denied. The court also confiscated his assets that included prized real estate and a collection of vintage cars.",
      "Ivanov's lawyers said they would appeal the verdict.",

      "Reporting in Somalia, Afghanistan and Syria was tough work for reporter Jane Ferguson",
      "NEW YORK -- Jane Ferguson has won awards for unflinching reporting from dangerous lands including Afghanistan, Somalia and Yemen. So she was unlikely to be intimidated by seeking financing for a new journalism platform, despite tough times for the news industry.",
      "\u201cIt's very high pressure,\u201d said Ferguson, founder of Noosphere. \u201cI'm used to pressure in the field.\u201d",
      "Started this year, Noosphere offers journalists a place to showcase work to consumers who are attracted by a more personal style of reporting than they'd normally see on traditional outlets.",
      "It's similar to Substack, with a twist. Instead of paying for feeds of individual journalists \u2014 the Substack model \u2014 people who subscribe to Noosphere for $14.99 a month get access to all of its journalists. There are 20 so far, expected to increase to 24 with the site's upcoming British launch.",
      "Noosphere \u2014 named to reference a state of consciousness advanced by Jesuit philosopher Pierre Teilhard de Chardin \u2014 arrives at a time of flux in the news industry. Consumers are fleeing newspapers and television news and trying different approaches springing up in a new media world.",
      "Ferguson raised $1 million to get Noosphere off the ground and is about to announce an additional round of investment.",
      "Ferguson, 40, grew up in Northern Ireland, and was attracted to the high-stakes, high-risk world of international reporting. For CNN International and then PBS NewsHour, she worked largely alone, covering stories about famine and war crimes in South Sudan, the conflict in Syria and Afghanistan following the U.S. withdrawal in 2021.",
      "The latter experience left her shell-shocked and heartbroken, wondering if she'd reached the end of that phase of her career. \u201cI had been on the road for 15 years,\u201d she said. \u201cI was exhausted, and in some respects, burnt out.\u201d",
      "She settled in the United States, teaching \u2014 and learning \u2014 at Princeton. She took classes in entrepreneurship and built contacts in the business world. Ferguson knew how many of her former international colleagues had to hustle to find outlets for their work, and envisioned Noosphere as a landing spot. Her business partner, Seb Walker, worked at Vice Media, known for its strong international reporting before filing for bankruptcy in 2023.",
      "\u201cIt's gotten a lot harder to continue making a living doing this,\u201d said Matthew Cassell, an international correspondent whose credits include Vice. A member of Noosphere's inaugural class of journalists, Cassell has posted videos giving his perspectives on the Israel-Iran war, along with recent reporting from the West Bank.",
      "Shrouq Al Aila contributed video from Gaza, showing efforts to distribute aid as the sound of gunfire is heard in the background. Oren Ziv reported from a missile strike in Israel, walking through a hospital's shattered hallways to show the destruction.",
      "\u201cIt feels like a really high-quality reporter is Face-Timing you from the field,\u201d Ferguson said, \u201cwhich is really cool.\u201d",
      "News consumers, particularly young ones, are souring on more stilted, conventional television news reporting, said veteran journalist Kate O'Brian, who is on Noosphere's board of directors. \u201cThe stage has been set for an audience who wants to hear directly from the journalist,\u201d O'Brian said.",
      "Ferguson envisions a reporting staff that is roughly half international, half based in the United States. Former CNN journalist Chris Cillizza reports on Washington for Noosphere.",
      "Her biggest signing to date is former \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Chuck Todd. He started a Sunday night show in June, with \u201cWar Room\u201d host Steve Bannon and Trita Parsi, founder of the National Iranian American Council, as his first guests. Todd has hired the former producer for Charlie Rose's PBS talk show, a clue to his ambitions for an eclectic show interviewing interesting people from politics and business.",
      "\u201cJane's hard to say no to,\u201d Todd said. \u201cLike any smart executive, she knows what she doesn't know, and goes to find smart people who she thinks know more.\"",
      "Ferguson's bet is that audiences can only afford so many Substack subscriptions to individual journalists, and that Noosphere will offer access to more at a set price. She's also talked to news outlets interested in acquiring some of the reporters' work.",
      "The challenge to getting Noosphere established is an increasingly crowded marketplace, and several of her journalists aren't household names.",
      "Noosphere journalists are paid a percentage of subscription fees, and given a greater amount if a subscriber specifically cites that contributor's work in signing on. Ferguson will not say how many subscribers she has yet.",
      "\u201cSubstack created a market that did not exist before and I give them huge kudos for that,\u201d O'Brian said. \u201cThis is just a different way of approaching it.\u201d",
      "To succeed, \u201cyou have to offer a lot,\u201d Todd said. \u201cYou can't just offer one or two things. Every hot spot around the world, Noosphere will have journalists on the ground. They have a reasonable chance to be very successful in their lane. The question is how big the lane can get.\u201d",
      "Todd said Noosphere's advantage is that it has been created by reporters, a distinction from the lack of journalism experience found among executives in the business, he said.",
      "Ferguson, too, has wondered whether journalism can survive the diminishment or death of news organizations. \u201cThe solution for the problems of the industry are going to come from journalists and not media executives,\u201d she said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- An analysis finds that a critical group of U.S. employers would face a direct cost of $82.3 billion from President Donald Trump\u2019s current tariff plans, a sum that could be potentially managed through price hikes, layoffs, hiring freezes or lower profit margins.",
      "The analysis by the JPMorganChase Institute is among the first to measure the direct costs created by the import taxes on businesses with $10 million to $1 billion in annual revenue, a category that includes roughly a third of private-sector U.S. workers. These companies are more dependent than other businesses on imports from China, India and Thailand \u2014 and the retail and wholesale sectors would be especially vulnerable to the import taxes being levied by the Republican president.",
      "The findings show clear trade-offs from Trump\u2019s import taxes, contradicting his claims that foreign manufacturers would absorb the costs of the tariffs instead of U.S. companies that rely on imports. While the tariffs launched under Trump have yet to boost overall inflation, large companies such as Amazon, Costco, Walmart and Williams-Sonoma delayed the potential reckoning by building up their inventories before the taxes could be imposed.",
      "The analysis comes just ahead of the July 9 deadline by Trump to formally set the tariff rates on goods from dozens of countries. Trump imposed that deadline after the financial markets panicked in response to his April tariff announcements, prompting him to instead schedule a 90-day negotiating period when most imports faced a 10% baseline tariff. China, Mexico and Canada face higher rates, and there are separate 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum.",
      "Had the initial April 2 tariffs stayed in place, the companies in the JPMorganChase Institute analysis would have faced additional direct costs of $187.6 billion. Under the current rates, the $82.3 billion would be equivalent on average to $2,080 per employee, or 3.1% of the average annual payroll. Those averages include firms that don't import goods and those that do.",
      "Asked Tuesday how trade talks are faring, Trump said simply: \u201cEverything\u2019s going well.\u201d",
      "The president has indicated that he will set tariff rates given the logistical challenge of negotiating with so many nations. As the 90-day period comes to a close, only the United Kingdom has signed a trade framework with the Trump administration. India and Vietnam have signaled that they\u2019re close to a trade framework.",
      "There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that more inflation could surface. The investment bank Goldman Sachs said in a report that it expects companies to pass along 60% of their tariff costs onto consumers. The Atlanta Federal Reserve has used its survey of businesses\u2019 inflation expectations to say that companies could on average pass along roughly half their costs from a 10% tariff or a 25% tariff without reducing consumer demand.",
      "The JPMorganChase Institute findings suggest that the tariffs could cause some domestic manufacturers to strengthen their roles as suppliers of goods. But it noted that companies need to plan for a range of possible outcomes and that wholesalers and retailers already operate on such low profit margins that they might need to spread the tariffs costs to their customers.",
      "The outlook for tariffs remains highly uncertain. Trump had stopped negotiations with Canada, only to restart them after the country dropped its plan to tax digital services. He similarly on Monday threatened more tariffs on Japan unless it buys more rice from the U.S.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a Tuesday interview that the concessions from the trade talks have impressed career officials at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and other agencies.",
      "\u201cPeople who have been at Treasury, at Commerce, at USTR for 20 years are saying that these are deals like they\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d Bessent said on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d",
      "The treasury secretary said the Trump administration plans to discuss the contours of trade deals next week, prioritizing the tax cuts package passed on Tuesday by the Republican majority in the Senate. Trump has set a Friday deadline for passage of the multitrillion-dollar package, the costs of which the president hopes to offset with tariff revenues.",

Cooper rejected AT&T\u2019s wager on the car phone, betting that America wanted to feel like Dick Tracy, armed with \u201ca device that was an extension of you, that made you reachable everywhere.\u201d",
      "Fifty-two years ago, Cooper declared victory in a call from a Manhattan sidewalk to the head of AT&T\u2019s rival program. His four-pound DynaTAC 8000X has evolved into a global population of billions of smartphones weighing mere ounces apiece. Some 4.6 billion people \u2014 nearly 60% of the world \u2014 have mobile internet, according to a global association of mobile network operators.",
      "The tiny computers that we carry by the billions are becoming massive, interlinked networks of processors that perform trillions of calculations per second \u2013 the computing power that artificial intelligence needs. The simple landlines once used to call friends or family have evolved into omnipresent glossy screens that never leave our sight and flood our brain with hours of data daily, deluging us with endless messages, emails, videos and a soundtrack that many play constantly to block the outside world.",
      "From his home in Del Mar, California, the inventor of the mobile phone, now 96, watches all of this. Of one thing Cooper is certain: The revolution has really just begun.",
      "Now, the winner of the 2024 National Medal of Technology and Innovation \u2014 the United States\u2019 highest honor for technological achievement \u2013 is focused on the cellphone\u2019s imminent transition to a thinking mobile computer fueled by human calories to avoid dependence on batteries. Our new parts will run constant tests on our bodies and feed our doctors real-time results, Cooper predicts.",
      "\u201cThat will let people anticipate diseases before they happen,\u201d Cooper envisions. \u201cPeople are going to die from old age and accidents but they\u2019re not going to die from disease. That\u2019s a revolution in medicine.\u201c",

Her 18-year-old granddaughter Bryndal Hoover, a senior at nearby Lawrence High School, says she prefers voice calls over texting because then I can understand, \u2018Oh, how should I go about a conversation?\u2019\u201d",
      "When she was a girl, Karen Wilson\u2019s family shared a party line with other phone customers outside Buffalo, New York. Wilson, 79, shocked her granddaughter by telling her about the party line when the girl got a cellphone as a teenager.",
      "\u201cWhat did you do if you didn\u2019t wait?\u2019\u201d the girl asked. Responded her grandmother: \u201c`You went down to their house and you yelled, \u2018Hey, Mary, can you come out?\u2019\u201d",

      "We increasingly buy online and get products delivered without the possibility of serendipity. There are fewer opportunities to greet a neighbor or store employee and find out something unexpected, to make a friend, to fall in love. People are working more efficiently as they drown.",

      "The Wonsan-Kalma eastern coastal tourist zone, which North Korea says can accommodate nearly 20,000 people, is at the heart of leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s push to boost tourism as a way to improve his country\u2019s struggling economy. But prospects for the resort, the biggest tourist complex in North Korea, aren\u2019t clear, as the country won\u2019t likely fully reopen its borders and embrace Western tourists anytime soon, observers say.",
      "The official Korean Central News Agency reported the Wonsan-Kalma area began service Tuesday, drawing a large number of North Koreans who enjoyed open water swimming, slides and other attractions at a water park and various water activities in the area.",
      "\u201cThe guests\u2019 hearts were filled with overwhelming emotion as they felt the astonishing new heights of our-style tourism culture blossoming under the era of the Workers\u2019 Party,\" KCNA said in a typical propaganda-driven dispatch.",
      "Photos released by North Korean state media showed children with tubes and inflatable balls dipping into the sea, while others in colorful swimsuits beamed while sitting beneath red-and-white parasols.",
      "Kim said at the inaugural ceremony last week the site would be recorded as \u201cone of the greatest successes this year\" and called its opening \u201cthe proud first step\u201d toward realizing the government\u2019s policy of developing tourism.",
      "Since 2022, North Korea has been slowly easing the curbs imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic and reopening its borders in phases. But the country hasn\u2019t said whether and when it would fully resume international tourism.",
      "Chinese group tours, which made up more than 90% of visitors before the pandemic, remain stalled while there are questions about ties between the two socialist neighbors. In February this year, North Korea allowed a small group of international tourists to visit its northeastern border city of Rason, only to stop that tour program in less than a month.",
      "Since February 2024, North Korea has been accepting Russian tourists amid expanding military cooperation between the countries. But Russian government records seen by South Korean experts show a little more than 2,000 Russians, only about 880 of them tourists, visited North Korea last year, a number that is too small to revive North Korea's tourism.",
      "Russia\u2019s Primorsky region, which borders North Korea, said last week that the first group of Russian tourists to the Wonsan-Kalma resort will depart on July 7 for a eight-day trip that includes a visit to Pyongyang.",

      "TVA is the nation's largest public utility and provides power to more than 10 million people across seven southern states.",
      "The White House said Trump's nominees for the federal utility are Tennesseans Lee Beaman, Mitch Graves and Jeff Hagood; and Randall Jones of Alabama.",
      "The selections follow Trump's firing of three Biden-nominated board members since late March. The board normally has nine members and requires five to make a quorum. It currently has three. Trump's picks would not be seated until the U.S. Senate confirms them.",
      "Without a quorum, TVA's board can take actions needed for ongoing operations but cannot jump into new areas of activity, start new programs or change the utility's existing direction.",
      "Beaman is a businessman who sold his Nashville-area fleet of car dealerships. He is also a prominent Republican political fundraiser.",

They wrote that studies and hurdles under the TVA board were bogging down a project that seeks to build a small modular nuclear reactor.",

      "Less expensive versions of high-end clothing and other accessories are just about everywhere these days",
      "NEW YORK -- Fashion \u201cdupes,\u201d or less expensive versions of high-end clothing and other accessories, are just about everywhere these days. They're also drawing some businesses into legal battles.",
      "In the latest example, Lululemon filed a lawsuit against Costco on Friday, accusing the wholesale club operator of selling lower-priced duplicates of some of its popular athleisure apparel.",
      "Across the retail industry, it\u2019s far from a new phenomenon. But social media is pushing the culture of online dupe shopping to new heights as influencers direct their followers to where they can buy the knockoffs. Want a taste of Herm\u00e8s' $1,000 fuzzy slippers? Target has a version for $15. Looking for a $2,800 price Bottega Veneta hobo bag? There\u2019s a version for $99 on online clothing and accessories upstart Quince, which has become a go-to for fashionistas.",
      "It's not even the first time Lululemon has encountered what it says are knockoffs of its clothing, which often carry steep price tags of over $100 each for leggings and sporty zip-ups. Without specifying additional sellers beyond Costco in Friday\u2019s complaint, Lululemon noted that a handful of companies have \u201creplicated or copied\u201d its apparel to sell cheaper offerings \u2014 including those popularized online through hashtags like \u201cLululemonDupes\u201d on TikTok and other social media platforms.",
      "For years, companies have rolled out a range of cheaper option for consumers to buy instead of pricey name-brands or designer labels \u2014 often through retailers' house or generic brands. Unlike more direct copies of the product with an unauthorized trademark or logo of a patented brand, \u201cpure\u201d dupes that just resemble certain features are generally legitimate. They can even spark awareness of the original items.",
      "But the rising frenzy for dupes, particularly in the fashion space, signals that many shoppers want a taste of luxury, but no longer want to pay for (or care about) getting the real thing.",
      "Late last year, for example, discount chain Walmart created a buzz when it started selling a leather bag online that resembled Herm\u00e8s\u2019 coveted Birkin bag. The $78 item \u2014 sold by Kamugo, which doesn\u2019t appear to have its own website \u2014 was a fraction of the price of the original, which goes from $9,000 to hundreds of thousands of dollars on resale and auction sites. Influencers labeled the leather bag a \u201cwirkin.\u201d Other suppliers including BESTSPR, YMTQ and Judy were listed on Walmart\u2019s site selling similar totes.",
      "While popular among shoppers, these kind of look-alikes can frustrate the targeted companies. Following the viral fame of the \u201cwirkin,\u201d Herm\u00e8s Executive Chairman Axel Dumas shared his annoyance, for example.",
      "\u201cMaking a copy like this is quite detestable,\u201d Dumas said in a corporate earnings call in February. Still, he acknowledged that it was \u201cquite touching\u201d to see so many consumers want a bag with the Birkin style \u2014 and that \u201cdifference in quality\u201d was still evident, noting that nobody bought the dupe thinking it was from Herm\u00e8s.",
      "Alexandra Roberts, a professor of law and media at Northeastern University, said that \u201cthe term \u2018dupe\u2019 itself doesn\u2019t tell us much about legality,\" noting the word has also been used to describe more traditional counterfeits.",
      "But overall, dupes can move into shaky legal territory, including copyright and trademark infringement, particularly if a dupe marketer makes false claims about the duplicate or the original.",
      "\u201cWith fashion, in particular, we\u2019re going to get into some thorny questions,\" Roberts said. That includes what intellectual property rights exist and how enforceable they are, she explained, and whether there is actual infringement or if a product is just \u201cpositioning itself as a less expensive alternative.\u201d",
      "Often such disputes boil down trademark questions around consumer confusion or patented product designs. Several businesses have already put this to the test, but not always successfully.",
      "In December, for example, Benefit lost a lawsuit in California over E.l.f.'s $6 Lash \u2019N Roll mascara, which is similar to Benefit\u2019s $29 Roller Lash mascara. The judge\u2019s decision was \u201ca resounding win for us,\u201d E.lf. CEO Tarang Amin previously told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cThe basic reality is we always put our E.l.f. twist on it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an E.l.f. product that\u2019s a much better value.\u201d",
      "In its lawsuit, Lululemon argued that Costco had \u201cunlawfully traded\u201d on Lululemon\u2019s reputation and that it was suing as part of wider intellectual property enforcement \u201cdirected to retailers who have chosen to copy rather than compete.\u201d",
      "Lululemon accuses Costco of making duplicates of several products, including its popular Scuba hoodies, Define jackets and ABC pants. Lululemon says one of the duplicates that Costco sells is the Hi-Tec Men\u2019s Scuba Full Zip, with the lawsuit showing a screenshot image of Costco\u2019s website showing the item priced at $19.97.",
      "Roberts said she was \u201ca little skeptical\u201d of some of Lululemon's claims, noting that the design patents in particular could be hard to challenge. And she pointed to Lululemon's asserting common law trade dress over a \u201ctriangle kind of shape in the crotch region\u201d of the ABC pants.",
      "\u201cMy first reaction as a trademark expert is that looks pretty functional,\u201d she said, and functional matter is not protected under trademark law. \u201cI was just cracking up because that particular claim seemed really far-fetched to me. Those pants look really basic.\"",
      "Still, Roberts noted that Lululemon had some plausible claims.",
      "Lululemon alleges that Costco is known to use manufacturers of popular branded products for its private label Kirkland brand, although the companies involved don't clearly reveal that information to customers. Due to this, Lululemon claims some shoppers may believe that Kirkland-branded products are made by the authentic supplier of the \u201coriginal\u201d products.",
      "Roberts said this could rule in Lululemon's favor as something that \u201cweighs toward consumer confusion.\u201d Still, she noted that most of the products Lululemon mentioned in its complaint weren't sold under the Kirkland brand, which could undermine the argument.",
      "A message was left Tuesday seeking comment from Costco on the lawsuit.",
      "Lululemon found itself in a similar dispute with Peloton in 2021, when it sued the exercise bike company over alleged \u201ccopycat products\u201d in its then-new clothing lines. Two years later, the companies announced a five-year partnership that included Lululemon becoming the primary athletic apparel partner to Peloton.",

      "The Trump administration is withholding more than $6 billion in federal grants for after-school and summer programs, English language instruction, adult literacy and more",
      "WASHINGTON -- Day camp providers and schools are warning that a Trump administration funding freeze could wreck summer for low-income American families and wipe out some after-school programming next year.",
      "The administration is withholding more than $6 billion in federal grants for after-school and summer programs, English language instruction, adult literacy and more as part of a review to ensure grants align with President Donald Trump\u2019s priorities.",
      "The move leaves states and schools in limbo as they budget for programs this summer and in the upcoming school year, introducing new uncertainty about when \u2014 or if \u2014 they will receive the money. It also sets the stage for a clash with Democrats, who say the administration is flouting the law by holding back money Congress appropriated.",
      "Without the money, schools say they won't be able to provide free or affordable after-school care for low-income kids while their parents work, and they may not be able to hire staff to teach children who are learning English. Even classes or camps underway this summer could be in jeopardy.",
      "For instance, the Boys and Girls Clubs of America depend on some of the withheld money to run camps and other summer programming for low-income students. If funding isn\u2019t restored soon, the programming may end mid-season, said Boys and Girls Club President Jim Clark.",
      "After-school programming in the fall could also take a hit. \u201cIf these funds are blocked, the fallout will be swift and devastating,\u201d Clark said. As many as 926 Boys and Girls Clubs could close, affecting more than 220,000 kids, the group said.",
      "Programs that rely on the money were expecting it to be distributed July 1, but an Education Department notice issued Monday announced the money would not be released while the programs are under review. The department did not provide a timeline and warned that \u201cdecisions have not yet been made\u201d on grants for the upcoming school year.",
      "\u201cThe Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President\u2019s priorities and the Department\u2019s statutory responsibilities,\u201d Education Department officials wrote in the notice, which was obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "The department referred questions to the Office of Management and Budget, which did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In Gadsden City Schools in Alabama, officials say they'll have no choice but to shutter their after-school program serving more than 1,200 low-income students if federal funds aren't released. There\u2019s no other way to make up for the frozen federal money, said Janie Browning, who directs the program.",
      "Families who rely on after-school programs would lose an important source of child care that keeps children safe and engaged while their parents work. The roughly 75 employees of the district's after-school programs may lose their jobs.",
      "\u201cThose hours between after school and 6 o\u2019clock really are the hours in the day when students are at the most risk for things that may not produce great outcomes,\u201d Browning said. \u201cIt would be devastating if we lost the lifeline of afterschool for our students and our families.\u201d",
      "Jodi Grant, executive director of the Afterschool Alliance, said withholding the money could cause lasting damage to the economy.",
      "Some advocates fear the grants are being targeted for elimination, which could force schools to cut programs and teachers. Trump\u2019s 2026 budget proposal called for Congress to zero out all of the programs under review, signaling the administration sees them as unnecessary.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., pressed the administration to spend the money as Congress intended.",
      "\u201cEvery day that this funding is held up is a day that school districts are forced to worry about whether they\u2019ll have to cut back on afterschool programs or lay off teachers instead of worrying about how to make sure our kids can succeed,\u201d Murray said in a statement.",
      "The six grant programs under review include one known as 21st Century Community Learning Centers. It\u2019s the primary federal funding source for after-school and summer learning programs and supports more than 10,000 local programs nationwide, according to the Afterschool Alliance. Every state runs its own competition to distribute the grants, which totaled $1.3 billion this fiscal year.",
      "Also under review are $2 billion in grants for teachers' professional development and efforts to reduce class size; $1 billion for academic enrichment grants, often used for science and math education and accelerated learning; $890 million for students who are learning English; $376 million to educate the children of migrant workers; and $715 million to teach adults how to read.",
      "These programs account for over 20% of the federal money the District of Columbia receives for K-12 education, according to an analysis by the Learning Policy Institute, a think tank. California alone has over $800,000 in limbo, while Texas has over $660,000.",
      "\u201cTrump is illegally impounding billions of dollars appropriated by Congress to serve students this fiscal year,\" said Tony Thurmond, California's state superintendent, in a statement. \u201cThe Administration is punishing children when states refuse to cater to Trump\u2019s political ideology.",
      "The loss of funds could \u201cput several more school districts in extreme financial distress,\u201d said Chris Reykdal, superintendent of public instruction in Washington state. Districts have already adopted budgets, planned programming and hired staff, assuming they'd receive the money, Reykdal said.",
      "If the funding freeze remains, children learning English and their parents would be especially affected. Some districts use the money to pay for summer programming designed for English learners, family engagement specialists who can communicate with parents and professional development training for staff. Rural districts would be hit the hardest.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re trying to send a message,\u201d said Amaya Garcia, who oversees education research at New America, a left-leaning think tank. \u201cThey don\u2019t believe that taxpayer funding should be used for these children.\u201d",
      "Umatilla School District in rural eastern Oregon \u2014 with a sizable population of migrant families and students learning English \u2014 relies heavily on federal funding for its after-school and summer school programs. Superintendent Heidi Sipe says she is meeting with state officials soon to find out if the district will have to plan an early end to summer school, an option 20% of students are using. Come this fall, if federal money stays frozen, she\u2019ll have to lay off staff and eliminate after-school programs attended by around half the district's students.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an essential service in our community because we don\u2019t have any licensed child care centers for school-age children,\u201d she said.",
      "Sipe said it\u2019s particularly frustrating to deal with these funds being put into limbo because the school district was in the middle of a five-year grant period.",
      "\u201cIt feels preventable,\u201d she said, \u201cand it feels as though we could have done a better job planning for America\u2019s children.\u201d",

      "FRANKFURT, Germany -- A German court has suspended proceedings in the trial of former Volkswagen CEO Martin Winterkorn, who has been charged with fraud and market manipulation in connection with Volkswagen's use of rigged software that let millions of diesel-engine cars cheat on emissions tests.",
      "The regional court in Braunschweig on Tuesday cited an unspecified health issue that meant Winterkorn, 78, was not in a condition to face trial.",
      "The court said in a statement that it had \"provisionally terminated\u201d the proceedings. It said the health issue represented a \u201ctemporary impediment\u201d and would continue to be reviewed with the help of an expert so that proceedings could resume if Winterkorn recovers.",
      "Winterkorn went on trial in September, 2024 but the proceedings were suspended a few days later after Winterkorn had an accident.",

      "A Himalayan village in Nepal has vanished \u2014 emptied by climate change",
      "SAMJUNG, Nepal -- The Himalayan village of Samjung did not die in a day.",
      "Perched in a wind-carved valley in Nepal's Upper Mustang, more than 13,000 feet (3,962 meters) above sea level, the Buddhist village lived by slow, deliberate rhythms \u2014 herding yaks and sheep and harvesting barley under sheer ochre cliffs honeycombed with \u201csky caves\u201d \u2014 2,000-year-old chambers used for ancestral burials, meditation and shelter.",
      "Then the water dried up. Snow-capped mountains turned brown and barren as, year after year, snowfall declined. Springs and canals vanished and when it did rain, the water came all at once, flooding fields and melting away the mud homes. Families left one by one, leaving the skeletal remains of a community transformed by climate change: crumbling mud homes, cracked terraces and unkempt shrines.",
      "The Hindu Kush and Himalayan mountain regions \u2014 stretching from Afghanistan to Myanmar \u2014 hold more ice than anywhere else outside the Arctic and Antarctic. Their glaciers feed major rivers that support 240 million people in the mountains \u2014 and 1.65 billion more downstream.",
      "Such high-altitude areas are warming faster than lowlands. Glaciers are retreating and permafrost areas are thawing as snowfall becomes scarcer and more erratic, according to the Kathmandu-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development or ICMOD.",
      "Kunga Gurung is among many in the high Himalayas already living through the irreversible effects of climate change.",
      "\u201cWe moved because there was no water. We need water to drink and to farm. But there is none there. Three streams, and all three dried up,\u201d said Gurung, 54.",
      "Climate change is quietly reshaping where people can live and work by disrupting farming, water access, and weather patterns, said Neil Adger, a professor of human geography at the University of Exeter. In places like Mustang, that's making life harder, even if people don\u2019t always say climate change is why they moved. \u201cOn the everyday basis, the changing weather patterns ... it's actually affecting the ability of people to live in particular places,\u201d Adger said.",
      "Around the globe, extreme weather due to climate change is forcing communities to move, whether it's powerful tropical storms in The Philippines and Honduras, drought in Somalia or forest fires in California.",
      "In the world's highest mountains, Samjung isn't the only community to have to start over, said Amina Maharjan, a migration specialist at ICMOD. Some villages move only short distances, but inevitably the key driver is lack of water.",
      "\"The water scarcity is getting chronic,\u201d she said.",
      "Retreating glaciers \u2014 rivers of ice shrinking back as the world warms \u2014 are the most tangible and direct evidence of climate change. Up to 80% of the glacier volume in the Hindu Kush and Himalayas could vanish in this century if greenhouse gas emissions aren\u2019t drastically cut, a 2023 report warned.",
      "It hasn't snowed in Upper Mustang for nearly three years, a dire blow for those living and farming in high-altitude villages. Snowfall traditionally sets the seasonal calendar, determining when crops of barley, buckwheat, and potatoes are planted and affecting the health of grazing livestock.",
      "\u201cIt is critically important,\" Maharjan said.",
      "For Samjung, the drought and mounting losses began around the turn of the century. Traditional mud homes built for a dry, cold mountain climate fell apart as monsoon rains grew more intense \u2014 a shift scientists link to climate change. The region's steep slopes and narrow valleys funnel water into flash floods that destroyed homes and farmland, triggering a wave of migration that began a decade ago.",
      "Moving a village \u2014 even one with fewer than 100 residents like Samjung \u2014 was no simple endeavor. They needed reliable access to water and nearby communities for support during disasters. Relocating closer to winding mountain roads would allow villagers to market their crops and benefit from growing tourism. Eventually, the king of Mustang, who still owns large tracts of land in the area nearly two decades after Nepal abolished its monarchy, provided suitable land for a new village.",
      "Pemba Gurung, 18, and her sister Toshi Lama Gurung, 22, don\u2019t remember much about the move from their old village. But they remember how hard it was to start over.

      "The fate of Argentina\u2019s state-run oil company has been thrown into doubt as a U.S. judge ordered the cash-strapped country to give up its 51% controlling stake in YPF",
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- The fate of Argentina\u2019s state-run oil company was thrown into doubt Monday as a U.S. judge ordered the cash-strapped country to give up its 51% controlling stake in YPF in partial compensation for seizing the shares of former investors during its 2012 nationalization of the energy group.",
      "The ruling \u2014 a dramatic effort to enforce a $16 billion U.S. court judgement against Argentina \u2014 presents a new headache for libertarian President Javier Milei, the ideological foil for left-wing former President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner who oversaw Argentina's contentious takeover of YPF and ensuing legal battles during her tenure (2007-2015). Milei vowed to appeal the ruling.",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez's abrupt move to seize control of YPF at the time helped bring serial defaulter Argentina further infamy for abandoning its global financial obligations. Milei inherited an economy in shambles after decades of reckless state spending and campaigned on pledges to privatize state companies.",
      "In granting the request of former shareholders largely represented by Burford Capital, which finances litigation in return for a share of the winnings, Judge Loretta Preska of the Southern District of New York gave Argentina two weeks to transfer its shares in YPF to Bank of New York Mellon Corp, the major U.S. custody bank, according to the ruling seen by The Associated Press.",
      "Because YPF is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the plaintiffs could file the lawsuit in a U.S. district court. Shares of YPF closed down 5.6%.",
      "The judgement stems from a long-running legal case that in 2023 saw Judge Preska find Argentina liable for $16.1 billion in damages and interest. The plaintiffs argue that the government should have launched a tender offer for stakes held by minority shareholders.",
      "Milei, whose government has struggled to build up depleted foreign reserves, has vowed to appeal the ruling \u201cto defend national interests\" and blamed the problem on his political rivals.",
      "\u201cMore than 10 years have passed, and we Argentines continue to suffer the consequences of the worst government in Argentine history,\u201d he wrote on social media platform X.",
      "Marcelo J. Garc\u00eda, Director for the Americas at the New York-based Horizon Engage risk consultancy, said the ruling was \u201ca reminder for the Milei administration that the country\u2019s problems will not go away just because he blames the opposition for them.\u201d",
      "\u201cControl of YPF is important for Milei; that\u2019s why an appeal is the only option for him,\u201d he added.",
      "Paying up and losing the controlling stake in YPF \u2014 which has become a pillar of the economy \u2014 would cripple Argentina at a crucial moment for Milei's government.",
      "YPF has accelerated its drive to develop the country's huge reserves of shale gas in the Vaca Muerta field in Argentine Patagonia. Crude production at Vaca Muerta has steadily climbed, hitting record production in May at 448,000 barrels per day, 22.5% more than the same month in 2024, according to official data.",
      "In 2024, YPF notched a net profit of almost $2.4 billion, up from a $1.3 billion loss the year before.",
      "Milei has hoped to leverage investments in the Vaca Muerta field to cure the nation's long-standing fiscal weakness and pay its massive deficits.",

      "At some 940 pages, the legislation is a sprawling collection of tax breaks, spending cuts and other Republican priorities, including new money for national defense and deportations",
      "WASHINGTON -- Republicans are inching closer to getting their tax and spending cut bill through Congress with a final Senate vote likely late Monday or early Tuesday.",
      "At some 940 pages, the legislation is a sprawling collection of tax breaks, spending cuts and other Republican priorities, including new money for national defense and deportations. President Donald Trump has admonished Republicans, who hold majority power in the House and Senate, to skip their holiday vacations and deliver the bill by the Fourth of July.",
      "Democrats are united against the legislation and were offering scores of amendments to alter it Monday as the Senate slogged through what is known as a vote-a-rama. Senators can offer an unlimited number of amendments, with each receiving a vote. Once the bill clears the Senate, it would have to pass the House before Trump can sign it into law.",
      "Here's the latest on what's in the bill. There could be changes as GOP lawmakers continue to negotiate.",
      "Republicans say the bill is crucial because there would be a massive tax increase after December when tax breaks from Trump's first term expire. The legislation contains about $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.",
      "The existing tax rates and brackets would become permanent under the bill. It temporarily would add new tax breaks that Trump campaigned on: no taxes on tips, overtime pay, the ability to deduct interest payments for some automotive loans, along with a $6,000 deduction for older adults who earn no more than $75,000 a year.",
      "It would boost the $2,000 child tax credit to $2,200. Millions of families at lower income levels would not get the full credit.",
      "A cap on state and local deductions, called SALT, would quadruple to $40,000 for five years. It's a provision important to New York and other high tax states, though the House wanted it to last for 10 years.",
      "There are scores of business-related tax cuts, including allowing businesses to immediately write off 100% of the cost of equipment and research.",
      "The wealthiest households would see a $12,000 increase from the legislation, which would cost the poorest people $1,600 a year, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analysis of the House's version.",
      "Middle-income taxpayers would see a tax break of $500 to $1,500, the CBO said.",
      "The bill would provide some $350 billion for Trump's border and national security agenda, including $46 billion for the U.S.-Mexico border wall and $45 billion for 100,000 migrant detention facility beds, as he aims to fulfill his promise of the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history.",
      "Money would go for hiring 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, with $10,000 signing bonuses and a surge of Border Patrol officers, as well. The goal is to deport some 1 million people per year.",
      "The homeland security secretary would have a new $10 billion fund for grants for states that help with federal immigration enforcement and deportation actions.",
      "To help pay for it, immigrants would face various new fees, including when seeking asylum protections.",
      "For the Pentagon, the bill would provide billions for ship building, munitions systems, and quality of life measures for servicemen and women, as well as $25 billion for the development of the Golden Dome missile defense system. The Defense Department would have $1 billion for border security.",
      "To help partly offset the lost tax revenue and new spending, Republicans aim to cut back on Medicaid and food assistance for the poor.",
      "Republicans argue they are trying to rightsize the safety net programs for the population they were initially designed to serve, mainly pregnant women, the disabled and children, and root out what they describe as waste, fraud and abuse.",
      "The package includes new 80-hour-a-month work requirements for many adults receiving Medicaid and food stamps, including older people up to age 65. Parents of children 14 and older would have to meet the program\u2019s work requirements.",
      "There's also a proposed new $35 co-payment that can be charged to patients using Medicaid services.",
      "More than 71 million people rely on Medicaid, which expanded under Obama's Affordable Care Act, and 40 million use the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program. Most already work, according to analysts.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 11.8 million more Americans would become uninsured by 2034 if the bill became law and 3 million more would not qualify for food stamps.",
      "The Senate proposes a $25 billion Rural Hospital Transformation Program to help offset reduced Medicaid dollars. It's a new addition, intended to win over holdout GOP senators and a coalition of House Republicans warning that the proposed Medicaid provider tax cuts would hurt rural hospitals.",
      "Republicans are proposing to dramatically roll back tax breaks designed to boost clean energy projects fueled by renewable sources such as energy and wind. The tax breaks were a central component of President Joe Biden's 2022 landmark bill focused on addressing climate change and lowering healthcare costs.",
      "Democratic Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden went so far as to call the GOP provisions a \u201cdeath sentence for America\u2019s wind and solar industries and an inevitable hike in utility bills.\u201d",
      "Under the bill, a tax credit that subsidizes the production of electricity would be eliminated for any wind and solar plant not plugged into the grid by the end of 2027. But Republicans aren't just looking to roll back the tax breaks Biden put into place: they're also looking to add a tax for new wind and solar projects that use a certain percentage of components from China.",
      "A tax break for people who buy new or used electric vehicles would expire on Sept. 30 of this year, instead of at the end of 2032 under current law.",
      "Meanwhile, a tax credit for the production of critical materials will be expanded to include metallurgical coal used in steelmaking.",
      "A number of extra provisions reflect other GOP priorities.",
      "The House and Senate both have a new children's savings program, called Trump Accounts, with a potential $1,000 deposit from the Treasury.",
      "The Senate provided $40 million to establish Trump\u2019s long-sought \u201cNational Garden of American Heroes.\u201d",
      "There's a new excise tax on university endowments. A $200 tax on gun silencers and short-barreled rifles and shotguns was eliminated. One provision bars money to family planning providers, namely Planned Parenthood, while $88 million is earmarked for a pandemic response accountability committee.",
      "Another section expands the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, a hard-fought provision from GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, for those impacted by nuclear development and testing.",
      "Billions would go for the Artemis moon mission and for exploration to Mars.",
      "The bill would deter states from regulating artificial intelligence by linking certain federal AI infrastructure money to maintaining a freeze. Seventeen Republican governors have asked GOP leaders to drop the provision.",
      "Additionally, a provision would increase the nation's debt limit, by $5 trillion, to allow continued borrowing to pay already accrued bills.",
      "Altogether, the Congressional Budget Office projects that the bill would increase federal deficits over the next 10 years by nearly $3.3 trillion from 2025 to 2034.",
      "Or not, depending on how one does the math.",
      "Senate Republicans are proposing a unique strategy of not counting the existing tax breaks as a new cost because those breaks are already \u201ccurrent policy.\u201d Republican senators say the Senate Budget Committee chairman has the authority to set the baseline for the preferred approach.",
      "Under the alternative Senate GOP view, the bill would reduce deficits by almost a half-trillion dollars over the coming decade, the CBO said.",
      "Democrats say this is \u201cmagic math\u201d that obscures the true costs of the tax breaks. Some nonpartisan groups worried about the country's fiscal trajectory are siding with Democrats in that take. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says Senate Republicans are employing an \u201caccounting gimmick that would make Enron executives blush.\u201d",

      "FRANKFURT, Germany -- The head of the European Central Bank said inflation has become more unpredictable due to shocks like the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine \u2014 and that policymakers need to take the possibility of such extreme scenarios into account and communicate them to the public as well.",
      "\u201cThe world ahead is more uncertain, and that uncertainty is likely to make inflation more volatile,\u201d ECB President Christine Lagarde said Monday in a speech opening the central bank's annual conference in Sintra, Portugal. \u201cIt's pretty basic but that's the reality.\u201d",
      "One reason, she said, was that increasingly regular supply disruptions were leading companies to change their prices more frequently, a habit that goes beyond the recent burst of inflation in the U.S. and Europe and \u201creflects a structural shift in how firms operate under conditions of permanently higher uncertainty.\"",
      "The bank's assessment of the economy needs to rely on taking extreme possible scenarios into account as well as the more likely baseline predictions, and it should let the public in on those possible outcomes as well, she said. Lagarde in particular cited the inflation spike that followed Russia's invasion of Ukraine, where a baseline scenario based on higher energy prices suggest inflation for 2022 of 5.5% - but a worst-case scenario indicated more than 7% inflation, much closer to the final figure of 8%.",
      "Another example was the pandemic, where spending by homebound consumers shifted from services like restaurants to goods such as home exercise equipment.",
      "\u201cScenario analysis could have helped in illustrating that the range of possible inflation outcomes was unusually wide \u2013 and would have reduced the risk of projecting false certainty to the public,\u201d Lagarde said.",
      "The bank's strategy review announced Monday reaffirmed its target of 2% for inflation, a goal it has met for the time being as annual price increases were 1.9% in May. The drop in inflation has let the bank cut its benchmark interest rate from a peak of 4% to 2%.",
      "Threats of higher tariffs from U.S. President Donald Trump have added to uncertainty about the outlook for growth and inflation. The European Commission and US negotiators are trying to reach agreement on a trade deal ahead of a July 9 deadline.",
      "The conference in Sintra is the ECB's equivalent of the U.S. Federal Reserve gathering in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, and gathers top central bankers and economists from around the world. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is to take part in a panel on Tuesday with Lagarde, Bank of England Government Andrew Bailey, Bank of Korea Governor Chang Yong Rhee and Kazuo Ueda, the governor of the Bank of Japan.",

      "Aryna Sabalenka has come back after being two points from dropping the opening set of her second-round Wimbledon match three times",
      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 Aryna Sabalenka was just two points from dropping the opening set of her second-round Wimbledon match three times on Wednesday before asserting herself for a 7-6 (4), 6-4 victory over Marie Bouzkova to avoid the sort of surprise that has sent a group of seeded players home.",
      "Four of the top 10 women's seeds failed to make it out of the first round: No. 2 Coco Gauff, No. 3 Jessica Pegula, No. 5 Zheng Qinwen and No. 9 Paula Badosa. In all, a record-tying 23 seeded players \u2014 10 women, 13 men \u2014 were gone by the end of Day 2, equaling the most at any Grand Slam event in the past 25 years.",
      "\u201cOf course you're going to know the overall picture. ... I hope it\u2019s no upsets anymore in this tournament,\u201d the No. 1-ranked Sabalenka said afterward with a chuckle. \"If you know what I mean.\u201d",
      "She is a three-time Grand Slam champion, with all of those titles coming on hard courts at the Australian Open or U.S. Open. She also was the runner-up to Gauff at the clay-court French Open last month \u2014 drawing criticism from some over her post-match comments, a flap she and Gauff set aside via social media videos last week \u2014 but hasn't been past the semifinals on the grass of the All England Club.",
      "A year ago, Sabalenka was forced to miss Wimbledon because of an injured shoulder.",
      "On Wednesday, the record-breaking heat of the first two days gave way to rain that delayed the start of play on smaller courts for about two hours, along with temperatures that dropped from above 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) to below 68 F (20 C).",
      "At Centre Court, the 48th-ranked Bouzkova went ahead 6-5 in the first set with the match's initial service break thanks to a double-fault by Sabalenka. Bouzkova served for that set, and was two points away from it at 30-15 in that game, again at 30-all, then once more at deuce.",
      "But on the last such occasion, Sabalenka came through with a forehand volley winner she punctuated with a yell, followed by a down-the-line backhand winner that was accompanied by another shout.",
      "\u201cThat was a tough moment,\" said Sabalenka, who will face 2021 U.S. Open champion Emma Raducanu or 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova next. \u201cUntil that point, (my) return wasn\u2019t great enough to break her serve. I'm really glad ... everything clicked together and I was able to break her back. I kind of like felt a little bit better.\u201d",
      "That sent them to a tiebreaker, and from 4-all there, Sabalenka took the next three points, ending the set with a powerful forehand return winner off a 67 mph second serve. In the second set, the only break arrived for a 3-2 lead for Sabalenka, and that was basically that.",
      "Sabalenka compiled a 41-17 edge in winners while making only 18 unforced errors in a match that lasted a little more than 1 1/2 hours.",
      "Australian Open champion Madison Keys, who is seeded sixth, joined Sabalenka in the third round, beating Olga Danilovic 6-4, 6-2. Other players in action later included 2024 runner-up Jasmine Paolini among the women and two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz, Taylor Fritz, Frances Tiafoe among the men.",

      "BUFFALO, N.Y. -- Buffalo Bills first-round draft pick Maxwell Hairston was accused in a lawsuit of sexually assaulting a woman in 2021 at the University of Kentucky.",
      "The lawsuit was filed Tuesday in federal court in Kentucky by a woman who claims Hairston entered her dorm room without being invited, ignored her when she said didn't want to have sexual intercourse, forcibly removed her bottoms and sexually assaulted her. The Associated Press does not typically name alleged victims of sexual assault.",
      "Texts seeking comment Wednesday were sent to agents for Hairston.",

      "On a cool, windy night in Brisbane, the Lions again took a while to get started, twice falling behind to early tries before turning a 12-7 deficit into a 21-12 halftime lead.",
      "Skipper Itoje, who was rested for the first game, ran powerfully onto an inside pass from scrumhalf Jamison Gibson-Park five minutes after the break to crack the game open, with the Lions scoring three tries in 15 minutes.",
      "The Lions were determined to play with pace and high-tempo, spreading the ball to the edges regularly and maintaining a positive attacking shape to generate space and scoring opportunities.",
      "\u201cAs a team we just wanted to be better today, take a step forward. It wasn\u2019t perfect, but it was a step in the right direction,\u201d Itoje said of his first win as Lions captain. \"I think we were a little bit more clinical, sharper, a little bit more accurate on the ball.",
      "\u201cWe still made quite a few errors ball in hand, but I thought it was better in that regard.\u201d",
      "Flyhalf Finn Russell again orchestrated the Lions attack before he was rested after 55 minutes.",
      "Winger Tommy Freeman was a beneficiary of the attacking mindset, scoring two tries, while Bundy Ake created opportunities in midfield and openside flanker Jac Morgan put in a player-of-the-match performance in a dominant forward pack, including a try.",
      "Huw Jones plucked an attempted chip kick out of the air and sprinted 60 meters to make it 47-12 and Garry Ringrose capped it off with a try five minutes into stoppage time.",
      "The Lions have now won back-to-back matches after slipping to a 28-24 loss to Argentina in a warmup in Dublin before traveling to Australia for a nine-game tour, which includes three tests against the Wallabies on July 19, 26 and Aug. 2.",
      "The Lions will play New South Wales on Saturday in Sydney.",
      "\u201cWe have five games in two weeks. We don\u2019t have loads of time on the training field but what we do have is loads of games,\u201d Itoje said. \u201cYou improve and you learn probably more so in games than you do in training, so it\u2019s a blessing in disguise.\u201d",
      "Irish fullback Hugo Keenan was ruled out just ahead of the match and replaced by Elliot Daly, who scored two tries in the win over Western Force. Daly hurt his left forearm in a tackle late in the second half and didn't finish the match.",
      "Head coach Andy Farrell said Daly would undergo medical scans on the injury.",
      "The Reds stunned the Lions with an early try and twice led in the first half.",
      "Prop Jeff Toomaga-Allen powered through the defense and reached over to score the opener in the ninth minute after a strong break by center Hunter Paisami.",
      "Ake was held up over the line at the back of a driving maul from a lineout in the 12th minute, and the Lions again went close to scoring in the 16th until Daly's last pass went astray with the tryline open.",
      "The pressure paid off in the 20th when the Lions created an overlap and spread the ball wide for Freeman to score untouched.",
      "The Reds, playing in maroon and navy colors, were missing a host of starting players on duty for Australia's test against Fiji on Sunday, but still threatened regularly.",
      "Center Josh Flook swooped onto a short, stabbed grubber kick from scrumhalf Kalani Thomas as the Lions defense rushed up, collected the half-volley and dived over to give the Reds a 12-7 lead after 25 minutes.",
      "The Lions went within inches of scoring two minutes later but couldn't ground the ball. There was no doubt over prop Andrew Porter's barging try from close range in the 29th, though, and the Lions regained the lead 14-12.",
      "The Lions took a quick tap in the 35th after the Reds were penalized for a hand in the scrum and spread it wide quickly for Duhan van der Merwe to dive inside the left corner post. It was all the Lions after that.",

      "BIRMINGHAM, England -- India was 98-2 at lunch after being made to bat first by England to start the second test at Edgbaston on Wednesday.",
      "Yashasvi Jaiswal was 62 not out, after Lokesh Rahul chopped on to his stumps on 2 early on, and Karun Nair was out minutes before lunch when he picked out second slip.",
      "Rahul's wicket was reward for England's tight bowling on a dry, batter-friendly pitch under sunny skies.",
      "Then Nair's ambition sparked Jaiswal out of uncharacteristic caution and they accelerated to hit 16 boundaries in a stand of 80 runs off 90 balls.",
      "But Nair's wicket stopped the session from being dominated by India.",
      "Captain Shubman Gill was with Jaiswal on 1.",
      "The first hour was attritional for India, with England seamer Chris Woakes particularly effective.",
      "He got Rahul out and had big lbw shouts against Jaiswal on 12 and Nair on 5. Both times the ball was tracking to clip the top of off stump but the batters survived on umpire calls.",
      "Nair was promoted from No. 6 in the batting order to No. 3 for the first time in a test and quickly passed Jaiswal's score by driving at Woakes and Josh Tongue.",
      "Jaiswal was unusually strangled but didn't give England the mistake it was waiting for. He opened up in the second hour by smashing fuller-length deliveries to the boundary by Tongue and Ben Stokes.",
      "His rising confidence brought out his imagination, including an overhead volley smash of Stokes to the boundary. He brought up his 50 with his 10th boundary \u2014 an overhead cut, on his toes, off Tongue. His 16th 50-plus score in his 21st test came off 58 balls.",
      "Nair fell softly after a bowling change and the return of Brydon Carse.",
      "India revealed its lineup after England won the toss and surprised by resting its best bowler, Jasprit Bumrah, and not picking wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav, who was missed in the series-opening loss in Leeds last week.",

      "Bumrah was replaced by Akash Deep.",

      "A controversial redevelopment plan in Tokyo's Jingu Gaien park threatens historic landmarks and green spaces",
      "TOKYO -- Plans to demolish a historic baseball stadium where Babe Ruth played and an adjacent rugby venue are at the heart of a disputed park redevelopment in Tokyo that critics say trades history and greenery for commercial space.",
      "The plan to remake the Jingu Gaien park area was approved 2 1/2 years ago by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. Work clearing land has begun but opponents are still trying to stop the project, which could take a decade to complete.",
      "A coalition on Wednesday presented an open letter to Toshiko Abe, the minister of education, culture, sports, science and technology, asking the project be reassessed.",
      "It's signed by 368 experts \u2014 urban planners, architects and environmental scientists \u2014 and 1,167 others.",
      "The park area was established a century ago through public donations to honor the Meiji Emperor. At the heart of the issue is citizens' control of public space, and a potential conflict of interest with private developers and politicians deciding how valuable parcels are used.",
      "The stadium oozes history and critics say building skyscrapers in the park space would never be allowed in Central Park in New York or Hyde Park in London.",
      "Ruth and Lou Gehrig played at the stadium on a 1934 barnstorming tour. Japanese novelist Haruki Murakami was inspired to write his first novel while drinking beer and watching a game there in 1978. The stadium is still home to the Yakult Swallows baseball team and hosted a concert this week.",
      "Plans call for developers to build a pair of 200-meter (650-feet) towers and a smaller tower. The stadiums are to be rebuilt in the reconfigured space with the baseball stadium going where the rugby stadium now stands.",
      "The open letter is critical of so-called private finance schemes that give private developers access to park space. Hibiya Park is Tokyo's oldest public park, another example of this approach.",
      "Opposition to the Jingu redevelopment has included novelist Murakami, a conservancy group, and botanists and environmentalists who argue the sprawling project threatens 100-year-old gingko trees that grace the area's main avenue.",
      "A global conservancy body ICOMOS, which works with the United Nations body UNESCO, has said the development will lead to \u201cirreversible destruction of cultural heritage\u201d with trees and green space being lost.",
      "Opposition groups are pitted against powerful real-estate developer Mitsui Fudosan, the Shinto religious body, and Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike.",
      "\u201cThe problem is that many Japanese citizens are not so much interested in democratically regulating their own city and are used to demolishing buildings,\u201d Kohei Saito, a Japanese political economist at Tokyo University, wrote to The Associated Press.",
      "He said \u201ccompanies with political power try to maximize their short-term profits without consideration of Tokyo's attractiveness (history, culture), inhabitants' well-being and future generations.\u201d",
      "Zoning changes to allow high-rise buildings in the area were made around 2013 by the Tokyo government when the city won the bid for the 2020 Olympics. Many of those changes permitted building the neighboring National Stadium but also applied to the park area.",
      "\u201cThe process of rezoning the area lacked transparency and democratic procedure and constitutes an illegal abuse of the governor\u2019s discretion in urban planning decisions,\u201d the open letter said.",
      "The Jingu district was considered \u201ccommon property\u201d until after World War II when the government sold it to Shinto under a promise it would remain a common space.",
      "The national government comes into play because the rugby venue is the property of the Japan Sport Council, a national government affiliated body. The rugby venue represents about 30% of the Jingu Gaien area.",
      "Opponents hope the timing later this month of a national election might aid their cause with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba heading a minority government.",
      "Former Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori has ties to the rugby venue.",
      "In addition to serving two decades ago as prime minister, he is the former president of the Japan Rugby Football Union and also served as the president of the 2020 Olympic organizing committee until he was forced to resign after making sexist comments about women.",
      "Opened in 1926, developers argue the baseball stadium is too old to save. However, Fenway Park in Boston dates from 1912 and Wrigley Field in Chicago from 1914. Both have been refurbished and are among the most venerated in the United States.",
      "Meiji Kinenkan, a historic reception hall in Jingu Gaien, dates from 1881 and is still widely used with no calls for its demolition. Mitsui Fudosan\u2019s headquarters building in Tokyo dates from 1929. Koshien Stadium, located near Osaka, was built in 1924 and has been in use since a refurbishment.",
      "The new rugby stadium would be an indoor venue with plastic grass, which players view as the least desirable surface for the sport.",

      "Nikolaj Ehlers could choose his destination as soon as Wednesday after letting the start of NHL free agency pass without signing a contract.",
      "Ehlers became one of the rare top players available not to sign on the first day of free agency, opting instead to sit back and consider his options. Carolina, Tampa Bay and Washington were considered among the teams interested in pursuing the 29-year-old from Denmark who played his first nine seasons with Winnipeg.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had talks with his agent,\" Hurricanes general manager Eric Tulsky said. \u201cHe\u2019s taking his time to field offers. He\u2019s obviously a very popular person right now, and we\u2019re waiting to see where that goes.\u201d",
      "Ehlers and his camp watched Tuesday as fellow winger Brock Boeser re-signed in Vancouver for just over $50 million and older forward Mikael Granlund got $7 million annually from Anaheim. With the salary cap increasing a record amount to $95.5 million and a lack of high-end talent available, Ehlers could sign the most lucrative contract among players changing teams this summer.",
      "Ehlers going unsigned is almost certainly holding things up for players like Anthony Beauvillier and Jeff Skinner, who could be part of a Plan B or C for those who don't land their first choice. Andrew Mangiapane signed with back-to-back defending Western Conference champion Edmonton on a two-year deal worth $7.2 million late Tuesday night.",
      "Defensemen Dmitry Orlov, Brent Burns and Matt Grzelcyk, forwards Jack Roslovic and Mason Appleton and goaltenders Ilya Samsonov and Alexandar Georgiev are also still available.",
      "\u201cDay 1 is always a little bit hectic and crazy,\u201d said San Jose GM Mike Grier, who made multiple moves but still needs to spend more to get to the salary floor. \u201cWe\u2019ll kind of see how things shake out. After (Tuesday night), things will settle down and teams will kind of regroup and see what\u2019s out there and the free agents will do the same.\u201d",

      "PHOENIX -- Jake McCarthy hit a three-run homer, Lourdes Gurriel Jr. added a two-run shot and the Arizona Diamondbacks hit four homers in an 8-2 win over the San Francisco Giants on Tuesday night.",
      "Right-hander Zac Gallen (6-9) struck out 10 over seven strong innings, giving up just one earned run and bouncing back from a mediocre stretch of outings.",
      "Randal Grichuk and James McCann added back-to-back solo homers in the sixth to push the D-backs lead to 8-2.",
      "San Francisco has lost seven of its past eight games.",
      "The D-backs took a 4-2 lead in the fourth after Eugenio Suarez and Lourdes Gurriel Jr. drew back-to-back walks from Hayden Birdsong to start the inning. McCarthy \u2014 who recently returned to the big leagues after spending most of the season at Triple-A Reno \u2014 followed with the no-doubt shot into the right field seats.",
      "Birdsong (3-3) gave up four runs, including three earned, over four innings. The right-hander struck out six.",
      "The Giants took an early 2-0 lead on a Willy Adames solo homer and Patrick Bailey's RBI groundout. The D-backs cut the advantage to 2-1 in the third on Geraldo Perdomo's RBI single.",
      "It was a tough night for Bailey, whose two passed balls helped lead to three unearned runs. His first miscue in the third allowed James McCann to get to second and he later scored on Geraldo Perdomo's single.",
      "In the fifth, Bailey's second passed ball allowed Suarez to reach first on a strikeout with two outs. Gurriel followed with his two-run homer.",
      "McCarthy has had at least one hit in six of his seven games since being promoted from Triple-A on June 24. He also has two homers.",
      "The Giants send RHP Landen Roupp (6-5, 3.43 ERA) to the mound on Wednesday to face the D-backs and RHP Merrill Kelly (7-4, 3.49).",

      "Both times, it was Adeyemi delivering the pass that set up Guirassy, a native of France who plays for Guinea's national team. The 29-year-old striker has three goals in four tournament games and 37 across all competitions in his first season with Dortmund.",

      "Using their speed to attack Dortmund vertically, Monterrey dominated the second half and had several chances to level the score. But the German team held on, despite the Mexican squad holding a 59% edge in possession and a 7-3 advantage in shots on goal.",
      "The late game drew a crowd of 31,442 at cavernous Mercedes-Benz Stadium, where the upper deck wasn't needed. But the sweltering U.S. heat wasn't an issue with the roof closed in Atlanta.",

      "Coco Gauff is disappointed in her mistake-filled performance during a first-round Wimbledon loss",
      "LONDON -- Before Wimbledon began, Coco Gauff reflected on the significance of her breakthrough performance at the place six years ago \u2014 a run to the fourth round at age 15 \u2014 and what aspirations she harbored as she prepared to return.",
      "\u201cEven when I see videos of me during that time, it just doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s me. It felt like a dream. I\u2019ll always have special memories from that run and, I guess, it definitely fueled the belief that I can be on tour and live out my dream,\u201d she told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something that always holds a special place in my heart. Obviously, I would love to win this tournament just for it to be like a full-circle moment,\u201d she continued. \u201cI feel like it would be like the start of the dream, and \u2014 I don\u2019t want to say \u2018the finish,\u2019 because I obviously have a lot of career left, but \u2014 a full-circle type of situation.\u201d",
      "A week after that conversation, the No. 2-ranked Gauff was out of the bracket at the All England Club in the first round with a 7-6 (3), 6-1 loss to unseeded Dayana Yastremska at No. 1 Court on Tuesday night. Gauff was undone by serving troubles, including nine double-faults, and more than two dozen unforced errors in all, not to mention Yastremska's hard, flat groundstrokes.",
      "It was an abrupt, and mistake-filled, exit for Gauff, who so recently earned her second Grand Slam title \u2014 at the French Open via a three-set victory over No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in the final.",
      "After Tuesday's defeat, Gauff said, \u201cI definitely was struggling in the locker room. I don\u2019t like losing. The main thing I\u2019m sure my team and everyone is going to tell me (is): 'You did well at Roland-Garros. Don't be so upset.' Things like that.\u201d",
      "But as much as she'll want to move on and focus on what's to come, the 21-year-old American acknowledged as she dabbed away the tears welling in her eyes during her news conference that she felt \u201ca little bit disappointed in how I showed up today.\u201d",
      "It's instructive to remember \u2014 setting aside that captivating 2019 debut, which featured a victory over Venus Williams \u2014 that Wimbledon's grass courts actually have produced Gauff's least successful Grand Slam results.",
      "Yastremska's take? She said she considers Gauff \u201cmuch better on clay court and hard court than on grass.\u201d",
      "This was the second time in the past three years that she was sent home in the opening round. She's never been past the fourth round at the All England Club, whereas at every other major tournament, including the hard-court Australian Open, she's at least reached the semifinals.",
      "Her first Slam trophy arrived on the hard courts of the U.S. Open in 2023 when she was 19. She already was the 2022 runner-up on the red clay at the French Open before going one step better this time.",
      "Sabalenka's self-described \u201cunprofessional\u201d comments after last month's title match in Paris became a real topic of conversation and, perhaps, a distraction. Gauff and Sabalenka sought to put it behind them \u2014 and tell fans they should, too \u2014 by filming TikTok videos together once they got to Wimbledon.",
      "\u201cI was a little bit overwhelmed with everything that came afterwards,\u201d Gauff said, \u201cso I didn\u2019t feel like I had enough time to celebrate and also get back into it.\u201d",
      "It's not easy to manage the tricky transition from the Roland-Garros clay to the Wimbledon grass. There's a reason it's been a decade since a woman won both in the same season \u2014 and a reason that woman was Serena Williams.",
      "By the end of the night, Gauff was eager to look ahead to the upcoming North American hard-court circuit, culminating with a trip to New York in late August.",
      "\u201cI mean, obviously I\u2019m not going to dwell on this too long, because I want to do well at the U.S. Open. Maybe losing here (in the) first round isn\u2019t the worst thing in the world,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause I have time to reset.\u201d",

      "Ancient DNA has revealed links between the cultures of Egypt and Mesopotamia",
      "WASHINGTON -- Ancient DNA has revealed a genetic link between the cultures of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, according to research published Wednesday in the journal Nature.",
      "Researchers sequenced whole genomes from the teeth of a remarkably well-preserved skeleton found in a sealed funeral pot in an Egyptian tomb site dating to between 4,495 and 4,880 years ago.",
      "Four-fifths of the genome showed links to North Africa and the region around Egypt. But a fifth of the genome showed links to the area in the Middle East between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, known as the Fertile Crescent, where Mesopotamian civilization flourished.",
      "\u201cThe finding is highly significant\" because it \u201cis the first direct evidence of what has been hinted at\u201d in prior work,\u201d said Daniel Antoine, curator of Egypt and Sudan at the British Museum.",
      "Earlier archeological evidence has shown trade links between Egypt and Mesopotamia, as well as similarities in pottery-making techniques and pictorial writing systems. While resemblances in dental structures suggested possible ancestral links, the new study clarifies the genetic ties.",
      "The Nile River is \u201clikely to have acted as an ancient superhighway, facilitating the movement of not only cultures and ideas, but people,\u201d said Antoine, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The skeleton was found in an Egyptian tomb complex at the archaeological site of Nuwayrat, inside a chamber carved out from a rocky hillside. An analysis of wear and tear on the skeleton \u2014 and the presence of arthritis in specific joints \u2014 indicates the man was likely in his 60s and may have worked as a potter, said co-author and bioarchaeologist Joel Irish of Liverpool John Moores University.",
      "The man lived just before or near the start of ancient Egypt\u2019s Old Kingdom, when Upper and Lower Egypt were unified as one state, leading to a period of relative political stability and cultural innovation \u2014 including the construction of the Giza pyramids.",
      "\u201cThis is the time that centralized power allowed the formation of ancient Egypt as we know it,\u201d said co-author Linus Girdland-Flink, a paleogeneticist at the University of Aberdeen.",
      "At approximately the same time, Sumerian city-states took root in Mesopotamia and cuneiform emerged as a writing system.",

      "Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, was arrested in Canada in late 2018 on a U.S. extradition request but released in September 2021 in a high-stakes prisoner swap that freed two Canadians held by China and allowed her to return home.",

      "From his home in Del Mar, California, the inventor of the mobile phone, now 96, watches all of this. Of one thing Cooper is certain: The revolution has really just begun.",
      "Now, the winner of the 2024 National Medal of Technology and Innovation \u2014 the United States\u2019 highest honor for technological achievement \u2013 is focused on the cellphone\u2019s imminent transition to a thinking mobile computer fueled by human calories to avoid dependence on batteries. Our new parts will run constant tests on our bodies and feed our doctors real-time results, Cooper predicts.",
      "\u201cThat will let people anticipate diseases before they happen,\u201d Cooper envisions. \u201cPeople are going to die from old age and accidents but they\u2019re not going to die from disease. That\u2019s a revolution in medicine.\u201c",
      "Human behavior is already adapting to smartphones, some observers say, using them as tools that allow overwhelmed minds to focus on quality communication.",
      "The phone conversation has become the way to communicate the most intimate of social ties, says Claude Fischer, a sociology professor at the University of California, Berkeley and author of \u201cAmerica Calling: A Social History of the Telephone to 1940.\u201d",
      "For almost everyone, the straight-up phone call has become an intrusion. Now everything needs to be preceded by a message. \u201cThere seems to be a sense that the phone call is for heart-to-heart and not just for information exchange,\u201d Fischer says.",
      "And this from a 20-year-old corroborates that: \u201cThe only person I call on a day-to-day basis is my cousin,\u201d says Ayesha Iqbal, a psychology student at Suffolk County Community College. \u201cI primarily text everyone else.\u201d",
      "Child education student Katheryn Ruiz, 19, concurs, saying \u201ctexting is used for just like nothing substantial, like nothing personal.\u201d",
      "Sometimes the roles are reversed, though. Sixty-eight-year-old Diana Cunningham of Overbrook, Kansas, pop. 1005, uses a group text to stay in touch with her kids and grandkids. Her 18-year-old granddaughter Bryndal Hoover, a senior at nearby Lawrence High School, says she prefers voice calls over texting because then I can understand, \u2018Oh, how should I go about a conversation?\u2019\u201d",
      "When she was a girl, Karen Wilson\u2019s family shared a party line with other phone customers outside Buffalo, New York. Wilson, 79, shocked her granddaughter by telling her about the party line when the girl got a cellphone as a teenager.",
      "\u201cWhat did you do if you didn\u2019t wait?\u2019\u201d the girl asked. Responded her grandmother: \u201c`You went down to their house and you yelled, \u2018Hey, Mary, can you come out?\u2019\u201d",
      "Many worry about the changes exerted by our newly interconnected, highly stimulated world.",
      "We increasingly buy online and get products delivered without the possibility of serendipity. There are fewer opportunities to greet a neighbor or store employee and find out something unexpected, to make a friend, to fall in love. People are working more efficiently as they drown.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no barrier to the number of people who can be reaching out to you at the same time and it\u2019s just overwhelming,\u201d says Kristen Burks, an associate circuit judge in Macon, Missouri.",
      "Most importantly, sociologists, psychologists and teachers say, near-constant phone-driven screen time is cutting into kids\u2019 ability to learn and socialize. A growing movement is pushing back against cellphones\u2019 intrusion into children\u2019s daily lives.",
      "\u201cAt the turn of the millennium, technology companies based on the West Coast of the United States created a set of world-changing products,\u201d New York University social psychologist Jonathan Haidt writes in \u201cThe Anxious Generation,\u201d which has been on The New York Times bestseller list for a year.",
      "\u201cBy creating a firehose of addictive content that entered through kids\u2019 eyes and ears, and by displacing physical play and in-person socializing, these companies have rewired childhood and changed human development on an almost unimaginable scale,\u201d he writes.",
      "Seven states have signed \u2014 and twenty states have introduced \u2014 statewide bell-to-bell phone bans in schools. Additional states have moved to prohibit them during teaching time.",
      "That doesn\u2019t sit well with the smartphone\u2019s inventor, who says there are better solutions than regulation. \u201cAccommodating disruptive technologies requires disruptive solutions,\u201d Cooper wrote from Del Mar. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better for teachers to integrate the cellphone that provides access to all the information in the world?\u201d",
      "That advantage is coming to rich countries faster than poor ones.",
      "The first time that Nnaemeka Agbo had to leave his family in Nigeria for a prolonged period, life shuttled him to Russia for studies, like many other young Nigerians increasingly desperate to relocate to seek better opportunities.",
      "Adjusting to life in Russia when he moved there in 2023 was tough, he says, but one thing kept him going; WhatsApp calls with family. \u201cOne thing that kept me sane was calling home every time, and it made me feel closer to my people,\u201d the 31-year-old says.",
      "In a country that has one of the world\u2019s highest poverty and hunger levels despite being Africa\u2019s top oil producer, Agbo\u2019s experience mirrors many young people in Nigeria increasingly forced to choose between remaining at home with family or aiming at a better life elsewhere. At least 37% of African adults expressed their desire to live somewhere else in 2023, the highest rate in the world, according to a Gallup survey published in October last year.",
      "For many, phone calls blur the distance and offer comfort.",
      "\u201cNo matter how busy my schedule is, I must call my people every weekend, even if that\u2019s the only call I have to make,\u201d Agbo says.",
      "In Africa, where only 37% of the population had internet access in 2023, according to the International Telecommunication Union, regular mobile calls are the only option many have. In northern Nigeria\u2019s Zamfara state, Abdulmalik Saidu says the mobile connectivity rate is so low that \u201csometimes we stay for weeks without network.\u201d",
      "When 19-year-old Shamsu Deen-Cole flew from Sierra Leone to the United States to study international relations in 1971, making a call to his parents in Sierra Leone would take days, starting with telling his parents when to expect the call. Calls would cost around $150 for under 10 minutes. \u201cThere was no time for extra talks or complimentary because it would all add up in cost,\u201d recalls Deen-Cole, 73.",
      "Tabane Ciss\u00e9, who moved from Senegal to Spain in 2023, makes phone calls about investing Spanish earnings at home. Otherwise, it\u2019s all texts, or voice notes, with one exception.",
      "His mother doesn\u2019t read or write, but when he calls \u201cit\u2019s as if I was standing next to her,\u201d Ciss\u00e9 says. \u201cIt brings back memories \u2014 such pleasure.\u201d",

      "The U.S. government is preparing to breed billions of flies and drop them from airplanes over Mexico and even southern Texas",
      "TOPEKA, Kan. -- The U.S. government is preparing to breed billions of flies and dump them out of airplanes over Mexico and southern Texas to fight a flesh-eating maggot.",
      "That sounds like the plot of a horror movie, but it is part of the government's plans for protecting the U.S. from a bug that could devastate its beef industry, decimate wildlife and even kill household pets. This weird science has worked well before.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an exceptionally good technology,\u201d said Edwin Burgess, an assistant professor at the University of Florida who studies parasites in animals, particularly livestock. \u201cIt\u2019s an all-time great in terms of translating science to solve some kind of large problem.\u201d",
      "The targeted pest is the flesh-eating larva of the New World Screwworm fly. The U.S. Department of Agriculture plans to ramp up the breeding and distribution of adult male flies \u2014 sterilizing them with radiation before releasing them \u2014 so they can mate ineffectively with females and over time cause the population to die out.",
      "It is more effective and environmentally friendly than spraying the pest into oblivion, and it is how the U.S. and other nations north of Panama eradicated the same pest decades ago. Sterile flies from a factory in Panama kept the flies contained there for years, but the pest appeared in southern Mexico late last year.",
      "The USDA expects a new screwworm fly factory to be up and running in southern Mexico by July 2026. It plans to open a fly distribution center in southern Texas by the end of the year so that it can import and distribute flies from Panama if necessary.",
      "Most fly larvae feed on dead flesh, making the New World screwworm fly and its Old World counterpart in Asia and Africa outliers \u2014 and for the American beef industry, a serious threat. Females lay their eggs in wounds and, sometimes, exposed mucus.",
      "\u201cA thousand-pound bovine can be dead from this in two weeks,\u201d said Michael Bailey, president elect of the American Veterinary Medicine Association.",
      "Veterinarians have effective treatments for infested animals, but an infestation can still be unpleasant \u2014 and cripple an animal with pain.",
      "Don Hineman, a retired western Kansas rancher, recalled infected cattle as a youngster on his family's farm.",
      "\u201cIt smelled nasty,\u201d he said. \u201cLike rotting meat.\u201d",
      "The New World screwworm fly is a tropical species, unable to survive Midwestern or Great Plains winters, so it was a seasonal scourge. Still, the U.S. and Mexico bred and released more than 94 billion sterile flies from 1962 through 1975 to eradicate the pest, according to the USDA.",
      "The numbers need to be large enough that females in the wild can't help but hook up with sterile males for mating.",
      "One biological trait gives fly fighters a crucial wing up: Females mate only once in their weekslong adult lives.",
      "Alarmed about the fly's migration north, the U.S. temporarily closed its southern border in May to imports of live cattle, horses and bison and it won't be fully open again at least until mid-September.",
      "But female flies can lay their eggs in wounds on any warm-blooded animal, and that includes humans.",
      "Decades ago, the U.S. had fly factories in Florida and Texas, but they closed as the pest was eradicated.",
      "The Panama fly factory can breed up to 117 million a week, but the USDA wants the capacity to breed at least 400 million a week. It plans to spend $8.5 million on the Texas site and $21 million to convert a facility in southern Mexico for breeding sterile fruit flies into one for screwworm flies.",
      "In one sense, raising a large colony of flies is relatively easy, said Cassandra Olds, an assistant professor of entomology at Kansas State University.",
      "But, she added, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to give the female the cues that she needs to lay her eggs, and then the larvae have to have enough nutrients.\"",
      "Fly factories once fed larvae horse meat and honey and then moved to a mix of dried eggs and either honey or molasses, according to past USDA research. Later, the Panama factory used a mix that included egg powder and red blood cells and plasma from cattle.",
      "In the wild, larvae ready for the equivalent of a butterfly\u2019s cocoon stage drop off their hosts and onto the ground, burrow just below the surface and grow to adulthood inside a protective casing making them resemble a dark brown Tic Tac mint. In the Panama factory, workers drop them into trays of sawdust.",
      "Security is an issue. Sonja Swiger, an entomologist with Texas A&M University\u2019s Extension Service, said a breeding facility must prevent any fertile adults kept for breeding stock from escaping.",
      "Dropping flies from the air can be dangerous. Last month, a plane freeing sterile flies crashed near Mexico\u2019s border with Guatemala, killing three people.",
      "In test runs in the 1950s, according to the USDA, scientists put the flies in paper cups and then dropped the cups out of planes using special chutes. Later, they loaded them into boxes with a machine known as a \u201cWhiz Packer.\u201d",
      "The method is still much the same: Light planes with crates of flies drop those crates.",
      "Burgess called the development of sterile fly breeding and distribution in the 1950s and 1960s one of the USDA\u2019s \u201ccrowning achievements.\u201d",
      "Some agriculture officials argue now that new factories shouldn\u2019t be shuttered after another successful fight.",
      "\u201cSomething we think we have complete control over \u2014 and we have declared a triumph and victory over \u2014 can always rear its ugly head again,\u201d Burgess said.",

Maria Cantwell of Washington on Monday night to introduce an amendment to strike the entire proposal. Voting on the amendment happened after 4 a.m. Tuesday as part of an overnight session as Republican leaders sought to secure support for the tax cut bill while fending off other proposed amendments, mostly from Democrats trying to defeat the package.",

      "NOAA \u2014 which has been the subject of hefty Department of Government Efficiency cuts this year \u2014 said Friday the satellite program accounts for a \u201csingle dataset in a robust suite of hurricane forecasting and modeling tools\u201d in the National Weather Service's portfolio.",

      "Giving Funds is GoFundMe\u2019s latest in a flurry of product rollouts with the purported goal of moving stagnant U.S. charitable contributions beyond the 2% GDP mark where totals have long hovered",
      "NEW YORK -- GoFundMe CEO Tim Cadogan had some complications while fundraising on his own website last fall.",
      "Several friends wanted to help Cadogan reach his $28,000 goal as he crowdfunded for a Los Angeles area wilderness rescue team. But they tried to donate through a lesser-known wealth management tool called a donor-advised fund, or a DAF, a no-frills investing vehicle for money earmarked as eventual charitable gifts. After cutting checks and waiting three weeks, Cadogan said, the money finally arrived.",
      "\u201cIt was just a bit of a thing,\u201d he added. \"If they were using a Giving Fund, it would take ten seconds.\u201d",
      "Giving Funds are GoFundMe's latest in a flurry of product rollouts with the purported goal of moving stagnant U.S. charitable contributions beyond the 2% GDP mark where totals have long hovered. But the for-profit company's DAF, announced Monday, enters a crowded market of more than a thousand providers \u2014 products often with older, wealthier clienteles that are often criticized for warehousing gifts.",
      "To transform the way that everyday users plan their donations, Cadogan will have to widen the appeal of DAFs beyond the likes of the technology entrepreneur's circles. And he wants to change public perceptions of his company as just a crowdfunding site.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re also hopeful that more people will start using GoFundMe for a broader set of things in their lives: not just that one fundraiser they\u2019re supporting, not just that one nonprofit. But they\u2019re coming in and they\u2019re managing their giving portfolio with us and through us,\u201d Cadogan said. \u201cThat connects directly to our mission, which is we want to help people help each other.\u201d",
      "Donor-advised funds grew popular over the last decade among ultra-high net worth individuals as a tax-efficient instrument for grantmaking without the hassle of a more sophisticated charitable foundation. Donors can immediately write the contribution off on their taxes but face no deadline for giving the money to a nonprofit.",
      "The idea: account holders could invest money they wanted to ultimately donate, let the funds grow tax-free while they sit and give themselves time to identify the recipients best aligned with their giving goals.",
      "There's since been a rush to court average givers. Legacy financial services firms such as Fidelity Charitable lowered the minimums to open accounts. Fintech startups such as Daffy contrast their flat fees with the hidden expenses they allege their competitors charge. All that traction brought IRS proposals last year to impose penalties on those who abuse DAFs and Congress has considered legislation that would require some deadlines for disbursements.",
      "GoFundMe's Giving Funds will have no minimum balances, zero management fees and donations starting at $5. Users can load their DAF through their bank accounts or direct deposits for free. Credit card payments will be covered through the end of the year and then face the company's standard transaction fee of 2.2% plus 30 cents. Contributions can then be invested in a choice of exchange traded funds from managers including Vanguard, Blackrock and State Street Global Advisors.",
      "Cadogan pitches Giving Funds as a way to be more intentional about giving \u2014 something he said user feedback suggests more people want. As he sees it, widespread adoption hasn't occurred because DAFs have been framed as \u201cwealth management products.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a giving product,\u201d Cadogan said. \u201cIt\u2019s something for everybody. And you don\u2019t need to know the words \u2018donor advised fund.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t show up.\u201d",
      "DAFs remain scrutinized for allowing donors to reap tax benefits before they ever redistribute any money to charitable causes \u2014 even if the notion that the channel is being exploited is fiercely debated in the nonprofit sector. Opaque disclosure requirements make it difficult to put a number on the overall assets held within the funds. The National Philanthropic Trust placed the total at more than $250 billion in 2023.",
      "Cadogan believes GoFundMe's culture is uniquely suited to nudge users with targeted spotlights of the 1.5 million charities already active on the platform. Giving Funds holders will be peppered with information about local nonprofits, crisis responders, their friends' charities of choice and potential beneficiaries that address their selected issue areas.",
      "That \u201cdynamic, alive community\u201d is very different from the \u201cfairly static, passive\u201d financial vehicles in the current market, according to Cadogan.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s essentially inspiring the money to move,\u201d he said.",
      "Other features seek to encourage contributions by simplifying things. Users can set annual giving goals by a percentage of their income or a fixed number. Their gifts will tally up in real-time records to track their progress and ease year-end tax planning.",
      "Streamlining the process was one area for improvement identified in the DAF Research Collaborative's recent survey of more than 2,100 donors. But Jeff Williams, one of the researchers, said DAFs are currently hitting the \u201csweet spot of convenience and connection to nonprofits.\u201d",
      "The challenge for any new player, he said, is that it's a competitive environment with many different options. Plus, he added, many DAFs already are \u201cavailable-to-everyone vehicles\" considering that half run balances under $50,000.",
      "\u201cGivers are voting with their feet that DAFs are increasing with popularity. More options are generally better,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAnything that makes sure we maintain or enhance the ease of giving, it makes me happier.\u201d",
      "But Direct Relief CEO Amy Weaver, previously the CFO at Salesforce, described GoFundMe's entrance as \u201ca game changer\u201d that could unlock additional funds. Direct Relief, a nonprofit that supplies free medical resources worldwide, reported receiving more than 18,000 DAF gifts totaling $116 million over the past five years.",
      "Weaver acknowledged DAFs have been traditionally used by those with more substantial wealth. But she encouraged people to view them as a \u201csavings account\" for \"good works.\"",
      "\u201cAnd GoFundMe, with its name familiarity and the fact that it really attracts people making smaller gifts, I think could be incredibly powerful if they can bring DAFs to that group of people,\u201d she said.",

      "Four teams of humanoid robots faced off in fully autonomous 3-on-3 soccer matches powered entirely by artificial intelligence on Saturday night in China's capital in what was touted as a first in China and a preview for the upcoming World Humanoid Robot Games, set to take place in Beijing.",
      "According to the organizers, a key aspect of the match was that all the participating robots operated fully autonomously using AI-driven strategies without any human intervention or supervision.",
      "Equipped with advanced visual sensors, the robots were able to identify the ball and navigate the field with agility",
      "They were also designed to stand up on their own after falling. However, during the match several still had to be carried off the field on stretchers by staff, adding to the realism of the experience.",
      "China is stepping up efforts to develop AI-powered humanoid robots, using sports competitions like marathons, boxing, and football as a real-world proving ground.",
      "Cheng Hao, founder and CEO of Booster Robotics, the company that supplied the robot players, said sports competitions offer the ideal testing ground for humanoid robots, helping to accelerate the development of both algorithms and integrated hardware-software systems.",
      "He also emphasized safety as a core concern in the application of humanoid robots.",
      "\u201cIn the future, we may arrange for robots to play football with humans.

      "Booster Robotics provided the hardware for all four university teams, while each school\u2019s research team developed and embedded their own algorithms for perception, decision-making, player formations, and passing strategies\u2014including variables such as speed, force, and direction, according to Cheng.",

      "A tech industry trade group has sued Arkansas over two new law placing limits on content on social media platforms",
      "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- A tech industry trade group sued Arkansas Friday over two new laws that would place limits on content on social media platforms and would allow parents of children who killed themselves to sue over content on the platforms.",
      "The lawsuit by NetChoice filed in federal court in Fayetteville, Arkansas, comes months after a federal judge struck down a state law requiring parental consent before minors can create new social media accounts. The new laws were signed by Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders earlier this year.",
      "\u201cDespite the overwhelming consensus that laws like the Social Media Safety Act are unconstitutional, Arkansas elected to respond to this Court\u2019s decision not by repealing the provisions that it held unconstitutional but by instead doubling down on its overreach,\u201d NetChoice said in its lawsuit.",
      "Arkansas is among several states that have been enacting restrictions on social media, prompted by concerns about the impact on children's mental health. NetChoice \u2014 whose members include TikTok, Facebook parent Meta, and the social platform X \u2014 challenged Arkansas' 2023 age-verification law for social media. A federal judge who initially blocked the law struck it down in March.",
      "Similar laws have been blocked by judges in Florida and Georgia.",
      "A spokesperson for Attorney General Tim Griffin said his office was reviewing the latest complaint and looked forward to defending the law.",
      "One of the new laws being challenged prohibits social media platforms from using a design, algorithm or feature it \u201cknows or should have known through the exercise of reasonable care\u201d would cause a user to kill themself, purchase a controlled substance, develop an eating disorder, develop an addiction to the platform.",
      "The lawsuit said that provision is unconstitutionally vague and doesn't offer guidance on how to determine which content would violate those restrictions, and the suit notes it would restrict content for both adults and minors. The suit questions whether songs that mention drugs, such as Afroman's \u201cBecause I Got High,\u201d would be prohibited under the new law.",
      "The law being challenged also would allow parents whose children have died by suicide or attempted to take their lives to sue social media companies if they were exposed to content promoting or advancing self-harm and suicide. The companies could face civil penalties of up to $10,000 per violation.",
      "NetChoice is also challenging another law that attempts to expand Arkansas' blocked restrictions on social media companies. That measure would require social media platforms to ensure minors don't receive notifications between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.",
      "The measure also would require social media companies to ensure their platform \u201cdoes not engage in practices to evoke any addiction or compulsive behavior.\u201d The suit argues that the law doesn't explain how to comply with that restriction and is so broadly written that it's unclear what kind of posts or material would violate it.",
      "\u201cWhat is \u2018addictive\u2019 to some minors may not be addictive to others. Does allowing teens to share photos with each other evoke addiction?\u201d the lawsuit said.",

      "In the time before widespread vaccination, young children often lost their lives to devastating infectious diseases that ran rampant in America",
      "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. -- In the time before widespread vaccination, death often came early.",
      "Devastating infectious diseases ran rampant in America, killing millions of children and leaving others with lifelong health problems. These illnesses were the main reason why nearly one in five children in 1900 never made it to their fifth birthday.",
      "Over the next century, vaccines virtually wiped out long-feared scourges like polio and measles and drastically reduced the toll of many others. Today, however, some preventable, contagious diseases are making a comeback as vaccine hesitancy pushes immunization rates down. And well-established vaccines are facing suspicion even from public officials, with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist, running the federal health department.",
      "\u201cThis concern, this hesitancy, these questions about vaccines are a consequence of the great success of the vaccines \u2013 because they eliminated the diseases,\u201d said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. \u201cIf you\u2019re not familiar with the disease, you don\u2019t respect or even fear it. And therefore you don\u2019t value the vaccine.\u201d",
      "Anti-vaccine activists even portray the shots as a threat, focusing on the rare risk of side effects while ignoring the far larger risks posed by the diseases themselves \u2014 and years of real-world data that experts say proves the vaccines are safe.",
      "Some Americans know the reality of these preventable diseases all too well. For them, news of measles outbreaks and rising whooping cough cases brings back terrible memories of lives forever changed \u2013 and a longing to spare others from similar pain.",
      "With a mother\u2019s practiced, guiding hand, 80-year-old Janith Farnham helped steer her 60-year-old daughter\u2019s walker through a Sioux Falls art center. They stopped at a painting of a cow wearing a hat.",
      "Janith pointed to the hat, then to her daughter Jacque\u2019s Minnesota Twins cap. Jacque did the same.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s so funny!\u201d Janith said, leaning in close to say the words in sign language too.",
      "Jacque was born with congenital rubella syndrome, which can cause a host of issues including hearing impairment, eye problems, heart defects and intellectual disabilities. There was no vaccine against rubella back then, and Janith contracted the viral illness very early in the pregnancy, when she had up to a 90% chance of giving birth to a baby with the syndrome.",
      "Janith recalled knowing \u201cthings weren\u2019t right\u201d almost immediately. The baby wouldn\u2019t respond to sounds or look at anything but lights. She didn\u2019t like to be held close. Her tiny heart sounded like it purred \u2013 evidence of a problem that required surgery at four months old.",
      "Janith did all she could to help Jacque thrive, sending her to the Colorado School for the Deaf and the Blind and using skills she honed as a special education teacher. She and other parents of children with the syndrome shared insights in a support group.",
      "Meanwhile, the condition kept taking its toll. As a young adult, Jacque developed diabetes, glaucoma and autistic behaviors. Eventually, arthritis set in.",
      "Today, Jacque lives in an adult residential home a short drive from Janith's place. Above her bed is a net overflowing with stuffed animals. On a headboard shelf are photo books Janith created, filled with memories like birthday parties and trips to Mount Rushmore.",
      "Jacque\u2019s days typically begin with an insulin shot and breakfast before she heads off to a day program. She gets together with her mom four or five days a week. They often hang out at Janith\u2019s townhome, where Jacque has another bedroom decorated with her own artwork and quilts Janith sewed for her. Jacque loves playing with Janith\u2019s dog, watching sports on television and looking up things on her iPad.",
      "Janith marvels at Jacque\u2019s sense of humor, gratefulness, curiosity and affectionate nature despite all she\u2019s endured. Jacque is generous with kisses and often signs \u201cdouble I love yous\u201d to family, friends and new people she meets.",
      "\u201cWhen you live through so much pain and so much difficulty and so much challenge, sometimes I think: Well, she doesn\u2019t know any different,\u201d Janith said.",
      "Given what her family has been through, Janith believes younger people are being selfish if they choose not to get their children the MMR shot against measles, mumps and rubella.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s more than frustrating. I mean, I get angry inside,\u201d she said. \u201cI know what can happen, and I just don\u2019t want anybody else to go through this.\u201d",
      "More than half a century has passed, but Patricia Tobin still vividly recalls getting home from work, opening the car door and hearing her mother scream. Inside the house, her little sister Karen lay unconscious on the bathroom floor.",
      "It was 1970, and Karen was 6. She\u2019d contracted measles shortly after Easter. While an early vaccine was available, it wasn\u2019t required for school in Miami where they lived. Karen\u2019s doctor discussed immunizing the first grader, but their mother didn't share his sense of urgency.",
      "\u201cIt's not that she was against it,\" Tobin said. \"She just thought there was time.\u201d",
      "Then came a measles outbreak. Karen \u2013 who Tobin described as a \u201cvery endearing, sweet child\u201d who would walk around the house singing \u2013 quickly became very sick. The afternoon she collapsed in the bathroom, Tobin, then 19, called the ambulance. Karen never regained consciousness.",
      "\u201cShe immediately went into a coma and she died of encephalitis,\u201d said Tobin, who stayed at her bedside in the hospital. \u201cWe never did get to speak to her again.\u201d",
      "Today, all states require that children get certain vaccines to attend school. But a growing number of people are making use of exemptions allowed for medical, religious or philosophical reasons. Vanderbilt\u2019s Schaffner said fading memories of measles outbreaks were exacerbated by a fraudulent, retracted study claiming a link between the MMR shot and autism.",
      "The result? Most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners \u2014 the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very upset by how cavalier people are being about the measles,\u201d Tobin said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that they realize how destructive this is.\u201d",
      "One of Lora Duguay\u2019s earliest memories is lying in a hospital isolation ward with her feverish, paralyzed body packed in ice. She was three years old.",
      "\u201cI could only see my parents through a glass window. They were crying and I was screaming my head off,\u201d said Duguay, 68. \u201cThey told my parents I would never walk or move again.\u201d",
      "It was 1959 and Duguay, of Clearwater, Florida, had polio. It mostly preyed on children and was one of the most feared diseases in the U.S., experts say, causing some terrified parents to keep children inside and avoid crowds during epidemics.",
      "Given polio's visibility, the vaccine against it was widely and enthusiastically welcomed. But the early vaccine that Duguay got was only about 80% to 90% effective. Not enough people were vaccinated or protected yet to stop the virus from spreading.",

    "story": [
      "Ticks can be active in any season and experts say it\u2019s important to check for and remove the bloodsuckers as quickly as possible",
      "WASHINGTON -- Ticks can be active in any season and it's important to check for and remove the bloodsuckers as quickly as possible \u2014 especially after you've been outside hiking, gardening or enjoying nature.",
      "\u201cHumans are outside more in summer so we hear about more tick infections,\u201d said Sam Telford, an infectious diseases expert at Tufts University. But he urges caution year-round because \u201cevery season is tick season.\u201d",
      "While tick populations vary a lot regionally, some Northeastern states including Maine, Massachusetts and Rhode Island are seeing \u201cabove average\u201d numbers of American dog ticks this year, said Telford.",
      "And New York state is seeing a higher number of reported deer tick bites this year than last year, said Saravanan Thangamani, who studies tick-borne diseases at SUNY Upstate Medical University.",
      "Ticks, like mosquitos, need to feed on blood. But instead of a quick prick, they are slow feeders \u2013 with hooked mouth parts that attach into the skin of deer, rabbits, dogs and people.",
      "There are many different species of ticks found globally and only some spread germs that can make people sick. A main worry is blacklegged ticks, also called deer ticks, which can spread Lyme disease. Once found mainly in New England and pockets of the Midwest, the ticks are now present over a wider range.",
      "A tick bite doesn't always lead to illness. \u201cIf you remove a tick within 24 hours of attachment, it\u2019s fairly unlikely that you will get infected,\u201d said Telford.",
      "Ticks are usually found low to the ground, in leaf litter or grassy areas.",
      "Check your clothing for ticks and do a full-body check including under the arms and behind ears, knees and hair.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re out all day long, try to do a quick check for ticks every few hours,\u201d said Bobbi Pritt at the Mayo Clinic. \u201cWhen you go back inside, take a shower. That will wash off any unattached ticks, and you\u2019re also more likely to spot any other ticks.\"",
      "Use tweezers to remove the tick and grasp it as close to the skin as possible to pull from the head. If you don\u2019t have them handy, you can also use your fingernails, the edge of a credit card or any semi-sharp object.",
      "The best approach is to minimize tick exposure altogether.",
      "Bug sprays containing ingredients such as DEET can be sprayed on exposed skin to ward off ticks and mosquitos, said Telford.",
      "Wear long sleeves and pants, and you can also spray clothing with repellents containing permethrin, a chemical similar to a natural ingredient in chrysanthemums that makes ticks avoid the flowers.",
      "Don\u2019t forget to pay attention to outdoor pets. Medications can prevent fleas and ticks from attaching to a dog's skin. But it\u2019s still a good idea to check the fur after being outside.",
      "\u201cWherever pets can\u2019t easily groom themselves, that\u2019s where the ticks will be \u2013 on the ears, around the muzzle area, under the collar, between the toes,\u201d said Thangamani.",
      "Dogs and cats roaming outdoors can also bring ticks into the house.",
      "\u201cIf pets bring ticks in, a tick can live in the house for months until it finds its next blood meal,\u201d which could be another household member, he said.",
      "After removing the tick, keep an eye on the skin around the bite. If a rash or flu-like symptoms appear within several days or weeks, see a doctor.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend tick testing because results may not be reliable.",

      "LONDON -- Apple has revamped its app store policies in the European Union with hopes of fending off escalating fines under the 27-nation bloc's digital competition regulations.",
      "It's a last-minute bid by the iPhone maker to avoid further charges following a 500 million euro ($585 million) penalty in April. The bloc's executive Commission punished Apple for preventing app makers from pointing users to cheaper options outside its App Store, and gave it a 60-day deadline, which expired Thursday, to avoid additional, periodic fines.",
      "The changes made by Apple will make it easier for app makers to point users to better deals on digital products and options to pay for them outside of Apple's own App Store, including other websites, apps or alternative app stores.",
      "The California company is also rolling out a two-tier system of fees to accommodate app developers that want to use alternative payments.",
      "\u201cThe European Commission is requiring Apple to make a series of additional changes to the App Store,\" Apple said in a statement. \"We disagree with this outcome and plan to appeal.\u201d",
      "The commission noted Apple\u2019s announcement and \u201cwill now assess these new business terms for DMA compliance,\u201d referring to the EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act. The rulebook was designed to rein in the power of big tech companies under threat of hefty fines worth up to 10% of a company's global annual revenue.",
      "Among the DMA\u2019s provisions are requirements that developers inform customers of cheaper purchasing options, and direct them to those offers.",
      "Apple's restrictions preventing developers from steering users to outside payment channels had been fiercely opposed by some companies. It's the reason, for example, Spotify removed the in-app payment option to avoid having to pay a commission of up to 30% on digital subscriptions bought through iOS.",

It has paid for more than 1 billion children to be vaccinated through routine immunization programs, saving an estimated 18 million lives. The United States has long been one of its biggest supporters; before Donald Trump\u2019s re-election, the country had pledged $1 billion through 2030.",

      "Some observational studies have shown that vaccinated girls do have a higher death rate compared to unvaccinated children, but there is no evidence the deaths are caused by the vaccine.",
      "Gavi said in a statement Thursday that its \u201cutmost concern is the health and safety of children.\u201d The organization said any decision it makes on vaccines to buy is done in accordance with recommendations issued by WHO's expert vaccine group.",

      "Yet the candidate atop North Carolina Democrats' wish list is their former governor, Roy Cooper. A spokesperson for Cooper told ABC News he's strongly considering a run and will announce his decision \"in the coming weeks.\"",
      "Anderson Clayton, the chair of the North Carolina Democratic Party, told ABC News in an interview Monday that as she has been \"going around the state and going around all my different counties, what I've heard the most from folks is that they would love to see Governor Cooper get in this race.\"",
      "But Clayton, even as she praised Cooper's strong approval ratings and the desire among many for him to run, pointed to a \"bench\" of others she said were strong candidates, including Nickel and Lt. Gov. Rachel Hunt. A spokesperson for Hunt's lieutenant governor campaign told ABC News that Hunt believes Cooper will run but that \"if the field shifts, she'll give it thoughtful consideration.\"",
      "Clayton said she believes Democrats will handily flip the seat no matter who is on the ticket.",
      "\"I think that the Republican Party is running away from Thom Tillis, which is what we saw from the announcement [Sunday] ... We immediately saw the president deciding that he was going to find a primary challenger for Tillis. And I think it shows that North Carolina Democrats are in a prime position to be able to take this seat, especially now that it's an open seat,\" she said.",
      "She said the party had also seen an influx in donations and volunteers since Tillis announced his retirement.",
      "Cooper would be \"a real powerhouse\" if he decided to enter the race, Davidson College political science professor Susan Roberts told ABC News. She contrasted Cooper with the progressive New York Assembly member Zohran Mamdani, the presumptive Democratic primary nominee for mayor of New York City.",
      "\"[Cooper] may not be the shiniest object [or] have the campaign that helped Mamdani in the New York mayor's primary, he may not have that shiny social media presence, but I think he has the gravitas to be a good candidate, and I think he would know how to govern,\" Roberts said.",
      "Mac McCorkle, a professor at Duke University's Sanford School of Public Policy, said Lara Trump's powerful name recognition could clear the Republican primary field.",
      "\"The other Republicans who were thinking about it are kind of no-names,\" McCorkle said. \"I think it's Lara Trump's to refuse.\"",
      "He said while less-known candidates might need to take positions heavily to the right to win over \"the MAGA base\" in the primary, Lara Trump's connection to President Trump could help her gain support without having to do so, making her more appealing to moderate voters later on in the general election.",
      "On the other hand, Jason Roberts, a political science professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, saw Lara Trump's family connection to the president as a potential disadvantage.",
      "\"Midterm elections typically don't go well for the president's party, because the out-party is fired up. The in-party typically doesn't have as high a turnout,\" Roberts said. \"What successful presidential party candidates do in a midterm is they try to distinguish themselves from that president. And if you're running a candidate whose last name is Trump, that's going to be really, really difficult to do.\"",

      "The State Department is taking over programs previously run by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in a move officials say will restructure U.S. foreign assistance and reorient it toward national interests, as a new study finds the cuts could contribute to millions of deaths by 2030.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced in a post on Substack on Tuesday that USAID -- which oversaw foreign aid, disaster relief and international development programs -- would no longer be providing assistance to other countries.",
      "\"As of July 1st, USAID will officially cease to implement foreign assistance,\" Rubio wrote. \"Foreign assistance programs that align with administration policies -- and which advance American interests -- will be administered by the State Department, where they will be delivered with more accountability, strategy, and efficiency.\"",
      "A senior official at the State Department, who briefed reporters on Tuesday, said the \"U.S. foreign assistance policy\" would aim to be \"linked up diplomatically\" with the foreign policy agenda of the Trump administration and U.S. partners.",
      "\"Once we get through this transition and the programs are over here, I think the next few months are going to help indicate where we think our vision of the future is,\" the official said. \"We do not foresee a gap operationally.\"",
      "The foreign aid agency was among the first government agencies the Department of Government Efficiency, formerly run by Elon Musk, slashed in its effort to scale back the size of the federal government.",
      "The Trump administration sought to dismantle USAID, terminating thousands of contracts and placing workers on leave.",
      "In a statement in February, the State Department said \"significant portions of USAID funding are not aligned with the core national interests of the United States.\"",
      "In recorded farewell remarks shared privately with USAID staff on Monday, former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama criticized the decision to gut the agency.",
      "Obama calling the dismantling of USAID a tragedy and a \"colossal mistake,\" according to The Associated Press, which reviewed portions of the video. Bush focused on PEPFAR -- the global health initiative launched under his administration to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic -- which is credited for saving 25 million lives, the AP reported.",
      "Humanitarian aid organizations said they have been witnessing the effects of USAID cuts, with programs shutting down that helped communities experiencing poverty and conflict.",
      "\"It's an extremely sad day,\" Bob Kitchen, vice president of emergency and humanitarian action with the International Rescue Committee (IRC), told ABC News. \"I had the pleasure of working with hundreds of committed USAID staff around the world over the last couple of decades. They've done amazing work and funded amazing projects, and it's sad to see like that'll come predominantly to an end.\"",
      "Kitchen said IRC has lost several of its grants and that 40% of its funding came from USAID. As a result, he said several IRC programs are now closed or will soon close, including water and sanitation programs, mobile health clinics and school programs.",
      "\"What that looks like \u2026 is many thousands of girls who no longer can go to any form of school [In Afghanistan] as a result of the closure of this program,\" Kitchen said. \"The one that really hits me is we have somehow found ways to keep thousands of girls going to school, informal schools, underground schools. That has all stopped.\"",
      "USAID's closure comes amid a study published in The Lancet on Monday that found cuts to USAID could cause more than 14 million additional deaths by 2030.",
      "Using models, the authors estimated the impact of USAID funding on deaths from 2001 to 2021. The team then used models to estimate effects up to five years from now.",
      "The study found that more than 91 million deaths were prevented by USAID funding to low-income and middle-income countries over the 21-year study period, including a 65% reduction in mortality from HIV/AIDS and a 51% reduction from malaria.",
      "Forecasting models not only predicted millions of additional deaths due to the steep cuts, but also that one-third of those deaths are projected to occur in children younger than age 5.",
      "The State Department official said such studies \"misapprehend\" the administration's new vision for foreign assistance and that reported life-and-death impacts \"is not what we're hearing on the ground.\"",
      "\"You can go back and relitigate all these little decisions. That's not our focus,\" the official said. \"That's not the secretary's focus. We are excited about what sort of the 'America First' foreign assistance agenda is going to look like, and how much impact we can have moving forward.\"",
      "The official said the new strategy would, for example, expect partners to take on more prevention work for patients with HIV infections and reduce their reliance on U.S.-funded programs for preventive health care.",
      "They noted that up to 90% of direct beneficiaries are receiving their medication under PEPFAR to date. There will be more investment in ending mother-to-child HIV transmission, the official said.",
      "\"The administration has a target of ending mother-child transmission by the time that President Trump leaves office, and we think that we can meet that and we're going to invest more in that particular space,\" the official said.",

      "Gathered on the Senate floor after a 26-hour, record-breaking vote-a-rama series, senators voted hastily on two final Republican-led amendments before getting to the main event: final passage of President Donald Trump's \"big, beautiful bill.\"",
      "Vice President JD Vance was presiding over the chamber after breaking a tie on a previously considered wraparound amendment to the bill. It was assumed that he would soon break another tie on the bill's final passage, with a number of Republican holdouts remaining to make the vote math still uncertain.",
      "It was just a matter of who would be the third \"no\" vote Republicans could afford to lose and still pass the bill. Sens. Thom Tillis and Rand Paul had already committed to voting it down.",
      "Sen. Lisa Murkowski was widely thought to be the last opponent, with a temporary SNAP carveout for her state of Alaska hanging in the balance down until the last minute.",
      "When the final vote started, Murkowski was seated in the second row near the middle of the chamber. Next to her was Mississippi GOP Sen. Roger Wicker and next to him was another moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who eventually proved to be the third and final GOP \"no\" vote.",
      "Collins, dressed in a hot-pink pantsuit, votes near the top of the alphabet. But she left near the beginning of the vote's final passage to go to the cloakroom. She missed her chance to vote when her name was called, coming out shortly after and walking directly to Murkowski. Collins put her arm around Murkowski, and then went up to the clerk and put her thumb down: no. She then left the chamber.",
      "Focus was then squarely on Murkowski, whose vote could have tanked the entire bill. But former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell came up to sit next to her. The two talked quietly and then shook hands. When her name was called, Murkowski quietly said \"Aye.\"",
      "Senators had added additional sweeteners for her state, including a provision aimed at insulating Alaska from some of the bill\u2019s harshest impacts on SNAP.",
      "She then started to leave the chamber, shaking hands with GOP Sens. Jerry Moran of Kansas and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana before exiting.",
      "Afterward, Murkowski told ABC News' she \u201cstruggled mightily with the [bill\u2019s] impact on the most vulnerable in this country.\u201d",
      "\"I needed help, and I worked to get that every single day. And did I get everything that I wanted? Absolutely not,\u201d she added.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune didn't speak to either woman after their votes. He was seated in his chair in the front of the chamber.",
      "Collins later explained her vote in a statement: \"My vote against this bill stems primarily from the harmful impact it will have on Medicaid, affecting low-income families and rural health care providers like our hospitals and nursing homes.\"",
      "She also said she had problems with cuts to energy tax credits and that the rural hospital relief fund that was created to try to get Republican holdouts to vote for the bill was insufficient.",
      "The drama wasn't over after the final vote -- Murkowski appeared exasperated when asked about Paul's criticism over her vote and what deals Alaska might have benefitted from.",
      "When asked by an NBC reporter about Paul saying Alaska had gotten a bailout for her vote at the expense of the country, Murkowski replied, \"Oh my God.\"",

      "\u201cMy response is I have an obligation to the people of the state of Alaska, and I live up to that every single day. I fight for my state's interests, and I make sure that Alaskans are understood. I work hard to take care of a state that has more unique situations, more unique people, and it's just different,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cAnd so when people suggest that federal dollars go to one of our 50 states in a, quote, \"bailout,\" I find that offensive,\" she went on. \"I advocated my state's interests. I will continue to do that, and I will make no excuses for doing that.\u201d",

      "The Wisconsin Supreme Court has struck down the state\u2019s 176-year-old abortion ban",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- The Wisconsin Supreme Court\u2019s liberal majority struck down the state\u2019s 176-year-old abortion ban on Wednesday, ruling 4-3 that it was superseded by a newer state law that criminalizes abortions only after a fetus can survive outside the womb.",
      "State lawmakers adopted the ban in 1849, making it a felony when anyone other than the mother \u201cintentionally destroys the life of an unborn child.\u201d",
      "It was in effect until 1973, when the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s landmark Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion nationwide nullified it. Legislators never officially repealed the ban, however, and conservatives argued that the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 2022 decision to overturn Roe reactivated it.",
      "Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul, a Democrat, filed a lawsuit that year arguing that the ban was trumped by abortion restrictions legislators enacted during the nearly half-century that Roe was in effect. Kaul specifically cited a 1985 law that essentially permits abortions until viability. Some babies can survive with medical help after 21 weeks of gestation.",
      "Sheboygan County District Attorney Joel Urmanski, a Republican, defended the ban in court, arguing that the 1849 ban could coexist with the newer abortion restrictions, just as different penalties for the same crime coexist.",
      "Dane County Circuit Judge Diane Schlipper ruled in 2023 that the 1849 ban outlaws feticide \u2014 which she defined as the killing of a fetus without the mother\u2019s consent \u2014 but not consensual abortions. Abortions have been available in the state since that ruling but the state Supreme Court decision gives providers and patients more certainty that abortions will remain legal in Wisconsin.",
      "Urmanski asked the state Supreme Court to overturn Schlipper\u2019s ruling without waiting for a decision from a lower appellate court. It was expected as soon as the justices took the case that they would overturn the ban. Liberals hold a 4-3 majority on the court and one of them, Janet Protasiewicz, openly stated on the campaign trail that she supports abortion rights.",
      "Democratic-backed Susan Crawford defeated conservative Brad Schimel for an open seat on the court in April, ensuring liberals will maintain their 4-3 edge until at least 2028. Crawford has not been sworn in yet and was not part of Wednesday\u2019s ruling. She\u2019ll play pivotal role, though, in a separate Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin lawsuit challenging the 1849 ban\u2019s constitutionality. The high court decided last year to take that case. It\u2019s still pending.",

      "Group and solo travelers are trickling into Afghanistan by plane, motorbike, camper van and even on bicycles",
      "KABUL, Afghanistan -- By plane, motorbike, camper van and even on bicycles, tourists are beginning to discover Afghanistan, with solo travelers and tour groups gradually venturing into a country that until recently was wracked by war.",
      "And the country\u2019s Taliban government, which seized power more than three years ago but has yet to be formally recognized by any other nation, is more than happy to welcome them.",
      "\u201cThe Afghan people are warm and welcoming and wish to host tourists from other countries and engage with them,\u201d Deputy Minister of Tourism Qudratullah Jamal told The Associated Press in an early June interview. \u201cTourism brings many benefits to a country. We have considered those benefits and aim for our nation to take full advantage of them.\u201d",
      "Tourism is a vital, multi-billion-dollar industry for many countries.",
      "Afghanistan\u2019s isolation on the international stage, largely because of the Taliban\u2019s restrictions on women and girls, has left much of its 41 million people mired in poverty. As it struggles to attract foreign investment, the lucrative potential of tourism is far from lost on the government.",
      "\u201cWe are currently earning a considerable amount of revenue from this industry, and we are hopeful it will grow even more in the future,\u201d Jamal said, noting money spent by visitors can reach more layers of society than revenue from other industries. \u201cWe are optimistic this sector will evolve into a large economy, bringing significant benefits. It plays an important role in strengthening our national economy.\u201d",
      "Tourist visas are quick and easy to obtain and flights from major transit hubs such as Dubai and Istanbul operate several times a week. The government has even set up a training institute for men \u2014 and it is only for men \u2014 seeking jobs in the hospitality and tourism sector.",
      "While visitor numbers are still very much a trickle rather than a flood, they are increasing. Nearly 9,000 foreign tourists visited Afghanistan last year, while nearly 3,000 people visited in the first three months of this year, Jamal said.",
      "Four decades of near-continuous conflict kept nearly all vacationers away from this landlocked country of towering mountains, deep gorges and millennia of history.",
      "The Taliban\u2019s takeover from a U.S.-backed government in August 2021 stunned the world and sent thousands of Afghans fleeing. But with the insurgency over, the bloodshed from frequent bombings and suicide attacks all but ended too.",
      "Attacks still occur, however. An Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan remains active and gunmen killed six people, including three Spanish tourists, in a May 2024 attack in Bamiyan, one of the country\u2019s main tourist attractions where centuries-old giant Buddhas carved into the cliffs were blown up by the Taliban in 2001.",
      "While Western countries still advise against travel to Afghanistan, a drop in violence from the two decades of U.S.-led military presence is indisputable, as the government is keen to point out.",
      "\u201cAfghanistan has gone through many years of war and hardship. Now, we want tourists to come and see the true traditions and customs of Afghans, to understand Afghan life, creativity and resilience,\u201d Jamal said, noting there was \u201ccomprehensive security across Afghanistan.\u201d",
      "Critics question the ethics of foreigners visiting Afghanistan for pleasure when its government discriminates so heavily against half the country\u2019s population.",
      "Education beyond primary school level is banned for girls and women and few professions are open to them. Women cannot enter parks, gardens or gyms.",
      "Beauty salons are forbidden. Authorities dictate how women dress and have demanded they cover their faces in public, a decree still flouted by many, particularly in Kabul.",
      "Some visitors say they contemplated the ethics, but ultimately wanted to see the situation for themselves.",
      "French-Peruvian Illary Gomez said she and her British partner, James Liddiard, debated for about a year whether to drive through Afghanistan as part of their U.K.-to-Japan camper van journey.",
      "\u201cSome things didn\u2019t feel morally right,\u201d she said.",
      "But once here, they said they found a warm, hospitable and welcoming people and beautiful landscapes. They didn\u2019t feel their presence was any form of support for the Taliban.",
      "By traveling, \u201cyou put money in the hands of the people, not the government,\u201d Liddiard said.",
      "The treatment of women is particularly sensitive for government officials. Jamal declined to comment on the subject beyond saying male and female visitors were welcome.",
      "\u201cThose who respect our laws and traditions have already come and can continue to come,\u201d he said.",
      "While most restrictions are strictly enforced on Afghan women, they are far more relaxed for foreigners. Although they must still wear a headscarf in public, foreign women are more likely to gain entry into some restricted areas such as parks and are rarely asked to cover their faces in public.",
      "Opening the country to foreign visitors was also a way of building bridges, Jamal said.",
      "\u201cIt is a great way to promote interaction between the people of different countries. It helps build international relations and is also beneficial for trade,\u201d he told the AP. \u201cWhen foreigners come here, Afghans also learn a lot from them. In addition to expanding commerce, tourism also helps foster mutual understanding, cultural exchange and strengthens talents as people learn from one another.\u201d",
      "A foreign traveler seeing the country with his own eyes \u201ccreates closeness, builds connections and fosters trust among people,\u201d Jamal said. \u201cThey will respect each other\u2019s culture and the distance between peoples will diminish.",
      "\u201cSo this is not just economic development; it also brings spiritual and political benefits,\u201d he said.",

      "PHILADELPHIA -- A strike being staged by nearly 10,000 city workers in Philadelphia entered its second day Wednesday as a judge ordered some emergency service dispatchers and essential water department employees to return to work.",
      "Common Pleas Court Judge Sierra Thomas-Street granted the city an injunction Tuesday stating 237 out of 325 workers at the city's 911 call center must return to work because their absence creates a \u201cclear and present danger to threat to health, safety or welfare of the public.\" The order does not prevent those workers \u2014 32 fire dispatchers, five supervisors and 200 police dispatchers \u2014 from participating in the strike during off-duty hours.",
      "The judge also ordered some water department workers back to the job because they're essential to ensuring fresh, clean drinking water is available to residents.",
      "Seeking better pay and benefits, District Council 33 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees announced the strike early Tuesday, spurring nearly 10,000 blue-collar workers to walk off the job. During the day, the strikers waved signs at traffic near City Hall and formed picket lines outside libraries, city offices and other workplaces.",
      "Mayor Cherelle Parker has said the city would suspend residential trash collection, close some city pools and shorten recreation center hours, but vowed to keep the city running. Police and firefighters are not on strike.",
      "Parker, a pro-labor Democrat, promised that Fourth of July celebrations in the nation\u2019s birthplace would go on as usual.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, the mayor said the city had \u201cput its best offer on the table.\u201d The city offered raises that amount to 13% over her four-year term, including last year\u2019s 5% bump, and added a fifth step to the pay scale to align with other city unions, she said.",
      "District Council 33 is the largest of four major unions representing city workers. Union president Greg Boulware President Greg Boulware said the city isn\u2019t coming anywhere close to the wage increases the union is seeking.",
      "Union leaders, in their initial contract proposal, asked for 8% annual raises each year of the three-year contract, along with cost-of-living hikes and bonuses of up to $5,000 for those who worked through the pandemic. The union also asked the city to pay the full cost of employee health care, or $1,700 per person per month.",
      "In November, the city transit system averted a strike when the parties agreed to a one-year contract with 5% raises.",
      "A District Council 33 trash strike in the summer of 1986 left the city without trash pickup for three weeks, leading trash to pile up on streets, alleyways and drop-off sites.",

    "story": [
      "The Wisconsin Supreme Court has struck down the state\u2019s 176-year-old abortion ban",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- The Wisconsin Supreme Court\u2019s liberal majority struck down the state\u2019s 176-year-old abortion ban on Wednesday, ruling 4-3 that it was superseded by a newer state law that criminalizes abortions only after a fetus can survive outside the womb.",
      "State lawmakers adopted the ban in 1849, making it a felony when anyone other than the mother \u201cintentionally destroys the life of an unborn child.\u201d",
      "It was in effect until 1973, when the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s landmark Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion nationwide nullified it. Legislators never officially repealed the ban, however, and conservatives argued that the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 2022 decision to overturn Roe reactivated it.",
      "Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul, a Democrat, filed a lawsuit that year arguing that the ban was trumped by abortion restrictions legislators enacted during the nearly half-century that Roe was in effect. Kaul specifically cited a 1985 law that essentially permits abortions until viability. Some babies can survive with medical help after 21 weeks of gestation.",
      "Sheboygan County District Attorney Joel Urmanski, a Republican, defended the ban in court, arguing that the 1849 ban could coexist with the newer abortion restrictions, just as different penalties for the same crime coexist.",
      "Dane County Circuit Judge Diane Schlipper ruled in 2023 that the 1849 ban outlaws feticide \u2014 which she defined as the killing of a fetus without the mother\u2019s consent \u2014 but not consensual abortions. Abortions have been available in the state since that ruling but the state Supreme Court decision gives providers and patients more certainty that abortions will remain legal in Wisconsin.",
      "Urmanski asked the state Supreme Court to overturn Schlipper\u2019s ruling without waiting for a decision from a lower appellate court. It was expected as soon as the justices took the case that they would overturn the ban. Liberals hold a 4-3 majority on the court and one of them, Janet Protasiewicz, openly stated on the campaign trail that she supports abortion rights.",
      "Democratic-backed Susan Crawford defeated conservative Brad Schimel for an open seat on the court in April, ensuring liberals will maintain their 4-3 edge until at least 2028. Crawford has not been sworn in yet and was not part of Wednesday\u2019s ruling. She\u2019ll play pivotal role, though, in a separate Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin lawsuit challenging the 1849 ban\u2019s constitutionality. The high court decided last year to take that case. It\u2019s still pending.",

      "The history of encounters between Catholicism and Native spirituality has often been marred by violence and oppression",
      "TUCSON, Ariz. -- On St. John the Baptist\u2019s feast day in late June, an extended Tohono O\u2019odham family attends Mass out at their desert camp, where they gather to harvest saguaro fruit in a process sacred in their Native spirituality.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re raised as being a Catholic and raised as being an O\u2019odham, you have both of those within your home, you have both of those within your family,\u201d said Maria Francisco. \u201cSo it\u2019s a combination.\u201d",
      "With her cousin, Tanisha Tucker Lohse, and about three dozen other family members and friends, Francisco worshipped at the early morning Mass in a ramada \u2014 a canopy topped with saguaro ribs to provide shade, this one decorated with paper flowers. A folding table covered by a white and gold tablecloth served as an altar. A priest visited from Tucson to celebrate the Mass.",
      "A statuette of St. John the Baptist stood by a bunch of fresh flowers, candles and burning desert sage in lieu of incense. There also were photographs of Tucker\u2019s late mom and their great-great-aunt, known as \u201cGrandma Juanita,\u201d whose advocacy preserved the camp. Juana is Spanish for Jane, so she celebrated her name day on St. John's and the family is continuing the tradition.",
      "A dozen cross-shaped saguaro fruit-picking poles leaned behind the table. Made from saguaro ribs, they're used to hook the fruits and push or pull them down from the towering plants.",
      "The history of encounters between Catholicism and Native spirituality has often been marred by violence and oppression. But many members of the Tohono O\u2019odham Nation hold onto both faith traditions as they were passed down since the late 17th century, when an Italian-born Jesuit missionary, the Rev. Eusebio Kino, introduced Christianity to these remote deserts in what now are the U.S.-Mexico borderlands.",
      "\u201cTo me, it\u2019s the lived consequence of trying to do Catholicism on their own,\u201d said Seth Schermerhorn, a Hamilton College professor who studies Indigenous adoption of Christian practices.",
      "Many O\u2019odham villages have mission churches, though a shortage of priests means regular Mass is a rarity. The Rev. Aro Varnabas came from his parish, Saint Kateri, to celebrate this service.",

      "The saguaro cactus is the iconic plant of the Arizona borderlands, and in June and early July, its fruit ripens",
      "TUCSON, Ariz. -- Cousins Tanisha Tucker Lohse and Maria Francisco set off from their desert camp around dawn on most early summer days, in search of ripe fruit from the towering saguaro cactus, an icon of the Southwest that is crucial to the Tohono O\u2019odham Nation\u2019s spirituality.",
      "One plucks the small, thorn-covered fruits called \u201cbahidaj\u201d with a 10-foot-long (3-meter-long) stick made with a saguaro rib as the other catches them in a bucket. The harvest ritual is sacred to the O\u2019odham, who have lived for thousands of years in what are now U.S.-Mexico borderlands, and it's enjoying a renaissance as many seek to protect their traditional way of life.",
      "The fruit collected in late June is central to annual summer rain ceremonies, which mark the New Year. The laborious, weekslong harvest process also reinforces crucial connections to the Creator, the natural environment and fellow O\u2019odham across generations.",
      "\u201cI feel like I\u2019m surrounded by all the people that were here before us, all the ancestors,\u201d Francisco said in a desert wash lined with saguaros, flowering creosote bushes and spiny cholla cacti. \u201cWe talk about them constantly when we\u2019re out here.\u201d",
      "Foremost for the cousins' extended family is \u201cGrandma Juana.\u201d In the 1960s, elder Juanita Ahil campaigned to preserve their access to the harvesting camp in the foothills west of Tucson after the land became part of Saguaro National Park. Tucker Lohse\u2019s late mother, Stella Tucker, carried on the harvesting tradition that\u2019s now organized by the two cousins.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m taking on a big responsibility, a big legacy,\u201d said Tucker Lohse, who brought her 4-year-old daughter along this year. \u201cMy mom knows we\u2019re still here.\u201d",
      "Saguaros are the iconic plant of the Sonoran Desert, a land straddling the border between Arizona and Sonora, Mexico, that\u2019s surprisingly lush even though it receives less than 12 inches (30 centimeters) of rain yearly and summer temperatures routinely soar above 100 (38 degrees Celsius).",
      "The treelike cacti start to produce fruit at 30 years old, then sprout their trademark arms around 75 and live up to 200 years. Most of the fruit is near the top, which can be more than four times the average person\u2019s height, so the fruit of the tallest can be beyond their reach.",
      "They\u2019re an essential shelter and food source for desert creatures from mice to wrens, which is why harvesters \u2014 traces of whose camps date back to the 1500s \u2014 never pick them clean, Tucker Lohse said.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t look at land and animals as a resource \u2014 we create a relationship,\u201d she said, echoing perspectives shared by Indigenous people across North and South America.",
      "For the O\u2019odham, the saguaros, or \u201cha:sa\u00f1\u201d in their language, provide far more than food, tools and shelter material \u2014 they\u2019re family.",
      "\u201cHa:sa\u00f1 to us are like people, and we respect them that way,\u201d said Silas Garcia, Francisco's partner. He started harvesting as a child with his aunt on the O\u2019odham reservation, which is one of the largest in the United States.",
      "Garcia said there is a specific creation story about the saguaros \u2014 though like many stories sacred to Native Americans, it cannot be told in summer \u2014 and their spiritual presence makes the harvest central to the O\u2019odham.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s being reconnected to the desert, to who I am, to where our stories talk about where we come from as a people,\u201d Garcia said as he built a mesquite wood fire to boil the sugary fruit pulp into syrup.",
      "Starting in May, O\u2019odham families check the saguaro buds. The fruit is usually ripe by mid-June, opening a one-to-four week harvesting window until the fruit is spoiled by the first summer monsoons.",
      "After picking the first fruit, harvesters praise the Creator, believed to reside in a nearby mountain peak, the Baboquivari, that has been the site of many rescues of migrants who tried to evade U.S. border authorities.",
      "Then they bless themselves with some of the pulp, often making a cross-like sign over their foreheads and hearts \u2014 for some, a reference to Christian beliefs many O'odham also embrace. They taste it and thank the saguaro for providing for them.",
      "When it\u2019s cut open \u2014 using the saguaro\u2019s dried-up flower as a knife and leaving the pods by the saguaro for animals \u2014 the fruit is the color of a ripe watermelon. It changes shades from fuchsia to blood red as it\u2019s processed at camp.",
      "After the pulp is boiled for about an hour, it\u2019s strained to remove any debris, fiber and seeds. The latter two are collected into patties that, after being dried in the relentless sun, make natural pectin for saguaro jam. Then the juice is cooked again, reducing it to a syrup, and its flowery, caramel-like smell pervades the camp.",
      "Since the syrup is one-tenth the quantity of the harvested fruit pulp, it takes a pair of harvesters about 10 hours in the desert to get enough to make 64 ounces (1.9 liters) of syrup.",
      "Finally, a bit of syrup is mixed with water and left to ferment to make wine for Nawait I\u2019i. That\u2019s the dayslong ceremony in which O\u2019odham pray together to their Creator to keep sending the monsoon rains that make it possible to plant traditional crops like beans, squash and corn.",
      "For many Native Americans, losing access to land, natural cycles of agriculture and the local foods that sustained them for centuries has meant spiking rates of diabetes, alcoholism and other diseases that disproportionately plague their communities.",
      "Too many elders lost their lives this way, putting at risk their language and traditions and more of their land.",
      "\u201cI watched them slowly pass away and no one took over,\u201d Tucker Lohse said. That\u2019s why she, Francisco and others push to teach youth about saguaro harvesting and other practices.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really proud Maria has picked it up,\u201d said Francisco\u2019s mother, Josephine Ramon, adding that she\u2019s relearning some traditions she was taught as a child from her daughter.",
      "Ramon said she regrets not teaching the language to younger family members who lived off the reservation, as about one third of the nation\u2019s 30,000 members do.",
      "City living also distances many from heirloom crops, which the Indigenous-run San Xavier Co-op Farm just south of Tucson is trying to regenerate, said one of its managers, Amy Juan, who harvests near the cousins\u2019 camp.",
      "\u201cWith everything we do, there\u2019s a teaching of some sort,\u201d added Garcia, who said he's encouraged by programs on the reservation and beyond that help youth connect to their ancestral culture.",
      "Francine Larson Segundo, who also harvests nearby, said her grandparents taught her about planting and caring for the saguaro.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re people, and they are our people, and when we\u2019re gone, one will take our place,\u201d she said after picking the fruit for nearly two hours. \u201cAnybody that\u2019s younger than me, I have a responsibility to teach as much as I can.\u201d",
      "Francisco\u2019s aunt Helen Ramon, widely known as \u201cGrandma Helen,\u201d stopped by. She\u2019s especially adamant about instilling in youth the need to treat the natural environment with the same respect due to fellow beings.",
      "\u201cThey need to carry on our traditions,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t lose our ways of being Native.\u201d",

      "BANGKOK -- A U.S. judge has ruled that China\u2019s Huawei Technologies, a leading telecoms equipment company, must face criminal charges in a wide reaching case alleging it stole technology and engaged in racketeering, wire and bank fraud and other crimes.",
      "U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly on Tuesday rejected Huawei\u2019s request to dismiss the allegations in a 16-count federal indictment against the company, saying in a 52-page ruling that its arguments were premature.",
      "The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The U.S. accuses Huawei and some of its subsidiaries of plotting to steal U.S. trade secrets, installing surveillance equipment that enabled Iran to spy on protesters during 2009 anti-government demonstrations in Iran, and of doing business in North Korea despite U.S. sanctions there.",
      "During President Donald Trump\u2019s first term in office, his administration raised national security concerns and began lobbying Western allies against including Huawei in their wireless, high-speed networks.",
      "In its January 2019 indictment, the Justice Department accused Huawei of using a Hong Kong shell company called Skycom to sell equipment to Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions and charged its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, with fraud by misleading the HSBC bank about the company\u2019s business dealings in Iran.",
      "Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, was arrested in Canada in late 2018 on a U.S. extradition request but released in September 2021 in a high-stakes prisoner swap that freed two Canadians held by China and allowed her to return home.",
      "Chinese officials have accused the U.S. government of \u201ceconomic bullying\u201d and of improperly using national security as a pretext for \u201coppressing Chinese companies.\u201d In their motion to dismiss the broad criminal case, among other arguments Huawei's lawyers contended that the U.S. allegations were too vague and some were \u201dimpermissibly extraterritorial,\" and do not involve domestic wire and bank fraud.",
      "The biggest maker of network gear, Huawei struggled to hold onto its market share under sanctions that have blocked its access to most U.S. processor chips and other technology. The limits led it to ramp up its own development of computer chips and other advanced technologies.",
      "The company also shifted its focus to the Chinese market and to network technology for hospitals, factories and other industrial customers and other products that would not be affected by U.S. sanctions.",

      "JACKSON, Miss. -- More than 60 years after a white supremacist assassinated civil rights leader Medgar Evers, his daughter still sees the same strain of political violence at work in American society.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s painful,\u201d said Reena Evers-Everette. \u201cIt\u2019s very painful.\u201d",
      "Evers-Everette was 8 years old when her father, a field secretary for the NAACP, was shot to death in the driveway of his home in Jackson, Mississippi.",
      "A few months after Evers\u2019 killing in 1963, President John F. Kennedy was gunned down. The deaths of civil rights leaders Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, and U.S. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy followed later that decade.",
      "Now, experts say the level of political violence in America over the past few years is likely the highest it\u2019s been since the 1960s and 1970s. The past year alone has seen the assassination of a Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband, the killing of two Israeli Embassy staffers, and two assassination attempts on then-presidential candidate Donald Trump.",
      "At a four-day conference celebrating Evers' life just before what would have been his 100th birthday on July 2, his daughter was joined by the daughters of slain civil rights leaders: Kerry Kennedy, the daughter of Robert F. Kennedy, and Bettie Dahmer, the daughter of civil and voting rights activist Vernon Dahmer. The 2025 Democracy in Action Convening, \u201cMedgar Evers at 100: a Legacy of Justice, a Future of Change,\u201d was held in Jackson.",
      "\u201cI just was feeling so much pain, and I didn't want anyone else to have to go through that,\u201d Kennedy said, recalling that after her father died, she prayed for the man who killed him. \u201cI was saying, \u2018Please don\u2019t \u2014 please don't kill the guy that killed him.'\u201d",
      "Two-time Georgia gubernatorial candidate and voting rights activist Stacey Abrams spoke at the event, denouncing efforts by the Trump administration to strip the names of activists from Navy vessels, including possibly Evers.",
      "\u201cThey want to take his name off a boat because they don't want us to have a reminder of how far he sailed us forward,\u201d Abrams told the conference crowd.",
      "U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has undertaken an effort to change the names of ships and military bases that were given by President Joe Biden\u2019s Democratic administration, which often honored service members who were women, people of color, or from the LGBTQ+ community.",
      "Abrams drew parallels between acts of radical political violence and the Trump administration's use of military resources against protesters in Los Angeles who were demonstrating against immigration enforcement actions.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, we cannot decry political violence and then sanction the sending of the Marines and the National Guard to stop protesters and not believe that that conflicting message doesn\u2019t communicate itself,\u201d Abrams told The Associated Press. \u201cWhat I want us to remember is that whether it is Medgar Evers or Melissa Hortman, no one who is willing to speak for the people should have their lives cut short because of what they say.\u201d",
      "In addition to her father's life and legacy, Evers-Everette wants people to remember the hatred that led to his assassination.",
      "\u201cWe have to make sure we know what our history is,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we don't repeat the crazy, nasty, racist mess.\u201d",

      "BOISE, Idaho -- More than two years after the stabbing deaths of four University of Idaho students shocked the rural community of Moscow, Idaho, the former criminal justice doctoral student charged in the murders is expected in court Wednesday to plead guilty in a deal to avoid the death penalty.",
      "Bryan Kohberger agreed to the plea deal in the past few days, just weeks before his trial was to begin, after his attorneys tried but failed to have execution stricken as a possible punishment. The deal drew mixed reactions from the victims' families, ranging from support to outrage that Kohberger would live.",
      "\u201cBryan Kohberger facing a life in prison means he would still get to speak, form relationships, and engage with the world,\u201d Aubrie Goncalves, the 18-year-old sister of victim Kaylee Goncalves, wrote in a Facebook post. \u201cMeanwhile, our loved ones have been silenced forever. That reality stings more deeply when it feels like the system is protecting his future more than honoring the victims\u2019 pasts.\u201d",
      "The small farming community of Moscow, in the northern Idaho panhandle, had not had a homicide in about five years when Kaylee Goncalves, Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle and Madison Mogen were found dead at a rental home near campus on Nov. 13, 2022. Autopsies showed the four victims were all likely asleep when they were attacked. Some had defensive wounds and each was stabbed multiple times.",
      "The killings prompted a massive hunt for the perpetrator. That included an elaborate effort to track down a white sedan that was seen on surveillance cameras repeatedly driving by the rental home, using genetic genealogy to identify Kohberger as a possible suspect, and using cellphone data to pinpoint his movements the night of the killings.",
      "At the time, Kohberger was a criminal justice graduate student at Washington State University, about 9 miles (14.5 kilometers) west of the University of Idaho. He was arrested in Pennsylvania, where his parents lived, weeks later. Investigators said they matched his DNA to genetic material recovered from a knife sheath found at the crime scene.",
      "Online shopping records showed that Kohberger had purchased a military-style knife months earlier \u2014 as well as a sheath like the one found at the scene.",
      "No motive has emerged for the killings, nor is it clear why the attacker spared two roommates who were in the home. Authorities have said cellphone data and surveillance video show that Kohberger visited the victims\u2019 neighborhood at least a dozen times before the killings.",
      "Kohberger is due to appear at 11 a.m. MDT Wednesday before Idaho Fourth Judicial District Judge Steven Hippler in Boise, where the case was moved due to pretrial publicity in northern Idaho. Hippler must approve the plea deal. If Kohberger pleads guilty as expected, he would likely be sentenced in July.",
      "While the Goncalves family opposed the agreement and said they would seek to stop it, they also argued that any such deal should require Kohberger to make a full confession, detail the facts of what happened and provide the location of the murder weapon.",
      "\"We deserve to know when the beginning of the end was,\u201d they wrote in a Facebook post.",
      "The family of Chapin \u2014 one of three triplets who attended the university together \u2014 supports the deal, their spokesperson, Christina Teves, said Tuesday. Attorney Leander James, who represents Mogen\u2019s mother and stepfather, declined to give their views but said he would deliver a statement on their behalf after Wednesday\u2019s hearing. Mogen\u2019s father, Ben Mogen, told CBS News he was relieved by the agreement.",
      "\u201cWe can actually put this behind us and not have these future dates and future things that we don\u2019t want to have to be at, that we shouldn\u2019t have to be at, that have to do with this terrible person,\u201d he said. \u201cWe get to just think about the rest of lives and have to try and figure out how to do it without Maddie and the rest of the kids.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- A federal judge in New York on Tuesday blocked the Trump administration from ending temporary legal status for more than 500,000 Haitians who are already in the United States.",
      "District Court Judge Brian M. Cogan in New York ruled that moving up the expiration of the temporary protected status, or TPS, by at least five months for Haitians, some of whom have lived in the U.S. for more than a decade, is unlawful.",
      "The Biden administration had extended Haiti\u2019s TPS status through at least Feb. 3, 2026, due to gang violence, political unrest, a major earthquake in 2021 and several other factors, according to court documents.",
      "But last week, the Department of Homeland Security announced it was terminating those legal protections as soon as Sept. 2, setting Haitians up for potential deportation. The department said the conditions in the country had improved and Haitians no longer met the conditions for the temporary legal protections.",
      "The ruling comes as President Donald Trump works to end protections and programs for immigrants as part of his mass deportations promises.",
      "The judge's 23-page opinion states that the Department of Homeland Security 's move to terminate the legal protections early violates the TPS statute that requires a certain amount of notice before reconsidering a designation.",
      "\u201cWhen the Government confers a benefit over a fixed period of time, a beneficiary can reasonably expect to receive that benefit at least until the end of that fixed period,\u201d according to the ruling.",
      "The judge also referenced the fact that the plaintiffs have started jobs, enrolled in schools and begun receiving medical treatment with the expectations that the country's TPS designation would run through the end of the year.",
      "Manny Pastreich, president of the Service Employees International Union Local 32BJ, which filed the lawsuit, described the ruling as an \u201cimportant step\u201d but said the fight is not over.",
      "\u201cWe will keep fighting to make sure this decision is upheld,\" Pastreich said in a statement. \"We will keep fighting for the rights of our members and all immigrants against the Trump Administration \u2013 in the streets, in the workplace, and in the courts as well. And when we fight, we win.\"",
      "DHS did not immediately respond to an email from The Associated Press requesting comment. But the government had argued that TPS is a temporary program and thus \u201cthe termination of a country\u2019s TPS designation is a possibility beneficiaries must always expect.\"",
      "Haiti's TPS status was initially activated in 2010 after the catastrophic earthquake and has been extended multiple times, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Gang violence has displaced 1.3 million people across Haiti as the local government and international community struggle with the spiraling crisis, according to a report from the International Organization for Migration. There has been a 24% increase in displaced people since December, with gunmen having chased 11% of Haiti\u2019s nearly 12 million inhabitants from their home, the report said.",
      "In May, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to strip Temporary Protected Status from 350,000 Venezuelans, potentially exposing them to deportation. The order put on hold a ruling from a federal judge in San Francisco that kept the legal protections in place.",
      "The judge's decision in New York also comes on the heels of the Trump administration revoking legal protections for thousands of Haitians who arrived legally in the U.S. through a humanitarian parole program.",

      "\u201cThe eight victims who lost their lives did nothing to deserve what the MS-13 did to them,\u201d they wrote in legal filings ahead of Wednesday\u2019s hearing. \u201cThe defendant and the others killed them in service of the gang without remorse or any regard for them as human beings.\u201d",
      "But Saenz's lawyers have argued for leniency, saying in their own legal filings that the now-30-year-old is remorseful and \u201con a journey of redemption\u201d while incarcerated.",
      "\"With the passage of time and much reflection, it is hard for Mr. Saenz to reconcile the person he is today with the person he was when he committed the crimes,\" their sentencing memo reads. \u201cHe is profoundly sorry, and although he knows the families may not accept his apology, it is sincere, and he accepts full responsibility for his participation in these crimes.\u201d",
      "Saenz's lawyers also say he suffers from intellectual disabilities and lasting trauma from an abusive father and difficult upbringing in El Salvador. They say Saenz was recruited and unwittingly \u201cgroomed\u201d into MS-13 because he was an \u201ceasily influenced\u201d and \u201cgullible\u201d high school student on Long Island.",
      "Prosecutors, however, counter that Saenz has remained \u201cfirmly entrenched\u201d in MS-13 while in a federal lockup in Brooklyn for the past eight years.",
      "They cited photos of him posing with other gang members behind bars and displaying gang signs and gang paraphernalia. They also say Saenz has been disciplined for assaulting other inmates, refusing staff orders and possessing sharpened metal shanks, cellphones and other contraband.",
      "\u201cIndeed, the same pattern of violence and mayhem that has marked his life on the street has not waned with the passage of time,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "Saenz, also known as \u201cBlasty\u201d and \u201cBig Homie,\u201d was the leader of an MS-13 clique operating in Brentwood and Central Islip known as Sailors Locos Salvatruchas Westside.",
      "He admitted last July that he\u2019d authorized the eight killings and three other attempted killings of perceived rivals and others that had disrespected or feuded with the clique.",
      "Saenz also admitted to arson, firearms offenses and drug trafficking \u2014 the proceeds of which went toward buying firearms, more drugs and providing contributions to the wider MS-13 gang.",
      "Among the killings Saenz oversaw were the deaths of Kayla Cuevas, 16, and Nisa Mickens, 15, lifelong friends and classmates at Brentwood High School who were slain with a machete and a baseball bat.",
      "Other victims included Javier Castillo, 15, of Central Islip, who was befriended by gang members only to be cut down with a machete in an isolated marsh.",
      "Another victim, Oscar Acosta, 19, was found dead in a wooded area near railroad tracks nearly five months after he left his Brentwood home to play soccer.",
      "MS-13, or Mara Salvatrucha, is a transnational criminal organization believed to have been founded as a neighborhood street gang in Los Angeles in the mid-1980s by people fleeing civil war in El Salvador.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The United States. Australia, India and Japan have agreed to expand their cooperation on maritime security in the Indo-Pacific and further collaborate on supplies of critical minerals and rare earths that are key components of high-tech production.",
      "The foreign ministers of the four countries, known as the \u201cQuad,\u201d met in Washington on Tuesday as the Trump administration seeks to expand U.S. influence in the Indo-Pacific to compete with a rising China amid tensions with partners over trade and defense issues.",
      "In a joint meeting with his three colleagues, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the Quad must be a \u201cvehicle for action\u201d that goes beyond statements of intent and stressed that commerce and trade will be critical to ensuring the group\u2019s relevance in the future.",
      "To that end, the four announced in a statement the creation of a \u201cQuad Critical Minerals Initiative\u201d that aims \u201cto strengthen economic security and collective resilience by collaborating on securing and diversifying critical mineral supply chains.\u201d The statement did not provide details of the initiative.",
      "\u201cWe are deeply concerned about the abrupt constriction and future reliability of key supply chains, specifically for critical minerals,\u201d they said. \u201cThis includes the use of non-market policies and practices for critical minerals, certain derivative products, and mineral processing technology.\u201d",
      "The statement did not mention China by name, but Chinese domination of the critical minerals supply chain has long been a concern of the U.S. and others. The ministers expressed specific concern about rising tensions in the East and South China Seas, where Beijing has become increasingly assertive of maritime and territorial claims that are rejected by its smaller neighbors.",
      "\u201cWe reiterate our strong opposition to any unilateral actions that seek to change the status quo by force or coercion,\u201d they said. \u201cWe express our serious concerns regarding dangerous and provocative actions, including interference with offshore resource development, the repeated obstruction of the freedoms of navigation and overflight, and the dangerous maneuvers by military aircraft and coast guard and maritime militia vessels, especially the unsafe use of water cannons and ramming or blocking actions in the South China Sea.\u201d",
      "The ministers also condemned North Korea for continuing to launch ballistic missiles, expand its nuclear weapons program and engage in malicious cyberactivity. In a veiled reference to North Korean support for Russia in its war against Ukraine, they expressed \u201cdeep concern about countries that are deepening military cooperation with North Korea, which directly undermines the global nonproliferation regime.\u201d",

      "CHAPIN, S.C. -- Former South Carolina Lt. Gov. Andr\u00e9 Bauer is mounting a GOP primary challenge to Sen. Lindsey Graham, arguing the incumbent isn't conservative enough to represent the state.",
      "Bauer, a wealthy developer, is a longtime backer of President Donald Trump. His candidacy sets up a midterm grudge match with Graham, a four-term senator whose relationship with Trump has undulated through the years, but who has Trump's endorsement for reelection.",
      "Bauer has described himself as \u201ca real, America First conservative\u201d intent on representing what he sees as South Carolina conservatives\u2019 true values.",
      "\u201cI think Graham's been there too long, and he votes like it,\u201d Bauer told The Associated Press Tuesday night. \u201cI'm guaranteed, I'm conservative, and I don't think he is.\"",
      "Republicans dominate South Carolina\u2019s statewide-elected positions, meaning that the most intense political competition takes place in GOP primaries.",
      "Graham has faced previous primary challenges from the right, with opponents accusing him of kowtowing to Democrats on issues from immigration to climate change. But he also hews to Republican priorities on national security; ahead of last month\u2019s U.S. strike on Iranian facilities, Graham called for Trump to \u201cgo all-in\u201d in backing Israel and destroying Iran\u2019s nuclear program.",
      "Graham kicked off his reelection campaign in February, and at least one other Republican has also announced a primary challenge.",
      "He has already secured Trump\u2019s endorsement. This week, Graham's campaign announced that Chris LaCivita, a co-campaign manager of Trump\u2019s 2024 bid, would serve as a senior adviser. On Tuesday, Abby Zilch, spokeswoman for Graham\u2019s campaign, noted that the senator had earned Trump\u2019s \u201ccomplete and total endorsement,\u201d adding that Bauer \u201chas spent his career chasing titles to feed his ego.\u201d",
      "Bauer said he understood Trump\u2019s need to use Capitol Hill relationships to advance his legislative priorities, like the tax cuts and spending bill that came before the Senate Budget Committee \u2014 which Graham chairs \u2014 before passing the chamber earlier Tuesday.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s got to work and get his bills passed,\u201d Bauer said. \u201cLindsey\u2019s chairman of a major committee. ... I get what you have to do.\"",
      "Bauer has backed Trump since before his win in South Carolina\u2019s 2016 GOP primary. At his 2024 campaign's South Carolina launch event, Trump called Bauer \u2014 who served on his state leadership committee \u2014 \u201ca friend of mine, somebody that could I think run for almost any office and win.\u201d",
      "Bauer served in the South Carolina legislature before, at 33, he was elected the youngest lieutenant governor in the country in 2002. After two terms, he mounted an unsuccessful 2010 gubernatorial bid, finishing last in a four-way GOP primary ultimately won by Nikki Haley.",
      "Two years later, Bauer ran for Congress, losing a GOP runoff to eventual Rep. Tom Rice in South Carolina\u2019s newly created 7th District.",
      "Asked how much of his own money he would commit, Bauer declined to give a figure, saying he would \u201cput skin in the campaign\u201d and looked forward to returning to the trail.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to cover this state like the dew covers Dixie,\u201d Bauer said. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to see a movement.\u201d",

      "MOSCOW, Idaho -- Residents expressed a mix of relief and anger Tuesday in the small Idaho college town where four students were stabbed to death in 2022 after news that the man charged in the killings had agreed to plead guilty to avoid a trial and a possible death penalty.",
      "Bryan Kohberger, 30, is expected to plead guilty on Wednesday to charges that he murdered University of Idaho students Kaylee Goncalves, Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle and Madison Mogen at a rental home near the Moscow campus in November 2022.",
      "No motive has emerged for the killings, which stunned a community that's still healing \u2014 and news of the plea deal elicited mixed reactions from Moscow residents.",
      "Telisa Swan had thanked authorities with a message on her tattoo shop's marquee after Kohberger was arrested in early 2023. On Tuesday, Swan said she\u2019s disappointed the victims' families may not get full answers if Kohberger \u2019s quadruple-murder trial doesn\u2019t happen next month.",
      "\u201cBut at the same time, I\u2019m glad that he\u2019s admitting his guilt right now, finally,\u201d Swan said, adding that the \u201cdeath penalty would have been an easy way out for him. He should suffer in prison for a very long time.\u201d",
      "With word of a plea deal, news crews descended Tuesday on Moscow's main street, where every other storefront boasts the University of Idaho's colors, flags and insignia.",
      "The nearby campus was quiet, with summer break in full swing. Bouquets of flowers and candles adorned the names of the victims etched on metal plaques at a campus healing garden and memorial opened in 2024 that honors the four students and others who lost their lives while enrolled at the university.",
      "The off-campus home where the killings took place was demolished in 2023, leaving behind an empty lot with dry grass and weathered mementos from a makeshift memorial there.",
      "Moscow resident Luke Brunaugh, who said he lives less than a mile from where the killings happened, didn\u2019t like that a deal would mean the death penalty option would go away, saying that should be the punishment for murder.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s just unfair to the families,\" said Brunaugh. \u201cIt allows him to hide. He never had to really go to trial. He is answering to his crimes, but not to the fullest extent in my opinion.\u201d",
      "In Idaho, judges have the option to reject plea agreements, but that is rare. If Kohberger pleads guilty on Wednesday, he is expected to be sentenced in late July.",
      "Kohberger, who was a criminal justice graduate student at Washington State University at the time of the killings, was arrested after investigators said they matched his DNA to genetic material recovered from a knife sheath found at the crime scene.",
      "Heidi Barnett said she felt trepidation when her son chose the University of Idaho as his college three years ago. Visiting him in Moscow Tuesday, Barnett said a long trial would have been very emotional for the families.",
      "\u201cI would think life in prison sometimes would be harder, so I kind of looked at it that way,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not the parent, but I would be happy with that.\u201d",

      "A department spokesperson declined to comment. The New York Times was first to report on Wise's appointment.",

But the president pulled his nomination to keep the job on a more permanent basis two days after a key Republican senator said he could not support Martin for the job due to his defense of Capitol rioters.",
      "Martin was a leading figure in Trump\u2019s \u201cStop the Steal\u201d movement. He spoke at a rally in Washington on the eve of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. He represented three Jan. 6 defendants and served on the board of the nonprofit Patriot Freedom Project, which reports raising over $2.5 million to support riot defendants.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi called for creating the \u201cweaponization\u201d group in February to investigate claims by Trump and Republican allies that the Justice Department unfairly targeted conservatives during President Joe Biden\u2019s administration. The group's review includes the work of former special counsel Jack Smith, who led two federal prosecutions of Trump that were ultimately abandoned after Trump was elected to a second term.",
      "Fox News host Jeanine Pirro replaced Martin as the top federal prosecutor in Washington, but Martin immediately moved over to his current Justice Department position.",

      "Wise repeatedly shouted, \u201cKill \u2019em!\u201d as he watched rioters assaulting officers outside the Capitol, according to an FBI agent\u2019s affidavit. Wise clapped his hands and raised his arms \u201din triumph\u201d after he entered the building through the Senate wing door, the affidavit says. He left the building about nine minutes after entering.",

      "\u201cI\u2019m former law enforcement,\" he told them.\" You\u2019re disgusting. You are the Nazi. You are the Gestapo. You can\u2019t see it.\u201d",
      "Wise was on trial in Washington when Trump returned to the White House in January and immediately pardoned, commuted prison sentences or ordered the dismissal of cases for all of the nearly 1,600 people charged in the attack.

      "A federal judge on Tuesday temporarily blocked the Trump administration from dismantling a U.S. federal agency that invests in African small businesses.",
      "U.S. District Judge Richard Leon in Washington, D.C., ruled that Trump violated federal law when he appointed Pete Marocco the new head of the U.S. African Development Foundation, or USDAF, because Marocco was never confirmed by Congress. As a result, Marocco's actions \u2014 terminating most of the agency's employees and effectively ending the agency's grants \u2014 are void and must be undone, the judge found.",
      "Congress created USADF as an independent agency in 1980, and its board members must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate. In 2023, Congress allocated $46 million to the agency to invest in small agricultural and energy infrastructure projects and other economic development initiatives in 22 African countries.",
      "On Feb. 19, Trump issued an executive order that said USADF, the U.S. Institute of Peace, the Inter-American Foundation and the Presidio Trust should be scaled back to the minimum presence required by law. Trump also fired the agency's board members and installed Marocco as the board chair.",
      "Two USDAF staffers and a consulting firm based in Zambia that works closely with USADF sued on May 21, challenging Marocco's appointment and saying the deep cuts to the agency prevented it from carrying out its congressionally mandated functions.",
      "The staffers and consulting firm asked the judge for a preliminary injunction, saying Marocco's \u201cslash-and-burn approach\u201d threatened to reduce the agency to rubble before their lawsuit is resolved. They said the Federal Vacancies Reform Act prohibited Marocco's appointment to USADF, and that the same law requires that any actions done by an unlawfully appointed person must be unwound.",
      "\u201cThis is a victory for the rule of law and the communities that rely on USADF\u2019s vital work,\u201d said Joel McElvain, senior legal adviser at Democracy Forward, the organization representing the USDAF staffers and consulting firm in their lawsuit. \u201cWe will continue fighting against these power grabs to protect USADF\u2019s ability to fulfill the mission that Congress gave it to perform.\u201d",
      "U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro had written in court documents that the Federal Vacancies Reform Act doesn't apply to USADF, and that the president has the authority to designate acting members of the agency's board until the Senate confirms his nominees. Any claims about the cuts themselves, Pirro said, must be handled in the Court of Federal Claims, not the federal district court.",
      "The judge found in a separate case that Trump had the legal authority to fire the previous members of the USADF board. Pirro wrote in court documents in that case that the president also has the legal authority to appoint someone to run the USADF, consistent with Trump's policy goals, until the Senate could confirm his nominees.",

      "The NCAA\u2019s House settlement era has launched, with athletic programs across the country free to start paying millions to their athletes in the biggest change in the history of college athletics",
      "The NCAA's House settlement era opened Tuesday, with athletic programs across the country free to start paying millions to their athletes in the biggest change in the history of college athletics.",
      "The end of the NCAA's longstanding amateur model is certain to cause headaches and disputes among powerhouse schools and smaller colleges alike. Scattered among them, however, is a handful of schools that have decided to wait it out at least a year to see how things develop, including legal risks and Title IX concerns.",
      "Call them the opt-outs.",
      "The Ivy League removed itself from the conversation early, saying in January that its eight schools \u2014 which do not award athletic scholarships \u2014 will not participate. Military rules bar Navy, Air Force, and Army from compensating athletes through name, image and likeness deals. But alongside the academies are others choosing to watch the settlement unfold from the sidelines during year one.",
      "The deadline for schools to opt out was Monday. There were very few announcements. Among them: Nebraska-Omaha and Montana.",
      "\u201cAlthough we welcome the approval and intent of the settlement, our mission remains to protect the interests of our current student-athletes while honoring UNO\u2019s core values as we transition to a new era,\u201d the university wrote in a statement. \u201cOpting in at this stage ... would simply introduce new and unresolved variables at a time when clarity is critical.\u201d",
      "Omaha cited Title IX compliance as a reason, which according to attorney Mit Winter, a college sports legal expert, should be a legitimate concern for any university opting in and deciding to share up to $20.5 million with its athletes over the next year alone.",
      "\u201cA lot of people think Title IX doesn\u2019t mandate that the rev-share dollars be paid out the same way that athletic scholarships have to be paid out, which is proportional to the male-female student population,\u201d Winter said. \u201cMost (Power Four) schools, 90- to 95% of their $20.5 million are going to go to male athletes \u2014 football and basketball in most cases.\u201d",
      "Another noteworthy opt-out is Montana, whose football team consistently competes at a high level. Athletic director Kent Haslam informed multiple outlets of the university\u2019s decision, which comes as archrival Montana State opts in.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019ve been sitting on this extra pot of revenue that now, magically, we\u2019ll be able to share,\u201d Haslam told the Montana Kaimin in April.",
      "Winter said even a year on the sideline could hurt.",
      "\u201cIt makes it much harder to compete in recruiting if schools you\u2019re competing against are able to pay their athletes up to $20.5 million and you\u2019re not able to pay them anything,\u201d Winter said. \u201cIn my view, Montana State just gave themselves a huge advantage in recruiting over Montana.\u201d",
      "For schools opting in \u2013 and that\u2019s the vast majority across Division I -- there is a host of questions. Some are logistical: Many donor-backed collectives are disbanding or being brought in-house, a key change in fundraising. Schools are getting familiar with reporting and enforcement details for NIL deals over $600, and both school and athlete are getting crash courses on contracts that read more like the are from the NFL and other pro sports leagues.",
      "Plenty of opt-ins won\u2019t reach the $20.5 million cap that will rise over the next decade. But regardless of finances, most schools have chosen to partake in the settlement to stay competitive in an evolving college sports landscape.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of schools that feel the obligation to opt in to remain competitive,\" said Michael Rueda, an attorney leads the sports and entertainment division at the Withers law firm. \"I do think it offers a bit more structure for some of those larger schools that have been spending a lot of time trying to build a collective and raise money so that they could keep their best athletes. And then there are other schools that just aren\u2019t in the same category. From a dollars and cents perspective, it just doesn\u2019t make sense across the board.\u201d",
      "With limited resources and difficulties adapting to NIL ventures, Rueda said smaller schools face significant challenges against deep-pocketed universities.",
      "\u201cI would envision that a lot of those schools can\u2019t even fathom how to make this jump yet,\u201d Rueda said. \u201cThey were struggling even before this trying to understand how institutional NIL worked. They probably were just coming to terms with how some of that stuff might have been feasible for them, and now you\u2019re completely changing the game. And so they have to get up to speed and figure out what this looks like for a school of that size with limited resources, budget staff and all that.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The man charged in the late night stabbing deaths of four University of Idaho students in their off-campus house has agreed to plead guilty",
      "The man charged in the stabbing deaths of four University of Idaho students in November 2022 has agreed to plead guilty, according to an attorney for a victim's family, but the family says it opposes any deal that would take the death penalty off the table.",
      "Shanon Gray, an attorney for the family of Kaylee Goncalves, said the family has requested that a change of plea hearing for Bryan Kohberger set for Wednesday be delayed so that families could travel to Boise to attend.",
      "The family of Ethan Chapin, another of those killed, supports the plea deal, said family spokesperson Christina Teves on Tuesday. Karen and Scott Laramie, the mother and stepfather of Madison Mogen, plan to make a statement through their attorney, Leander James, after the hearing. Relatives of Xana Kernodle did not immediately respond to interview requests.",
      "Prosecutors stressed in a letter to victims' families, obtained by ABC News, that they had met with available family members last week before extending the offer.",
      "What happens when surviving families of crime victims or victims themselves disagree with prosecutors? Here's a little more on what rights and recourse victims do and don't have in the U.S. and in Idaho.",
      "A movement to address the needs and well-being of victims of crime started in the 1970s and made grassroots advancements, like the first victims help hotline. Laws addressing the rights of crime victims followed in the \u201880s, \u201990s and 2000s, and are relatively new for the criminal justice landscape.",
      "The 2004 federal Crime Victims' Rights Act granted eight specific rights to victims in federal criminal cases including the right to be protected from the person accused of committing the crime, the right to reasonable and timely notice of proceedings, the right to restitution and the reasonable right to confer with the prosecution.",
      "States were left to pass laws that governed victims' rights for state-level criminal prosecutions. Every state has some form of law addressing the rights of crime victims that vary.",
      "Most, at minimum, provide the right to seek restitution or to be informed about court hearings in advance. Many states have passed larger packages sometimes called a victim bill of rights.",
      "\u201cReally, what these laws are designed to do is to make sure that victims are meaningful participants in the architecture of justice,\u201d said Meg Garvin, the executive director of the National Crime Victim Law Institute.",
      "Idaho's Constitution outlines 10 rights of crime victims, including to be treated fairly and respectfully, the right to notification of case events and to attend those events, and the right to communicate with prosecutors, among others.",
      "It also specifically allows for victims \u201cto be heard, upon request, at all criminal justice proceedings considering a plea of guilty, sentencing, incarceration or release of the defendant, unless manifest injustice would result.\u201d",
      "It was unclear Tuesday if any of the families had requested to make a statement at that hearing, but Garvin said that would be a meaningful opportunity for them to speak to the court.",
      "\u201cWhen a court decides to accept or reject a plea agreement, it has to be done in the interest of justice,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's a victim's right to have input in the prosecution, but also to make sure the court knows how they feel about a plea. The victims don't have control over the outcome, but they can offer something that helps the court analyze whether the plea is in the interest of justice.\u201d",
      "Judges can reject plea agreements in Idaho, but it is a rare occurrence. The judge in Kohberger's case previously denied a defense attorney motion to remove the death penalty from consideration that had argued Kohberger's autism diagnosis made him less culpable.",
      "The right to confer covers a broad range of communication with prosecutors, but largely means being kept informed and participating as a case proceeds. That can mean having conversations before a bail hearing to propose conditions of a defendant being released that increase a victim's feeling of safety, or strategizing victim impact statements before sentencing.",
      "It does not mean that victims or their families get the final say in how prosecutors try a case or whether they can offer or approve a plea agreement. There is no appeals process for victims or families who disagree with a prosecutor\u2019s decision, but that doesn't mean there isn't recourse if a victim believes their rights have been violated.",
      "Garvin said not providing an opportunity for meaningful victim input can lead to courts reconsidering sentences or overturning outcomes and holding new hearings.",
      "She cited the recent case of Adnan Syed in Maryland, whose murder conviction had been vacated in 2022 after Baltimore prosecutors said they had uncovered issues with the initial prosecution. The victim's family later succeeded in getting the conviction reinstated after challenging the ruling on procedural grounds, arguing they didn\u2019t receive proper notice to attend the hearing that freed Syed from prison\u2014 a victims' rights violation.",
      "In the letter sent to the families of the Idaho victims Monday, prosecutors wrote, \u201cYour viewpoints weighed heavily in our decision-making process, and we hope that you may come to appreciate why we believe this resolution is in the best interest of justice.\u201d",
      "Goncalves' family wrote in Facebook posts that family members had spoken to prosecutors multiple times from Friday to Monday to register their objections to a plea and explain their views about pushing for a conviction at trial and the death penalty. The statement said the Friday discussions were vague, and that the whole process moved incredibly fast despite nearly two years of preparations and waiting for a trial that had been scheduled to start in August.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is withholding more than $6 billion in federal grants for afterschool and summer programs, English language instruction, adult literacy and more",
      "WASHINGTON -- Day camp providers and schools are warning that a Trump administration funding freeze could wreck summer for low-income American families and wipe out some after-school programming next year.",
      "The administration is withholding more than $6 billion in federal grants for after-school and summer programs, English language instruction, adult literacy and more as part of a review to ensure grants align with President Donald Trump\u2019s priorities.",
      "The move leaves states and schools in limbo as they budget for programs this summer and in the upcoming school year, introducing new uncertainty about when \u2014 or if \u2014 they will receive the money. It also sets the stage for a clash with Democrats, who say the administration is flouting the law by holding back money Congress appropriated.",
      "Without the money, schools say they won't be able to provide free or affordable after-school care for low-income kids while their parents work, and they may not be able to hire staff to teach children who are learning English. Even classes or camps underway this summer could be in jeopardy.",
      "For instance, the Boys and Girls Clubs of America depend on some of the withheld money to run camps and other summer programming for low-income students. If funding isn\u2019t restored soon, the programming may end mid-season, said Boys and Girls Club President Jim Clark.",
      "After-school programming in the fall could also take a hit. \u201cIf these funds are blocked, the fallout will be swift and devastating,\u201d Clark said. As many as 926 Boys and Girls Clubs could close, affecting more than 220,000 kids, the group said.",
      "Programs that rely on the money were expecting it to be distributed July 1, but an Education Department notice issued Monday announced the money would not be released while the programs are under review. The department did not provide a timeline and warned that \u201cdecisions have not yet been made\u201d on grants for the upcoming school year.",
      "\u201cThe Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President\u2019s priorities and the Department\u2019s statutory responsibilities,\u201d Education Department officials wrote in the notice, which was obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "The department referred questions to the Office of Management and Budget, which did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In Gadsden City Schools in Alabama, officials say they'll have no choice but to shutter their after-school program serving more than 1,200 low-income students if federal funds aren't released. There\u2019s no other way to make up for the frozen federal money, said Janie Browning, who directs the program.",
      "Families who rely on after-school programs would lose an important source of child care that keeps children safe and engaged while their parents work. The roughly 75 employees of the district's after-school programs may lose their jobs.",
      "\u201cThose hours between after school and 6 o\u2019clock really are the hours in the day when students are at the most risk for things that may not produce great outcomes,\u201d Browning said. \u201cIt would be devastating if we lost the lifeline of afterschool for our students and our families.\u201d",
      "Jodi Grant, executive director of the Afterschool Alliance, said withholding the money could cause lasting damage to the economy.",
      "Some advocates fear the grants are being targeted for elimination, which could force schools to cut programs and teachers. Trump\u2019s 2026 budget proposal called for Congress to zero out all of the programs under review, signaling the administration sees them as unnecessary.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., pressed the administration to spend the money as Congress intended.",
      "\u201cEvery day that this funding is held up is a day that school districts are forced to worry about whether they\u2019ll have to cut back on afterschool programs or lay off teachers instead of worrying about how to make sure our kids can succeed,\u201d Murray said in a statement.",
      "The six grant programs under review include one known as 21st Century Community Learning Centers. It\u2019s the primary federal funding source for after-school and summer learning programs and supports more than 10,000 local programs nationwide, according to the Afterschool Alliance. Every state runs its own competition to distribute the grants, which totaled $1.3 billion this fiscal year.",
      "Also under review are $2 billion in grants for teachers' professional development and efforts to reduce class size; $1 billion for academic enrichment grants, often used for science and math education and accelerated learning; $890 million for students who are learning English; $376 million to educate the children of migrant workers; and $715 million to teach adults how to read.",
      "These programs account for over 20% of the federal money the District of Columbia receives for K-12 education, according to an analysis by the Learning Policy Institute, a think tank. California alone has over $800,000 in limbo, while Texas has over $660,000.",
      "\u201cTrump is illegally impounding billions of dollars appropriated by Congress to serve students this fiscal year,\" said Tony Thurmond, California's state superintendent, in a statement. \u201cThe Administration is punishing children when states refuse to cater to Trump\u2019s political ideology.",
      "The loss of funds could \u201cput several more school districts in extreme financial distress,\u201d said Chris Reykdal, superintendent of public instruction in Washington state. Districts have already adopted budgets, planned programming and hired staff, assuming they'd receive the money, Reykdal said.",
      "If the funding freeze remains, children learning English and their parents would be especially affected. Some districts use the money to pay for summer programming designed for English learners, family engagement specialists who can communicate with parents and professional development training for staff. Rural districts would be hit the hardest.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re trying to send a message,\u201d said Amaya Garcia, who oversees education research at New America, a left-leaning think tank. \u201cThey don\u2019t believe that taxpayer funding should be used for these children.\u201d",
      "Umatilla School District in rural eastern Oregon \u2014 with a sizable population of migrant families and students learning English \u2014 relies heavily on federal funding for its after-school and summer school programs. Superintendent Heidi Sipe says she is meeting with state officials soon to find out if the district will have to plan an early end to summer school, an option 20% of students are using. Come this fall, if federal money stays frozen, she\u2019ll have to lay off staff and eliminate after-school programs attended by around half the district's students.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an essential service in our community because we don\u2019t have any licensed child care centers for school-age children,\u201d she said.",
      "Sipe said it\u2019s particularly frustrating to deal with these funds being put into limbo because the school district was in the middle of a five-year grant period.",
      "\u201cIt feels preventable,\u201d she said, \u201cand it feels as though we could have done a better job planning for America\u2019s children.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The sprawling Republican budget bill approved by the Senate Tuesday removes a proposed tax on solar and wind energy projects but quickly phases out tax credits for wind, solar and other renewable energy.",
      "The Senate approved the bill 51-50 as President Donald Trump and GOP lawmakers move to dismantle the 2022 climate law passed by Democrats under former President Joe Biden. Vice President JD Vance broke a tie after three Republican senators voted no.",
      "The bill now moves to the House for final legislative approval.",
      "The excise tax on solar and wind generation projects was added to the Senate bill over the weekend, prompting bipartisan pushback from lawmakers as well as clean energy developers and advocates.",
      "The final bill removes the tax but mostly sticks with legislative language released late Friday night and would end incentives for clean energy sooner than a draft version unveiled two weeks ago.",
      "Democrats and environmental groups said the GOP plan would crush growth in the wind and solar industry and lead to a spike in Americans\u2019 utility bills. The measure jeopardizes hundreds of renewable energy projects slated to boost the nation\u2019s electric grid, they said.",
      "\u201cDespite limited improvements, this legislation undermines the very foundation of America\u2019s manufacturing comeback and global energy leadership,\u201d said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association. If the bill becomes law, \u201cfamilies will face higher electric bills, factories will shut down, Americans will lose their jobs, and our electric grid will grow weaker,'' she said.",
      "The American Petroleum Institute, the top lobbying group for the oil and gas industry, applauded the bill's passage.",
      "\u201cThis historic legislation will help usher in a new era of energy dominance by unlocking opportunities for investment, opening lease sales and expanding access to oil and natural gas development,'' said Mike Sommers, the group's president and CEO.",
      "While Democrats complained that the bill would make it harder to get renewable energy to the electric grid, Republicans said the measure represents historic savings for taxpayers and supports production of traditional energy sources such as oil, natural gas and coal, as well as nuclear power, increasing reliability.",
      "In a compromise approved overnight, the bill allows wind and solar projects that begin construction within a year of the law's enactment to get a full tax credit without a deadline for when the projects are \u201cplaced in service,'' or plugged into the grid. Wind and solar projects that begin later must be placed in service by the end of 2027 to get a credit.",
      "The bill retains incentives for technologies such as advanced nuclear, geothermal and hydropower through 2032.",
      "Changes to the renewable energy language \u2014 including removal of the excise tax on wind and solar \u2014 were negotiated by a group of Republican senators, including Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Iowa Sens. Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley. Iowa is a top producer of wind power, while Murkowski is a longtime supporter of renewable energy as crucial for achieving energy independence, particularly for isolated rural communities in Alaska.",
      "Murkowski, who voted in favor of the final bill, called her decision-making process \u201cagonizing.\u201d",
      "Changes that push back the timeline for terminating wind and solar credits mean that \u201ca good number\u201d of Alaska projects would still qualify, she said. \u201cAgain, it\u2019s not all we wanted. It could have been worse,\u201d she told reporters Tuesday.",
      "Murkowski praised provisions calling for more oil lease sales in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and other areas in Alaska and increased revenue sharing.",
      "Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, called the bill a \u201cmassively destructive piece of legislation\u201d that \u201cincreases costs for everyone by walloping the health care system, making families go hungry and sending utility bills through the roof.\u201d",
      "The bill \u201csaddles our children and grandchildren with trillions and trillions of dollars in debt \u2014 all to serve giant corporations, fossil fuel polluters and billionaire Republican megadonors who are already among the richest people on the planet,\u201d Whitehouse said.",
      "Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, the No. 2 Senate Republican, hailed the bill for rescinding many elements of what he called the Biden administration\u2019s \u201cgreen new scam,\u201d including electric vehicle tax credits that have allowed car owners to lower the purchase price of EVs by $7,500. The bill also blocks for 10 years a first-ever fee on excess methane emissions from oil and gas production. Industry groups fiercely opposed the methane fee, which was authorized by Democrats in the 2022 climate law but never implemented. The GOP bill also increases oil and gas leases on public lands and revives coal leasing in Wyoming and other states.",
      "\u201cToday, the Senate moved President Trump\u2019s agenda forward,'' said West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican who chairs the Senate environment committee.",
      "Clean energy advocates were deeply disappointed by the bill, which they argue undoes much of the climate law before it fully takes effect.",

    "story": [
      "A federal appeals court has ruled Alabama prosecutors violated the constitutional rights of a man sentenced to death in 1990",
      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- A federal appeals court ruled Alabama prosecutors violated the constitutional rights of a man sentenced to death in 1990, saying Blacks were rejected from the jury during his trial.",
      "The Monday ruling from a three judge panel on the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals means Michael Sockwell, 62, is eligible for a retrial. He was convicted of killing former Montgomery County Sheriff Isaiah Harris in 1988 when he was 26-years old.",
      "The panel issued a 2-1 opinion stating Alabama prosecutors violated Sockwell's 14th Amendment rights by \u201crepeatedly and purposefully\u201d rejecting potential Black jurors who were believed to be more sympathetic to him on the basis of their shared race.",
      "Prosecutors said Harris' wife hired Sockwell to kill Harris because she wanted to cover up an affair she was having and collect Harris' insurance money. There were no witnesses to the shooting. Sockwell, whose attorneys say has a low IQ that disqualifies him from the death penalty, initially told authorities in a videotaped confession that he killed Harris. At his trial, Sockwell testified that officers threatened to beat and kill him before he confessed and deprived him of food and water.",
      "Sockwell then testified that another man, who was having an affair with Harris' wife, committed the killing. Sockwell also denied he ever received money to kill Harris.",
      "The jury voted 7-5 to sentence Sockwell to life in prison, but the judge overruled the decision and sentenced Sockwell to death. Alabama no longer allows a judge to override a jury\u2019s sentence in capital cases.",
      "Attorneys for Sockwell appealed the decision, arguing the prosecutors unconstitutionally used race as the basis for jury selection, rejecting 80% of the Black jurors who were eligible for Sockwell's trial \u2014 compared to only 20% white jurors who were disqualified. The appeal cited notes from the prosecutor that rejected one juror who she described as \u201ca (B)lack male, approximately twenty-three years of age, which would put him very close to the same race, sex, and age of\u201d Sockwell.",
      "Judge Robert J. Luck, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, dissented. Luck emphasized that the prosecutor noted the race of white potential jurors too, a fact Luck said indicated race was not a disqualifying factor for jurors in Sockwell\u2019s case.",

      "Florida law enforcement agencies' cooperation with federal immigration officials is causing concerns among family members and immigrants' rights advocates that people will disappear into county jail systems",
      "MIAMI -- As Florida law enforcement agencies work with federal immigration officials, family members and immigrants' rights advocates worry that people will disappear into county jail systems despite the state's expansive public record laws.",
      "Miami-Dade officials said during a Thursday commission meeting that they are committed to transparency and will continue to follow state laws regarding the release of information about inmates. But one section of an agreement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement designates all records and information created under the agreement as federal records, and some observers say ICE would have the final say on what information is made public, including whether a person is even in custody.",
      "That could be a huge problem, said William Mann, an attorney with the Community Justice Project.",
      "\u201cI think the concerns that many folks have would be that they (county officials) would use this language that\u2019s in this basic ordering agreement ... to prevent loved ones, family members, friends, advocates and journalists from accessing information,\u201d Mann said. \u201cMeaning that they would disappear into the Miami-Dade system if they were technically an ICE prisoner.\u201d",
      "Tricia McLaughlin, the assistant secretary of ICE, told the Associated Press via email that any allegations that detainees do not have due process are false.",
      "\u201cFurther, all detainees are provided ample opportunity to communicate with their attorneys and family members,\u201d McLaughlin said.",
      "She said the easiest way to locate someone in custody is through the ICE detainee locator.",
      "Under Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, local and state officials must take a much more aggressive role in supporting federal immigration enforcement, which has ramped up since President Donald Trump\u2019s return to office in January.",
      "A law 2022 law expanded the state's ban on so-called sanctuary policies and required agencies that operate county detention facilities to enter into agreements with ICE that empower local officers to identify and process \u201cremovable aliens\u201d in their jails.",
      "Another measure signed into law this year requires officials responsible for overseeing local or state law enforcement to use their \u201cbest efforts\u201d to support federal immigration enforcement. Upon the request of a federal agency, county detention centers are also required to provide a list of \u201call inmates\u201d and \u201cany information\u201d about each one's immigration status.",
      "\u201cToday, the Florida Legislature has passed the strongest legislation to combat illegal immigration of any state in the entire country,\u201d DeSantis said earlier this year. \u201cWe are ahead of the curve on ending the illegal immigration crisis.\u201d",
      "Local elected officials who initially balked at signing cooperation agreements with ICE have been threatened by the state attorney general with removal from office.",
      "At Thursday's Miami-Dade commission meeting, the board was scheduled to vote on new provisions for the county's existing ICE agreement but ultimately deferred and chose to let Mayor Daniella Levine Cava ratify the deal herself.",
      "Levine Cava told people who attended the hearing that she had no choice in the matter: \u201cThis is the law of Florida, and it was required that this agreement be signed.\u201d",
      "She and several commissioners noted that any public records the county has jurisdiction over would continue to be publicly available.",
      "While officials in Miami-Dade have said they are committed to transparency, federal inmates, including people on immigration holds, had not been appearing in Orange County jail records until just last week.",
      "Ericka G\u00f3mez-Tejeda, organizing director for Hope Community Center, said officials in the central Florida county took the position that the federal records were not covered by state open records laws, meaning immigrants were effectively disappearing into the system.",
      "G\u00f3mez-Tejeda pointed to the case of Esvin Juarez, who was arrested and deported to Guatemala this month before his family and attorney even knew where he was being held. Making it difficult to track detained immigrants is intentional, she said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s working to the advantage of people\u2019s due process being violated,\u201d G\u00f3mez-Tejeda said.",
      "Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings directed the jail to begin posting information about ICE detainees last week, but G\u00f3mez-Tejeda said that might not help inmates were arrested in other counties or states before being taken to Orange County.",
      "\u201cWe have people who have been sent to four or five different detention centers,\u201d G\u00f3mez-Tejeda said. \u201cAnd each state that you go into, that family then needs to identify an attorney that will then do their representation and their paperwork. So it puts an onerous responsibility on the families.\u201d",
      "U.S. Rep. Maxwell Frost, a Democrat who represents the Orlando area, introduced legislation this month aimed at stopping unlawful detention and ending detainee mistreatment. It would require all ICE facilities to publicly report who is being detained, as well as where, when and why.",
      "\u201cThis bill won\u2019t fix everything, but if Donald Trump and his allies think these policies are defensible, then they shouldn\u2019t be afraid to tell the public exactly what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Frost said. \u201cIf they\u2019re proud of it, they\u2019ll report it. If they\u2019re ashamed, they need to end it.\u201d",

    "published": "Wed, 02 Jul 2025 12:14:13 -0400",
    "summary": "The verdict in the Sean \"Diddy\" Combs trial comes after the high-profile proceedings started in May.",
    "story": [
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs was found guilty Wednesday of transportation to engage in prostitution in his federal trial in New York, but the music mogul was acquitted of the more severe charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking.",
      "Combs was convicted of two counts of the prostitution-related charge. Each count carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. Prosecutors said they'd be seeking a lengthy prison sentence for Combs on the two convictions.",
      "When the verdict was announced, Combs turned around, kneeled down on the ground, put his hands on his chair and prayed. He and his family erupted in loud applause, cheering loudly and whistling.",
      "Following the decision, Combs' lawyers argued for him to be released from custody immediately and be able to return to his Miami home, emphasizing that this was his first conviction. Prosecutors opposed the defense's request and urged Judge Arun Subramanian to keep Combs detained until his sentencing.",
      "Subramanian acknowledged that Combs didn't want to return to a federal detention center in Brooklyn where he'd been in custody since his arrest last September. Combs shook his head no.",
      "The judge asked both the prosecution and defense to submit letters as to why Combs should be released Wednesday or remain detained. Court was expected to resume at 1 p.m. Eastern time.",
      "The developments come after jurors said Tuesday they'd agreed on four of the five counts against Combs but disagreed on racketeering conspiracy. They reached a verdict on all five counts Wednesday morning.",
      "Jurors began deliberating in U.S. District Court in lower Manhattan on Monday. They said they'd reached a partial verdict Tuesday, but Subramanian sent them back to continue deliberating on the remaining count.",
      "What were the charges against Sean \"Diddy\" Combs?",
      "The grand jury indictment against the 55-year-old Combs, unsealed in September 2024, initially charged the hip-hop mogul with three counts following his arrest at a Manhattan hotel. In April, before the trial began, prosecutors filed additional charges, bringing the total number of counts against him to five.",
      "Combs pleaded not guilty to all the charges.",
      "The charges against Combs and each verdict were:",
      "Count 1: Racketeering conspiracy - NOT GUILTYCount 2: Sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion (Casandra Ventura) - NOT GUILTYCount 3: Transportation to engage in prostitution (Casandra Ventura) - GUILTYCount 4: Sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion (\"Jane\") - NOT GUILTYCount 5: Transportation to engage in prostitution (\"Jane\") - GUILTY",
      "Count 1: Racketeering conspiracy - NOT GUILTY",
      "Count 2: Sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion (Casandra Ventura) - NOT GUILTY",
      "Count 3: Transportation to engage in prostitution (Casandra Ventura) - GUILTY",
      "Count 4: Sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion (\"Jane\") - NOT GUILTY",
      "Count 5: Transportation to engage in prostitution (\"Jane\") - GUILTY",
      "\"Jane\" is a pseudonym used in court for an ex-girlfriend of Combs who testified against him.",
      "What is the Mann Act?",
      "The prostitution-related charges allege violations of the Mann Act, a law that makes it a federal crime to transport someone across state lines for prostitution.",
      "The charge of racketeering conspiracy requires prosecutors to prove a number of elements: that there was an agreement among two or more people to participate in a pattern of activity that would affect interstate commerce; that the defendant willfully joined it; and that members of the conspiracy committed two or more racketeering acts. The charging document lists a number of alleged racketeering acts, including kidnapping, bribery, sex trafficking and forced labor.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that Combs' business empire created a criminal enterprise that he used for years to cover up acts of violence and abuse and to coerce women into fulfilling his sexual desires. Jurors heard from more than 30 witnesses over the course of seven weeks as the prosecution went through its case.",
      "Combs denied the accusations but chose not to take the stand to testify in his defense. His attorneys did not call any witnesses during the trial, though they did conduct extensive cross-examinations of the government's witnesses. Combs' lawyers argued the prosecution failed to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.",
      "\"Freak-offs\" part of emotional and graphic testimony",
      "The high-profile trial, which started in May, included graphic and emotional testimony from two of Combs' former girlfriends.",
      "Casandra Ventura, the R&B singer known as Cassie who spent more than a decade with him, testified about drug-fueled sex sessions that Combs allegedly referred to as \"freak-offs.\" Ventura testified that he directed all the encounters, which could last for days, and that she felt forced to participate to make him happy.",
      "Ventura testified that Combs controlled every aspect of her life, and that she often did things out of fear, since physical abuse was \"frequent.\"",
      "Combs' attorneys argued that the encounters were consensual. During cross-examination, the defense showed the jury a 2009 message from Ventura to Combs that read, \"I'm always ready to freak off.\"",
      "Ventura also testified about a 2016 incident which was caught on surveillance video showing Combs beating and kicking her in a California hotel hallway. Combs apologized at the time, saying his behavior was \"inexcusable\" and that he took \"full responsibility\" for his actions.",
      "Ventura testified that the attack happened as she was trying to leave a \"freak-off\" that had turned violent. A former hotel security officer testified that Combs offered him cash after the attack, which the officer said he understood to be a bribe.",
      "Ventura had filed a civil lawsuit against Combs in 2023, accusing him of physically and sexually abusing her. Combs denied the claims and quickly reached a settlement with her. In his closing argument to the jury Friday, defense attorney Marc Agnifilo said, \"If you had to pick a winner in this whole thing, it's hard not to pick Cassie.\"",
      "Another former girlfriend of Combs testified under the pseudonym \"Jane\" to protect her identity. She told the court she often participated in what she called \"hotel nights,\" which also involved drugs. Jane testified she would have sex with a male escort while Combs watched. She said she told Combs many times that she didn't want to have sex with other men and didn't like the \"hotel nights.\"",
      "Combs' lawyers displayed messages showing her setting up \"hotel nights.\" Jane said she felt pressured and that she had grown financially dependent on Combs.",
      "In the prosecution's closing arguments, Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik described Combs as \"the leader of a criminal enterprise. He doesn't take no for an answer. And now you know about many crimes he committed with members of his enterprise.\"",
      "She said he used a \"small army\" of employees to harm women and then cover it up. \"He thought that his fame, wealth and power put him above the law,\" Slavik said.",
      "Agnifilo countered by arguing that prosecutors \"badly exaggerated\" evidence of a swinger lifestyle and threesomes, combining it with recreational drug use and calling it a racketeering conspiracy.",
      "\"He did not do the things he's charged with. He didn't do racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking,\" Combs' lawyer said.",

      "Combs, 55, has\u00a0pleaded not guilty\u00a0to\u00a0all the charges.",
      "The jurors sent a note to the judge late Tuesday afternoon saying they'd reached a verdict on four of the five counts but were unable to agree on count 1. The foreman told Judge Arun Subramanian that the jury was unable to reach a verdict on the racketeering conspiracy charge because they had jurors \"with unpersuadable opinions on both sides.\" The judge told them to keep deliberating, and the jurors were later dismissed for the day.",
      "According to the jury's verdict sheet, there are eight acts under the federal racketeering conspiracy charge: kidnapping, arson, bribery, witness tampering, forced labor, sex trafficking, transportation and inducement to travel for purposes of prostitution, and possession with intent to distribute narcotics.",
      "\"The RICO [Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act] charge is the most serious, the most complex, the most elements, the most difficult to prove and, frankly, the most confusing,\" legal expert Richard Schoenstein, the vice chair of litigation practice at Tarter Krinsky & Drogin, told CBS New York. \"So it doesn't surprise me at all that would be the count that they're currently undecided on.\"",

      "Judge Arun Subramanian began the day by addressing with the prosecution and defense a question posed Monday from the jury about one of the alleged racketeering acts \u2014 possession with intent to distribute drugs \u2014 which relates to the racketeering conspiracy charge Combs is facing. The jury sent a note asking for clarification on the part of the instructions addressing drug distribution.",
      "Subramanian said he would remind jurors of the instructions he gave them on that part of the case before they started deliberating on Monday. Combs' lawyers had pushed for a more expansive response, but prosecutors argued \u2014 and Subramanian agreed \u2014 that doing so could end up confusing jurors more.",
      "An exchange between Subramanian and Combs' defense team got a little testy as they wrangled over the response.",
      "\"Can you do what I'm asking or no?\" the judge asked.",
      "\"Of course I can do what your honor is asking,\" one of the defense lawyers responded.",
      "About 75 minutes into Tuesday's deliberations, the jury requested the testimony from Ventura, one of the prosecution's most important witnesses, when she gave her account of Combs allegedly beating, kicking and dragging her at a Los Angeles hotel in 2016 \u2014 an assault captured on now-infamous security camera footage. Combs apologized after the video surfaced.",
      "The jury also asked to see Ventura's testimony about an incident in which she said Combs accused her of taking drugs from him and kicked her off of their yacht at the Cannes Film Festival in France in 2013. On their way back to the U.S., she said, he threatened to release explicit videos of her having sex.",
      "In addition, the jury asked for Ventura and stripper Daniel Phillip's testimony about her jumping into his lap at a New York City hotel after, as Phillip testified, he suspected Combs had been slapping and slamming her around an adjacent room.",
      "\"Her whole entire body was shaking, like she was terrified,\" said Phillip, who was at the hotel for a sexual encounter with Ventura sometime between 2012 and 2014.",
      "Phillip testified that he asked Ventura why she was with Combs if he was hitting her and beating her. He said he told her she was in real danger. Ventura, he said, \"basically tried to convince me that it was OK, it's OK. I'm fine, I'll be OK.\"",
      "Combs, 55, has\u00a0pleaded not guilty\u00a0to\u00a0federal charges\u00a0of racketeering conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking, and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution for allegedly arranging to fly sex workers across state lines.",
      "The first day of deliberations saw several notes from the jury, as well as Combs and his supporters bowing their heads in prayer in the courtroom. One of the notes came not long after jurors started deliberating and raised concerns from several jurors about another member of the panel. They told the judge they thought \"he cannot follow your honor's instructions.\"",
      "After a discussion between the judge, attorneys for Combs and prosecutors, the judge reminded the jurors of their obligation to follow the law and sent them back to resume their deliberations, but said if more issues should arise, the foreperson should send another note.",
      "To help them come to a verdict, jurors were provided with a laptop loaded with all of the exhibits shown in court, including text messages, photographs and videos of the sexual encounters at the heart of the case.",
      "Five alternate jurors\u00a0are also on standby in case they're needed to fill in on the main jury.",
      "The jury will sift through seven weeks of at times\u00a0graphic and emotional testimony about the rap, fashion and reality TV impresario's propensity for violence and his sexual predilections, including drug-fueled sex marathons dubbed \"freak-offs\" or \"hotel nights.\" Defense lawyers argued that there was no conspiracy and that his conduct did not violate federal laws.",

    "summary": "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' fate is in a jury's hands after listening to weeks of sometimes graphic and emotional testimony.",
    "story": [
      "The jury in Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' sex trafficking case in New York shared concerns about an individual juror with the judge not long after they started deliberating Monday. The first day of deliberations ultimately ended without a verdict.",
      "After more than two hours of legal instructions from federal Judge Arun Subramanian, the jury of eight men and four women headed behind closed doors to deliberate at around 11:30 a.m. Subramanian told the five alternate jurors to remain on standby in case they're needed to fill in on the main jury who are weighing charges that could put the hip-hop mogul in prison for life.",
      "About 10 minutes into deliberations, the jury sent a note indicating they'd completed their first order of business: electing a foreperson.",
      "Less than two hours later, at about 1:25 p.m., a note from the jury was read in court  to inform the judge of concerns regarding one juror's ability to follow the instructions. The jury asked the judge to question this juror. The judge discussed the response with the prosecution and defense and decided to remind the jury of their obligation to follow the law and resume their deliberations.",
      "After the judge originally proposed asking the jury foreperson the nature of concerns about the fellow juror, defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo suggested caution and that less be said rather than more.",
      "\"We can always ratchet it up. We can't ratchet it down,\" Agnifilo said.",
      "In the late afternoon, the jury sent the judge a new note with a question about one of the alleged racketeering acts \u2014 possession with intent to distribute drugs \u2014 stemming from the racketeering conspiracy charge Combs is facing. The judge told the court he'd answer them on Tuesday and dismissed the jury for the day.",
      "Jurors are being provided with a laptop loaded with all of the exhibits shown in court, including text messages, photographs and videos of the sexual encounters at the heart of the case.",
      "Subramanian had stressed to the jury the importance of delivering a unanimous verdict, but also said no juror should surrender their beliefs in order to reach unanimity.",
      "Ahead of the deliberations, CBS News legal contributor Caroline Polisi, a criminal defense attorney, discussed on \"CBS Mornings\" what judges typically tell juries.",
      "\"The judge will instruct the jurors, 'maintain your own integrity with respect to what you believe, but keep an open mind, engage in discussions with other jurors, look at the evidence, see other people's point of view, and if you can with integrity really come over to, you know, the other side, then you can get to unanimity,'\" Polisi said.",
      "As the deliberations got underway, Combs faced his family and supporters in the courtroom gallery. They bowed their heads in prayer \u2014 his family members holding hands with each other. When they finished, they all applauded.",
      "The judge granted Combs' request to have some books with him during the deliberations. On his way out of the courtroom on Monday, Combs showed two books to reporters: \"The Power of Positive Thinking\" and \"The Happiness Advantage.\"",
      "The jury will sift through seven weeks of sometimes graphic and emotional testimony about the rap, fashion and reality TV impresario's propensity for violence and his sexual predilections, including drug-fueled sex marathons dubbed \"freak-offs\" or \"hotel nights.\"",
      "Combs, 55, has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of racketeering conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking \u2014 relating to two of his ex-girlfriends \u2014 and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution for allegedly arranging to fly sex workers across state lines.",
      "Polisi said the prosecution's best chance at getting a conviction could be with the sex trafficking charges.",
      "\"The prosecution made clear there only has to be one instance, out of these hundreds of 'freak-offs,' one instance where it was coerced by force, fraud or coercion, and that can include threats of harm that doesn't even include physical harm,\" Polisi said. \"So that can include fear of financial harm, fear of reputational harm. Remember, he videotaped all of these encounters, and the government laid out specific instances where he threatened to release those tapes.\"",
      "In closing arguments last week, federal prosecutors and Combs' defense team took their last shots at convincing jurors to convict or acquit the Grammy Award-winning founder of Bad Boy Records.",
      "\"The defendant used power, violence and fear to get what he wanted,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik said. \"He thought that his fame, wealth and power put him above the law.\"",
      "She said that he used his \"close inner circle and a small army of personal staff, who made it their mission to meet the defendant's every desire, promote his power and protect his reputation at all costs.\"",
      "Agnifilo countered, \"This isn't about crime. It's about money.\" He noted that one of Combs' accusers in the criminal case also sued him in civil court.",
      "\"He is not a racketeer. He is not a conspirator to commit racketeering. He is none of these things. He is innocent. He sits there innocent. Return him to his family, who have been waiting for him,\" the lawyer told jurors.",
      "In all, 34 witnesses testified, headlined by Combs' former girlfriends Cassie \u2014 the R&B singer born Casandra Ventura \u2014 and \"Jane,\" who testified under a pseudonym. Both women said he often was violent toward them. Cassie said he forced her into hundreds of sexual encounters with paid male sex workers while Jane recounted numerous \"hotel nights.\"",
      "Jurors also saw now-infamous security camera video of Combs beating, kicking and dragging Cassie at a Los Angeles hotel in 2016 and clips from videos of sexual encounters.",
      "Combs chose not to testify, and his lawyers didn't call any witnesses in their defense case. His attorneys elected instead to challenge the accusers' credibility during lengthy cross-examination questioning.",
      "The defense has acknowledged that Combs veered into violence, but his lawyers maintain that the sex acts were consensual. They contend that prosecutors are intruding in Combs' personal life and that he's done nothing to warrant the charges against him.",

      "London \u2014 The BBC has said it regrets not pulling down its live stream of a performance at the Glastonbury music festival over the weekend that included what the broadcaster calls \"utterly unacceptable\" chants against Israel's military.",
      "The taxpayer-funded BBC said in a statement Monday that it regrets not cutting short its live streaming signal after punk-rap duo Bob Vylan started leading a chant of \"Death, death to the IDF,\" during their Saturday performance, referring to the Israel Defense Forces.",
      "\"The BBC respects freedom of expression but stands firmly against incitement to violence,\" the statement\u00a0from the broadcaster said. \"The antisemitic sentiments expressed by Bob Vylan were utterly unacceptable and have no place on our airwaves... The [BBC broadcasting] team were dealing with a live situation but with hindsight we should have pulled the stream during the performance. We regret this did not happen.\"",
      "The BBC, which is CBS News' partner network in the U.K., quickly acknowledged that the language used on Saturday was \"deeply offensive,\" but the network was criticized \u2014 including by Prime Minister Keir Starmer and members of his cabinet \u2014\u2014 for not reacting more quickly after the chant started.",
      "Glastonbury festival's organizers also condemned the chant in a statement, saying: \"Their chants very much crossed a line and we are urgently reminding everyone involved in the production of the festival that there is no place at Glastonbury for antisemitism, hate speech or incitement to violence.\"",
      "The reaction from the Trump administration appeared to be significantly harsher, with Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau saying in a social media post on Monday that U.S. entry visas already issued to Bob Vylan's members had been revoked \"in light of their hateful tirade at Glastonbury, including leading the crowd in death chants.\"",
      "The band's website shows more than a dozen scheduled tour dates in the U.S., from coast to coast, starting in late October.",
      "\"Foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country,\" Landau said in the post.",
      "On Sunday, Bob Vylan posted a lengthy statement on their Instagram\u00a0page, with the caption: \"I said what I said.\"",
      "The duo, who use stage names and keep their identities anonymous, said their message was aimed at younger generations, whom they said should be shown how to fight for their own futures.",
      "\"Let us display to them loudly and visibly the right thing to do when we want and need change,\" the band said. \"Let them see us marching in the streets, campaigning on ground level, organizing online and shouting about it on any and every stage that we are offered.\"",
      "Local police have launched an investigation into the chants to determine whether any criminal offenses may have been committed.",
      "Glastonbury is a five-day music festival that takes place on a farm in the southwest of England. It is one of the largest music festivals anywhere in the world, drawing more than 200,000 ticketholders, and it generally takes place every other year as the organizers give the farm fields time to recover from the impact of so many revelers. The event is hosted and organized by the Eavis family, who still own the farm, and has been running for about 55 years.",
      "Bob Vylan's performance preceded that of Northern Irish rappers Kneecap, whose set the BBC did not air live due to previous instances at the group's concerts involving alleged comments supporting Hamas and Hezbollah and calling for the death of Conservative party lawmakers.",

    "published": "Sun, 29 Jun 2025 10:12:41 -0400",
    "summary": "The fighter for Truth, Justice and the American Way is back on the big screen. Director James Gunn talks about his re-imagining of the Man of Steel, and actor David Corenswet discusses the challenges of taking on the iconic role.",
    "story": [
      "He was born on the planet Krypton. But the Man of Steel comes to life in California, inside an edit room in Burbank. It's there that James Gunn is reviewing a scene from what Warner Brothers hopes is a summer blockbuster: \"Superman.\" With a reported budget of at least $225 million, it arrives in theaters July 11.",
      "It's the first feature from DC Studios, a division of Warner Brothers.\u00a0 Gunn is not only the film's director; he wrote the screenplay, and he's DC's CEO.",
      "\"I feel good about the movie,\" he said. \"And I'm excited about that. And I think we've done something that's different.\"",
      "Among those differences: \"My Superman is not indestructible,\" Gunn said. \"We see him bleed, immediately. At times, I've thought, 'He's too strong.' You don't want him to be able to punch a planet in half or, for that matter, go around a planet a billion times and make time go backwards, you know? I wanted a Superman who was a little bit more down-to-Earth.\"",
      "And few things are more down-to-Earth than a dog. \"The dog is the whole reason \u2013 [it] was the start of the movie for me, a thousand percent,\" Gunn said. \"I adopted a dog. His name is Ozu. And he didn't want to be touched, he had never known human beings. He chewed up all our furniture. He was, you know, chasing the cat, and just being the worst dog you can imagine. And I thought, 'Wow. What if this terrible dog had super powers? I'd really be screwed!'\"",
      "The first Superman feature film came in 1951 with George Reeves, who later played the role on TV. In this century, Superman has been played by Brandon Routh and Henry Cavill. But in the last 75 years, only one big screen Superman has fully captured the audience's imagination: Christopher Reeve.",
      "Trained in the theater, Reeve was a graduate of the Juilliard School in New York \u2013 as is the new Superman, David Corenswet. He is 31 \u2013 seven years older than Reeve was when he made his debut in 1978. \"I don't think there's any way or reason to try to sort of live up to Christopher Reeve,\" Corenswet said. \"I just feel grateful to get to play that character that he embodied and put into the public consciousness in such a positive and strong way.\"",
      "We met Corenswet at the Arden Theatre in Philadelphia. It's Corenswet's hometown, where he still lives, and it's at the Arden where he landed his first paid gig, when he was nine years old: \"All My Sons\" by Arthur Miller.",
      "Like his Superman, Corenswet is immediately disarming, as well as vulnerable, as in a scene with Superman's girlfriend, reporter Lois Lane (played by Rachel Brosnahan).",
      "\"He is definitively different from everybody else on Earth,\" Corenswet said. \"He is not human. He's an alien, and he has these powers that nobody else has. And at the same time, he wants desperately to be a part of humanity. So ultimately, the dramatic stakes of Superman as a character is that he is lonely and he doesn't want to be.\"",
      "He also has a sense of humor about those red shorts. \"Without the trunks, the uniform can look very military,\" Corenswet said. \"So he puts the red underwear on, a) so that everybody can see him, against the blue sky you can see the red trunks, b) so that everybody knows he doesn't take himself too seriously. He's not trying to look cool.",
      "\"Now, that doesn't in any way undermine how badass and cool he is when he's up in the sky fighting the bad guys. But once he touches down, he wants to be the one that people can laugh or make fun of, because he can take it.\"",
      "Superman has been saving the world for nearly nine decades. Created by Jerry Siegel and drawn by Joe Shuster, he first appeared in a comic in 1938.",
      "Asked if Superman represents the signature American movie character, critic and filmmaker Elvis Mitchell said, \"I think he's bigger than that. Spider-Man is tortured. You know, he has to support himself and his aunt, and he's responsible for the death of his uncle. And Batman's responsible for the death of everybody in his line of sight. They're all sufferers.",
      "\"But Superman, he stands tall, and there's a pride of authorship, literally, in the character. 'Cause he's creating his own narrative as his alter ego. People want to see that. They want to believe that you can create your own narrative in a way that is benevolent, even if you have all the power in the world. It's wrong of you to turn away from people who need your help.\"",
      "Asked what he wants audiences around the world to take away from his Superman, Gunn said, \"I think, just culturally, being able to place a little bit more importance on being a good human being. I think we're surrounded by a lot of meanness. I think Superman is surrounded by a lot of meanness in the movie. But he stands against that grain. And that's what makes him rebellious.",
      "\"And in a way, I think today, in today's world, Superman's the edgier, more rebellious character because he's the one who's standing up for the values that most people are not,\" he said.",
      "Corenswet is embracing the challenge, fully aware that success could mean Superman defines his career. He said, \"When you take a role that's gonna be this visible and this iconic, even just visually iconic, and it's your face and the underwear, yeah, I wanted to be prepared for the possibility that it wouldn't lead to a bunch of other things, that this would be the thing.",
      "\"And I felt really lucky that when I asked myself that question the answer came back, somebody's gotta play this part, and if you're the person to play it and you give up everything else to do it, it would be worth doing.\"",

      "Attorney Marc Agnifilo mocked the government's case against Combs and belittled the agents who seized hundreds of bottles of Astroglide lubricant and baby oil at his properties as he began his four-hour presentation Friday in a New York courtroom.",
      "\"Way to go, fellas,\" he said of the agents.",
      "He said prosecutors had \"badly exaggerated\" evidence of a swinger lifestyle and threesomes to combine it with recreational drug use and call it a racketeering conspiracy.",
      "\"He did not do the things he's charged with. He didn't do racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking,\" the lawyer said.",
      "Agnifilo said of Combs: \"He sits there innocent. Return him to his family who have been waiting for him.\"",
      "Agnifilo called Combs' prosecution a \"fake trial\" and ridiculed the notion that he engaged in racketeering. \"Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?\" Agnifilo asked. \"Did any witness get on that witness stand and say yes, I was part of a racketeering enterprise \u2014 I engaged in racketeering?\" No, Agnifilo argued, telling jurors that those accusations were a figment of the prosecution's imagination.",
      "The lawyer argued prosecutors had invaded Combs' most intimate personal affairs, telling jurors: \"Where's the crime scene? It's your sex life.\"",
      "Agnifilo also argued there's another factor at play in the allegations that women have lobbed against Combs: the prospect of draining him of his wealth through lawsuits.",
      "\"This isn't about crime. It's about money. This is about money,\" Agnifilo said.",
      "In the prosecution's rebuttal, Assistant U.S. Attorney Maurene Comey said Agnifilo had spent \"a whole lot of energy\" trying to distract from Combs' \"inexcusable behavior.\"",
      "\"Make no mistake,\" Comey told jurors, \"this trial was about how in Sean Combs' world, 'no' was never an option.\"",
      "In his closing argument, Agnifilo reiterated that the defense \"owns\" the fact that Combs was violent but argued that behavior does not justify the grave charges against him.",
      "Combs and R&B singer\u00a0Cassie Ventura Fine\u00a0had a \"loving, beautiful relationship,\" albeit a \"complicated\" one, Agnifilo said. \"If racketeering conspiracy had an opposite, it would be their relationship,\" Agnifilo said. \"They were deeply in love with each other.\"",

      "Jurors are expected to begin deliberating on Monday.",
      "Combs' family, including six of his children and his mother, were in the audience for the defense's closing, which took place a day after the prosecution made its closing arguments Thursday \u2014 after calling on 34 witnesses over the course of seven weeks. Combs' ex-girlfriend, Ventura Fine, and rapper\u00a0Kid Cudi, were among those who testified.",
      "The trial of Combs, 55, began on May 12. Prosecutors allege he relied on employees, resources and influence of his business empire to create a criminal enterprise that engaged in \u2014 or attempted to engage in \u2014 \"sex trafficking, forced labor, interstate transportation for the purposes of prostitution, coercion and enticement to engage in prostitution, narcotics offenses, kidnapping, arson, bribery and obstruction of justice.\"",
      "Combs has denied the allegations against him and\u00a0pleaded not guilty\u00a0to five counts. If convicted, he could face up to life in prison.",
      "Combs has been present at the trial but told U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian earlier this week that he decided not to testify.",
      "\"I mean, it's my decision with my lawyers. ... My decision to make. I'm making it,\" he said.",

Slavik said Combs \"counted on silence and shame\" to allow his abuse to continue. She also said he used a \"small army\" of employees to harm women and then cover it up.",

    "summary": "Scientists conducting medical research are facing an existential crisis: Layoffs and budget cuts pushed by President Trump that, they say, jeopardize finding a cure for cancer.",
    "story": [
      "They might easily be mistaken for Congressional staffers, reluctant to face the day, but these are among the most accomplished cancer specialists in the country, meeting with Representatives, Senators and staff. Among them: Dr. Elizabeth Jaffee, deputy director of the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center, from up the road in Baltimore; and Dr. George Weiner, a cancer specialist in Iowa for more than 35 years, who has flown in frequently to lobby Congress for more research funds.",
      "Lobbying for cancer research, he says, used to be like pushing on an open door. \"Most of the time when I've come, I've met with Democrats and Republicans, and we talked about the bipartisan support for cancer research,\" Weiner said. \"This is the first time that I felt there was an existential crisis in our ability to make the type of progress that I see in front of us.\"",
      "These days, the conversation is all about thousands of layoffs \u2026 delays in research \u2026 massive budget cuts \u2013 close to a 40% proposed cut in funding for the National Cancer Institute.",
      "\"I wake up every morning looking at my phone: Did I get an email from the National Cancer Institute saying I'm no longer receiving my grants?\" said Jaffee.",
      "Has she felt the impact yet? \"Oh, yeah, we certainly have felt the impact, to the point where people are leaving,\" Jaffee replied. \"So, in our clinical research operation, which takes years to build, train research nurses, takes two years to train coordinators, takes six to 12 months, these people are leaving because the funding isn't coming in.\"",
      "I asked, \"If they keep cutting back, how long before Dr. Jaffee says, 'That's it'?\"",
      "\"I have to be honest, there are days when I do feel that,\" she replied. \"But I look around and I feel like I would be disloyal to our patients. We are in a technological revolution in cancer research. We are rapidly making discoveries that we couldn't even do ten years ago.\"",
      "\"What price do you put on life?\"",
      "Kevin Callahan was a Marine in Vietnam when he barely survived stepping on a land mine. Decades later, he was diagnosed with a killer disease: pancreatic cancer. First came surgery and chemo. Now, he's part of a clinical trial, which is where Dr. Jaffee and her colleague Dr. Neeha Zaidi come in, working to develop a vaccine to prevent pancreatic cancer from recurring.",
      "I asked Callahan, \"When you see some of the debates that are going on right now, and it relates to the National Cancer Institute and NIH \u2026\"",
      "\"It raises the hair on the back of my neck,\" he replied.",
      "Beth Callahan wasn't all that sure about the clinical trial at first, but Kevin couldn't stop thinking about all that had gone into it \u2013 getting chemotherapy as an approved treatment. \"They would shoot me up with three drugs, and the fourth one I would go home with a little bag on my chest, and it wouldn't come out until Friday. It had to be done over 40 hours. I thought to myself, 'How many poor bastards went through tests to get that done?' So I thought, 'If there's anything that I can do, I'm more than happy to go in with the study and see if I can help somebody else later on, [to] develop this vaccine.'\"",
      "Pancreatic cancer is particularly nasty, even when, as with Kevin, it's detected early. The experimental vaccine they've been administering to him is promising, but according to Jaffee, the chances of recurrence are 80%, and the chances of a patient being alive in five years is 20%.",
      "Yet, Kevin is four-and-a-half years out, without recurrence, \"part of a small cohort of patients who received the vaccine on that trial who are, like him, doing well without recurrence,\" Jaffee said.",
      "I asked, \"Could it be anything other than the vaccine?",
      "Jaffee replied, \"We don't believe so. This is not a cancer where sometimes it looks less aggressive than other times. This is a cancer that uniformly \u2013 it doesn't matter who you are \u2013 it comes back.\"",
      "And so far, it has not. Kevin says, \"Bottom line, I'm cancer free.\"",
      "Now the Callahans are concerned the cuts at the NIH could interfere with \u2013 or even stop \u2013 Kevin's vaccine trial.",
      "I said, \"They claim that they're not cutting back on any of the science, on any of the people who are really doing the research.\"",
      "\"I don't believe that for a minute,\" said Kevin.",
      "Asked if it is worth the money invested by taxpayers, Beth responded: \"What price do you put on life? It's our lives. It's our children's lives. It's our grandchildren's lives. What price do you put on that? We're not just talking about cutting funding to individual research programs. We're talking about NIH, which is a gift that we have had in this country for decades. Why would we give that up as a country?\"",
      "Located just outside of Washington, D.C., the National Cancer Institute is the crown jewel of the National Institutes of Health. It is also the most expensive. Its budget last year was $7 billion.",
      "Dr. Weiner noted, \"Mary Lasker, who was a brilliant woman and a force of nature who worked with Richard Nixon on the original war on cancer, would say, 'If you think research is expensive, try disease.'\"",
      "The Trump administration is proposing cutting that $7 billion cancer budget down to about $4.5 billion. Weiner thinks that America's widely-recognized position as the world's leader in medical research is at a tipping point. \"Progress is gonna be proportional to investment,\" he said. \"So, progress is not gonna totally stop if funding drops dramatically. But the more it drops and the longer it drops, the slower progress will be.",
      "\"But that's not the case for patients,\" he said. \"Our job as researchers is to bring those advances to help those patients as soon as possible, because those patients can't wait.\"",
      "That would describe Natalie Phelps' dilemma to a T.",
      "\"When is cancer political?",
      "Natalie Phelps has Stage 4 metastatic colorectal cancer. \u00a0She and her husband, Jeff, live out in Washington State.",
      "\"We have one boy, one girl, and a giant German Shepherd, very average American,\" she said. \"And I had always hoped, if I needed a clinical trial, I was like, 'I'm gonna get to the NIH. I'm gonna go to the top place in the world.'\"",
      "Phelps was invited to NIH for testing to determine if she qualified for a promising breakthrough immunotherapy treatment that has shrunk tumors in about a quarter of the patients with gastrointestinal cancers. \u00a0She said, \"When I was invited to go back, I had cancer patients congratulating me. They were like, 'You made it!' It's like making it into the Olympics when you're a cancer patient.\"",
      "The clinical trial is run by Dr. Steven Rosenberg, a legend in the field of cancer research who is still practicing in his mid-eighties. \"Well, she's a young woman with a metastatic cancer, and so that's a desperate situation. Every patient we see here at the National Cancer Institute has been through all standard treatments that haven't worked. And they come here to the NIH, the National Institutes of Health, of Hope, trying to see if some experimental treatments might be of help to them.\"",
      "In late May, Natalie Phelps finally qualified for Rosenberg's clinical trial. But budget cuts at NIH had already slowed the trial down. NIH has lost about 1,500 employees.",
      "\"We did lose two technicians that are involved in producing the materials that are used to treat patients,\" Rosenberg said.",
      "\"And would that cause a significant delay?\" I asked. \"When I say 'significant,' I mean in Natalie's case she feels that it has been delayed by a month. Is that correct?\"",
      "\"That's correct.\"",
      "\"A month could be critical for her.\"",
      "\"It certainly can when you have metastatic cancer that's growing,\" Rosenberg said.",
      "That one-month delay means Natalie's specialized immune cell therapy won't be ready until late July. I said to her, \"I don't even know what seems like an appropriate question. You must be devastated.\"",
      "\"Well, yeah, Ted,\" she replied. \"I was diagnosed in 2020 during COVID, after giving birth to my second child. And I had to spend the first bit of my child's life changing diapers and doing bottles with the chemotherapy pump attached to me. I've done 48 rounds of chemotherapy. I've had multiple aggressive surgeries and radiation. And I have been in treatment for five years, hoping that I can raise her, but at the very least let her have a memory of who her mother was.",
      "\"I have endured so much, and now I have another hurdle just because of funding cuts?\" she said. \"I mean, my husband and I can't believe it. When is cancer political?\"",
      "In a recent online statement, NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya pushed back on concerns about budget cuts and employee layoffs. He said, \"As to the current re-organization, no clinical trial has been delayed, nor has any participant been dropped from any clinical trial\u2026\"",
      "Natalie Phelps is just one patient, one case out of many; but her participation in a clinical trial was delayed, because two specialized technicians were let go.",
      "And that delay has proved to be devastating. She sent us a video message a couple of days ago from NIH:",
      "\"I got my test results back today and I didn't pass,\" she said. \"I have several new brain tumors, and it's not safe for me to participate in the trial. The earliest I could get back here for treatment would be about six weeks after having the tumors radiated, provided that the radiation's successful. I don't know. It's a long time.\"",
      "As for the budget cuts that caused the layoffs that produced the delay, it probably won't help much to learn that they were nothing personal.",

      "Gavi says it has helped vaccinate more than 1.1 billion children in 78 low income countries and prevented more than 18.8 million deaths since its creation 25 years ago. Its focus is getting vaccines, especially new vaccines, to populations that would struggle to afford them or access them otherwise.",
      "Kennedy argued in the video that GAVI \"has neglected the key issue of vaccine safety,\" and that \"when vaccine safety issues have come before Gavi, Gavi has treated them not as a patient health problem, but as a public relations problem.\"",
      "Kennedy accused GAVI of ignoring the science and said the alliance must \"justify the $8 billion the U.S. has given it since 2001.\"",
      "The U.S. has long been among the top government contributors to Gavi's funding, which also comes from private organizations.",
      "The Biden administration had committed to $1.6 billion in funding for the organization from 2026 through 2030 \u2014 an amount roughly equal to the funding pledged by the private Gates Foundation \u2014 and shock and outrage reverberated across the conference in Brussels after Kennedy's announcement.",
      "Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft and the Gates Foundation, said on social media that the move would have \"devastating consequences.\" He called on the U.S. Congress to keep funding Gavi, warning that if it did not, \"more sick kids will fall behind in school,\" and there would be \"more overcrowded hospital wards and eventually more grieving parents.\"",
      "\"If Congress allows this to happen, the consequences will be devastating,\" Gates Foundation CEO Mark Suzman said. \"Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of preventable deaths will occur, especially among mothers and children.\"",
      "Dr. Atul Gawande, a public health researcher and surgeon at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston who previously held a seat on the Gavi board, said Kennedy would be held personally responsible for the results of halted U.S. government funding, which he called a \"travesty and a nightmare.\"",
      "\"I would expect to see significant changes and reductions in access to safe and effective vaccines to children, in the poorest and most vulnerable countries of the world,\" one U.S. official with decades of experience in global health and vaccination programs told CBS News on the condition of anonymity. \"Kennedy's rhetoric on vaccine safety is not helpful and is likely to fuel vaccine hesitancy in the minds of people across the world, where we will surely now see more uncontrolled outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. This is very unfortunate.\"",
      "The U.N.'s World Health Organization has warned since 2019 that vaccine hesitancy and mistrust is one of the leading threats to global public health.",
      "The goal of this year's conference was to secure funding to reach the organization's target of over 90% global coverage with essential vaccines for a wide range of diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus and measles. Gavi received more than $9 billion in funding commitments on Wednesday, but it had hoped to garner $11.9 billion for the next five years, with the goal of immunizing 500 million children globally.",
      "Other countries acknowledged Gavi's importance, and increased their contributions at the conference on Wednesday.",
      "Topping that list was the U.K.",
      "British Foreign Secretary David Lammy announced $1.7 billion for the coming five years, making the U.K. Gavi's new largest donor.",
      "Ghana's President John Darami Mahama, addressing the Gavi conference on Wednesday, began by detailing his younger brother's struggle with polio, and the stigma associated with the disease, which has been virtually eradicated worldwide thanks to vaccination programs launched in the late 1980s.",
      "\"I understand the importance of vaccines,\" Mahama told the delegations.",
      "When his brother was diagnosed, vaccine access in Ghana was close to zero, but the president said that, through partnership with Gavi, 97% of the population was now vaccinated.",
      "He said officials were still working to reach the last 3% \u2014   about \"65,000 children who are in remote areas, difficult to reach for life saving vaccines\" \u2014 and that Ghana planned to no longer need Gavi's support by 2030.",
      "Mahama concluded his remarks with a topical comparison, saying: \"One B-2 Spirit Bomber that dropped bombs on Iran cost $2.13 billion,\" and that he had done the math, adding: \"Surely the world can afford the value of four B-2 bombers to save 500 million children. It's a choice we have to make.\"",

      "In a lawsuit filed Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, the athletic and lifestyle apparel company claims that certain Costco products imitate its own designs so closely that it constitutes \"trade dress\" infringement, which occurs when a product mimics another so closely that it confuses consumers.",
      "The apparel company claims that Costco's \"knockoff\" designs, or product \"dupes,\" violate trademark law because \"some customers incorrectly believe these infringing products are authentic Lululemon apparel.\" In other cases, \"customers specifically purchase the infringing products because they are difficult to distinguish from authentic Lululemon products,\" the lawsuit alleges.",
      "\"Indeed, one of the purposes of selling 'dupes' is to confuse consumers at the point-of-sale and/or observers post-sale into believing that the 'dupes' are Plaintiffs' authentic products when they are not,\" the lawsuit alleges.",
      "Lululemon refers to itself in the lawsuit as a \"path-breaking\" apparel company that has set a new standard for performance athletic wear, adding that its \"construction techniques\" and \"strategic fits\" help it stand out to consumers.

    "published": "Wed, 02 Jul 2025 10:53:45 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration is withholding over $6 billion in funding for after-school and summer programs, English language instruction and more.",
    "story": [
      "Day camp providers and schools say the Trump administration's funding freeze could ruin summer for low-income American families and jeopardize some after-school programs next year.",
      "The administration is holding back over $6 billion in federal grants for after-school and summer programs, English language instruction, adult literacy and more as it conducts a review to ensure grants are aligned with President Trump's priorities.",
      "The move creates uncertainty for states and schools as they budget for programs this summer and in the upcoming school year because they don't know if or when they'll receive the funding. Democrats say the administration is flouting the law by holding back congressionally appropriated money.",
      "Without the funds, schools say they won't be able to provide free or affordable after-school care for low-income kids while their parents work and may not be able to hire staff to teach children who are learning English. Classes or camps underway this summer could be in jeopardy, too.",
      "The Boys and Girls Clubs of America depend on some of this funding to run their camps and other summer programming for low-income students. If it's not restored soon, the programming could end mid-season, said Boys and Girls Club President Jim Clark.",
      "After-school programming in the fall could also take a hit. \"If these funds are blocked, the fallout will be swift and devastating,\" Clark said. As many as 926 Boys and Girls Clubs could close, affecting more than 220,000 kids, the group said.",
      "Programs relying on the money were expecting it to be distributed July 1, but an Education Department notice issued Monday announced the money would not be released while the programs are under review. The department didn't provide a timeline and warned that \"decisions have not yet been made\" on grants for the upcoming school year.",
      "\"The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President's priorities and the Department's statutory responsibilities,\" Education Department officials wrote in the notice, which was obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "The department referred questions to the Office of Management and Budget, which did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In Gadsden City Schools in Alabama, officials say they'll have no choice but to shutter their after-school program, which serves more than 1,200 low-income students, if federal funds aren't released. There's no other way to make up for the frozen federal money, said Janie Browning, who directs the program.",
      "Families who rely on after-school programs would lose an important source of child care that keeps children safe and engaged while their parents work. The roughly 75 employees of the district's after-school programs may lose their jobs.",
      "\"Those hours between after school and 6 o'clock really are the hours in the day when students are at the most risk for things that may not produce great outcomes,\" Browning said. \"It would be devastating if we lost the lifeline of afterschool for our students and our families.\"",
      "Jodi Grant, executive director of the Afterschool Alliance, said withholding the money could cause lasting damage to the economy.",
      "Some advocates fear the grants are being targeted for elimination, which could force schools to cut programs and teachers. Mr. Trump's 2026 budget proposal called on Congress to zero out all of the programs under review, signaling the administration sees them as unnecessary.",
      "Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington pressed the Trump administration to spend the money as Congress intended.",
      "\"Every day that this funding is held up is a day that school districts are forced to worry about whether they'll have to cut back on afterschool programs or lay off teachers instead of worrying about how to make sure our kids can succeed,\" Murray said in a statement.",
      "The six grant programs under review include one known as 21st Century Community Learning Centers. It's the primary federal funding source for after-school and summer learning programs and supports more than 10,000 local programs nationwide, according to the Afterschool Alliance. Every state runs its own competition to distribute the grants, which totaled $1.3 billion this fiscal year.",
      "Also under review are $2 billion in grants for teachers' professional development and efforts to reduce class size; $1 billion for academic enrichment grants, often used for science and math education and accelerated learning; $890 million for students who are learning English; $376 million to educate the children of migrant workers; and $715 million to teach adults how to read.",
      "These programs account for over 20% of the federal money the District of Columbia receives for K-12 education, according to an analysis by the Learning Policy Institute, a think tank. California alone has over $800,000 in limbo, while Texas has over $660,000.",
      "\"Trump is illegally impounding billions of dollars appropriated by Congress to serve students this fiscal year,\" said Tony Thurmond, California's state superintendent, in a statement. \"The Administration is punishing children when states refuse to cater to Trump's political ideology.",
      "The loss of funds could \"put several more school districts in extreme financial distress,\" said Chris Reykdal, superintendent of public instruction in Washington state. Districts have already adopted budgets, planned programming and hired staff, assuming they'd receive the money, Reykdal said.",
      "If the funding freeze remains, children learning English and their parents would be especially affected. Some districts use the money to pay for summer programming designed for English learners, family engagement specialists who can communicate with parents and professional development training for staff. Rural districts would be hit the hardest.",
      "\"They're trying to send a message,\" said Amaya Garcia, who oversees education research at New America, a left-leaning think tank. \"They don't believe that taxpayer funding should be used for these children.\"",
      "Umatilla School District in rural eastern Oregon \u2014 with a sizable population of migrant families and students learning English \u2014 relies heavily on federal funding for its after-school and summer school programs. Superintendent Heidi Sipe says she is meeting with state officials soon to find out if the district will have to plan an early end to summer school, an option 20% of students are using. Come this fall, if federal money stays frozen, she'll have to lay off staff and eliminate after-school programs attended by around half the district's students.",
      "\"It's an essential service in our community because we don't have any licensed child care centers for school-age children,\" she said.",
      "Sipe said it's particularly frustrating to deal with these funds being put into limbo because the school district was in the middle of a five-year grant period.",
      "\"It feels preventable,\" she said, \"and it feels as though we could have done a better job planning for America's children.\"",

Robert Keeley, owner of Keeley Electronics, a roughly 33-person guitar pedal company in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, told CBS MoneyWatch he used the points, rather than cash, to cover the tariffs.",

So I thought it would be clever to apply them to my bills for tariffs,\" Keeley said, noting that the charge is only a sliver of his tariff-related cost. \"It sounds like a lot of points, and that gives you a sense of how much I am paying in tariffs.\"",
      "Keeley emphasized he doesn't like depending on China for manufacturing his company's wares, saying that amounts to what he described as a \"single point of failure.\" Although he hasn't yet raised prices for customers to offset the higher costs, the business may have no choice but to do so if stiff tariffs on Chinese imports remain in place, he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I want to make sure I am releasing exciting products that the world wants to buy,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If I don't pay attention to what I'm trying to sell and what people want, then I will go out of business. But for now, I am in a stable place.\"",

    "story": [
      "Paramount will settle President Trump's lawsuit over a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Kamala Harris for $16 million, the company announced late Tuesday.",
      "CBS News' parent company worked with a mediator to resolve the lawsuit. Under the agreement, $16 million will be allocated to Mr. Trump's future presidential library and the plaintiffs' fees and costs. Neither Mr. Trump nor his co-plantiff, Texas Rep. Ronny Jackson, will be directly paid as part of the settlement.",
      "The settlement did not include an apology.",
      "Paramount also agreed that \"60 Minutes\" will release transcripts of interviews with presidential candidates in the future, \"subject to redactions as required for legal or national security concerns,\" the statement said.",
      "Mr. Trump's lawsuit, filed last October when he was still a candidate for president, was widely viewed as an attack on the First Amendment. He took issue with CBS News airing two different portions of Harris' response to a question about the Middle East, one in an early excerpt on \"Face the Nation\" and the other on the full broadcast of \"60 Minutes.\"",
      "The lawsuit was filed in Amarillo, Texas, a portion of a federal district court where the sole judge is a 2019 Trump appointee, and it was based on a state consumer protection law that is intended to prevent advertisers from misleading the public about a product being sold. CBS News is not headquartered in Texas, nor did the interview take place there.",
      "He initially sought $10 billion in damages when he filed suit last October but upped his demand to $20 billion in February after adding a federal claim alleging false advertising and unfair competition. Jackson, a Texas Republican, joined Mr. Trump as a plaintiff in the amended complaint.",
      "Paramount has maintained that the lawsuit was completely without merit and that \"60 Minutes\" followed a standard editing process. The show's executive producer, Bill Owens, stood behind the show's interview and said he would not apologize. He announced in April that he would depart the network, citing a loss of editorial independence.",
      "Weeks later, Wendy McMahon, who served as president and CEO of CBS News and Stations and CBS Media Ventures, announced she was also departing. \"It's become clear that the company and I do not agree on a path forward,\" she wrote in a note to staffers.",
      "First Amendment scholars and constitutional experts largely viewed the lawsuit as a frivolous misapplication of the law.",
      "Geoffrey R. Stone, a First Amendment scholar and law professor at the University of Chicago, explained, \"That statute is about sales \u2014 a salesperson can be held liable for stating that a product has certain positive effects when he knows it doesn't. But CBS is not engaged in advertising here.\"",
      "Constitutional law expert and Harvard professor Noah Feldman called the case an \"outrageous violation of First Amendment principles.\"",
      "Politicians had also spoken out about the suit, urging Paramount Global Chair Shari Redstone not to settle. The day after McMahon announced her departure, Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden sent a letter to Redstone raising concerns that efforts to settle with Mr. Trump would amount to bribery. Redstone had recused herself from settlement talks.",
      "In an April Truth Social post, Mr. Trump said he was \"honored\" to be suing CBS and Paramount. He also urged Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr to \"impose the maximum fines and punishment\" against CBS in connection with a news distortion complaint, which was filed by a conservative group over the same Harris interview. Outgoing FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel dismissed the complaint in January before former President Biden's term ended, but Carr reopened it days after Mr. Trump took office and appointed him to the role.",
      "Back in February, CBS complied with an FCC inquiry to hand over the transcript and videos from the Harris interview, simultaneously releasing those files to the public.",
      "CBS sought dismissal of the FCC complaint in a March filing, writing, \"The Complaint filed against CBS for 'news distortion' envisions a less free world in which the federal government becomes a roving censor \u2014 one that second guesses and even punishes specific editorial decisions that are an essential part of producing news programming.\"",
      "The news distortion complaint remains open and under investigation.",
      "The FCC's approval is necessary for Paramount's $8.4 billion merger with Skydance Media to move ahead, and the agency didn't make a decision on the transaction by the informal 180-day deadline to review mergers, which passed in May. Carr said Thursday that the FCC was still reviewing the transaction.",
      "If completed, the Paramount-Skydance merger will cap off a long, turbulent sales process that attracted multiple potential bidders. Talks between Skydance and Paramount's corporate parent, National Amusements, were briefly called off before the sides resumed negotiations and clinched a deal in July 2024.",

    "published": "Tue, 01 Jul 2025 18:17:20 -0400",
    "summary": "The Senate budget bill would have imposed an excise tax on certain wind and solar projects with foreign materials.",
    "story": [
      "The Senate bill containing President Trump's domestic policy agenda at the last minute eliminated a new excise tax that would have hammered the renewable energy industry, a move that likely ensured Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska would back the measure.",
      "The excise tax would have been imposed on wind and solar energy projects constructed with a certain percentage of materials sourced from prohibited foreign countries, like China. Consumers would see their energy prices rise by around 8% to 10%, and the provision would have cost clean energy businesses an additional $4-$7 billion by 2036, according to an analysis by the American Clean Power Association.",
      "The tax was designed to boost domestic manufacturing, but developing these projects by working around Chinese components was likely to be cost prohibitive.",
      "The Senate bill also made another key concession: it would phase out wind and solar tax credits for clean energy development on a slower timeline than originally proposed, ensuring that projects that have already been planned, financed and approved would still receive the applicable tax credit, as long as they begin construction before June 2026, or are operational by the end of 2027.",
      "But this is still a major modification from the original timeline for the wind and solar tax credit \u2014 which wasn't due to expire until 2032 \u2014 and it still puts clean energy developers in peril, according to environmental groups.",
      "Joanna Slaney, vice president for political and government affairs for the Environmental Defense Fund, said in an email to CBS News, \"By making it much, much harder to build new clean energy projects, the bill is effectively cutting off supply of cheap energy right when the U.S. needs it the most.\"",
      "Environmental groups said few gains were to be found in the bill.",
      "\"If there's a bright spot, it is that the Senate bill would preserve tax credits for newer technologies like advanced nuclear, battery storage, geothermal energy, and carbon capture, as well as advanced manufacturing,\" Nathaniel Keohane, president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, said in a statement.",
      "The final bill passed by the Senate would largely terminate numerous tax incentives from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act for clean energy, electric vehicles, and energy efficiency programs that benefited consumers. It would end tax credits for new and used electric vehicles, installation of home EV charging equipment and insulation or energy efficient heating and cooling systems. The bill also ends the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which gives funding to nonprofit organizations providing financing for projects that reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions in communities.",
      "A new analysis by the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions predicted that the changes in the Senate bill would eliminate more than 1.6 million jobs, cause more than $290 billion in lost GDP, increase U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 8% by 2035 and increase the cost of energy by 4% per megawatt.",
      "Climate and environmental groups expressed concern about how the reduction of key tax incentives for clean energy production and energy efficiency will affect the public.",
      "\"The bill will raise energy costs and make it harder to keep the lights on,\" said Steven Nadel in a statement, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. \"No one asked Congress to make their energy bills even higher. Taking away incentives for energy-saving improvements would raise monthly bills for families and businesses. It will only exacerbate the growing strain on the electric grid.\"",
      "The bill now returns to the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson is intent on meeting Republicans' self-imposed July 4 deadline to get the bill to President Trump's desk. To do so, the House will have to pass the Senate version unchanged. Any alteration would mean the bill would have to be considered by a conference committee to reconcile the differences. That's what Murkowski would prefer. \"We do not have a perfect bill by any stretch of the imagination,\" she told reporters Tuesday. \"My hope is that the House is going to look at this and recognize that we're not there yet.\"",

    "story": [
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.",
      "Speaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.",
      "\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact \u2014 in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"",
      "Powell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Trump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.",
      "President Trump has\u00a0repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.",
      "The president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.",
      "Although Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.",
      "The Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate \u2014 what banks charge each other for overnight loans \u2014 steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.",
      "\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.",
      "Powell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.",
      "\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\"",

      "Read on to find which cities have the most to offer U.S. workers.",
      "Which cities have the best overall job market?",
      "Bend, Oregon, has the top job market in the United States, according to SmartAsset. The West Coast city notched points for its low unemployment rate (3.1%) and high income growth. From 2020 to 2023, the median income in Bend grew 44% \u2014 the fourth highest rate after Richmond, Virginia, (50%); Nampa, Idaho, (47%); and Dayton, Ohio, (45%).",
      "A hub for outdoor recreation, Bend also stands out for its work-life balance. The median commute time for workers in Bend is 16 minutes, with just over a quarter of the city's population working remotely.",
      "Trailing Bend in the No. 2 and No. 3 spots for best overall job markets are Richmond, Virginia, and Seattle, Washington.",
      "Which cities have the highest percentage of health care coverage for workers?",
      "For workers looking for solid health care coverage, a move to Santa Clara, California, may be worth considering. Over 88% of the population in the southern Bay Area city have private health insurance plans through their employer. Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Bellevue, Washington, follow close behind with roughly 87% of their residents having health coverage through their employers.",
      "Which cities have the shortest commutes?",
      "Spending large chunks of time sitting on a train or stuck in traffic is not conducive to good work-life balance. For that reason, cities with the shortest commute times contribute to top job market rankings in SmartAssets' study.",
      "With a median commute time of roughly 14 minutes, workers in Wichita Falls, Texas, have one the shortest commute times in the country, according SmartAsset. Abilene, Texas, and Topeka, Kansas, workers also spend less time in transit than others, with median commutes of around 14 and 15 minutes, respectively.",
      "Which cities are remote-work friendly?",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's promise to eliminate federal income tax on worker tips could soon come to fruition after the Senate passed President Trump's massive budget package.",
      "One part of the legislation, the centerpiece of the Trump administration's economic agenda, would provide workers who rely on tips for a large share of their income, such as waiters, bartenders and hairdressers, with relief from federal income tax on those tips.",
      "The White House has framed the tax cuts as a win for the working class. But critics such as the Independent Restaurant Coalition have pushed back on that notion, saying the benefits for tipped workers would be temporary and that this apparent tax cut wouldn't help most low-wage workers.",
      "Senators narrowly approved the legislation, which Republicans call the \"one big, beautiful bill,\" on July 1 by a vote of 51-50. The measure now returns to the House for sign off. Mr. Trump has vowed to swiftly sign the bill and urged lawmakers to approve it by July 4.",
      "How would \"no tax on tips\" work?",
      "The \"no tax on tips\" provision in the spending bill would create a new deduction for tipped workers, eliminating what they owe in federal income tax. Tipped workers would still have to pay state and local income tax and payroll taxes.",
      "The House and Senate versions\u00a0of the tax and spending bill vary on a few key points, including how much a worker could claim in deductions. The Senate proposal limits that deduction to $25,000, while the House version is uncapped.",
      "Under the House measure, meanwhile, only people with annual income of $160,000 or less would qualify for the tipping tax break, while the Senate version would phase out benefits for individuals whose income exceeds $150,000 or couples whose income exceeds $300,000.",
      "Notably, however, under the budget bill those tip tax cuts would extend only through 2028, and so Congress could restrict or even abolish the tax break in future.",
      "Who would benefit?",
      "A May\u00a0report\u00a0from the White House's Council of Economic Advisers estimates that eliminating taxes on tips for eligible workers would increase their average take-home pay by $1,675 per year.",
      "According to the White House, a June survey found that 83% of hourly workers support eliminating taxes on tips. \"These results suggest that any measure increasing the amount of immediately available income \u2014 such as untaxed tips \u2014 would provide meaningful, stabilizing support for a large segment of the hourly workforce,\" according to that report.",
      "Data\u00a0from the Yale Budget Lab shows that roughly 4 million people \u2014 2.5% of the American workforce \u2014 worked in tipped jobs as of 2023. But given the way the budget bill is written, not all would benefit. The nonpartisan policy research center notes in a recent\u00a0analysis that over a third of tipped workers in the U.S. are already exempt from federal income tax because their earnings are too low.",
      "\"A deduction for tipped work is actually a pretty horrible way to help low-wage workers,\" Ernie Tedeschi, the director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You're only helping a narrow slice of them, and it's not helping the lowest of low-wage workers because they don't have any federal tax liability to begin with.\"",
      "Only about 4% of workers who earn less than $25 per hour also get tips, the group has found. As a result, low-wage servers at many restaurants would qualify for the tax break, but fast-food employees would not despite earning similar incomes.",
      "\"It's going to help some very, very high earners, along with some middle earners,\" Sylvia Allegretto, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The lion's share of low-wage workers, it's not going to touch because they're not tipped workers.\"",
      "A better way to helps low-wage workers, labor advocates say, would be to raise the federal minimum wage, which has been stuck at $7.25 an hour since 2009.",
      "\"It's not that these workers pay too much in taxes or that taxes are a problem,\" Allegretto said. \"The problem is they just don't earn enough money.\"",

      "Additionally, cost increases for parts and other intermediate inputs could take time to work their way through supply chains before they show up in consumer prices.",

      "Aggressive \"front-loading\"",
      "After the Trump administration announced a range of tariffs on Canada, China, Mexico and dozens of other countries earlier this year, many companies scrambled to stock up, or front-load, on products, parts and other imports to\u00a0avoid incurring added tariff costs.",

      "The Trump administration in April froze most of its tariffs for 90 days to allow time for negotiations, with that pause due to expire on July 9. And after announcing tariffs of as much as 145% on Chinese imports earlier this year, Mr. Trump and Chinese officials on Thursday said the two countries have agreed on the framework for a trade deal.",
      "\"We have had literally dozens of changes in tariff policy in the last five months. In that highly uncertain environment, companies that sell items that are subject to tariff may be cautious about raising prices immediately,\" Charley Ballard, professor of economics emeritus at Michigan State University, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Companies often refrain from raising prices to avoid scaring away consumers and losing market share to competitors.",
      "Added Daco: \"Essentially, some business decided to not immediately pass on the cost. They said, 'Let's see if we can hold out for a month, delay some imports, use the inventory on hand and be creative in terms of our broader pricing strategy'.\"",
      "Although tariffs are paid by importers, which typically pass those costs on to consumers, some foreign exporters have also been willing to take a hit.",
      "Lower tariff costs",
      "Although Mr. Trump has announced sky-high tariff rates, the actual duties collected at the U.S. border so far are lower than the official rates. That's because some importers have been able to skirt the levies by storing goods in so-called bonded warehouses or foreign trade zones.",
      "Businesses can use bonded warehouses, which are usually located near major commercial ports, to temporarily store goods, components and other inputs without immediately having to pay tariffs or taxes.",
      "\"If you make use of a warehouse or so-called foreign trade zone, you are able to delay the payment of tariffs until these goods are put into commerce,\" Daco said. \"So it's a free-trade zone, or imaginary area that is not subject to tariffs.\"",
      "Additionally, the U.S. has implemented a number of tariff exemptions and exclusions. In practice, that has resulted in the actual levies on imports often being lower than the nominal rate initially announced by the White House.",
      "As of June, the effective U.S. tariff rate on all imports was around 10%, compared with an official average tariff rate of 15%.",
      "Still, business can't hold the line on price hikes indefinitely if tariffs remain elevated, experts say. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u00a0told lawmakers this week\u00a0that tariffs could yet spark higher inflation, likely starting this summer,",
      "\"Part of that is due to the start-stop nature of the tariffs that have been introduced,\" James Rossiter, head of global macro strategy at TD Securities, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"For us it's a question of patience more than a mystery as to where it is,\" he added. \"The typical pass-through takes some time. We expect July to be when you start to see it more.\"",

    "summary": "Elon Musk, the world's richest person, reignited his criticism Monday of the Trump-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk ramped up his criticism of the massive tax and domestic policy package working its way through the Senate on Monday, suggesting he could support primary challenges against Republicans who vote for the Trump-backed bill.",
      "\"Every member of Congress who campaigned on reducing government spending and then immediately voted for the biggest debt increase in history should hang their head in shame!\" the billionaire and onetime Trump ally wrote in a post on X. \"And they will lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth.\"",
      "In a separate post, Musk said he will support Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who voted against the bill when it passed the House, leading Mr. Trump to back a primary challenge.",
      "Musk also suggested starting \"a new political party that actually cares about the people\" on Monday, an idea he first floated earlier this month. He said if the bill passes, a new political party \u2014 which he calls the \"America Party\" \u2014 \"will be formed the next day.\"",
      "Musk's latest swipes came as the Senate worked to advance the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, holding a marathon series of amendment votes on Monday. The Senate still needs to vote on final passage, and the House will need to approve the Senate's changes, before a self-imposed July 4 deadline to send the bill to Mr. Trump's desk.",
      "It's unclear how serious Musk is about the apparent threat to back primary challenges against supporters of the legislation \u2014 or what support, if any, he could offer to challengers. But it suggests Musk could remain involved in politics, after spending upwards of $250 million to help elect Mr. Trump and other Republicans last year. The Tesla CEO indicated last month he planned to dial back his political spending for now, saying, \"I think I've done enough.\"",
      "The vast majority of House and Senate Republicans have backed the bill, though some lawmakers have withheld their support, objecting to its Medicaid cuts or arguing it doesn't go far enough to slash spending. Mr. Trump has applied intense pressure to Republicans and lashed out at the remaining holdouts: In a statement last weekend, the White House said \"failure to pass this bill would be the ultimate betrayal.\"",
      "Musk has railed against the legislation on and off for weeks. The billionaire blasted the bill in early June, calling it a \"disgusting abomination\" \u2014 igniting a dayslong feud between President Trump and the world's richest man that seemed to signal the end of a once close partnership.",
      "The billionaire, who once led the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, backed down in mid-June and acknowledged some of his attacks on Mr. Trump \"went too far.\" He remained fairly quiet about the legislation for weeks, but his criticism has intensified in recent days, as lawmakers rush to finalize the bill by the end of the week.",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0lashed out at Musk in an early Tuesday morning Truth Social post that noted Tesla has benefitted from federal electric vehicle tax credits \u2014 a program the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would phase out. The president also suggested DOGE should \"take a good, hard, look at\" other subsidies Musk has benefitted from.",
      "\"Elon may get more subsidy than any human being in history, by far, and without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa. No more Rocket launches, Satellites, or Electric Car Production, and our Country would save a FORTUNE,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "Musk responded to Mr. Trump's message: \"I am literally saying CUT IT ALL. Now.\"",
      "Why is Musk opposed to Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\"?",
      "Many of Musk's criticisms zero in on the bill's price tag, calling its spending levels \"insane\" and attacking a provision in the Senate version of the bill that hikes the debt ceiling by $5 trillion.",
      "But the billionaire has also panned the bill's cuts to green energy tax credits and excise tax on certain renewable energy projects, calling those provisions \"utter madness\" that could \"destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country.\"",
      "Those provisions could directly impact Musk's electric carmaker, Tesla. The phaseout of electric vehicle tax credits may cost the company $1.2 billion, an analysis by JPMorgan Chase estimated. Tesla's solar power and energy storage businesses also benefit from government incentives, and ending those programs \"may harm our business\" by \"making our products less competitive for customers,\" the company disclosed in an annual report filed earlier this year.",

      "GE Appliances executive Lee Lagomarcino said U.S. trade policy was the driving factor in the company's recent decision to accelerate a plan to move overseas jobs back to the U.S.",
      "\"Any time we decide to move a factory or redesign a platform, it's an expensive endeavor, so we have to think through the strategy and trajectory of market,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch in discussing GE Appliances' move to expedite a shift in production of its washers and dryers from China to the U.S. in order to avoid having to pay\u00a0stiffer tariffs.",
      "\"This was the right time to strike on the business opportunity given the environment with tariffs,\" added Lagomarcino, vice president, clothes care, at GE Appliances.",
      "GE Appliances on June 26\u00a0announced it would invest $490 million in a laundry care manufacturing plant in Kentucky that would create 800 new American jobs. In a statement last week, GE Appliances CEO Kevin Nolan said the reshoring effort \"aligns with the current economic and policy environment.\"",
      "The company, which has long planned to reshore manufacturing to the U.S., said that high levies on\u00a0imports from China\u00a0under Mr. Trump have impelled the household appliance maker to \"accelerate the decision-making,\" Lagomarcino, GE Appliances' vice president of clothes care, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Once the plant is fully up and running, the company, a Haier subsidiary, will cease manufacturing in China. \"That factory will turn off when the factory in Louisville, Kentucky turns on,\" said Lagomarcino, adding that he expects the Kentucky plant to be operational by early 2027.",
      "What jobs is GE creating in the U.S.?",
      "The company is looking to fill research and development, engineering and supply chain positions at the Kentucky plant, openings for which it's already started posting on its careers site.",
      "\"We anticipate a lot of hiring for some skilled trades, and technically advanced manufacturing roles,\" Lagomarcino said. \"Our research and development team leader will need to hire more engineers, and our supply chain leader will have to hire to fill jobs.\"",
      "Why now?",
      "The investment in domestic manufacturing comes as a host of U.S. companies\u00a0announce plans\u00a0to reshore operations as they face added costs from Mr. Trump's tariff agenda.",
      "But the main force behind the production move to Louisville is GE's \"zero distance\" philosophy of building appliances where they are sold, the company said in the announcement.",
      "\"U.S. manufacturing allows us to be closer to the consumer and the team that designs and markets the products and is involved in the whole product development lifecycle,\" said Lagormarcino. \"Philosophically, and from a manufacturing and design standpoint, it makes sense.\"",
      "That said, the move makes even more sense with tariff increases in place, according to Lagormarcino.",
      "\"With tariffs or without tariffs, we think it's a good long-term strategy. But when you add tariffs, they introduce costs to the situation, and it does accelerate those actions,\" he said.",

      "More than 95% of the fireworks sold in the U.S. come from China, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. And while sales of pyrotechnics have grown in past years as more states and counties loosen restrictions, tariffs have snarled some firework importers' plans this year.",

      "The additional tax on wind and solar projects, which appeared on page 558 in the version of the bill released over the weekend, is estimated to increase consumer energy prices 8% to 10% and would tax clean energy businesses an additional $4-$7 billion by 2036, according to an\u00a0analysis by the American Clean Power Association.",
      "The tax would apply to all projects that go into construction after June 16 through 2036, and it would also apply to projects that are placed into service after 2027, even if they already are under construction.",
      "Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski told Politico Monday that she planned to introduce an amendment that would tie eligibility for the wind and solar tax credits to a project's construction start date, rather than its service date. The Senate is currently holding a marathon vote series on\u00a0proposed amendments to the bill.",
      "These wind and solar projects would have to pay the tax if a certain percentage of the value of their materials are sourced from prohibited foreign countries, like China. The provision is ostensibly designed to boost domestic manufacturing, but developing these projects by working around Chinese components would be cost prohibitive, and some data and AI companies \u2014 which require prodigious amounts of energy \u2014 could turn to China or other countries for reliable and affordable power sources, according to clean power experts.",
      "The Senate bill also scales back or eliminates renewable energy tax breaks that have been in place since 2005 and revised and expanded a few times since then, including in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The most recent expansion contained tax breaks for individuals for electric vehicles, wind and solar development, and energy efficient appliances and provided tax credits for clean electricity-generating projects that went into service from 2023 through the end of 2032.",
      "Both the Senate and the House would end the renewable energy tax credits, but the Senate would accelerate the timeline in the House version, which would end the tax credits for renewable energy projects placed in service after 2028, a year later than the Senate would.",
      "Eliminating the existing tax credits would likely kill up to 72% of the new wind and solar installations that were to be completed in the U.S. over the next decade, according to analysis from Rhodium Group, a research firm.",
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who until Saturday was silent on the bill after his social media spat with President Trump over the House version, said of the Senate bill that it was \"Utterly insane and destructive.\"",
      "\"It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future,\" he said in a post on X. And he predicted it would \"destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country!\" Musk also said, \"A massive strategic error is being made right now to damage solar/battery that will leave America extremely vulnerable in the future.\"",
      "According to Politico, President Trump asked Senate Majority Leader John Thune to further \"crack down\" on wind and solar energy by phasing out clean energy credits faster, rather than sunsetting the tax incentives more slowly, which moderate senators favored. Some asked for help easing the hit their states would take as a result of cancelled projects, job losses and higher energy prices.",
      "The renewable energy industry, manufacturing unions and even some conservatives also criticized the new tax.",
      "Conservative energy expert Alex Epstein, advocates ending the green tax credits, but he appeared to be taken by surprise by the excise tax, saying in a post on X, \"I just learned about the excise tax and it's definitely not something I would support.\"",
      "The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also quickly condemned the tax.",
      "Neil Bradly, the Chamber's executive vice president, said on social media, \"taxing energy production is never good policy, whether oil & gas or, in this case, renewables.\u00a0 Electricity demand is set to see enormous growth & this tax will increase prices. It should be removed.\"",
      "The North American Building Trades Union, in a statement, called the bill potentially \"the biggest job-killing bill in the history of this country.\"",
      "\"Simply put, it is the equivalent of terminating more than 1,000 Keystone XL pipeline projects,\" the statement continued. \"In some cases, it worsens the already harmful trajectory of the House-passed language, threatening an estimated 1.75 million construction jobs and over 3 billion work hours, which translates to $148 billion in lost annual wages and benefits.\"",

    "story": [
      "New Yorkers have a new logo in town as Luckin Coffee, a popular Chinese coffee chain, announces its debut in the United States.",
      "The Starbucks rival opened its first two stores in New York City on Monday, as the Xiamen-based coffee purveyor sets out to expand its market and garner favor with U.S. customers. The two Manhattan storefronts are located at 755 Broadway in Greenwich Village and 800 6th Ave in Chelsea.",
      "The Chinese company first announced its U.S. arrival last week,\u00a0posting on Instagram, \"Drip level: International. The rumors are true, NYC. You're luckin now.\" Since then, the chain has been teasing \"soft openings\" on its social media accounts, offering promotional deals to get customers in the door.",
      "Luckin did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "Rapid growth in Asia",
      "Since launching in 2017, Luckin has scaled rapidly to over 24,000 stores, with locations in China, Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong, according to a recent financial report. Despite hiccups, including an accounting fraud scandal, and $475 million in losses last year as the company poured hundreds of millions of dollars into coffee beans, store rent and other costs, Luckin's profit margins have rapidly ballooned. This past quarter, the coffee chain made $1.2 million in revenue, a 41% increase from the year prior.",
      "The store's app-based concept, contrived by founder Jenny Zhiya Qian, was intended to echo that of a ride-hailing business, according to an analysis by the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.",
      "To purchase an item, Luckin customers browse the coffee store's menu and make payments directly online. This is a \"100% cashier-less environment,\" Luckin states\u00a0on its website, adding that the app-based store model is intended to maximize efficiency and keep costs low. The company's beverages in China are 30% cheaper than Starbucks beverages in the country, according to CNN.",
      "Luckin's menu offers a range of drinks from traditional items like matcha and lattes to more unconventional choices like its \"fruity Americano\" series. It also has a small pastry menu including a banana yogurt loaf,\u00a0 chocolate-chip cookie and a sausage, egg and cheese croissant, among other offerings.",
      "Competition with Starbucks",
      "Luckin's entr\u00e9e into the U.S. coffee market is a direct challenge to Starbucks, which is in the midst of revamping its brand image through the \"Back to Starbucks\" campaign as it struggles against declining sales and revenue.",
      "With more than 17,000\u00a0locations across the country, Starbucks has the upper hand in the U.S. In China, however, the Seattle-based coffee giant lost its hold to Luckin in 2023, the Wall Street Journal reported.",
      "Significantly cheaper menu items and a convenient in-app ordering model boded well for Luckin in China, though it remains to be seen if the same exact strategy will be applied in the U.S. market.",
      "A quick glance at Luckin's in-app menu shows that prices on key items are more or less on par with those at U.S. Starbucks stores. A 16-ounce drip coffee at Luckin, for instance, goes for $3.45 compared with $3.65 at Starbucks. A 16-ounce iced matcha, meanwhile, costs $6.45 at Luckin, or 20 cents more than the $6.25 equivalent at Starbucks. A bagel at both companies goes for $3.25.",
      "According to Luckin, the company has over 120 million registered app users. That's far more than Starbucks, which also offers customers the ability to order via app. In January, the Seattle-based company said it had 34 million people in its membership rewards program, which is run through the app and online.",

    "story": [
      "Hundreds of thousands of workers across more than a dozen cities and states will soon receive higher pay, thanks to minimum wage hikes set to take effect July 1.",
      "More than 800,000 workers in two states \u2014Alaska and Oregon \u2014 as well as Washington, D.C., will be impacted by higher minimum wages that go into effect July 1, according to the left-leaning economic think tank Economic Policy Institute (EPI). Additionally, a dozen cities and counties are also set to boost their baseline pay rates next month.",
      "The higher minimum wages come as the federal baseline rate remains at $7.25 an hour, where it's been parked since 2009. As the cost of living has crept higher in subsequent years, some states and municipalities have boosted their own minimum wages through a combination of ballot measures, inflation adjustments and legislation.",
      "\"These minimum wage increases will put more money in workers' pockets, helping many of them and their families make ends meet,\" EPI state economic analyst Sebastian Martinez Hickey wrote in a post about the higher pay. \"The average increase in annual wages for a full-time, year-round worker resulting from these minimum wage hikes ranges from $420 in Oregon to $925 in Alaska.\"",
      "About 58% of the workers who will receive pay hikes are women, while Black and Hispanic workers will also disproportionately benefit, according to the EPI's analysis.",
      "For example, in states where the minimum wage will increase in July, Black workers make up 7% of workers who will receive raises, but only 4.5% of the wage-earning workforce. Similarly, nearly 27% of Hispanic workers will see their wages rise, though they make up just over 13% of the wage-earning workforce.",
      "While the federal minimum wage hasn't budged in 16 years, there have been periodic attempts to boost it, with the latest coming from Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, who earlier this month introduced legislation to increase the national baseline wage to $15 per hour. He was joined by Vermont Democratic Sen. Peter Welch as a co-sponsor.",
      "Pay hikes in Alaska, D.C., and Oregon",
      "Alaska's baseline wage will rise by $1.09 to $13.00 an hour, which was approved via a ballot measure passed by voters. The boost will impact 6.3% of the state's workforce, or 19,400 people, who will see an average annual pay increase of $925, EPI calculates.",
      "In Washington, D.C., 7.5% of the workforce, or 62,200 workers, will benefit from the minimum wage rising by 45 cents to $17.95 an hour, thanks to an inflation adjustment formula. With the new minimum in place, a full-time worker in the nation's capital will earn an additional $727 in annual wages, on average, according to the EPI's calculations.",
      "Oregon's minimum wage will rise 35 cents to $15.05 an hour on July 1, also through an inflation adjustment, boosting pay for 9.4% of the state's workforce, or 801,700 workers. The average pay hike will equate to $420 annually.",

    "summary": "Three members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission were fired by President Trump in May.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's administration asked the Supreme Court on Wednesday to allow him to fire three members of the independent Consumer Product Safety Commission.",
      "The request to the high court by Solicitor General D. John Sauer arose from a federal judge's decision earlier this month that found Mr. Trump's removal of the three commissioners \u2014 Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric and Richard Trumka Jr. \u2014 was unlawful and blocked their terminations.",
      "The officials had been named to the five-member Consumer Product Safety Commission by former President Joe Biden for seven-year terms. Boyle's term was set to end in October, Hoehn-Saric's time on the panel was due to end in October 2027 and Trumka's in October 2028. The commission sets consumer product safety standards, can order product recalls and bring civil suits against companies.",
      "The three members were told in May that their positions were terminated, effective immediately. Under federal law, a president cannot remove a commissioner at-will, but only for neglect of duty or malfeasance. Removal restrictions like those governing the Consumer Product Safety Commission have been put in place by Congress to insulate independent agencies from politics. But Mr. Trump has sought to test his removal powers through a series of firings targeting members of those entities.",
      "Following their firings, the commissioners sued and asked a federal judge in Maryland, where the Consumer Product Safety Commission is headquartered, to restore them to their positions. They succeeded in their bid earlier this month, when U.S. District Judge Matthew Maddox allowed the three commissioners to resume their roles.",
      "\"Depriving this five-member commission of three of its sitting members threatens severe impairment of its ability to fulfill its statutory mandates and advance the public's interest in safe consumer products,\" Maddox wrote in his decision. \"This hardship and threat to public safety significantly outweighs any hardship defendants might suffer from plaintiffs' participation on the CPSC.\"",
      "A unanimous panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit declined to block the district court's decision and allow Mr. Trump to fire the commissioners.",
      "The commissioners, Judge James Wynn wrote in a brief opinion, \"were appointed to serve fixed terms with statutory protections designed to preserve the commission's independence and partisan balance. Permitting their unlawful removal would thwart that purpose and deprive the public of the commission's full expertise and oversight. And because the attempted removals were unlawful, the Plaintiff-Commissioners never ceased to lawfully occupy their offices.\"",
      "Sauer's emergency appeal to the Supreme Court is the third involving the president's power to remove executive officers, which the administration has argued is generally unrestricted.",
      "The justices in May cleared the way for Mr. Trump to remove without cause two members of two federal independent labor boards while legal fights over their terminations move forward. Over the dissent of the three liberal justices, the high court said in its unsigned decision that it \"reflects our judgment that the government faces greater risk of harm from an order allowing a removed officer to continue exercising the executive power than a wrongfully removed officer faces from being unable to perform her statutory duty.\"",
      "Sauer said that May decision from the high court regarding the earlier removals should have foreclosed the reinstatement of the Consumer Product Safety Commission members. The district court's order, he wrote, effectively transfers control of the panel from Mr. Trump to three members who were appointed by his predecessor.",
      "\"That plain-as-day affront to the President's fundamental Article II powers warrants intervention now,\" the solicitor general wrote.",
      "Sauer asked the high court to act immediately and issue a brief administrative stay that would allow it more time to consider his request for emergency relief. Lawyers for the commissioners opposed that request for swift action, noting that they have been serving in their roles in the nearly three weeks since the district judge ruled in their favor.",
      "The Trump administration, the lawyers said, did not identify any harm that would stem from the commissioner's continued service during the time it will take for the Supreme Court to rule.",

      "The House Rules Committee advanced the Senate's changes to the bill overnight, setting up a possible dramatic floor vote in the coming hours. Debate and a key procedural vote were expected in the lower chamber Wednesday.",

The House passed an earlier version of the bill in May.",
      "House Democrats dragged out the process on the Rules Committee overnight and early into the morning\u00a0by submitting hundreds of amendments to be debated in the committee, similar to the way Senate Democrats delayed final passage by forcing the entire bill to be read on the floor and insisting on votes on dozens of amendments.",
      "\"All legislative tools and options are on the table,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said after the Senate vote Tuesday.",
      "Democratic Rep. Maxwell Frost of Florida said of their strategy that \"the longer this bill in the ether, the more unpopular it becomes.\"",
      "Democrats weren't alone in their resistance to the revised bill. GOP Reps. Ralph Norman of South Carolina and Chip Roy of Texas joined Democrats on the panel to oppose the rule, as a handful of hardline conservatives said they'd reject the Senate's changes.",

      "As Friday's self-imposed deadline quickly approaches, it's still unclear if House Republicans have enough support to get it over the finish line. Members have continued to voice their discontent with pieces of the tax and spending package that squeaked through the Senate. Possible holdouts, including moderates and members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, were meeting with Mr. Trump at the White House Wednesday.",

      "Republicans can only afford three defections, if all members are present and voting.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, has spent weeks pleading with his Senate counterparts not to make any major changes to the version of the bill that passed the lower chamber by a single vote in May. He said the Senate bill's changes \"went a little further than many of us would've preferred.\"",

      "Other controversial provisions that faced pushback in both chambers, including the sale of public lands in nearly a dozen states, a 10-year moratorium on states regulating artificial intelligence and an excise tax on the renewable energy industry, were stripped from the Senate bill before heading back to the House.",
      "Johnson said Tuesday night that he was having \"lots of discussion with lots of members about lots of ideas\" as several potential holdouts called for the bill to be reverted to the House-passed version. GOP leaders, however, said the House would vote on the Senate bill \"as-is.\"",

      "Should the House make changes to the bill, the revisions would require the Senate's approval, or force the two chambers to go to conference committee to iron out a final product that the two bodies could agree on, jeopardizing the bill's timely passage.",
      "Meanwhile, the White House was expected to continue to pressure House Republicans to get the bill across the finish line. In a Truth Social post\u00a0Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump urged the GOP to get the bill done, saying to his party, \"don't let the Radical Left Democrats push you around.\"",

Rob Bresnahan and Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Reps. David Valadao and Young Kim of California.",
      "\"It's unconscionable, it's unacceptable, it's un-American, and House Democrats are committing to you that we're going to do everything in our power to stop it,\" Jeffries said. \"All we need are four Republicans, just four.\"",

    "summary": "The Trump administration is withholding over $6 billion in funding for after-school and summer programs, English language instruction and more.",
    "story": [
      "Day camp providers and schools say the Trump administration's funding freeze could ruin summer for low-income American families and jeopardize some after-school programs next year.",
      "The administration is holding back over $6 billion in federal grants for after-school and summer programs, English language instruction, adult literacy and more as it conducts a review to ensure grants are aligned with President Trump's priorities.",
      "The move creates uncertainty for states and schools as they budget for programs this summer and in the upcoming school year because they don't know if or when they'll receive the funding. Democrats say the administration is flouting the law by holding back congressionally appropriated money.",
      "Without the funds, schools say they won't be able to provide free or affordable after-school care for low-income kids while their parents work and may not be able to hire staff to teach children who are learning English. Classes or camps underway this summer could be in jeopardy, too.",
      "The Boys and Girls Clubs of America depend on some of this funding to run their camps and other summer programming for low-income students. If it's not restored soon, the programming could end mid-season, said Boys and Girls Club President Jim Clark.",
      "After-school programming in the fall could also take a hit. \"If these funds are blocked, the fallout will be swift and devastating,\" Clark said. As many as 926 Boys and Girls Clubs could close, affecting more than 220,000 kids, the group said.",
      "Programs relying on the money were expecting it to be distributed July 1, but an Education Department notice issued Monday announced the money would not be released while the programs are under review. The department didn't provide a timeline and warned that \"decisions have not yet been made\" on grants for the upcoming school year.",
      "\"The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President's priorities and the Department's statutory responsibilities,\" Education Department officials wrote in the notice, which was obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "The department referred questions to the Office of Management and Budget, which did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In Gadsden City Schools in Alabama, officials say they'll have no choice but to shutter their after-school program, which serves more than 1,200 low-income students, if federal funds aren't released. There's no other way to make up for the frozen federal money, said Janie Browning, who directs the program.",
      "Families who rely on after-school programs would lose an important source of child care that keeps children safe and engaged while their parents work. The roughly 75 employees of the district's after-school programs may lose their jobs.",
      "\"Those hours between after school and 6 o'clock really are the hours in the day when students are at the most risk for things that may not produce great outcomes,\" Browning said. \"It would be devastating if we lost the lifeline of afterschool for our students and our families.\"",
      "Jodi Grant, executive director of the Afterschool Alliance, said withholding the money could cause lasting damage to the economy.",
      "Some advocates fear the grants are being targeted for elimination, which could force schools to cut programs and teachers. Mr. Trump's 2026 budget proposal called on Congress to zero out all of the programs under review, signaling the administration sees them as unnecessary.",
      "Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington pressed the Trump administration to spend the money as Congress intended.",
      "\"Every day that this funding is held up is a day that school districts are forced to worry about whether they'll have to cut back on afterschool programs or lay off teachers instead of worrying about how to make sure our kids can succeed,\" Murray said in a statement.",
      "The six grant programs under review include one known as 21st Century Community Learning Centers. It's the primary federal funding source for after-school and summer learning programs and supports more than 10,000 local programs nationwide, according to the Afterschool Alliance. Every state runs its own competition to distribute the grants, which totaled $1.3 billion this fiscal year.",
      "Also under review are $2 billion in grants for teachers' professional development and efforts to reduce class size; $1 billion for academic enrichment grants, often used for science and math education and accelerated learning; $890 million for students who are learning English; $376 million to educate the children of migrant workers; and $715 million to teach adults how to read.",
      "These programs account for over 20% of the federal money the District of Columbia receives for K-12 education, according to an analysis by the Learning Policy Institute, a think tank. California alone has over $800,000 in limbo, while Texas has over $660,000.",
      "\"Trump is illegally impounding billions of dollars appropriated by Congress to serve students this fiscal year,\" said Tony Thurmond, California's state superintendent, in a statement. \"The Administration is punishing children when states refuse to cater to Trump's political ideology.",
      "The loss of funds could \"put several more school districts in extreme financial distress,\" said Chris Reykdal, superintendent of public instruction in Washington state. Districts have already adopted budgets, planned programming and hired staff, assuming they'd receive the money, Reykdal said.",
      "If the funding freeze remains, children learning English and their parents would be especially affected. Some districts use the money to pay for summer programming designed for English learners, family engagement specialists who can communicate with parents and professional development training for staff. Rural districts would be hit the hardest.",
      "\"They're trying to send a message,\" said Amaya Garcia, who oversees education research at New America, a left-leaning think tank. \"They don't believe that taxpayer funding should be used for these children.\"",
      "Umatilla School District in rural eastern Oregon \u2014 with a sizable population of migrant families and students learning English \u2014 relies heavily on federal funding for its after-school and summer school programs. Superintendent Heidi Sipe says she is meeting with state officials soon to find out if the district will have to plan an early end to summer school, an option 20% of students are using. Come this fall, if federal money stays frozen, she'll have to lay off staff and eliminate after-school programs attended by around half the district's students.",
      "\"It's an essential service in our community because we don't have any licensed child care centers for school-age children,\" she said.",
      "Sipe said it's particularly frustrating to deal with these funds being put into limbo because the school district was in the middle of a five-year grant period.",
      "\"It feels preventable,\" she said, \"and it feels as though we could have done a better job planning for America's children.\"",

      "The Federal Bureau of Investigation has selected a new headquarters building in Washington, D.C., after nearly two decades of failed attempts to find a permanent new space, the Bureau announced on Tuesday.",
      "The FBI has been headquartered in downtown D.C. at the J. Edgar Hoover building since 1975 but structural problems have plagued the building for the last 20 years, leading to redevelopment and relocation projects that until Thursday had not successfully been resolved.",
      "\"This is a historic moment for the FBI,\" FBI Director Kash Patel said in a statement, adding he is \"ushering FBI Headquarters into a new era and providing our agents of justice a safer place to work.\"",
      "The Bureau and the U.S. General Services Administration selected the Ronald Reagan Building, blocks away from the Hoover building, as the new location. It was home to the U.S. Agency for International Development until this year, when the Trump administration consolidated USAID into the State Department and allowed Customs and Border Protection to take over the building's lease.",
      "\"Moving to the Ronald Reagan Building is the most cost effective and resource efficient way to carry out our mission to protect the American people and uphold the Constitution,\" Patel continued.",
      "It is unclear when the FBI will begin its transition out of the Hoover building.",
      "In a March speech at the Justice Department, President Trump said his administration is \"going to build another big FBI building right where it is, which would have been the right place, because the FBI and the DOJ have to be near each other.\"",
      "\"They were going to build an FBI headquarters three hours away in Maryland, a liberal state,\" Mr. Trump said, adding that the state's political leadership had \"no bearing\" on his decision to cancel a previous Biden administration plan to move the headquarters to Maryland.",
      "During his first term, Mr. Trump abandoned a plan to move the FBI to one of three locations in Maryland or Virginia, instead proposing a smaller headquarters in Washington to replace the Hoover building.",
      "Under the Biden administration in 2023, the GSA\u00a0chose a site in Greenbelt, Maryland, to serve as the new location for the FBI headquarters. The decision came after a 15-year debate on whether the headquarters should be relocated to Maryland or Virginia.",
      "Democratic members of Congress from Maryland blasted the decision to scrap plans for a new Maryland headquarters, saying that Congress \"appropriated funds specifically for the purpose of the new, consolidated campus to be built in Maryland.\"",
      "\"Simply moving down the street would ignore the real threats the Bureau faces and further jeopardize the safety of those protecting our communities,\" the Maryland lawmakers said in a joint statement. \"That's why we will be fighting back against this proposal with every tool we have.\"",
      "In May, Patel told Congress his goal is to move about 10% of the Bureau's Washington workforce \u2014 about 1,500 people \u2014 away from the D.C. area and redeploy them across the country, including a sizable number of personnel at the FBI's facility in Huntsville, Alabama.",

    "summary": "Billionaire Elon Musk is floating a new political party dubbed the \"America Party\" \u2014 but the idea could face major hurdles.",
    "story": [
      "As billionaire Elon Musk feuds with President Trump over his signature tax and domestic policy legislation, Musk has reupped his calls to launch a new political party \u2014 a daunting task even for the wealthiest person on Earth.",
      "Musk first floated launching a third party, dubbed the \"America Party,\" earlier this month, part of a nasty back-and-forth between the president and the Tesla CEO that marked the likely end of their political alliance. Musk raised the idea again this week as lawmakers raced to send the One Big Beautiful Bill Act to Mr. Trump's desk \u2014 and this time, Musk put a time limit on the plan.",
      "\"If this insane spending bill passes, the America Party will be formed the next day,\" Musk wrote in a post on X Monday evening, hours before the bill passed the Senate on Tuesday and headed back to the House. \"Our country needs an alternative to the Democrat-Republican uniparty so that the people actually have a VOICE.\"",
      "It remains unclear if Musk will follow through on his pledge, but the idea could be easier said than done. If Musk decides to launch a new political party, he'll need to contend with a thicket of complicated state laws, time-consuming ballot access rules and intense litigation.",
      "\"Only the richest person in the world could make a serious effort at creating a new American political party,\" Brett Kappel, a veteran election lawyer, told CBS News.",
      "Navigating 50 different state laws \u2014 and federal rules",
      "\"Political parties are creatures of the states,\" Kappel said.",
      "Each state has different legal rules for recognizing which political parties can appear on the ballot, and those hurdles \"range from high to extraordinarily difficult to overcome,\" he noted. In some cases, a nascent state party may need to get candidates onto the ballot by submitting large numbers of signatures, and then win a certain percentage of the vote across election cycles.",
      "For example, to qualify in California, a new political party needs to either sign up 0.33% of the state's voters \u2014 or about 75,000 people \u2014 as registered members, or submit signatures from 1.1 million voters. After that, in order to remain qualified, parties have to either maintain that 0.33% registration threshold or win at least 2% of the vote in a statewide race.",
      "And to gain recognition at the national level, each state-level political party would need to seek an advisory opinion from the Federal Election Commission.",
      "These efforts would almost certainly face intense pushback from the Democratic and Republican parties, including legal challenges over signatures in each state, requiring Musk \u2014 or any other aspiring third-party founder \u2014 to spend scores of money on litigation.",
      "\"The state laws in all of the states are biased towards the two major political parties, and make it as difficult as possible for the emergence of a third political party,\" Kappel told CBS News.",
      "The process of creating a political party with national ambitions would be time-consuming, too. Kappel says it might be doable \u2014 albeit difficult \u2014 for Musk to get a few favored candidates onto the ballot in certain states, but building an entirely new national party would likely take years, and would not be possible by the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "For evidence of how challenging the process is, look no further than the struggles that existing third parties have faced. The Green Party and Libertarian Party were each founded decades ago, and still engage in state-by-state pushes for ballot access and party recognition.",
      "\"The hurdles for creating a new party and getting it on the ballot are extremely high. It can be done if you have endless amounts of money, but it's a multi-year project and will cost hundreds of millions of dollars,\" Kappel said.",
      "Musk's campaign cash",
      "The high cost of launching a political party may not be a big stumbling block for Musk, whose net worth exceeds $350 billion according to Forbes and Bloomberg's valuations.",
      "The Tesla and SpaceX leader spent a staggering $277 million to aid Mr. Trump and other Republican candidates in the 2024 election cycle. The bulk of that spending, roughly $239 million, was routed through America PAC, a political action committee founded by Musk that underwrote a sprawling get-out-the-vote effort across the swing states.",
      "Since then, Musk has hinted that he plans to dial back his involvement in politics. His tenure leading the Trump administration's cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency ended in May, a month after telling Tesla shareholders his work with the federal government will \"drop significantly.\" He also said at the Qatar Economic Forum in May that he will \"do a lot less\" political spending moving forward, noting he doesn't \"currently see a reason\" to keep opening his wallet.",
      "If Musk follows through on his proposal to launch a competitor to the two mainstream parties, it would mark an expensive return to the fray \u2014 and the laws around how to finance it are complex.",
      "Before new political parties are formally recognized, they are typically organized as not-for-profit groups, and their financial backers do not face any dollar limits to their donations, Kappel says. But once a party gains national recognition, donors like Musk would be subject to the FEC's caps on political contributions. Currently, individuals can only give $10,000 a year to a state political party, or $44,300 a year to a national party committee, the FEC says.",
      "The rules governing when organizations are subject to those limits are byzantine. Almost two decades ago, the FEC said a group called Unity08 \u2014 which aimed to create a bipartisan presidential ticket \u2014 must register as a political committee if it spends over $1,000 trying to get ballot access. After a lengthy legal battle, an appeals court reversed that decision.",
      "Another way for Musk to keep wielding political influence would be through America PAC. The group is organized as a super PAC, which allows Musk to donate unlimited sums of money, but requires the group to remain officially independent from candidates or political parties.",
      "Even as he mused about launching a third party, Musk implied this week he could remain engaged in Republican politics. The billionaire suggested he will back primary challenges against GOP lawmakers who voted for the Trump-endorsed One Big Beautiful Bill Act. He also vowed to lend support to Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who voted against the bill and is facing a Trump-backed primary contest.",
      "The president, for his part, has said in recent days that Musk appears to be \"upset\" that his signature tax and domestic policy bill would phase out electric vehicle tax credits \u2014 which could\u00a0 cost Tesla billions. Some of Musk's criticisms of the bill have focused on its steep cuts to green energy incentives, though he has also argued the bill is too expensive.",
      "\"I think Elon is a wonderful guy, and I know he's going to do well always,\" Mr. Trump told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo in an interview that aired Sunday. \"But he got a little bit upset, and that wasn't appropriate.\"",

      "The ruling by Brooklyn-based U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan, who was nominated by former President George W. Bush in 2006, prevents Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem from following through on a plan to revoke temporary protected status, or TPS, of Haitians living in the U.S. under the program on Sept. 3, a few months before their status was set to expire under a Biden-era deadline.",
      "Nearly 350,000 people from Haiti are currently enrolled in the TPS program, which allows migrants to remain in the U.S. if their home country is unsafe due to war or natural disaster. The federal government first granted TPS designation to Haiti in 2010, and the Biden administration extended it for Haitian migrants until February 2026.",
      "DHS announced Friday that benefits will instead end in September, and unless migrants qualify for some other form of legal status, they will lose their right to work and may face deportation.",
      "In his ruling Tuesday, Hogan sided with a group of Haitian migrants who sued over the end to TPS for the Caribbean nation. The judge wrote that Noem \"does not have statutory or inherent authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation.\"",
      "Hogan said the DHS secretary \"cannot reconsider Haiti's TPS designation in a way that takes effect before February 3, 2026, the expiration of the most recent previous extension.\"",
      "\"Plaintiffs have enrolled in schools, taken jobs, and begun courses of medical treatment in the United States in reliance on Haiti's TPS designation lasting until at least February 3, 2026,\" Hogan wrote in the 23-page ruling.",
      "The White House says the administration will appeal the ruling.",
      "\"District courts have no authority to prohibit the Executive Branch from enforcing immigration laws or from terminating discretionary temporary benefit programs,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement. She added that the administration \"trusts that this unlawful order will meet the same fate similar injunctions have met in the Supreme Court. And President Trump will continue delivering on his promises to end the exploitation of our immigration system.\"",
      "DHS argued last week that TPS is intended to be temporary, and the \"environmental situation in Haiti has improved enough that it is safe for Haitian citizens to return home.\" But advocates warn Haiti is wracked by persistent gang violence and health problems.",
      "The Trump administration has pushed to wind down TPS for several other countries, including Venezuela and Afghanistan. The Supreme Court allowed the administration to end TPS for Venezuelan migrants in a late May decision, reversing a lower court ruling.",

    "published": "Tue, 01 Jul 2025 20:30:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration says it apprehended just over 6,000 migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border last month.",
    "story": [
      "The number of migrants caught crossing the southern border illegally set a new historic monthly low in June, continuing an extraordinary lull in illegal immigration the Trump administration has attributed to its aggressive deportation efforts, preliminary government data obtained by CBS News shows.",
      "Last month, Border Patrol agents along the U.S.-Mexico border recorded just over 6,000 apprehensions of migrants who entered the country without authorization, the lowest monthly tally ever reported by the agency, according to the preliminary Customs and Border Protection data. The previous monthly low reported by Border Patrol was in March, when the agency recorded around 7,200 migrant apprehensions.",
      "The numbers stand in stark contrast to the record levels of apprehensions made by Border Patrol under the Biden administration, which faced a humanitarian, political and operational crisis of unprecedented proportions at the southern border until it implemented restrictive asylum measures last year.",
      "During many months of former President Joe Biden's tenure, Border Patrol recorded more than 6,000 apprehensions each day. At their peak in late 2023, daily illegal crossings at the southern border topped 10,000 on some days.",
      "Tom Homan, the Trump administration's border czar, confirmed the roughly 6,000 Border Patrol apprehensions recorded in June. He added that Border Patrol did not release a single migrant for a second consecutive month. During some months under the Biden administration, tens of thousands of migrants were released into the U.S. with instructions to show up in immigration court to plead their cases.",
      "\"We have never seen numbers this low. Never,\" Homan wrote on X.",
      "While Border Patrol has not publicly reported monthly apprehension data before fiscal year 2000, the last time the agency averaged close to 6,000 migrant interdictions per month over a year was in the late 1960s, historical figures indicate.",
      "Immediately after taking office in January, President Trump empowered border officials to swiftly deport migrants \u2014 without hearing their asylum claims \u2014 under an emergency proclamation he argued was needed to quell an \"invasion.\" That policy is being challenged in court by civil rights advocates, who argue it violates U.S. asylum law. Immigration authorities were also directed to halt all releases, absent life-threatening circumstances.",
      "Mr. Trump has deployed thousands of additional active-duty troops to the southern border, tasking them with repelling illegal crossings through the construction of barriers. Along some parts of the border with Mexico, the U.S. military has set up zones where soldiers can temporarily detain migrants before transferring them to immigration officials.",
      "In the interior of the country, the Trump administration has tasked Immigration and Customs Enforcement with overseeing large-scale arrests of immigrants suspected of being in the country illegally. Last week, the number of individuals held in ICE detention set a record high.",
      "Amid the historic lull in illegal crossings, hundreds of Border Patrol agents have been assigned to help ICE with immigration arrests away from the border, in places like Los Angeles.",
      "The administration has also staged an intense messaging campaign to compel immigrants in the U.S. illegally to self-deport. It has offered them carrots in the form of travel assistance through a government smartphone app and a $1,000 self-deportation bonus.",
      "But it has also threatened those who refuse to leave with arrest and forcible deportation, and even the possibility of ending up detained at the naval base in Guantanamo Bay, a tent facility in the Florida Everglades dubbed \"Alligator Alcatraz\" or a maximum-security mega prison in El Salvador.",
      "Mr. Trump's immigration crackdown has not been without criticism. In communities across the U.S., especially Democratic-led cities, videos of masked federal agents arresting unauthorized immigrants at courthouses or outside homes have triggered outcry from local residents and politicians.",
      "Some Republicans have urged the Trump administration to prioritize the arrest of migrants with serious criminal records amid concerns that its crackdown is extending well beyond the dangerous individuals the president promised to expel. Recent figures show fewer than 10% of those booked in ICE detention in recent months were convicted of violent crimes.",

      "President Trump said Tuesday that Israel has agreed to a proposal for a two-month ceasefire in its war with Hamas.",
      "\"Israel has agreed to the necessary conditions to finalize the 60 Day CEASEFIRE, during which time we will work with all parties to end the War,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"I hope, for the good of the Middle East, that Hamas takes this Deal, because it will not get better \u2014 IT WILL ONLY GET WORSE.\"",
      "Mr. Trump did not give any details on the proposed deal, and it's unclear whether Hamas will accept it. Neither Israel nor Hamas has commented publicly on the terms of a possible agreement.",
      "The president said Qatar and Egypt \u2014 who have previously helped mediate talks with Hamas \u2014 \"will deliver this final proposal.\"",
      "Mr. Trump is set to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington next Monday. The president told reporters Tuesday he expects to discuss both Gaza and Iran, which struck a separate ceasefire deal with Israel last week after a 12-day campaign between the two countries that included U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites.",
      "Earlier Tuesday, Mr. Trump said a ceasefire could begin \"sometime next week.\"",
      "Prior pushes for a ceasefire have stalled. In late May, Mr. Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff proposed a 60-day ceasefire that would have required Hamas to release 10 living hostages taken from Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, as well as the remains of another 18 dead hostages. In exchange, Israel would have released 125 \"life sentence\" prisoners, 1,111 Palestinian detainees and 180 deceased Palestinians.",
      "Israel supported that proposal, but Hamas said it responded with \"notes and amendments.\" Witkoff called Hamas' response \"totally unacceptable.\"",
      "The war began when Hamas launched a terror attack on southern Israel in October 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages back to the Gaza Strip. Israel responded with an intense air and ground offensive in the Palestinian territory, killing more than 56,000 people, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry.",
      "The two sides have agreed to two prior ceasefire and hostage release deals since the start of the 21-month conflict, the most recent of which ran from January to March.",
      "Since then, Netanyahu has said there is \"no way\" he will agree to end the war until Hamas is defeated, though he left the door open to cutting deals to release hostages.",
      "Israel said Tuesday it had \"expanded its operations to additional areas within the Gaza Strip, eliminating dozens of terrorists.\" Hamas' health ministry said Tuesday some 116 people had been killed across the territory over a 24-hour period.",
      "Separately, in recent weeks, the U.S. has financially supported a controversial new group to distribute food in the Gaza Strip, but the effort has faced frequent reports of fatal shootings by Israeli forces near food distribution sites. The group, known as the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, has defended its efforts.",

      "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem are visiting the facility alongside the president. The controversial detention facility is at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport in the Florida Everglades, which has its own runway in an environment known for its treacherous terrain and wildlife. Mr. Trump joked in his remarks that \"we're going to teach them how to run away from an alligator if they escape prison.\"",
      "Mr. Trump invited the press to join his tour of the makeshift facility, which he called \"so professional and so well done.\" Rows of bunk beds were lined up behind chain fences.",
      "The president was asked if it could be a model going forward for other detention sites. \"It can be,\" he responded, adding that such a location is rare. Mr. Trump said he'd like to see similar temporary facilities in \"many states.\"",
      "DeSantis said they expect the first occupants of the detention center to arrive Wednesday. DeSantis said the site has been modified in just eight days to accommodate detainees, and he called the center an \"effective way\" to increase the numbers of removals and deportations of unauthorized immigrants as the state seeks to help the federal government's deportation efforts.",
      "The facility will have up to several thousand beds to house, process and deport individuals who were in the country illegally. Florida officials say the site will have at least 200 security cameras, at least 28,000 feet of barbed wire, 400-plus security personnel, and 24/7 air conditioning.",
      "In a roundtable alongside Mr. Trump, Noem told people who are in the country illegally and who may be watching on TV that they can still \"self-deport\" and get the chance to return to the United States legally in the future.",
      "\"If you don't, you may end up here,\" Noem said. \"And you may end up here and being processed, deported out of this country, and never get the chance to come back.\"",
      "DeSantis echoed Noem's message. \"Why would you want to come through 'Alligator Alcatraz' if you can just go home on your own?\" DeSantis said. \" I think a lot of people are going to make that decision.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 01 Jul 2025 18:17:20 -0400",
    "summary": "The Senate budget bill would have imposed an excise tax on certain wind and solar projects with foreign materials.",
    "story": [
      "The Senate bill containing President Trump's domestic policy agenda at the last minute eliminated a new excise tax that would have hammered the renewable energy industry, a move that likely ensured Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska would back the measure.",
      "The excise tax would have been imposed on wind and solar energy projects constructed with a certain percentage of materials sourced from prohibited foreign countries, like China. Consumers would see their energy prices rise by around 8% to 10%, and the provision would have cost clean energy businesses an additional $4-$7 billion by 2036, according to an analysis by the American Clean Power Association.",
      "The tax was designed to boost domestic manufacturing, but developing these projects by working around Chinese components was likely to be cost prohibitive.",
      "The Senate bill also made another key concession: it would phase out wind and solar tax credits for clean energy development on a slower timeline than originally proposed, ensuring that projects that have already been planned, financed and approved would still receive the applicable tax credit, as long as they begin construction before June 2026, or are operational by the end of 2027.",
      "But this is still a major modification from the original timeline for the wind and solar tax credit \u2014 which wasn't due to expire until 2032 \u2014 and it still puts clean energy developers in peril, according to environmental groups.",
      "Joanna Slaney, vice president for political and government affairs for the Environmental Defense Fund, said in an email to CBS News, \"By making it much, much harder to build new clean energy projects, the bill is effectively cutting off supply of cheap energy right when the U.S. needs it the most.\"",
      "Environmental groups said few gains were to be found in the bill.",
      "\"If there's a bright spot, it is that the Senate bill would preserve tax credits for newer technologies like advanced nuclear, battery storage, geothermal energy, and carbon capture, as well as advanced manufacturing,\" Nathaniel Keohane, president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, said in a statement.",
      "The final bill passed by the Senate would largely terminate numerous tax incentives from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act for clean energy, electric vehicles, and energy efficiency programs that benefited consumers. It would end tax credits for new and used electric vehicles, installation of home EV charging equipment and insulation or energy efficient heating and cooling systems. The bill also ends the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which gives funding to nonprofit organizations providing financing for projects that reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions in communities.",
      "A new analysis by the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions predicted that the changes in the Senate bill would eliminate more than 1.6 million jobs, cause more than $290 billion in lost GDP, increase U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 8% by 2035 and increase the cost of energy by 4% per megawatt.",
      "Climate and environmental groups expressed concern about how the reduction of key tax incentives for clean energy production and energy efficiency will affect the public.",
      "\"The bill will raise energy costs and make it harder to keep the lights on,\" said Steven Nadel in a statement, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. \"No one asked Congress to make their energy bills even higher. Taking away incentives for energy-saving improvements would raise monthly bills for families and businesses. It will only exacerbate the growing strain on the electric grid.\"",
      "The bill now returns to the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson is intent on meeting Republicans' self-imposed July 4 deadline to get the bill to President Trump's desk. To do so, the House will have to pass the Senate version unchanged. Any alteration would mean the bill would have to be considered by a conference committee to reconcile the differences. That's what Murkowski would prefer. \"We do not have a perfect bill by any stretch of the imagination,\" she told reporters Tuesday. \"My hope is that the House is going to look at this and recognize that we're not there yet.\"",

    "story": [
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. central bank has held off on lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.",
      "Speaking at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal, Powell said \"I think that's right\" in response to a moderator's question about whether the Fed would have cut its benchmark rate if not for the U.S. imposing steep tariffs on key trading partners.",
      "\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs, and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,\" Powell said. \"So we didn't overreact \u2014 in fact, we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.\"",
      "Powell said that tariffs have yet to have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, but reiterated his view that the levies could lead to higher inflation later this summer.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Trump administration officials say steeper tariffs are necessary to reinvigorate the U.S. manufacturing sector; ensure fair trade with other countries; and advance other domestic policy priorities, such as curbing the flow of unauthorized immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.",
      "President Trump has\u00a0repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority to do so.",
      "The president said in a post Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform, that Fed officials \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for not moving sooner to ease interest rates.",
      "Although Powell chairs the central bank, interest-rate decisions are set jointly by the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member panel of Fed officials.",
      "The Fed on June 18 opted to hold the federal funds rate \u2014 what banks charge each other for overnight loans \u2014 steady for a fourth straight meeting. Powell on Tuesday said the Fed continues to monitor the effect of tariffs on economic growth and inflation.",
      "\"As long as the economy is in solid shape, we think the prudent thing to do is to wait and see what those effects might be,\" Powell said, alluding to the tariffs.",
      "Powell, whose term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026, also sought to underline the importance of insulating central bankers from political pressure.",
      "\"We're trying to deliver macro stability, financial stability, economic stability for the benefit of all the people,\" he said at the European Central Bank forum. \"If we're going to do that successfully, we need to do it in a completely nonpolitical way, which means we don't take sides, we don't play one side against the other, we stay out of issues that are really not our bailiwick.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate narrowly passed President Trump's massive tax and spending bill Tuesday after a marathon series of amendment votes that stretched more than 24 hours, delivering a major victory for the president and bringing the signature piece of legislation of his second term one step closer to his desk.",
      "The measure passed in a 51 to 50 vote, with all but three Republicans supporting the bill. Vice President JD Vance cast the tie-breaking vote. GOP Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Susan Collins of Maine joined all Democrats in voting against the bill.",
      "The vote came after the Senate worked through the weekend and into a scheduled recess to pass the bill, which now returns to the House for sign-off. Mr. Trump has vowed to swiftly sign the measure, and pushed lawmakers to approve it by July 4.",
      "The legislation's passage also marks a significant victory for Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who worked to sway GOP holdouts to back the legislation amid opposition on multiple fronts that threatened to thwart the bill's progress in recent days.",
      "\"This was an incredible victory for the American people,\" Thune said after the vote.",
      "Known by the GOP as the \"big, beautiful bill,\" the legislation includes ramped-up spending for border security, defense and energy production and extends trillions of dollars in tax cuts, partially offset by cuts to health care and nutrition programs. The Congressional Budget Office estimated the legislation would increase federal deficits by nearly $3.3 trillion over the next decade.",
      "While some Republicans had taken issue with the legislation's impact on the deficit, others cited concern with some of the steep cuts to Medicaid, which the CBO has said would leave nearly 12 million more Americans without health coverage over the coming years. And with a 53-seat majority, Senate GOP leaders could only afford to lose three Republican votes, with Vance as a tie-breaker. But those concerns were not enough to defeat the legislation, and last-minute changes secured the support of Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, while apparently quelling other possible opponents to the bill.",
      "Mr. Trump welcomed news of the vote during a trip to Florida. \"There is something for everyone [in the bill], and I think it's going to go very nicely in the House,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Actually, I think it will be easier in the House than it was in the Senate.\"",
      "The path to passage",
      "Thune, a South Dakota Republican, met with possible holdouts in his office as the vote series stretched late Monday and into the wee hours Tuesday. The majority leader met with fiscal hawks including Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Rick Scott of Florida, and at another point in the night, he met with Paul, who had pledged to oppose the bill over a provision raising the debt ceiling by $5 trillion.",
      "Thune also talked briefly with Murkowski early Tuesday, since it appeared likely that her vote could make or break the bill in the Senate. The Alaska Republican had concerns about cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs and their impact on her state.",
      "Murkowski told reporters after the vote that her thought process on the bill was \"agonizing.\"",
      "\"I struggled mightily with the impact on the most vulnerable in this country,\" Murkowski said, citing the cuts to social safety net programs. But she outlined the unique conditions in her state, and the support Alaska received in the final version of the bill, saying \"I had to look on balance because people in my state are the ones that I put first.\"",
      "In a statement later in the afternoon, Murkowski said, \"My sincere hope is that this is not the final product.\"",
      "\"This bill needs more work across chambers and is not ready for the President's desk,\" she wrote. \"We need to work together to get this right.\"",
      "Senate Republicans advanced the legislation late Saturday, with all but two voting in favor following hours of delay as the GOP worked to iron out last-minute details and dispel concern among holdouts, including the fiscal hawks, Murkowski and Collins.",
      "Paul and Tillis were the two Republicans to oppose the bill's advancement Saturday, and they both voted against the legislation on final passage. With a handful of other possible opponents, Thune told reporters overnight that GOP leaders were working to determine what \"everybody has to have in terms of votes,\" a sign that the vote would come down to the wire.",
      "The Senate action comes after the House narrowly passed the bill last month. Senate Republicans worked to put their mark on the legislation, treading carefully so as not to throw off the delicate balance in the lower chamber.",
      "The House will need to approve the Senate's changes to the bill before it can head to the president's desk for his signature. And lawmakers are trying to move quickly, with a self-imposed July 4 deadline to get the measure signed. The House could return to Washington as early as Wednesday to begin consideration of the revised bill.",
      "Senate Republicans passed the legislation through the budget reconciliation process, which enables the party in the majority to move ahead without support from across the aisle. The Senate worked through the weekend as the GOP entered a final sprint on the legislation ahead of the July 4 deadline.",
      "Senate Democrats combated the legislation in one of the only ways available to them: by delaying the process. Democrats forced the bill to be read in its entirety over the weekend, totaling nearly 16 hours, before using debate time to rail against the bill, and proposing amendments to put their GOP colleagues on the record on a number of controversial issues ahead of the midterm elections.",
      "On Monday, the Senate began what's known as a \"vote-a-rama,\" in which senators could offer an unlimited number of amendments and force the chamber to cast vote after vote. Democrats proposed a number of amendments to attempt to roll back some of the bill's more controversial provisions, to no avail. As the votes stretched overnight Monday and into Tuesday, senators voted on a handful of notable amendments, including a near-unanimous vote to eliminate language from the bill that would have put a pause on state regulations on artificial intelligence. The Senate also approved an amendment to move up Medicaid eligibility verification requirements preventing payments for people who are deceased.",
      "An amendment proposed by Collins that would have increased the rural hospital stabilization fund from $25 billion to $50 billion and imposed a higher tax rate on the wealthy to pay for the larger fund fell short. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters ahead of the vote that the amendment was like putting a \"band aid on an amputation \u2014 it doesn't fix the problem.\" The outcome made it less likely that Collins would ultimately support the bill, although the change was expected to be included in a wide-ranging amendment to the bill.",
      "During the marathon vote series, the Senate also addressed an outstanding disagreement over the current policy baseline, an accounting approach that would make it appear that extending the current tax policy would cost nothing. Though Democrats railed against the move as the \"nuclear option,\" the chamber voted along party lines to affirm the use of the current policy baseline.",
      "Schumer lambasted the bill after the vote, criticizing Republicans for bowing to the president.",
      "\"The American people will remember the Republican betrayal,\" Schumer said.",
      "Cristina  Corujo, \n                                                  \n                                  Emily  Hung and \n                                                  \n                      Alan  He\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in Rhode Island has blocked the Department of Health and Human Services from implementing mass layoffs and overhauling some of its sub-agencies, finding there to be \"no rational basis\" for the Trump administration's reorganization plans that would have \"devastating consequences\" across the country if enacted.",
      "The suit was brought by 19 Democratic attorneys general and Washington, D.C., in May, seeking to block an agency restructuring plan announced by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in March.",
      "Their complaint warned of \"severe, complicated, and potentially irreversible\" consequences to public health services nationwide if the plan went forward, potentially \"paralyzing\" the agency \"by means of a confusing reorganization.\"",
      "\"Critical public health services have been interrupted, databases taken offline, status of grants thrown into chaos, technical assistance services gone, and training and consultation services curtailed. These are not unsubstantiated fears,\" Judge Melissa DuBose wrote in her opinion granting the states' request for a preliminary injunction.",
      "\"HHS has failed to produce a shred of evidence that services to States and access to critical information would continue uninterrupted, that the harms are minimal or not irreparable, or that it is authorized to act absent Congressional action,\" she added.",
      "The judge also ordered the parties to address whether and how the Supreme Court's recent ruling limiting universal injunctions should apply to her order. In that case, which stemmed from President Trump's attempt to end birthright citizenship, the Supreme Court limited the use of universal injunctions in cases with individuals as plaintiffs, but gave lower courts more latitude in cases brought by states.",
      "The states had cited concerns with the restructuring at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the FDA's tobacco products center, the Office of Head Start and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation.",
      "\"The Executive Branch does not have the authority to order, organize, or implement wholesale changes to the structure and function of the agencies created by Congress,\" DuBose wrote.",
      "As part of Kennedy's restructuring plan, he moved to lay off some 10,000 employees at the nation's health agencies and ordered remaining officials to draw up plans to reorganize their work. Several offices and teams are slated to move under the plans, many into a new agency Kennedy wants to create called the Administration for a Healthy America, or AHA.",
      "Most of those employees remain off the job after getting their layoff notices in April but are still being paid, due to cases that sought to block their terminations.",
      "\"HHS is the backbone of our nation's public health and social safety net \u2014 from cancer screenings and maternal health to early childhood education and domestic violence prevention,\" said New York Attorney General James in a statement after the ruling.",
      "In May, a federal court in California blocked the Trump administration's mass layoff attempts, including at HHS, though the Supreme Court is considering whether to lift a lower court's injunction and allow it to move forward with the administration's plans for reductions in force, or layoffs.",
      "\"The people who were subject to the reduction in force are on administrative leave, and they will remain on administrative leave until the injunction is lifted,\" Kennedy said at a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing last week.",
      "Multiple federal health officials said planning has been ongoing for the next steps of the reorganization and merger, even as Kennedy has cited the court rulings as a reason to dodge questions about the restructuring on Capitol Hill.",
      "Officials from the Health Resources and Services Administration visited the CDC's campuses in Atlanta in recent weeks, they said, in a meeting of senior leaders between the two agencies.",
      "Most remaining teams focused on chronic disease from the two agencies are supposed to start being transferred into the new AHA agency, Kennedy has said, if the injunction is lifted.",
      "A few hundred layoffs have also been reversed in the weeks since the initial cuts, including those of scientists, researchers and health officials the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health and the FDA.",
      "But officials have also been told that further layoffs might be demanded by the Trump administration from health agencies in order to \"balance out\" the jobs that were restored.",
      "\"At that point, we will make decisions. And, you know, in some cases, there have been gaps in our ability to perform our duties. I've brought people back,\" Kennedy said.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Senate on Tuesday narrowly passed a massive spending and tax bill that includes signature policies of President Trump's second-term agenda in a 51-50 vote that required Vice President JD Vance to break a tie.",
      "The vote came after a marathon session that featured votes on amendments to key portions of the bill by senators of both parties.",
      "At the center of what Republicans call the \"big, beautiful bill\"\u00a0is an extension of Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which is slated to sunset at year's end. The legislation would make most of the tax cuts permanent, while increasing spending for border security, defense and energy production.",
      "The bill is partially paid for by cuts to health care and nutrition programs, like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the Senate's bill would add $3.3 trillion to federal deficits over the next 10 years and leave millions without health insurance. Republicans and the White House dispute those forecasts.",
      "Senate Republicans used a process known as budget reconciliation to pass the bill, which limits the types of policies that can be included in a simple majority vote. A handful of provisions that initially appeared in the bill were ultimately removed, including one that would have ordered the sale of public lands and another that would have paused state regulations on artificial intelligence.",
      "The House passed its own version of the legislation last month, with some key differences. The lower chamber must now approve the Senate's version before it can go to the president's desk. If the House makes changes of its own, the Senate would need to sign off on those as well.",
      "Here's what is in the 887-page bill:",
      "Medicaid restrictions",
      "The legislation includes restrictions on Medicaid, which provides government-sponsored health care for low-income and disabled Americans. Like the House-passed bill, the legislation imposes work requirements for some able-bodied adults and more frequent eligibility checks. But the Senate parliamentarian determined that a measure cutting federal funds to states that use Medicaid infrastructure to provide health care coverage to undocumented immigrants, along with banning Medicaid from covering gender transition services, isn't in compliance with Senate reconciliation rules.",
      "The parliamentarian also weighed in on the provider tax, which states use to help fund their portion of Medicaid costs, in a blow to the Senate GOP's initial plan.",
      "Senate Republicans proposed steeper cuts to Medicaid funding, in part by incrementally lowering provider taxes from 6% to 3.5% by 2032. The timeline is delayed by one year from the Senate GOP's initial proposal, after the issue became one of the bill's sticking points in recent weeks. It's a departure from the House-passed bill, which sought to lower federal costs by freezing states' provider taxes at current rates and prohibiting them from establishing new provider taxes.",
      "The bill also includes a rural hospital stabilization fund after some GOP senators expressed concern over how rural hospitals could be impacted by the Medicaid restrictions, allocating $50 billion for rural hospitals over the same period that the provider taxes would be lowered.",
      "Homeland security and immigration",
      "The legislation includes more than $46.5 billion for border wall construction and related expenses, $45 billion to expand detention capacity for immigrants in custody and about $30 billion in funding for hiring, training and other resources for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "It also includes a minimum $100 fee for those seeking asylum, down from the $1,000 fee outlined in the House bill. The Senate parliamentarian ruled out the $1,000 fee for anyone applying for asylum.",
      "Increasing the state and local tax deduction, or SALT",
      "The package also includes an increase to the cap on the state and local tax deduction, raising it from $10,000 to $40,000. After five years, it would return to $10,000, a departure from the House-passed bill.",
      "The issue was a major sticking point in the House, where blue-state Republicans threatened to withhold their support without the increase to the deduction. But with no Republicans hailing from blue states in the Senate, the upper chamber has been contending with its own dynamics.",
      "Before the rule, taxpayers could deduct all their state and local taxes from their federal taxes, which some policymakers have said mainly benefits wealthy homeowners in states with high taxes, such as New York and California. But advocates for increasing the caps argue that the $10,000 cap is increasingly impacting middle-class homeowners who live in regions where property taxes are rising.",
      "Restrictions on food stamps",
      "The Senate bill still shifts the costs of SNAP, or food stamps, to some states. The program is currently fully funded by the federal government.",
      "The federal government would continue to fully fund the benefits for states that have an error payment rate below 6%, beginning in 2028. States with error rates\u00a0above 6% would be on the hook for 5% to 15% of the costs. States are also given some flexibility in calculating their share.",
      "The package also aligns with the House version on age requirements for able-bodied adults to qualify for SNAP benefits. Currently, in order to qualify, able-bodied adults between 18 and 54 must meet work requirements. Both the Senate and House bills would update the age requirement to 18 and 64, with some exemptions for parents.",
      "Alaska and Hawaii could receive waivers for the work requirements if it's determined that they're making a \"good faith effort\" to comply.",
      "Addressing the debt limit",
      "The legislation would raise the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, going beyond the $4 trillion outlined in the House-passed bill. Congress faces a deadline to address the debt limit later this summer.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has urged Congress to address the debt limit by mid-July, saying that the U.S. could be unable to pay its bills as early as August, when Congress is on recess.",
      "By addressing the debt ceiling as part of the larger package, Republicans in Congress are aiming to bypass negotiating with Democrats on the issue. Unlike most other legislation in the Senate, the budget reconciliation process that governs the package requires a simple majority, rather than the 60-vote threshold to move forward with a bill.",
      "Child tax credit",
      "The current $2,000 child tax credit is set to return to the pre-2017 level of $1,000 in 2026. The tax credit would permanently increase to $2,200 under the Senate bill, $300 less than the House-passed hike. The House version reverts the increase to $2,000 after 2028.",
      "Limits on overtime and tips deductions",
      "The bill would allow individuals to deduct a certain amount of tip wages and overtime from their taxes. The provisions would expire in 2028.",
      "The \"no tax on tips\" provision in the spending bill would create a new deduction for tipped workers, eliminating what they owe in federal income tax. Tipped workers would still have to pay state and local income tax and payroll taxes.",
      "The House and Senate\u00a0versions\u00a0vary on a few key points, including how much a worker could claim in deductions. The Senate proposal limits that deduction to $25,000, while the House version is uncapped.",
      "Under the House measure, meanwhile, only people with annual income of $160,000 or less would qualify for the tipping tax break, while the Senate version would phase out benefits for individuals whose income exceeds $150,000 or couples whose income exceeds $300,000.",
      "Changes to standard deduction",
      "The Senate wants to permanently expand the basic standard deduction, which was nearly doubled in 2017. The increases will expire at the end of the year. The House bill, however, would expand the deduction only through 2028.",

      "Notably, however, under the budget bill those tip tax cuts would extend only through 2028, and so Congress could restrict or even abolish the tax break in future.",
      "Who would benefit?",
      "A May\u00a0report\u00a0from the White House's Council of Economic Advisers estimates that eliminating taxes on tips for eligible workers would increase their average take-home pay by $1,675 per year.",
      "According to the White House, a June survey found that 83% of hourly workers support eliminating taxes on tips. \"These results suggest that any measure increasing the amount of immediately available income \u2014 such as untaxed tips \u2014 would provide meaningful, stabilizing support for a large segment of the hourly workforce,\" according to that report.",
      "Data\u00a0from the Yale Budget Lab shows that roughly 4 million people \u2014 2.5% of the American workforce \u2014 worked in tipped jobs as of 2023. But given the way the budget bill is written, not all would benefit. The nonpartisan policy research center notes in a recent\u00a0analysis that over a third of tipped workers in the U.S. are already exempt from federal income tax because their earnings are too low.",
      "\"A deduction for tipped work is actually a pretty horrible way to help low-wage workers,\" Ernie Tedeschi, the director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You're only helping a narrow slice of them, and it's not helping the lowest of low-wage workers because they don't have any federal tax liability to begin with.\"",
      "Only about 4% of workers who earn less than $25 per hour also get tips, the group has found. As a result, low-wage servers at many restaurants would qualify for the tax break, but fast-food employees would not despite earning similar incomes.",
      "\"It's going to help some very, very high earners, along with some middle earners,\" Sylvia Allegretto, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The lion's share of low-wage workers, it's not going to touch because they're not tipped workers.\"",
      "A better way to helps low-wage workers, labor advocates say, would be to raise the federal minimum wage, which has been stuck at $7.25 an hour since 2009.",
      "\"It's not that these workers pay too much in taxes or that taxes are a problem,\" Allegretto said. \"The problem is they just don't earn enough money.\"",

      "Musk\u00a0reignited a squabble with Mr. Trump\u00a0on Saturday by again criticizing the \"big, beautiful bill,\" which President Trump is urging Congress to pass by July 4. The Tesla founder and CEO wrote on X that the bill would \"destroy millions of jobs in America.\" He also suggested\u00a0on Monday that, should the bill pass, he would form a new political party and support primary challenges against any Republicans who voted in favor of the legislation.",
      "President Trump clapped back early Tuesday, noting the enormous federal subsidies Musk's various companies receive from the government and suggesting that the Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 which Musk led before stepping down late May \u2014 look into any spending flowing into Musk's empire.",
      "Despite the flare-up, Wedbush technology analyst Dan Ives expects the conflict between Musk and Mr. Trump to die down moving forward.

    "published": "Mon, 30 Jun 2025 14:08:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The GOP Senate version of the \"big, beautiful bill\" would raise the cost of wind and solar projects by 10% to 20%, one energy group estimated.",
    "story": [
      "Update: This tax provision was removed from the final version of the Senate bill that\u00a0passed on Tuesday, July 1. Read more here. Our earlier story is below.",
      "The latest version of the bill containing President Trump's second term agenda would hobble the renewable energy industry with a new excise tax, in addition to speeding up the sunsetting of tax credits and other benefits.",
      "The additional tax on wind and solar projects, which appeared on page 558 in the version of the bill released over the weekend, is estimated to increase consumer energy prices 8% to 10% and would tax clean energy businesses an additional $4-$7 billion by 2036, according to an\u00a0analysis by the American Clean Power Association.",
      "The tax would apply to all projects that go into construction after June 16 through 2036, and it would also apply to projects that are placed into service after 2027, even if they already are under construction.",
      "Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski told Politico Monday that she planned to introduce an amendment that would tie eligibility for the wind and solar tax credits to a project's construction start date, rather than its service date. The Senate is currently holding a marathon vote series on\u00a0proposed amendments to the bill.",
      "These wind and solar projects would have to pay the tax if a certain percentage of the value of their materials are sourced from prohibited foreign countries, like China. The provision is ostensibly designed to boost domestic manufacturing, but developing these projects by working around Chinese components would be cost prohibitive, and some data and AI companies \u2014 which require prodigious amounts of energy \u2014 could turn to China or other countries for reliable and affordable power sources, according to clean power experts.",
      "The Senate bill also scales back or eliminates renewable energy tax breaks that have been in place since 2005 and revised and expanded a few times since then, including in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The most recent expansion contained tax breaks for individuals for electric vehicles, wind and solar development, and energy efficient appliances and provided tax credits for clean electricity-generating projects that went into service from 2023 through the end of 2032.",
      "Both the Senate and the House would end the renewable energy tax credits, but the Senate would accelerate the timeline in the House version, which would end the tax credits for renewable energy projects placed in service after 2028, a year later than the Senate would.",
      "Eliminating the existing tax credits would likely kill up to 72% of the new wind and solar installations that were to be completed in the U.S. over the next decade, according to analysis from Rhodium Group, a research firm.",
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who until Saturday was silent on the bill after his social media spat with President Trump over the House version, said of the Senate bill that it was \"Utterly insane and destructive.\"",
      "\"It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future,\" he said in a post on X. And he predicted it would \"destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country!\" Musk also said, \"A massive strategic error is being made right now to damage solar/battery that will leave America extremely vulnerable in the future.\"",
      "According to Politico, President Trump asked Senate Majority Leader John Thune to further \"crack down\" on wind and solar energy by phasing out clean energy credits faster, rather than sunsetting the tax incentives more slowly, which moderate senators favored. Some asked for help easing the hit their states would take as a result of cancelled projects, job losses and higher energy prices.",
      "The renewable energy industry, manufacturing unions and even some conservatives also criticized the new tax.",
      "Conservative energy expert Alex Epstein, advocates ending the green tax credits, but he appeared to be taken by surprise by the excise tax, saying in a post on X, \"I just learned about the excise tax and it's definitely not something I would support.\"",
      "The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also quickly condemned the tax.",
      "Neil Bradly, the Chamber's executive vice president, said on social media, \"taxing energy production is never good policy, whether oil & gas or, in this case, renewables.\u00a0 Electricity demand is set to see enormous growth & this tax will increase prices. It should be removed.\"",
      "The North American Building Trades Union, in a statement, called the bill potentially \"the biggest job-killing bill in the history of this country.\"",
      "\"Simply put, it is the equivalent of terminating more than 1,000 Keystone XL pipeline projects,\" the statement continued. \"In some cases, it worsens the already harmful trajectory of the House-passed language, threatening an estimated 1.75 million construction jobs and over 3 billion work hours, which translates to $148 billion in lost annual wages and benefits.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 30 Jun 2025 05:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration eliminated the CDC team that developed national guidelines for prescribing contraception safely for millions of women with underlying medical conditions.",
    "story": [
      "For Brianna Henderson, birth control isn't just about preventing pregnancy.",
      "The Texas mother of two was diagnosed with a rare and potentially fatal heart condition after having her second child. In addition to avoiding another pregnancy that could be life-threatening, Henderson has to make sure the contraception she uses doesn't jeopardize her health.",
      "For more than a decade, a small team of people at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention worked to do just that, issuing national guidelines for clinicians on how to prescribe contraception safely for millions of women with underlying medical conditions \u2014 including heart disease, lupus, sickle cell disease, and obesity. But the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the CDC, fired those workers as part of the Trump administration's rapid downsizing of the federal workforce.",
      "It also decimated the CDC's larger Division of Reproductive Health, where the team was housed \u2014 a move that clinicians, advocacy groups, and fired workers say will endanger the health of women and their babies.",
      "Clinicians said in interviews that counseling patients about birth control and prescribing it is relatively straightforward. But for women with conditions that put them at higher risk of serious health complications, special care is needed.",
      "\"We really were the only source of safety monitoring in this country,\" said one fired CDC staffer who worked on the guidelines, known as the U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use, or MEC. \"There's no one who can actually do this work.\" KFF Health News agreed not to name this worker and others who were not authorized to speak to the press and feared retaliation.",
      "The stakes are high for people like Henderson. About six weeks after having her second baby, she said, her heart \"was racing.\"",
      "\"I feel like I'm underwater,\" Henderson said. \"I felt like I couldn't breathe.\" She eventually went to the hospital, where she was told she was \"in full-blown heart failure,\" she said.",
      "Henderson was diagnosed with peripartum cardiomyopathy, an uncommon type of heart failure that can happen toward the end of pregnancy or shortly after giving birth. Risk factors for the condition include being at least 30 years old, being of African descent, high blood pressure, and obesity.",
      "The CDC contraception guidelines say that combined hormonal contraception, which contains both estrogen and progestin to prevent pregnancy, can pose an \"unacceptable health risk\" for most women with peripartum cardiomyopathy, also known as PPCM. For some women with the diagnosis, a birth control injection commonly known by the brand name Depo-Provera also carries risks that outweigh its benefits, the guidelines show. Progestin-only pills or a birth control implant, inserted into a person's arm, are the safest.",
      "Henderson said her cardiologist had to greenlight which contraception she could use. She uses a progestin-only birth control implant that's more than 99% effective in preventing pregnancy.",
      "\"I didn't know that certain things can cause blood clots,\" Henderson said, \"or make your heart failure worse.\" Heart failure is a leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity in the U.S., with PPCM accounting for up to 70% of heart failure cases during pregnancy.",
      "Sweeping HHS layoffs in late March and early April gutted the CDC's reproductive health division, upending several programs designed to protect women and infants, three fired workers said.",
      "About two-thirds of the division's roughly 165 employees and contractors were cut, through firings, retirements, or reassignments to other parts of the agency, one worker said.",
      "Among those fired were CDC staffers who carried out the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System, a survey established nearly 40 years ago to improve maternal and infant health outcomes by asking detailed questions of women who recently gave birth. The survey was used \"to help inform and help reduce the contributing factors that cause maternal mortality and morbidity,\" one fired worker said, by allowing government workers to examine the medical care people received before and during pregnancy, if any, and other risk factors that may lead to poor maternal and child health.",
      "The firings also removed CDC workers who collected and analyzed data on in vitro fertilization and other fertility treatments.",
      "\"They left nothing behind,\" one worker said.",
      "U.S. contraception guidelines were first published in 2010, after the CDC adapted guidance developed by the World Health Organization. The latest version was published in August 2024. It includes information about the safety of different types of contraception for more than 60 medical conditions. Clinicians said it is the premier source of evidence about the safety of birth control.",
      "\"It gave us so much information which was not available to clinicians at their fingertips,\" said Michael Policar, a physician and professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive sciences at the University of California-San Francisco School of Medicine.",
      "\"If you've got a person with, let's say, long-standing Type 2 diabetes, someone who has a connective-tissue disease like lupus, someone who's got hypertension or maybe has been treated for a precursor to breast cancer \u2014 something like that? In those circumstances,\" Policar said, \"before the MEC it was really hard to know how to manage those people.\"",
      "The CDC updates the guidelines comprehensively roughly every five years. On a weekly basis, however, government workers would monitor evidence about patients' use of contraception and the safety of various methods, something they were doing when HHS abruptly fired them this spring, two fired workers said. That work isn't happening now, one of them said.",
      "Sometimes the agency would issue interim changes outside the larger updates if new evidence warranted it. Now, if something new or urgent comes up, \"there's not going to be any way to update the guidelines,\" one fired worker said.",
      "In 2020, for example, the CDC revised its contraception recommendations for women at high risk of HIV infection, after new evidence showed that various methods were safer than previously thought.",
      "HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard declined to say why CDC personnel working on the contraception guidelines and other reproductive health issues were fired, or answer other questions raised by KFF Health News' reporting.",
      "Most women of reproductive age in the U.S. use contraception. CDC data from 2019, the most recent available, shows that more than 47 million women ages 15 to 49 relied on birth control. About 1 in 10 used long-acting methods such as intrauterine devices and implants; 1 in 7 used oral contraception.",
      "The latest guidelines included updated safety recommendations for women who have sickle cell disease, lupus, or PPCM, and those who are breastfeeding, among others. Clinicians are now being told that combined hormonal contraception poses an unacceptable health risk for women with sickle cell disease, because it might increase the risk of blood clots.",
      "\"It can really come down to life or death,\" said Teonna Woolford, CEO of the Sickle Cell Reproductive Health Education Directive, a nonprofit that advocates for improved reproductive health care for people with the disease.",
      "\"We really saw the CDC guidelines as a win, as a victory \u2014 they're actually going to pay attention,\" she said.",
      "The 2024 guidelines also for the first time included birth control recommendations for women with chronic kidney disease. Research has shown that such women are at higher risk of serious pregnancy complications, including preeclampsia and preterm delivery. Their medical condition also increases their risk of blood clots, which is why it's important for them to not use combined hormonal contraception, fired CDC workers and clinicians said.",
      "The CDC information \"is the final say in safety,\" said Patty Cason, a family nurse practitioner and president of Envision Sexual and Reproductive Health. Having only static information about the safety of various types of birth control is \"very scary,\" she said, because new evidence could come out and entirely new methods of contraception are being developed.",
      "Henderson said it took her heart two years to recover. She created the nonprofit organization Let's Talk PPCM to educate women about the type of heart failure she was diagnosed with, including what forms of birth control are safe.",
      "\"We don't want blood clots, worsening heart failures,\" Henderson said. \"They already feel like they can't trust their doctors, and we don't need extra.\"",

    "story": [
      "A satellite program that has historically been a key source of weather forecasting data will be discontinued by July 31, as the United States enters peak hurricane season, according to the already resource-strapped National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "The federal agency, which includes the National Weather Service, initially said last week that it was going to lose access to the satellite data by June 30. But in an update\u00a0posted online on Monday, NOAA said the deadline to decommission the satellite system was pushed to July 31, at the request of a top official at NASA.",
      "Operated by the U.S. Department of Defense, the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program has since the 1960s collected environmental information each day from satellites orbiting Earth, in order to provide real-time details about conditions in the atmosphere and oceans to the military. The data was made available to weather scientists for traditional forecasting purposes, after being processed by a branch of the Navy that focuses on meteorology and oceanography.",
      "Starting Aug. 1, that naval branch will no longer process or upload satellite data to the computing interface where meteorologists previously accessed it, according to NOAA.",
      "In an email that the agency reposted online, the deputy director of its Office of Satellite and Product Operations said the Navy decided to implement that change in efforts \"to mitigate a significant cybersecurity risk\" but would continue to distribute the data through the end of next month. A Navy spokesperson told CBS News in an email that it is \"discontinuing contributions\" to the satellite program \"given the program no longer meets our information technology modernization requirements.\"",
      "NOAA spokesperson Kim Doster called it a \"routine process of data rotation and replacement\" in a statement to CBS News on Monday, adding that remaining data sources remaining \"are fully capable of providing a complete suite of cutting-edge data and models that ensure the gold-standard weather forecasting the American people deserve.\"",
      "\"The DMSP is a single dataset in a robust suite of hurricane forecasting and modeling tools in the NWS portfolio,\" said Doster, citing several other satellites that feed into the National Weather Service's forecasting models, including one launched recently that,\u00a0according\u00a0to the U.S. Space Force, \"advances weather monitoring.\"",
      "The data cutoff from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program comes after NOAA lost a substantial chunk of its staff to layoffs and buyouts earlier this year, stemming from President Trump's initiative to reduce government spending in part by shrinking the federal workforce.",
      "Former NOAA administrator Rick Spinrad, who served in that role during the Biden administration, told CBS News in an email that \"there's no logical explanation\" for the cutoff, \"other than some downstream benefit to the private sector\" \u2014 which would align with goals outlined in Project 2025 to move toward privatizing NOAA and the Weather Service. Losing that data puts the agency's current capabilities at risk, Spinrad said, especially during hurricane season.",
      "\"NWS is working feverishly to start using other data from a satellite DoD launched last year,\" he added. \"This is ill-timed, poorly planned, and dangerous.\"",
      "Hurricane season runs through Nov. 30, and NOAA forecasters said in May that they expected this one to be more active than an average year. The season typically reaches its \"peak,\" its most active period, around August and September.",

    "story": [
      "An ancient city was most likely ruled by females living in a \"matriarchal society\" more than 9,000 years ago, according to a study published\u00a0in Science this week.",
      "Researchers extracted the ancient genomes of more than 130 skeletons from 35 different houses at \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, an ancient city considered one of the most well-preserved Neolithic settlements in southern Anatolia in Turkey. About 395 skeletons, a mix of males and females, were found in grave pits under the floors of the city's mudbrick houses. Occupied for more than 1,000 years (9000 to 8000 BCE), the city was known for its female figurines, possible representatives of a \"Mother Goddess\" cult and signs of a matriarchal society.",
      "A team of geneticists, archaeologists, and biological anthropologists used cutting-edge technology to analyze the DNA of skeletons over 12 years and found that maternal lineage had a key role in connecting household members, as represented by burials within each building.",
      "During the early years in \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, family members were buried together, but over time, habits changed, and researchers found many of the dead had no biological connection. Where there was a genetic connection, it was through the female line, suggesting husbands relocated to the wife's household upon marriage, researchers said.",
      "Using genetic sequencing, researchers estimated that 70 to 100% of the time, female offspring remained connected to buildings, whereas adult male offspring may have moved away. There was also a clear pattern of preferential treatment toward females, with findings showing five times more grave goods offered to females than to males.",
      "\"We need to move away from our Western bias that assumes all societies are patrilineal. Many cultures, including some Indigenous Australian groups, pass identity, land rights, and responsibilities through the mother's line \u2014 a matrilineal system,\" study co-author Dr. Eline Schotsmans, a research fellow at Australia's University of Wollongong's School of Science,\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "These findings come several months after researchers studying social networks in Celtic society in Britain before the Roman invasion gathered genetic evidence from a late Iron Age cemetery and\u00a0found that women were closely related, while unrelated men tended to come into the community from elsewhere, likely after marriage.",
      "Using an examination of ancient DNA recovered from 57 graves in Dorset in southwest England, their study, published in the\u00a0journal Nature, shows that two-thirds of the individuals were descended from a single maternal lineage. This suggests that women had some control of land and property, as well as strong social support, researchers said.",
      "Researchers said upon the release of their findings, \"It is possible that maternal ancestry was the primary shaper of group identities.\"",

      "Work from two decades ago suggested the rocks could be 4.3 billion years old, placing them in the earliest period of Earth's history. But other scientists using a different dating method contested the finding, arguing that long-ago contaminants were skewing the rocks' age and that they were actually slightly younger \u2014 at 3.8 billion years old.",
      "In the new study, researchers sampled a different section of rock from the belt and estimated its age using the previous two dating techniques - measuring how one radioactive element decays into another over time. The result: The rocks were about 4.16 billion years old.",

      "The new research was published Thursday in the journal Science.",
      "Ancient rocks could shed light on Earth's earliest days",
      "Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago from a collapsing cloud of dust and gas soon after the solar system existed. Primordial rocks often get melted and recycled by Earth's moving tectonic plates, making them extremely rare on the surface today. Scientists have uncovered 4 billion-year-old rocks from another formation in Canada called the Acasta Gneiss Complex, but the Nuvvuagittuq rocks could be even older.",
      "Studying rocks from Earth's earliest history could give a glimpse into how the planet may have looked - how its roiling magma oceans gave way to tectonic plates - and even how life got started.",
      "\"To have a sample of what was going on on Earth way back then is really valuable,\" said Mark Reagan with the University of Iowa, who studies volcanic rocks and lava and was not involved with the new study.",
      "Inuit community wants steps to avoid rocks being exploited",
      "The rock formation is on tribal Inukjuak lands and the local Inuit community has temporarily restricted scientists from taking samples from the site due to damage from previous visits.",
      "After some geologists visited the site, large chunks of rock were missing and the community noticed pieces for sale online, said Tommy Palliser, who manages the land with the Pituvik Landholding Corp. The Inuit community wants to work with scientists to set up a provincial park that would protect the land while allowing researchers to study it.",
      "\"There's a lot of interest for these rocks, which we understand,\" said Palliser, a member of the community. \"We just don't want any more damage.\"",

      "Liftoff came eight days later than originally planned due to high winds in the West Texas desert, but the weather met Blue Origin's safety requirements on Sunday.",
      "The hydrogen-fueled BE-3 engine powering the New Shepard fired for about two-and-a-half minutes, accelerating the spacecraft to just under three times the speed of sound. The capsule then separated from the booster and continued coasting upward along its up-and-down trajectory.",
      "At that point, the passengers \u2013 Allie and Carl Kuehner, Leland Larson, Freddie Rescigno Jr., Jim Sitkin and Owolabi Salis, the first Nigerian to fly in space \u2013 began enjoying about three minutes of weightlessness.",
      "Free to unstrap and float about the cabin, the passengers were able to take in the view through the largest windows in any operational spacecraft as the ship climbed to an altitude of just above 65 miles. That's about three miles higher than the internationally recognized boundary between the discernible atmosphere and space.",
      "The capsule then began falling back to Earth and the passengers returned to their seats for the descent to touchdown. The reusable booster, meanwhile, made its own return to the launch site, dropping tail first to a rocket-powered touchdown.",
      "Floating under three red-and-blue parachutes, the New Shepard capsule touched down a stone's throw from the booster's concrete landing pad, closer than any previous landing. Blue Origin said that it was the result of \"low winds ... and within the safety margins of our predicted models.\"",

      "Subramanian acknowledged that Combs didn't want to return to a federal detention center in Brooklyn where he'd been in custody since his arrest last September. Combs shook his head no.",
      "The judge asked both the prosecution and defense to submit letters as to why Combs should be released Wednesday or remain detained. Court was expected to resume at 1 p.m. Eastern time.",
      "The developments come after jurors said Tuesday they'd agreed on four of the five counts against Combs but disagreed on racketeering conspiracy. They reached a verdict on all five counts Wednesday morning.",
      "Jurors began deliberating in U.S. District Court in lower Manhattan on Monday. They said they'd reached a partial verdict Tuesday, but Subramanian sent them back to continue deliberating on the remaining count.",
      "What were the charges against Sean \"Diddy\" Combs?",
      "The grand jury indictment against the 55-year-old Combs, unsealed in September 2024, initially charged the hip-hop mogul with three counts following his arrest at a Manhattan hotel. In April, before the trial began, prosecutors filed additional charges, bringing the total number of counts against him to five.",
      "Combs pleaded not guilty to all the charges.",
      "The charges against Combs and each verdict were:",
      "Count 1: Racketeering conspiracy - NOT GUILTYCount 2: Sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion (Casandra Ventura) - NOT GUILTYCount 3: Transportation to engage in prostitution (Casandra Ventura) - GUILTYCount 4: Sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion (\"Jane\") - NOT GUILTYCount 5: Transportation to engage in prostitution (\"Jane\") - GUILTY",
      "Count 1: Racketeering conspiracy - NOT GUILTY",
      "Count 2: Sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion (Casandra Ventura) - NOT GUILTY",
      "Count 3: Transportation to engage in prostitution (Casandra Ventura) - GUILTY",
      "Count 4: Sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion (\"Jane\") - NOT GUILTY",
      "Count 5: Transportation to engage in prostitution (\"Jane\") - GUILTY",
      "\"Jane\" is a pseudonym used in court for an ex-girlfriend of Combs who testified against him.",
      "What is the Mann Act?",
      "The prostitution-related charges allege violations of the Mann Act, a law that makes it a federal crime to transport someone across state lines for prostitution.",
      "The charge of racketeering conspiracy requires prosecutors to prove a number of elements: that there was an agreement among two or more people to participate in a pattern of activity that would affect interstate commerce; that the defendant willfully joined it; and that members of the conspiracy committed two or more racketeering acts. The charging document lists a number of alleged racketeering acts, including kidnapping, bribery, sex trafficking and forced labor.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that Combs' business empire created a criminal enterprise that he used for years to cover up acts of violence and abuse and to coerce women into fulfilling his sexual desires. Jurors heard from more than 30 witnesses over the course of seven weeks as the prosecution went through its case.",
      "Combs denied the accusations but chose not to take the stand to testify in his defense. His attorneys did not call any witnesses during the trial, though they did conduct extensive cross-examinations of the government's witnesses. Combs' lawyers argued the prosecution failed to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.",
      "\"Freak-offs\" part of emotional and graphic testimony",
      "The high-profile trial, which started in May, included graphic and emotional testimony from two of Combs' former girlfriends.",
      "Casandra Ventura, the R&B singer known as Cassie who spent more than a decade with him, testified about drug-fueled sex sessions that Combs allegedly referred to as \"freak-offs.\" Ventura testified that he directed all the encounters, which could last for days, and that she felt forced to participate to make him happy.",
      "Ventura testified that Combs controlled every aspect of her life, and that she often did things out of fear, since physical abuse was \"frequent.\"",
      "Combs' attorneys argued that the encounters were consensual. During cross-examination, the defense showed the jury a 2009 message from Ventura to Combs that read, \"I'm always ready to freak off.\"",
      "Ventura also testified about a 2016 incident which was caught on surveillance video showing Combs beating and kicking her in a California hotel hallway. Combs apologized at the time, saying his behavior was \"inexcusable\" and that he took \"full responsibility\" for his actions.",
      "Ventura testified that the attack happened as she was trying to leave a \"freak-off\" that had turned violent. A former hotel security officer testified that Combs offered him cash after the attack, which the officer said he understood to be a bribe.",
      "Ventura had filed a civil lawsuit against Combs in 2023, accusing him of physically and sexually abusing her. Combs denied the claims and quickly reached a settlement with her. In his closing argument to the jury Friday, defense attorney Marc Agnifilo said, \"If you had to pick a winner in this whole thing, it's hard not to pick Cassie.\"",
      "Another former girlfriend of Combs testified under the pseudonym \"Jane\" to protect her identity. She told the court she often participated in what she called \"hotel nights,\" which also involved drugs. Jane testified she would have sex with a male escort while Combs watched. She said she told Combs many times that she didn't want to have sex with other men and didn't like the \"hotel nights.\"",
      "Combs' lawyers displayed messages showing her setting up \"hotel nights.\" Jane said she felt pressured and that she had grown financially dependent on Combs.",
      "In the prosecution's closing arguments, Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik described Combs as \"the leader of a criminal enterprise. He doesn't take no for an answer. And now you know about many crimes he committed with members of his enterprise.\"",
      "She said he used a \"small army\" of employees to harm women and then cover it up. \"He thought that his fame, wealth and power put him above the law,\" Slavik said.",
      "Agnifilo countered by arguing that prosecutors \"badly exaggerated\" evidence of a swinger lifestyle and threesomes, combining it with recreational drug use and calling it a racketeering conspiracy.",
      "\"He did not do the things he's charged with. He didn't do racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking,\" Combs' lawyer said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-supreme-court-consumer-product-safety-commission/",
    "published": "Wed, 02 Jul 2025 11:51:36 -0400",
    "summary": "Three members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission were fired by President Trump in May.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's administration asked the Supreme Court on Wednesday to allow him to fire three members of the independent Consumer Product Safety Commission.",
      "The request to the high court by Solicitor General D. John Sauer arose from a federal judge's decision earlier this month that found Mr. Trump's removal of the three commissioners \u2014 Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric and Richard Trumka Jr. \u2014 was unlawful and blocked their terminations.",
      "The officials had been named to the five-member Consumer Product Safety Commission by former President Joe Biden for seven-year terms. Boyle's term was set to end in October, Hoehn-Saric's time on the panel was due to end in October 2027 and Trumka's in October 2028. The commission sets consumer product safety standards, can order product recalls and bring civil suits against companies.",
      "The three members were told in May that their positions were terminated, effective immediately. Under federal law, a president cannot remove a commissioner at-will, but only for neglect of duty or malfeasance. Removal restrictions like those governing the Consumer Product Safety Commission have been put in place by Congress to insulate independent agencies from politics. But Mr. Trump has sought to test his removal powers through a series of firings targeting members of those entities.",
      "Following their firings, the commissioners sued and asked a federal judge in Maryland, where the Consumer Product Safety Commission is headquartered, to restore them to their positions. They succeeded in their bid earlier this month, when U.S. District Judge Matthew Maddox allowed the three commissioners to resume their roles.",
      "\"Depriving this five-member commission of three of its sitting members threatens severe impairment of its ability to fulfill its statutory mandates and advance the public's interest in safe consumer products,\" Maddox wrote in his decision. \"This hardship and threat to public safety significantly outweighs any hardship defendants might suffer from plaintiffs' participation on the CPSC.\"",
      "A unanimous panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit declined to block the district court's decision and allow Mr. Trump to fire the commissioners.",
      "The commissioners, Judge James Wynn wrote in a brief opinion, \"were appointed to serve fixed terms with statutory protections designed to preserve the commission's independence and partisan balance. Permitting their unlawful removal would thwart that purpose and deprive the public of the commission's full expertise and oversight. And because the attempted removals were unlawful, the Plaintiff-Commissioners never ceased to lawfully occupy their offices.\"",
      "Sauer's emergency appeal to the Supreme Court is the third involving the president's power to remove executive officers, which the administration has argued is generally unrestricted.",
      "The justices in May cleared the way for Mr. Trump to remove without cause two members of two federal independent labor boards while legal fights over their terminations move forward. Over the dissent of the three liberal justices, the high court said in its unsigned decision that it \"reflects our judgment that the government faces greater risk of harm from an order allowing a removed officer to continue exercising the executive power than a wrongfully removed officer faces from being unable to perform her statutory duty.\"",
      "Sauer said that May decision from the high court regarding the earlier removals should have foreclosed the reinstatement of the Consumer Product Safety Commission members. The district court's order, he wrote, effectively transfers control of the panel from Mr. Trump to three members who were appointed by his predecessor.",
      "\"That plain-as-day affront to the President's fundamental Article II powers warrants intervention now,\" the solicitor general wrote.",
      "Sauer asked the high court to act immediately and issue a brief administrative stay that would allow it more time to consider his request for emergency relief. Lawyers for the commissioners opposed that request for swift action, noting that they have been serving in their roles in the nearly three weeks since the district judge ruled in their favor.",
      "The Trump administration, the lawyers said, did not identify any harm that would stem from the commissioner's continued service during the time it will take for the Supreme Court to rule.",

    "summary": "Republicans can likely only afford to lose three votes, and several GOP critics have threatened to sink the bill.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House convened Wednesday to take up President Trump's Senate-passed massive domestic policy bill, with Republicans aiming to approve the final version of the legislation ahead of a July 4 deadline to get the bill to the president's desk.",
      "The House Rules Committee advanced the Senate's changes to the bill overnight, setting up a possible dramatic floor vote in the coming hours. Debate and a key procedural vote were expected in the lower chamber Wednesday.",
      "House Republicans are forging ahead quickly on the signature legislation of Mr. Trump's second-term agenda, which includes ramped-up spending for border security, defense and energy production and extends trillions of dollars in tax cuts, partially offset by substantial cuts to health care and nutrition programs. The House passed an earlier version of the bill in May.",
      "House Democrats dragged out the process on the Rules Committee overnight and early into the morning\u00a0by submitting hundreds of amendments to be debated in the committee, similar to the way Senate Democrats delayed final passage by forcing the entire bill to be read on the floor and insisting on votes on dozens of amendments.",
      "\"All legislative tools and options are on the table,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said after the Senate vote Tuesday.",
      "Democratic Rep. Maxwell Frost of Florida said of their strategy that \"the longer this bill in the ether, the more unpopular it becomes.\"",
      "Democrats weren't alone in their resistance to the revised bill. GOP Reps. Ralph Norman of South Carolina and Chip Roy of Texas joined Democrats on the panel to oppose the rule, as a handful of hardline conservatives said they'd reject the Senate's changes.",
      "\"What the Senate did is unconscionable,\" Norman said. \"I'll vote against it here and I'll vote against it on the floor until we get it right.\"",
      "As Friday's self-imposed deadline quickly approaches, it's still unclear if House Republicans have enough support to get it over the finish line. Members have continued to voice their discontent with pieces of the tax and spending package that squeaked through the Senate. Possible holdouts, including moderates and members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, were meeting with Mr. Trump at the White House Wednesday.",
      "Several members on both sides of the aisle had their flights canceled or delayed by bad weather as they raced back to Washington for the vote, adding another layer of doubt around the bill's passage.",
      "Republicans can only afford three defections, if all members are present and voting.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, has spent weeks pleading with his Senate counterparts not to make any major changes to the version of the bill that passed the lower chamber by a single vote in May. He said the Senate bill's changes \"went a little further than many of us would've preferred.\"",
      "The Senate-passed bill includes steeper Medicaid cuts, a higher increase in the debt limit and changes to the House bill's green energy policies and the state and local tax deduction.",
      "Other controversial provisions that faced pushback in both chambers, including the sale of public lands in nearly a dozen states, a 10-year moratorium on states regulating artificial intelligence and an excise tax on the renewable energy industry, were stripped from the Senate bill before heading back to the House.",
      "Johnson said Tuesday night that he was having \"lots of discussion with lots of members about lots of ideas\" as several potential holdouts called for the bill to be reverted to the House-passed version. GOP leaders, however, said the House would vote on the Senate bill \"as-is.\"",
      "\"It's important to recognize that much of what the House included in H.R. 1 when we initially passed it is still included,\" said Republican Rep. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, who chairs the Rules Committee.",
      "Should the House make changes to the bill, the revisions would require the Senate's approval, or force the two chambers to go to conference committee to iron out a final product that the two bodies could agree on, jeopardizing the bill's timely passage.",
      "Meanwhile, the White House was expected to continue to pressure House Republicans to get the bill across the finish line. In a Truth Social post\u00a0Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump urged the GOP to get the bill done, saying to his party, \"don't let the Radical Left Democrats push you around.\"",
      "\"We've got all the cards, and we are going to use them,\" he said.",
      "With few levers to combat the bill's passage, House Democrats spoke out forcefully against the legislation.",
      "\"We will not stand by and watch Trump and his billionaire friends destroy this country without putting up one hell of a fight,\" Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts said, calling the bill a \"massive betrayal of the American people.\"",
      "Jeffries said that \"every single House Democrat will vote 'hell no' against this one, big ugly bill,\" while adding that \"all we need are four House Republicans to join us in defense of their constituents who will suffer mightily from this bill.\" Democratic leaders called out some Republicans by name, including Reps. Rob Bresnahan and Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Reps. David Valadao and Young Kim of California.",
      "\"It's unconscionable, it's unacceptable, it's un-American, and House Democrats are committing to you that we're going to do everything in our power to stop it,\" Jeffries said. \"All we need are four Republicans, just four.\"",

      "In a lawsuit filed Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, the athletic and lifestyle apparel company claims that certain Costco products imitate its own designs so closely that it constitutes \"trade dress\" infringement, which occurs when a product mimics another so closely that it confuses consumers.",
      "The apparel company claims that Costco's \"knockoff\" designs, or product \"dupes,\" violate trademark law because \"some customers incorrectly believe these infringing products are authentic Lululemon apparel.\" In other cases, \"customers specifically purchase the infringing products because they are difficult to distinguish from authentic Lululemon products,\" the lawsuit alleges.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/billions-withheld-from-summer-school-trump-administration/",
    "published": "Wed, 02 Jul 2025 10:53:45 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration is withholding over $6 billion in funding for after-school and summer programs, English language instruction and more.",
    "story": [
      "Day camp providers and schools say the Trump administration's funding freeze could ruin summer for low-income American families and jeopardize some after-school programs next year.",
      "The administration is holding back over $6 billion in federal grants for after-school and summer programs, English language instruction, adult literacy and more as it conducts a review to ensure grants are aligned with President Trump's priorities.",
      "The move creates uncertainty for states and schools as they budget for programs this summer and in the upcoming school year because they don't know if or when they'll receive the funding. Democrats say the administration is flouting the law by holding back congressionally appropriated money.",
      "Without the funds, schools say they won't be able to provide free or affordable after-school care for low-income kids while their parents work and may not be able to hire staff to teach children who are learning English. Classes or camps underway this summer could be in jeopardy, too.",
      "The Boys and Girls Clubs of America depend on some of this funding to run their camps and other summer programming for low-income students. If it's not restored soon, the programming could end mid-season, said Boys and Girls Club President Jim Clark.",
      "After-school programming in the fall could also take a hit. \"If these funds are blocked, the fallout will be swift and devastating,\" Clark said. As many as 926 Boys and Girls Clubs could close, affecting more than 220,000 kids, the group said.",
      "Programs relying on the money were expecting it to be distributed July 1, but an Education Department notice issued Monday announced the money would not be released while the programs are under review. The department didn't provide a timeline and warned that \"decisions have not yet been made\" on grants for the upcoming school year.",
      "\"The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President's priorities and the Department's statutory responsibilities,\" Education Department officials wrote in the notice, which was obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "The department referred questions to the Office of Management and Budget, which did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In Gadsden City Schools in Alabama, officials say they'll have no choice but to shutter their after-school program, which serves more than 1,200 low-income students, if federal funds aren't released. There's no other way to make up for the frozen federal money, said Janie Browning, who directs the program.",
      "Families who rely on after-school programs would lose an important source of child care that keeps children safe and engaged while their parents work. The roughly 75 employees of the district's after-school programs may lose their jobs.",
      "\"Those hours between after school and 6 o'clock really are the hours in the day when students are at the most risk for things that may not produce great outcomes,\" Browning said. \"It would be devastating if we lost the lifeline of afterschool for our students and our families.\"",
      "Jodi Grant, executive director of the Afterschool Alliance, said withholding the money could cause lasting damage to the economy.",
      "Some advocates fear the grants are being targeted for elimination, which could force schools to cut programs and teachers. Mr. Trump's 2026 budget proposal called on Congress to zero out all of the programs under review, signaling the administration sees them as unnecessary.",
      "Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington pressed the Trump administration to spend the money as Congress intended.",
      "\"Every day that this funding is held up is a day that school districts are forced to worry about whether they'll have to cut back on afterschool programs or lay off teachers instead of worrying about how to make sure our kids can succeed,\" Murray said in a statement.",
      "The six grant programs under review include one known as 21st Century Community Learning Centers. It's the primary federal funding source for after-school and summer learning programs and supports more than 10,000 local programs nationwide, according to the Afterschool Alliance. Every state runs its own competition to distribute the grants, which totaled $1.3 billion this fiscal year.",
      "Also under review are $2 billion in grants for teachers' professional development and efforts to reduce class size; $1 billion for academic enrichment grants, often used for science and math education and accelerated learning; $890 million for students who are learning English; $376 million to educate the children of migrant workers; and $715 million to teach adults how to read.",
      "These programs account for over 20% of the federal money the District of Columbia receives for K-12 education, according to an analysis by the Learning Policy Institute, a think tank. California alone has over $800,000 in limbo, while Texas has over $660,000.",
      "\"Trump is illegally impounding billions of dollars appropriated by Congress to serve students this fiscal year,\" said Tony Thurmond, California's state superintendent, in a statement. \"The Administration is punishing children when states refuse to cater to Trump's political ideology.",
      "The loss of funds could \"put several more school districts in extreme financial distress,\" said Chris Reykdal, superintendent of public instruction in Washington state. Districts have already adopted budgets, planned programming and hired staff, assuming they'd receive the money, Reykdal said.",
      "If the funding freeze remains, children learning English and their parents would be especially affected. Some districts use the money to pay for summer programming designed for English learners, family engagement specialists who can communicate with parents and professional development training for staff. Rural districts would be hit the hardest.",
      "\"They're trying to send a message,\" said Amaya Garcia, who oversees education research at New America, a left-leaning think tank. \"They don't believe that taxpayer funding should be used for these children.\"",
      "Umatilla School District in rural eastern Oregon \u2014 with a sizable population of migrant families and students learning English \u2014 relies heavily on federal funding for its after-school and summer school programs. Superintendent Heidi Sipe says she is meeting with state officials soon to find out if the district will have to plan an early end to summer school, an option 20% of students are using. Come this fall, if federal money stays frozen, she'll have to lay off staff and eliminate after-school programs attended by around half the district's students.",
      "\"It's an essential service in our community because we don't have any licensed child care centers for school-age children,\" she said.",
      "Sipe said it's particularly frustrating to deal with these funds being put into limbo because the school district was in the middle of a five-year grant period.",
      "\"It feels preventable,\" she said, \"and it feels as though we could have done a better job planning for America's children.\"",

      "Vehcle sales fell to 384,122 in April through June, a more than 13% drop from 443,956 in the same period last year. Sales of the company's Models 3 and Y totaled 373,728, above the estimate of 356,000 from Wall Street analysts.",
      "The decline comes amid renewed friction between Musk and President Trump this week, with the billionaire entrepreneur blasting the Republican tax and spending bill passed by the Senate on Tuesday.",
      "Musk has acknowledged that his work as head of the Department of Government Efficiency and his embrace of European far-right candidates have hurt the company. But he attributed much of the sales plunge to customers holding off while they waited for new versions of Tesla's best selling Model Y, and recently predicted a major turnaround in sales.",
      "Tesla sales across Europe plummeted by almost 50% in April\u00a0even as the broader market for electric cars saw growth in the region, according to data\u00a0released\u00a0by the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association in May.

      "Despite the sales slump, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives thinks Tesla is well-positioned for future growth, pointing to the company's push into self-driving vehicles. Tesla in June started testing a \"robotaxi\" service in Austin, Texas, and is investing heavily in autonomous driving technology.",

    "story": [
      "Bryan Kohberger, the former criminal justice doctoral student charged in the murders of four University of Idaho students in 2022, is expected to officially plead guilty Wednesday in a deal with prosecutors that spares him from the death penalty.",
      "The hearing is expected to begin at 11 a.m. local time (1 p.m. ET). People hoping to be inside the courtroom have been lined up since 2:45 a.m.",
      "Kohberger is charged with four counts of murder in the stabbings of Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves, who were killed at a home in Moscow, Idaho, during the\u00a0early morning hours of Nov. 13, 2022. Kohberger was arrested at his parents' home in Pennsylvania six weeks later. DNA evidence linked him to a knife sheath found at the crime scene, according to a\u00a0police affidavit.",
      "The plea deal was first revealed in a letter sent to the victims' families by the Latah County Prosecutor's Office. Mogen's father, Ben Mogen, shared portions of the letter with \"CBS Mornings,\" in which the prosecutor's office said that attorneys for Kohberger, 30, requested the deal and Kohberger accepted it.",
      "The deal requires Kohberger plead guilty to all the counts against him and says he would be sentenced to \"four consecutive (back to back) life sentences on the four Murder counts\" and \"would waive all rights to appeal.\" The plea deal would spare him the death penalty, which prosecutors had sought.",
      "Kohberger will also plead guilty to a burglary count and be sentenced to ten years, according to the letter.",
      "In Idaho, a judge has the authority to reject plea deals, but it's considered rare.",
      "The letter says that if Kohberger \"enters guilty pleas as expected,\" prosecutors expect him to be sentenced in late July. If he does not enter the expected guilty plea, prosecutors will proceed to trial. Kohberger's trial was expected to begin in August, following several delays.",
      "Kohberger's defense team had a motion to remove the death penalty as a possible sentence if he was convicted denied in November 2024. The case was meant to be tried in Latah County, but was moved to Boise out of concerns that media coverage and statements from local officials would make it impossible for Kohberger to receive a fair trial.",
      "Most recently, Ada County Judge Steven Hippler denied a motion by Kohberger's lawyers, who were seeking to argue that four \"alternate perpetrators\" could have committed the slayings. The judge called the argument \"rank speculation\" and said nothing linked the parties to the murders.",
      "Martin Souto Diaz, an attorney for the Kohberger family, said in a statement provided to CBS News Tuesday evening on behalf of the family that, \"In light of recent developments, the Kohbergers are asking members of the media for privacy, respect, and responsible judgment during this time. We will continue to allow the legal process to unfold with respect to all parties, and will not release any comments or take any questions.\"",
      "Prosecutors planned to present evidence including Kohberger's Amazon purchase history, which showed he bought a Ka-Bar knife with a sheath and sharpener. The blade he bought macthed the sheath found at the crime scene, prosecutors said. They also\u00a0planned\u00a0to present surveillance video of Kohberger's car and cellphone data that they said showed him in the vicinity of the killings.",
      "The families of the victims have been split on the plea deal. The Goncalves family said in a statement shared on Facebook that they are \"beyond furious at the State of Idaho,\" and said officials had \"failed\" them.",
      "\"This was very unexpected,\" the family wrote. In another statement, they asked that the plea deal \"require a full confession, full accountability, location of the murder weapon, confirmation the defendant acted alone, & the true facts of what happened that night.\"",
      "Ben Mogen said he was relieved to get the letter, and said the plea deal will spare him and his family from more time in court.",
      "\"We can actually put this behind us and not have these future dates and future things that we don't want to have to be at, that we shouldn't have to be at, that have to do with this terrible person,\" he told CBS Mornings. \"We get to just think about the rest of our lives and have to try and figure out how to do it without Maddie and without the rest of the kids.\"",

      "Jurors in the Sean \"Diddy\" Combs trial continued their deliberations Wednesday on the racketeering conspiracy charge against the hip-hop mogul after reaching a partial verdict on\u00a0four out of the five charges.",
      "The panel of eight men and four women entered the third day of deliberations at U.S. District Court in lower Manhattan, having arrived at a decision Tuesday on two counts of sex trafficking and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution, the latter concerning allegations of arranging to fly women and sex workers across state lines.",
      "It remains unclear whether the jury found Combs guilty or not guilty of those four counts. Before the results of the verdict can be announced, jurors will have to decide on count 1 of racketeering conspiracy.",
      "Combs, 55, has\u00a0pleaded not guilty\u00a0to\u00a0all the charges.",
      "The jurors sent a note to the judge late Tuesday afternoon saying they'd reached a verdict on four of the five counts but were unable to agree on count 1. The foreman told Judge Arun Subramanian that the jury was unable to reach a verdict on the racketeering conspiracy charge because they had jurors \"with unpersuadable opinions on both sides.\" The judge told them to keep deliberating, and the jurors were later dismissed for the day.",
      "According to the jury's verdict sheet, there are eight acts under the federal racketeering conspiracy charge: kidnapping, arson, bribery, witness tampering, forced labor, sex trafficking, transportation and inducement to travel for purposes of prostitution, and possession with intent to distribute narcotics.",
      "\"The RICO [Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act] charge is the most serious, the most complex, the most elements, the most difficult to prove and, frankly, the most confusing,\" legal expert Richard Schoenstein, the vice chair of litigation practice at Tarter Krinsky & Drogin, told CBS New York. \"So it doesn't surprise me at all that would be the count that they're currently undecided on.\"",
      "Jurors reached their partial verdict on the four counts Tuesday after\u00a0requesting to review some of the testimony from Combs' former longtime girlfriend and R&B singer\u00a0Cassie Ventura and a male escort allegedly involved in so-called \"freak-offs.\" It came after less than 13 hours of deliberations across two days. Jurors\u00a0began deliberating\u00a0on Monday.",
      "After the note from the jury was brought to court on Tuesday, Combs was seated with his attorneys surrounding him, standing in a half-circle. Combs appeared to be praying with his head bowed and hands folded on his lap. Combs wiped and rubbed his eyes, but it wasn't clear if he was crying.",

    "story": [
      "As billionaire Elon Musk feuds with President Trump over his signature tax and domestic policy legislation, Musk has reupped his calls to launch a new political party \u2014 a daunting task even for the wealthiest person on Earth.",
      "Musk first floated launching a third party, dubbed the \"America Party,\" earlier this month, part of a nasty back-and-forth between the president and the Tesla CEO that marked the likely end of their political alliance. Musk raised the idea again this week as lawmakers raced to send the One Big Beautiful Bill Act to Mr. Trump's desk \u2014 and this time, Musk put a time limit on the plan.",
      "\"If this insane spending bill passes, the America Party will be formed the next day,\" Musk wrote in a post on X Monday evening, hours before the bill passed the Senate on Tuesday and headed back to the House. \"Our country needs an alternative to the Democrat-Republican uniparty so that the people actually have a VOICE.\"",
      "It remains unclear if Musk will follow through on his pledge, but the idea could be easier said than done. If Musk decides to launch a new political party, he'll need to contend with a thicket of complicated state laws, time-consuming ballot access rules and intense litigation.",
      "\"Only the richest person in the world could make a serious effort at creating a new American political party,\" Brett Kappel, a veteran election lawyer, told CBS News.",
      "Navigating 50 different state laws \u2014 and federal rules",
      "\"Political parties are creatures of the states,\" Kappel said.",
      "Each state has different legal rules for recognizing which political parties can appear on the ballot, and those hurdles \"range from high to extraordinarily difficult to overcome,\" he noted. In some cases, a nascent state party may need to get candidates onto the ballot by submitting large numbers of signatures, and then win a certain percentage of the vote across election cycles.",
      "For example, to qualify in California, a new political party needs to either sign up 0.33% of the state's voters \u2014 or about 75,000 people \u2014 as registered members, or submit signatures from 1.1 million voters. After that, in order to remain qualified, parties have to either maintain that 0.33% registration threshold or win at least 2% of the vote in a statewide race.",
      "And to gain recognition at the national level, each state-level political party would need to seek an advisory opinion from the Federal Election Commission.",
      "These efforts would almost certainly face intense pushback from the Democratic and Republican parties, including legal challenges over signatures in each state, requiring Musk \u2014 or any other aspiring third-party founder \u2014 to spend scores of money on litigation.",
      "\"The state laws in all of the states are biased towards the two major political parties, and make it as difficult as possible for the emergence of a third political party,\" Kappel told CBS News.",
      "The process of creating a political party with national ambitions would be time-consuming, too. Kappel says it might be doable \u2014 albeit difficult \u2014 for Musk to get a few favored candidates onto the ballot in certain states, but building an entirely new national party would likely take years, and would not be possible by the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "For evidence of how challenging the process is, look no further than the struggles that existing third parties have faced. The Green Party and Libertarian Party were each founded decades ago, and still engage in state-by-state pushes for ballot access and party recognition.",
      "\"The hurdles for creating a new party and getting it on the ballot are extremely high. It can be done if you have endless amounts of money, but it's a multi-year project and will cost hundreds of millions of dollars,\" Kappel said.",
      "Musk's campaign cash",
      "The high cost of launching a political party may not be a big stumbling block for Musk, whose net worth exceeds $350 billion according to Forbes and Bloomberg's valuations.",
      "The Tesla and SpaceX leader spent a staggering $277 million to aid Mr. Trump and other Republican candidates in the 2024 election cycle. The bulk of that spending, roughly $239 million, was routed through America PAC, a political action committee founded by Musk that underwrote a sprawling get-out-the-vote effort across the swing states.",
      "Since then, Musk has hinted that he plans to dial back his involvement in politics. His tenure leading the Trump administration's cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency ended in May, a month after telling Tesla shareholders his work with the federal government will \"drop significantly.\" He also said at the Qatar Economic Forum in May that he will \"do a lot less\" political spending moving forward, noting he doesn't \"currently see a reason\" to keep opening his wallet.",
      "If Musk follows through on his proposal to launch a competitor to the two mainstream parties, it would mark an expensive return to the fray \u2014 and the laws around how to finance it are complex.",
      "Before new political parties are formally recognized, they are typically organized as not-for-profit groups, and their financial backers do not face any dollar limits to their donations, Kappel says. But once a party gains national recognition, donors like Musk would be subject to the FEC's caps on political contributions. Currently, individuals can only give $10,000 a year to a state political party, or $44,300 a year to a national party committee, the FEC says.",
      "The rules governing when organizations are subject to those limits are byzantine. Almost two decades ago, the FEC said a group called Unity08 \u2014 which aimed to create a bipartisan presidential ticket \u2014 must register as a political committee if it spends over $1,000 trying to get ballot access. After a lengthy legal battle, an appeals court reversed that decision.",
      "Another way for Musk to keep wielding political influence would be through America PAC. The group is organized as a super PAC, which allows Musk to donate unlimited sums of money, but requires the group to remain officially independent from candidates or political parties.",
      "Even as he mused about launching a third party, Musk implied this week he could remain engaged in Republican politics. The billionaire suggested he will back primary challenges against GOP lawmakers who voted for the Trump-endorsed One Big Beautiful Bill Act. He also vowed to lend support to Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who voted against the bill and is facing a Trump-backed primary contest.",
      "The president, for his part, has said in recent days that Musk appears to be \"upset\" that his signature tax and domestic policy bill would phase out electric vehicle tax credits \u2014 which could\u00a0 cost Tesla billions. Some of Musk's criticisms of the bill have focused on its steep cuts to green energy incentives, though he has also argued the bill is too expensive.",
      "\"I think Elon is a wonderful guy, and I know he's going to do well always,\" Mr. Trump told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo in an interview that aired Sunday. \"But he got a little bit upset, and that wasn't appropriate.\"",

    "summary": "The owner of an Oklahoma maker of guitar pedals has had to get creative to absorb higher import costs.",
    "story": [
      "Small businesses facing higher import costs because of steeper U.S. tariffs are having to find different ways of handling the added expense.",
      "Facing hefty tariffs on parts shipped from China, one small business owner took the hit by redeeming over 1.8 million reward points on his American Express card. Robert Keeley, owner of Keeley Electronics, a roughly 33-person guitar pedal company in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, told CBS MoneyWatch he used the points, rather than cash, to cover the tariffs.",
      "That unusual approach, first reported by Bloomberg, highlights the challenges many smaller enterprises are facing in coping with higher import duties.",
      "Keeley's operation makes pedals used to create effects for electric and some acoustic guitars in a 17,000 square-foot warehouse in Oklahoma. But he's been unable to source one of the pedals' key components, a so-called potentiometer from anywhere other than China, leading to ballooning tariff charges.",
      "\"We manufacture and build nearly every part of the pedals in our factory, including the aluminum enclosures and all the circuit boards,\" Keeley told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I really love manufacturing and giving someone a job.\"",
      "Keeley said his team has tried to find a provider of potentiometers, which control voltages, outside of China, but to no avail.",
      "\"We can't find a source outside of China for our potentiometer, which is critical for our designs,\" Keeley said. \"Even when we call companies in Taiwan, they say they get theirs from China.\"",
      "$11,000 credit card bill",
      "Tariffs on the key component have surged since the start of President Trump's second term in January, according to Keeley. His business was on the hook for tariffs of 25% until March, when the duties temporarily shot up to more than 100%. Now the company pays a rate of 55% for potentiometers, he said.",
      "A 90-day freeze on country-based tariffs, including those in place on China, expires on July 9. Keeley is hoping the current rate will come down, but uncertainty lingers. Trade experts also say Mr. Trump could again extend the tariff pause if trade deals are not reached by the deadline.",
      "Keeley's most recent credit card bill, which included shipping and tariff fees, totaled nearly $11,000, according to a copy of the statement viewed by CBS MoneyWatch. Instead of paying cash, Keeley used the credit card points he'd accrued by paying previous tariff charges with plastic.",
      "\"I decided to use my points because I wasn't redeeming them for other things like gift cards. So I thought it would be clever to apply them to my bills for tariffs,\" Keeley said, noting that the charge is only a sliver of his tariff-related cost. \"It sounds like a lot of points, and that gives you a sense of how much I am paying in tariffs.\"",
      "Keeley emphasized he doesn't like depending on China for manufacturing his company's wares, saying that amounts to what he described as a \"single point of failure.\" Although he hasn't yet raised prices for customers to offset the higher costs, the business may have no choice but to do so if stiff tariffs on Chinese imports remain in place, he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I want to make sure I am releasing exciting products that the world wants to buy,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If I don't pay attention to what I'm trying to sell and what people want, then I will go out of business. But for now, I am in a stable place.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 01 Jul 2025 17:33:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The partial verdict in the Sean \"Diddy\" Combs trial came on the second day of deliberations. The jury will return to deliberate on the final count Wednesday.",
    "story": [
      "Update: Sean \"Diddy\" Combs was convicted of prostitution-related offenses but acquitted of sex trafficking and racketeering charges on Wednesday, July 2. Read the story here. Our earlier coverage is below.",
      "The jury in Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' federal sex trafficking and racketeering trial in New York City said it reached a partial verdict in the case, but the judge told them they need to continue deliberating on the remaining count.",
      "The jurors sent a note to the judge late Tuesday afternoon saying they'd reached a verdict on four of the five counts but were unable to agree on count 1, racketeering conspiracy. The note indicated there are jurors with unpersuadable opinions on that charge.",
      "After discussing the options with attorneys for both sides, Judge Arun Subramanian asked the jury to keep deliberating on the remaining charge, which is what prosecutors and defense attorneys asked for.",
      "Court then ended for the day. The jury will return to continue deliberations at 9 a.m. Wednesday.",
      "After the note from the jury was brought to court, Combs was seated with his attorneys surrounding him, standing in a half-circle. Combs appeared to be praying with his head bowed and hands folded on his lap. Combs wiped and rubbed his eyes, but it wasn't clear if he was crying.",
      "Jurors began deliberating in U.S. District Court in lower Manhattan on Monday.",
      "What are the charges against Sean \"Diddy\" Combs?",
      "A sweeping grand jury indictment against Combs, 55, was unsealed in September 2024, initially charging the hip-hop mogul with three counts following his arrest at an upscale midtown Manhattan hotel. In April, before the trial began, prosecutors filed additional charges against Combs in a superseding indictment, bringing the total number of counts against him to five.",
      "The charges against Combs are one count of racketeering conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. Combs pleaded not guilty to the charges. If convicted, he could face up to life in prison.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that Combs' business empire created a criminal enterprise that he used for years to cover up acts of violence and abuse and to coerce women into fulfilling his sexual desires. Jurors heard from more than 30 witnesses over the course of seven weeks as the prosecution went through its case.",
      "Combs' attorneys didn't call him or any witnesses to testify in his defense during the trial. Combs told Judge Subramanian that he decided not to testify, saying: \"I mean, it's my decision with my lawyers. ... My decision to make. I'm making it.\" His lawyers argued the prosecution failed to prove the charges against Combs, and the defense sought an acquittal after the prosecution rested.",
      "\"Freak-offs\" and \"hotel nights\"",
      "The high-profile trial started in May. The proceedings included graphic and emotional testimony, including from singer Cassie Ventura, Combs' former girlfriend who spent more than a decade with him.",
      "Ventura testified about drug-fueled sex sessions that Combs allegedly referred to as \"freak-offs.\" Ventura said in court that Combs directed all the encounters, which could last for days. She said Combs would decide who participated, what she could wear and the role she was expected to play. She testified that she felt forced to participate in the \"freak-offs\" to make Combs happy.",
      "Combs' attorneys argued that the encounters were consensual, and during cross-examination, the defense showed the jury a 2009 message from Ventura to Combs that read, \"I'm always ready to freak off.\"",
      "Last year, CNN aired surveillance video from 2016 showing what appears to be Combs assaulting Ventura at a California hotel. Combs apologized at the time, and said his behavior was \"inexcusable\" and he takes \"full responsibility\" for his actions. Ventura testified during the trial that the attack happened as she was trying to leave a \"freak-off\" that turned violent. A former hotel security officer testified that Combs offered him cash after the attack, which the officer said he understood to be a bribe.",
      "Ventura had filed a civil lawsuit against Combs in 2023, accusing him of physically and sexually abusing her. Combs denied the claims and quickly settled with her. In his closing argument to the jury Friday, defense attorney Marc Agnifilo said, \"If you had to pick a winner in this whole thing, it's hard not to pick Cassie.\"",
      "Singer Dawn Richard, who was part of two bands tied to Combs, testified that she often saw Combs being violent toward Ventura. She said that after one incident in 2009, Combs allegedly threatened her and a bandmate, saying they could go missing if they didn't stay quiet.",
      "The defense focused on inconsistencies in Richard's testimony, and she said it takes time to remember things she tried to forget. Separately, Richard has made allegations against Combs in a civil lawsuit, accusing him of physical and psychological abuse, which he has denied.",
      "Another former girlfriend of Combs testified under the pseudonym Jane in court. During their relationship between 2021 and 2024, she told the court she often participated in what she called \"hotel nights,\" which also involved drugs. Jane testified she would have sex with a male escort while Combs watched.",
      "She said she told Combs she didn't like the \"hotel nights.\" Combs' lawyers displayed messages showing her setting them up. Jane said she felt pressured to meet her partner's expectations and that she had grown financially dependent on Combs.",
      "Jane said she got into a fight with Combs last year over another woman. She said she slammed his head on a marble table and he allegedly grabbed her by the neck, punched and kicked her.",

      "The panel of eight men and four women continued deliberating the charges against Combs after not reaching a verdict on the first day of deliberations.",
      "Judge Arun Subramanian began the day by addressing with the prosecution and defense a question posed Monday from the jury about one of the alleged racketeering acts \u2014 possession with intent to distribute drugs \u2014 which relates to the racketeering conspiracy charge Combs is facing. The jury sent a note asking for clarification on the part of the instructions addressing drug distribution.",
      "Subramanian said he would remind jurors of the instructions he gave them on that part of the case before they started deliberating on Monday. Combs' lawyers had pushed for a more expansive response, but prosecutors argued \u2014 and Subramanian agreed \u2014 that doing so could end up confusing jurors more.",
      "An exchange between Subramanian and Combs' defense team got a little testy as they wrangled over the response.",
      "\"Can you do what I'm asking or no?\" the judge asked.",
      "\"Of course I can do what your honor is asking,\" one of the defense lawyers responded.",
      "About 75 minutes into Tuesday's deliberations, the jury requested the testimony from Ventura, one of the prosecution's most important witnesses, when she gave her account of Combs allegedly beating, kicking and dragging her at a Los Angeles hotel in 2016 \u2014 an assault captured on now-infamous security camera footage. Combs apologized after the video surfaced.",
      "The jury also asked to see Ventura's testimony about an incident in which she said Combs accused her of taking drugs from him and kicked her off of their yacht at the Cannes Film Festival in France in 2013. On their way back to the U.S., she said, he threatened to release explicit videos of her having sex.",
      "In addition, the jury asked for Ventura and stripper Daniel Phillip's testimony about her jumping into his lap at a New York City hotel after, as Phillip testified, he suspected Combs had been slapping and slamming her around an adjacent room.",
      "\"Her whole entire body was shaking, like she was terrified,\" said Phillip, who was at the hotel for a sexual encounter with Ventura sometime between 2012 and 2014.",
      "Phillip testified that he asked Ventura why she was with Combs if he was hitting her and beating her. He said he told her she was in real danger. Ventura, he said, \"basically tried to convince me that it was OK, it's OK. I'm fine, I'll be OK.\"",
      "Combs, 55, has\u00a0pleaded not guilty\u00a0to\u00a0federal charges\u00a0of racketeering conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking, and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution for allegedly arranging to fly sex workers across state lines.",
      "The first day of deliberations saw several notes from the jury, as well as Combs and his supporters bowing their heads in prayer in the courtroom. One of the notes came not long after jurors started deliberating and raised concerns from several jurors about another member of the panel. They told the judge they thought \"he cannot follow your honor's instructions.\"",
      "After a discussion between the judge, attorneys for Combs and prosecutors, the judge reminded the jurors of their obligation to follow the law and sent them back to resume their deliberations, but said if more issues should arise, the foreperson should send another note.",

      "\"We can always ratchet it up. We can't ratchet it down,\" Agnifilo said.",
      "In the late afternoon, the jury sent the judge a new note with a question about one of the alleged racketeering acts \u2014 possession with intent to distribute drugs \u2014 stemming from the racketeering conspiracy charge Combs is facing. The judge told the court he'd answer them on Tuesday and dismissed the jury for the day.",

      "As the deliberations got underway, Combs faced his family and supporters in the courtroom gallery. They bowed their heads in prayer \u2014 his family members holding hands with each other. When they finished, they all applauded.",

      "\"The prosecution made clear there only has to be one instance, out of these hundreds of 'freak-offs,' one instance where it was coerced by force, fraud or coercion, and that can include threats of harm that doesn't even include physical harm,\" Polisi said. \"So that can include fear of financial harm, fear of reputational harm. Remember, he videotaped all of these encounters, and the government laid out specific instances where he threatened to release those tapes.\"",
      "In closing arguments last week, federal prosecutors and Combs' defense team took their last shots at convincing jurors to convict or acquit the Grammy Award-winning founder of Bad Boy Records.",
      "\"The defendant used power, violence and fear to get what he wanted,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik said. \"He thought that his fame, wealth and power put him above the law.\"",

    "summary": "Trump says Israel has agreed to conditions for a Gaza ceasefire and he's urging Hamas to back it, but neither side has committed to anything yet.",
    "story": [
      "It appeared on Wednesday that President Trump likely still has some deal-making to do before he can claim to have brokered a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas to end the devastating war in Gaza. Mr. Trump said in a Tuesday evening social media post that Israel had \"agreed to the necessary conditions to finalize\" a 60-day ceasefire, and he called on Hamas to accept the deal, warning the U.S.- and Israeli-designated terrorist group that \"it will not get better \u2014 IT WILL ONLY GET WORSE.\"",
      "Israeli sources told CBS News on Wednesday that while there was strong backing in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet for the terms in the proposal, Israel was not committing to it yet, stressing that the government had voiced its backing to U.S. officials for a proposed framework for a ceasefire deal, not a final agreement.",
      "In a statement, Hamas credited mediators Qatar and Egypt for having \"exerted intensive efforts to bridge the gap between the parties and reach a framework agreement that would pave the way for a serious round of negotiations.\"",
      "\"We are approaching this with a high sense of responsibility and are conducting national consultations to discuss the proposals presented by the mediators,\" Hamas said, reiterating its long-standing calls for a truce that brings the war to an end, sees Israeli forces withdraw from Gaza, \"and urgently delivers relief to our people in the Gaza Strip.\"",
      "Mr. Trump didn't offer any details of the proposed deal in his post on Tuesday evening, but he said that Qatar and Egypt \u2014 which have been key partners to the U.S. as it attempts to broker an agreement to end the nearly two-year war \u2014 would \"deliver this final proposal.\"",
      "Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar, in a post on social media Wednesday, said there was \"a great majority in the government and also among the people for a framework to release hostages. If there is an opportunity to do so \u2014 we must not miss it!\"",
      "But that claim of cohesion may belie a potentially significant hurdle for Netanyahu as he prepares to head to Washington this weekend to meet with Mr. Trump, who's made it clear he wants to see a deal to end the war within days.",
      "Numerous Israeli media outlets reported Wednesday that one of the most far-right members of Netanyahu's cabinet, Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, had called on far-right nationalist Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich to join him in blocking the government's approval of the ceasefire deal.",
      "Neither Smotrich nor Ben-Gvir confirmed any discussion about blocking the agreement, but in a short post on social media, Ben-Gvir said the war in Gaza should not end \"a moment before defeating Hamas.\" Both men have been vocal in rejecting peace deals with Hamas, insisting that the group must be completely destroyed, not negotiated with.",
      "Yair Golan, leader of the Israeli opposition Democrats party, accused Smotrich and Ben-Gvir in a social media post of \"leading a bloc to prevent the return of the hostages.\" He said they \"do not deserve to sit around the government table. And whoever continues to allow them to sit there does not deserve to lead Israel for even one more day.\"",
      "While the real prospects of Israel and Hamas agreeing to a ceasefire in the short time frame that Mr. Trump is hoping for remained unclear, even the suggestion that peace could be looming may raise hopes for Gazans who risk their lives every day just to line up lining up for food.",
      "Gaza Humanitarian Foundation responds to criticism",
      "The Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health says at least 640 civilians have been shot to death in recent weeks trying to access desperately needed humanitarian supplies, including more than 400 at distribution sites run by the heavily criticized U.S.- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.",
      "Since it began operating in the war-torn enclave on May 26, GHF has faced near daily claims of aid-seekers being killed by Israeli forces as they try to reach its four hubs in Gaza.",
      "Earlier this week, more than 170 humanitarian groups called for the opaquely run organization \u2014   which has never revealed its funding or management structure \u2014   to be disbanded and all aid efforts in Gaza to be reorganized under the long-established United Nations-led system. Those international humanitarian efforts have been largely blocked by Israel since March.",
      "The Israeli military says it works with the GHF to enable aid distribution without the risk of food and other goods being stolen by Hamas.",
      "The Trump administration has backed that reasoning and refused to support other means of food dispersal in Gaza, instead calling on other nations and institutions to work with the GHF, which replaced some 400 international aid distribution points in the Palestinian territory with just four of its hubs. Those hubs are run by armed U.S. private security contractors, and the Israeli military controls access to them.",
      "All established humanitarian agencies have refused to work with the GHF, saying it forces Palestinians to dislocate and trek for miles to reach its hubs and that it violates basic humanitarian principles, but the Trump administration announced late last week its first public support for the group: $30 million in funding.",
      "The State Department wouldn't say, when that funding was announced, if the funds had already been transferred to GHF, or which U.S. government account they would come from.",
      "The GHF has declined to respond to multiple questions from CBS News about its connections with the U.S. and Israeli governments and its funding, and it had, until this week, also declined to be interviewed by CBS News about its operations. On Tuesday, however, the GHF's director, American evangelical reverend Johnnie Moore, a former adviser to President Trump on religious matters, agreed to an interview via Zoom.",
      "Our first question was about the reports CBS News has received since GHF began its operations, directly from doctors and eyewitnesses, that Israeli soldiers have repeatedly opened fire on unarmed civilians trying to reach its aid hubs.",
      "\"I do not want to diminish these reports, but we can't control what happens outside our distribution sites,\" Moore told CBS News.",
      "Asked how many more people would die before GHF changed the way it operates, Moore called the framing of the question \"inappropriate,\" and said the group's \"whole reason for existing is to give food to these people so they can live.\"",
      "He repeated his previous calls \u2014   and those of the White House \u2014   for the United Nations and its various humanitarian agencies to join GHF's efforts in Gaza.",
      "\"We've said again and again to the U.N., to the WFP (World Food Program), join us in this effort,\" Moore said, before asking CBS News' correspondent, \"with respect, why don't you join us? I'm asking you to help us run the operation if you think there is a better way to do this.\"",
      "Asked how GHF has been able to verify who exactly receives the aid it provides on the ground \u2014   which Moore has stressed does not reach Hamas \u2014 the reverend responded with a question: \"Do you have anything positive to say about what we are doing?\"",
      "\"Do you think it is acceptable that people die every day trying to access aid? Is there not a better way to do this?\" CBS News asked again.",
      "\"We have made a decision that it is worth working in a war zone,\" Moore said, \"as deadly as it is, because Gazans deserve food.\"",
      "Moore would not respond to questions about how GHF operates or who funds the organization, beside the $30 million contribution announced this week by the Trump administration.",

      "The decision, however, is expected to irk China, which has repeatedly said that it alone has the authority to approve the next religious leader. It insists the reincarnated figure must be found in China's Tibetan areas, giving Communist authorities power over who is chosen.",
      "Many observers believe there eventually will be rival Dalai Lamas \u2014 one appointed by Beijing, and one by senior monks loyal to the current Dalai Lama.",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning at a daily news briefing Wednesday said \"the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama must adhere to the principles of domestic search in China\" and \"approval by the central government.\"",
      "Mao said the process must \"follow religious rituals and historical settings, and be handled in accordance with national laws and regulations.\"",
      "Tenzin Gyatso became the 14th reincarnation of the Dalai Lama in 1940. He fled Tibet when Chinese troops crushed an uprising in the Tibetan capital Lhasa in 1959 and has been living in the town of Dharamshala in India since then, helping establish a democratic government-in-exile while also traveling the world to advocate autonomy for the Tibetan people.",
      "Tibetan Buddhists believe the Dalai Lama can choose the body into which he is reincarnated, as has happened on 14 occasions since the creation of the institution in 1587. He has reiterated in the past that his successor would be born outside China.",
      "The Dalai Lama laid out his succession plan in a recorded statement that was televised at a religious gathering of Buddhist monks in Dharamshala. He said the process of finding and recognizing his reincarnation lies solely with the Gaden Phodrang Trust \u2014 a non-profit he founded in 2015 that oversees matters related to the spiritual leader and the institute of the Dalai Lama.",
      "\"No one else has any such authority to interfere in this matter,\" he said, adding that the search for a future Dalai Lama should be carried out in \"accordance with past tradition.\"",
      "The Dalai Lama has often urged his followers to reject anyone chosen by Beijing. The self-proclaimed Tibetan government-in-exile he once headed before relinquishing his political role in 2011 also supports this stance.",
      "Penpa Tsering, the president of the government-in-exile, said Tibetans from around the world made \"an earnest request with single-minded devotion\" that the position of the Dalai Lama should continue \"for the benefit of all sentient beings in general and Buddhist in particular.\"",
      "\"In response to this overwhelming supplication, His Holiness has shown infinite compassion and finally agreed to accept our appeal on this special occasion of his 90th birthday,\" he said at a press conference.",
      "Tsering, however, warned China not to meddle in the process of the Dalai Lama's succession, saying it is a \"unique Tibetan Buddhist tradition.\"",
      "\"We not only strongly condemn the People's Republic of China's usage of reincarnation subject for their political gain, and will never accept it,\" he said.",
      "The search for a Dalai Lama's reincarnation begins only upon the incumbent's death.",
      "In the past, the successor has been identified by senior monastic disciples, based on spiritual signs and visions, and it can take several years after the next Dalai Lama is identified as a baby and groomed to take the reins.",

      "Ye, the American rapper formerly known as Kanye West, has been barred from entering Australia because of his pro-Nazi song \"Heil Hitler,\" the country's immigration minister told Australia's ABC television network on Tuesday.",
      "The song, which was first released in May, has been banned in Germany and from online platforms including Spotify, YouTube and Apple Music because of its antisemitism lyrics praising Adolf Hitler. The song repeats the slogan hailing the Nazi German leader and includes a direct sample from a speech Hitler gave in 1935.",
      "Speaking to ABC, Immigration Minister Tony Burke revealed the ban on Ye while discussing the reported cancellation of a visa for Israeli-American tech personality Hillel Fuld, over a comment he posted declaring: \"Islamophobia is rational.\"",
      "Burke said the Australian government's decision to cancel foreign nationals' visas were most often made for people seeking to make \"public speeches,\" before adding: \"The only one I can think of where it wasn't for public advocacy - the visa - but we cancelled it anyway, would be Kanye West.\"",
      "Ye, who is married to Australian Bianca Censori, had been visiting the country \"for a long time,\" Burke said.",
      "\"He's made a lot of offensive comments,\" added the immigration minister, \"that my officials looked at again once he released the Heil Hitler song, and he no longer has a valid visa in Australia.\"",
      "\"If you're going to have a song and promote that sort of Nazism, we don't need that in Australia,\" said Burke. \"We have enough problems in this country already without deliberately importing bigotry.\"",
      "Asked if the ban was \"sustainable\" given Ye's global popularity, Burke replied: \"I think that what's not sustainable is to import hatred.\"",
      "He said the government had not banned Ye from entering Australia permanently, noting that \"every visa application gets reassessed by my officials each time.\"",
      "Ye's history of antisemitism",
      "CBS News received no immediate response to a request for comment from Ye that was submitted via his fashion brand, Yeezy, or from Australia's home affairs department when asked about the ban.",
      "A spokesperson for the ministry told The Guardian Australia newspaper, however, that the \"government will continue to act decisively to protect the community from the risk of harm posed by individuals who choose to engage in criminal activity or behavior of concern, including visa cancelation or refusal where appropriate.\"",
      "Ye has a years-long history of making antisemitic remarks. In 2022, his X and Instagram accounts were suspended for antisemitic posts. Later that year he told Alex Jones: \"I love Jewish people, but I also love Nazis\u2026 I do love Hitler.\"",
      "In 2023, after Ye's marriage to Censori, the Australian Jewish Association called for Ye to be denied entry to the country.",
      "In February 2025, Ye again had his X again suspended over a series of antisemitic posts that he defended as a \"social experiment.\"",
      "One post published during the last Super Bowl declared: \"I AM A NAZI.\"",
      "Ye also paid for an ad during the Super Bowl, in which he directed people to visit his clothing brand's website, where he was\u00a0selling t-shirts emblazoned with the swastika, the symbol of the Nazi Party, for $20.",

    "summary": "Coco Gauff has become just the third woman in the Open era to lose in the first round at Wimbledon right after winning the championship at the French Open.",
    "story": [
      "Coco Gauff became just the third woman in the Open era to lose in the first round at Wimbledon right after winning the championship at the French Open, eliminated 7-6 (3), 6-1 by unseeded Dayana Yastremska of Ukraine on Tuesday night.",
      "The No. 2-ranked Gauff made mistake after mistake at No. 1 Court, finishing with just six winners and a total of 29 unforced errors that included nine double-faults.",
      "\"Dayana started off playing strong,\" Gauff said. \"I couldn't find my footing out there today.\"",
      "She joined another highly seeded American, No. 3 Jessica Pegula, in bowing out on Day 2 of the tournament. In all, 23 seeds \u2014 13 men and 10 women \u2014 already are gone before the first round is even done, tying the most at any Grand Slam tournament since they began seeding 32 players in each singles bracket in 2001.",
      "It was just a little more than three weeks ago that Gauff was celebrating her second Grand Slam title by getting past No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in the final on the red clay of Roland-Garros.",
      "The quick turnaround might have been an issue, Gauff acknowledged.",
      "\"I feel like mentally I was a little bit overwhelmed with everything that came afterwards,\" said the 21-year-old Gauff, \"so I didn't feel like I had enough time to celebrate and also get back into it.\"",
      "She didn't think it mattered Tuesday that their match location was shifted from Centre Court to Court No. 1 or that she was told about a new start time only about an hour before the contest began.",
      "Even though Gauff's big breakthrough came at the All England Club at age 15 in 2019, when she beat Venus Williams in her opening match and made it all the way to the fourth round, the grass-court tournament has proved to be her least successful major.",
      "It's the only Slam where Gauff hasn't made at least the semifinals.",
      "Indeed, she has yet to get past the fourth round and now has been sent home in the first round twice in the past three years.",
      "The transition from clay to grass has proven tough for most players, and the last woman to win the French Open and Wimbledon in the same season was Serena Williams a decade ago.",
      "Still, since the Open era began in 1968, only Justine Henin in 2005 and Francesca Schiavone in 2010 went from holding the trophy in Paris to exiting immediately in London.",
      "Gauff was never quite at her best Tuesday against Yastremska, who had lost all three of their previous matchups and currently is ranked 42nd.",
      "A particular problem for Gauff, as it often is, was her serving. She managed to put only 45% of her first serves in play, won 14 of her 32 second-serve points and had all of those double-faults, including a pair in the tiebreaker and another when she got broken to open the second set.",
      "\"When I can serve well, and some games I did, it's definitely an added threat,\" Gauff said. \"I didn't serve that well.\"",
      "Yastremska's best Grand Slam result was making it all the way to the semifinals on the Australian Open's hard courts last year, although she entered this event with a record of only 10-11 in first-round matches at majors.",
      "Gauff, by contrast, was 20-3 at that stage, including a loss to Sofia Kenin at Wimbledon in 2023.",
      "Yastremska's deepest run at Wimbledon was making the fourth round in 2019, although she did get to the final of the junior event in 2016.",
      "\"I was really on fire,\" said Yastremska, who accumulated 16 winners. \"Playing against Coco, it is something special.\"",
      "She recently reached her first tournament final on grass, at a smaller event in Nottingham, which she said gave her confidence heading to the All England Club.",
      "\"I love playing on grass. I feel that this year we are kind of friends,\" Yastremska said with a laugh. \"I hope the road will continue for me here.\"",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014 Three former senior leaders at the British hospital where nurse Lucy Letby was convicted of murdering seven babies have been arrested on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter, police said Tuesday.",
      "All three were part of the senior leadership team at the Countess of Chester Hospital in the northwest of England between 2015 and 2016, when Letby was found to have killed the babies and attempted to kill seven others.",
      "Letby, 35, is serving 15 consecutive life sentences with no chance of parole, but there have been questions raised about the evidence used in her trial, and her lawyer has filed for a formal review of the case.",
      "In October 2023, following Letby's conviction, the Cheshire Constabulary police force launched an investigation into potential corporate manslaughter at the hospital, focusing on the decision-making of senior bosses, \"to determine whether any criminality has taken place concerning the response to the increased levels of fatalities,\" according to a Tuesday statement by Detective Superintendent Paul Hughes.",
      "That investigation was widened to include the charge of gross negligence manslaughter, leading to the arrest of the three former leaders. All three have been released on bail pending further investigation, the police said.",
      "\"Both the corporate manslaughter and gross negligence manslaughter elements of the investigation are continuing and there are no set timescales for these,\" Hughes said.",
      "\"It is important to note that this does not impact on the convictions of Lucy Letby for multiple offenses of murder and attempted murder,\" he added.",
      "The Cheshire police are also investigating deaths and non-fatal collapses of babies at the neonatal units of the Countess of Chester Hospital and the Liverpool Women's Hospital between 2012 and 2016, where Letby did her training.",
      "Lucy Letby's controversial murder conviction",
      "Since her conviction, there have been significant concerns voiced over the evidence used to secure Letby's conviction, with The New Yorker, The Guardian, Private Eye and other outlets reporting on possible alleged flaws in the trial proceedings.",
      "In February, a group of experts held a news conference to dispute the medical evidence used to convict Letby.",
      "Dr. Shoo Lee, a retired Canadian neonatologist, said the group of 14 doctors had concluded that the newborns died either of natural causes or from insufficient medical care.",
      "\"In summary then, ladies and gentlemen, we did not find murders,\" Lee said at the time",
      "Letby has maintained her innocence.",
      "Her defense attorney Mark McDonald said in April that the experts' findings had \"completely demolished\" the case against Letby, whom he argues was wrongly convicted. McDonald said he had submitted an application to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), which has the power to send cases back to the Court of Appeal.",
      "The CCRC has given no date for when a decision might be reached.",
      "In a statement sent to CBS News on Tuesday, McDonald said that despite the news of the three new arrests, \"the concerns many have raised will not go away, and we will continue to publicly discuss them.\"",
      "\"What is needed is a proper and full public inquiry into the failings of the neonatal and paediatric medical care unit at the Countess of Chester hospital,\" McDonald said, repeating his assertion that Letby was wrongfully convicted.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump recently indicated diplomatic talks with Iran could restart as soon as this week, although the White House noted no talks were officially scheduled. After U.S. airstrikes on some of Iran's nuclear facilities, followed days later by a\u00a0ceasefire to end what Mr. Trump called the\u00a012-day war between Iran and Israel, Iran's foreign minister seemed less certain about a speedy return to diplomacy.",
      "\"I don't think negotiations will restart as quickly as that,\" Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told CBS News through a translator.",
      "\"In order for us to decide to reengage, we will have to first ensure that America will not revert back to targeting us in a military attack during the negotiations,\" Araghchi said in his first interview with an American media outlet inside Iran since the bombings. \"And I think with all these considerations, we still need more time.\"",
      "However, Araghchi also insisted, \"The doors of diplomacy will never slam shut.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said during a televised address following the American strikes on June 21 that Iran's Fordo nuclear enrichment site and the Isfahan and Natanz nuclear facilities had been \"completely and totally obliterated.\" Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said during a news conference, \"Initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction.\"",
      "Rafael Mariano Grossi, the head of the United Nations' nuclear watchdog agency,\u00a0told CBS News the U.S. strikes caused \"severe damage, but it's not total damage.\" Grossi said Iran could likely start enriching uranium again within a few months.",
      "\"One cannot obliterate the technology and science for enrichment through bombings,\" Araghchi said. \"If there is this will on our part, and the will exists in order to once again make progress in this industry, we will be able to expeditiously repair the damages and make up for the lost time.\"",
      "When asked if Iran intends to continue enriching uranium, Araghchi said the country's \"peaceful nuclear program has turned into a matter of national pride and glory. We have also gone through 12 days of imposed war, therefore, people will not easily back down from enrichment.\"",
      "After 12 days of missile exchanges between Iran and Israel, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei declared victory, writing on social media, \"I offer my congratulations on the victory over the fallacious Zionist regime,\" and claiming Israel's government was \"practically knocked out and crushed under the blows of the Islamic Republic.\"",
      "Mr. Trump responded on social media, calling Khamenei's declaration a lie, saying Iran had been \"decimated\" and claiming he prevented both the U.S. and Israeli militaries from assassinating the supreme leader.",
      "Mr. Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are set to meet at the White House next Monday.",
      "Mr. Trump has also indicated he could order strikes on Iran again should it resume enriching uranium beyond a certain level. Araghchi questioned the legality of such action and said Iran was prepared for more attacks.",

      "The Justice Department announced criminal charges Monday in a scheme by North Korea to fund its weapons program through the salaries of remote information technology workers employed unwittingly by U.S. companies.",
      "The charges arose from what law enforcement officials described as a nationwide operation that also resulted in the seizure of financial accounts, websites and laptops that were used to carry out the fraud.",
      "Separate cases in Georgia and Massachusetts represent the latest Justice Department effort to confront a persistent threat that officials say generates enormous revenue for the North Korean government and in some cases affords workers access to sensitive and proprietary data from the American corporations that hire them.",
      "The scheme involved thousands of workers who, armed with stolen or fake identities, were dispatched by the North Korean government to find work as remote IT employees at American companies, including Fortune 500 corporations. The companies were duped into believing that the workers they hired were based in the U.S. when many were actually stationed in North Korea or China, and the wages the victimized companies paid were transferred into accounts controlled by co-conspirators affiliated with North Korea, prosecutors say.",
      "On Monday, U.S. prosecutors announced the arrest of U.S. national Zhenxing \"Danny\" Wang of New Jersey. A five-count indictment describes a \"multi-year fraud scheme by Wang and his co-conspirators to obtain remote IT work with U.S. companies that generated more than $5 million in revenue,\" the Justice Department said.",
      "The indictment also charges six Chinese nationals and two Taiwanese nationals for their roles in the scheme.",
      "\"These schemes target and steal from U.S. companies and are designed to evade sanctions and fund the North Korean regime's illicit programs, including its weapons programs,\" Assistant Attorney General John Eisenberg, the head of the Justice Department's National Security Division, said in a statement.",
      "In one case exposed on Monday in federal court in Massachusetts, the Justice Department said it had arrested one U.S. national and charged more than a half dozen Chinese and Taiwanese citizens for their alleged roles in an elaborate fraud that prosecutors say produced several million dollars in revenue and affected scores of companies.",
      "The conspiracy, court papers say, involved the registration of financial accounts to receive the proceeds and the creation of shell companies and fake websites to make it look like the remote workers were associated with legitimate businesses. Enablers inside the United States facilitated the workers' remote computer access, tricking companies into believing the workers were logging in from U.S. locations.",
      "The Justice Department did not identify the companies that were duped, but said that some of the fraudulent workers were able to gain access to and steal information related to sensitive military technology.",
      "The case filed in Georgia charges four North Korean IT workers with stealing virtual currency worth hundreds of thousands of dollars from their employers. The defendants remain at large.",
      "The Justice Department has filed similar prosecutions in recent years, as well as created an initiative aimed at disrupting the threat.",
      "The Justice Department has charged other people living in the U.S. with similar conduct tied to the North Korean government.",
      "Last December, a Chinese national living in California was charged after he allegedly bought and exported guns and ammunition to North Korea at the direction of North Korean agents who funneled him $2 million to buy the equipment.",
      "In May 2024, federal prosecutors\u00a0accused\u00a0an Arizona woman of carrying out a scheme to help North Korean IT workers illegally obtain remote employment with American companies. The group allegedly used the identities of more than 60 individuals who lived in the U.S. to generate nearly $7 million for the North Korean government from more than 300 U.S. companies.",

      "About 1,200 families have been urged by police in Australia to have their children tested for infectious diseases after a child care worker in Melbourne was charged with multiple sexual assault offenses against eight children.",
      "Joshua Brown, 26, was charged with more than 70 offenses, including child rape and attempted rape and possession of child sexual abuse material, the Victoria Police said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "\"The most important thing for our investigators was that we needed to identify the victims involved,\" Acting Commander Janet Stevenson of the Victoria Police's Crime Command said Tuesday. \"These are some of the most vulnerable members of our community and the conversations police have had to have with their families were no doubt life changing in the worst possible way.\"",
      "The charges relate to eight alleged victims from one child care centre in the Melbourne suburb of Point Cook, between April 2022 and January 2023, but authorities fear more children may have been affected. Brown worked at more than 20 child care centers in the region between 2017 and his arrest in May 2025, according to the police.",

      "A 92-year-old man on Monday was convicted of the rape and murder of a woman in southwestern England in what is thought to be the U.K.'s longest-running cold case ever to be solved.",
      "A jury at Bristol crown court found Ryland Headley, then aged 34, guilty of attacking 75-year-old Louisa Dunne in June 1967. He was sentenced to life in prison on Tuesday.",
      "\"Louisa Dunne died in a horrifying attack carried out in the place where she should have felt safest \u2014 her own home,\" prosecutor Charlotte Ream said. \"For 58 years, this appalling crime went unsolved and Ryland Headley, the man we now know is responsible, avoided justice.\"",
      "Dunne was found dead in her home by a neighbor on June 28, 1967. The night of her death, neighbors reported hearing a woman's \"frightening scream,\" the BBC reported.",
      "The cause of her death was found to be strangulation and asphyxiation. She had also been raped.",
      "It is \"one of the oldest cold cases to ever be solved in the U.K.,\"\u00a0said the Crown Prosecution Service\u00a0(CPS), which brings criminal prosecutions.",
      "Headley  was sentenced to life with a minimum term of 20 years at Bristol Crown Court in southwest England on Tuesday.",
      "After passing sentence, judge Derek Sweeting told Headley: \"You will never be released, you will die in prison.\"",
      "Investigators retained Dunne's clothing, including a blue skirt, and other samples from her body for further examination. They also recovered a palm print from a window which Headley is believed to have used to gain entry to her home.",
      "Despite the efforts of police investigating Dunne's death 58 years ago, no key suspect was identified, the BBC reported. Police collected about 19,000 prints from men and boys at the time with no success.",
      "In 2023, the case was reexamined and the skirt was sent away for forensic testing in May last year. DNA recovered from the item of clothing linked Headley to the murder scene after his DNA was added to the national database in 2012 for an unrelated incident.",
      "Forensic scientists concluded that DNA from the skirt matched Headley's and the palm print was also his. Headley was arrested at his home in Suffolk in November.",
      "Headley was convicted of two counts of rape in the late 1970s, after he attacked women, aged 79 and 84, in Ipswich. He pleaded guilty to the charges in 1978 and was jailed for seven years.",
      "All but one of the trial witnesses in the case died, according to the CPS, so the prosecution had to rely on written accounts taken from witnesses at the time of the murder.",
      "Testimonies of the two women were read during Headley's 2025 trial.",
      "\"Hearing the voices of the victims of his 1977 offences, is just incredibly powerful and harrowing,\" said Detective Inspector Dave Marchant, senior investigating officer for the case. \"I think it gives us an insight into probably what happened within 58 Britannia Road (Dunne's home) to some degree.\"",
      "Because witnesses were not available to give evidence in court, and therefore could not be challenged on that evidence, their statements had to be treated as hearsay evidence instead, the CPS noted.",
      "Dunne's granddaughter Mary Dainton said she was stunned when she heard that Headley had been arrested. \"I accepted that some murders just never get solved and some people have to live with that emptiness and sadness,\" she said.",
      "Marchant said he is working with the National Crime Agency to determine whether Headley may be responsible for any other unsolved offenses over the years. \"Crimes of this magnitude should never go unpunished and we will remain relentless in ensuring we do everything we can to advance other unsolved murder cases in the Avon and Somerset area,\" he said.",

      "\"Usually, when defense does not call witnesses, that defendant is called an inmate,\" Gowdy explained. \"I've said that my entire career. That's a fancy way of calling someone an inmate. You gotta give the jury a reason for reasonable doubt and to simply say the prosecution hasn\u2019t met its burden \u2026 most jurors don\u2019t really understand what that burden is.\"",
      "He added, \"Gotta give the jury a reason for doubt\u00a0and if you don't put up a very significant defense, all you do is cross-examine government witnesses, then you're going to be an inmate.\"",
      "DIDDY DEFENSE CLAIMS HE WAS UNFAIRLY TARGETED, WHILE PROSECUTION SAYS RAPPER THOUGHT HE WAS 'UNTOUCHABLE'",
      "Diddy told the court last week that it was his decision not to testify in his sex crimes case. The judge asked if Diddy understood he had the right to testify or not testify, and if he had discussed his rights with his attorney. Diddy responded, \"Yes, thoroughly,\" before admitting it was \"solely my decision\" to not testify in his sex crimes trial.",
      "Jurors began deliberating on Monday, June 30, and of the five counts, could not agree on a verdict for the racketeering charge, one of the most serious counts against the disgraced music mogul. A federal RICO violation can result in a 20-year sentence. The transportation to engage in prostitution charge could carry a sentence of up to 10 years, while sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion may carry a 20-year sentence.",
      "Jurors were unable to reach a verdict Tuesday on all five counts in Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' federal trial for sex crimes. (Jane Rosenberg)",
      "\"It\u2019s very complicated \u2014 most lawyers cannot explain RICO, so to expect 12 people, average citizen jurors to understand a criminal enterprise, predicate acts \u2026 it\u2019s just a lot to ask,\" Gowdy said. \"There\u2019s a reason to charge it even if you don\u2019t win. It opens evidentiary doors that might be closed, so lots of times prosecutors will charge something because it enables you to get extra evidence before a jury even though you don't really expect to get a guilty verdict on that count.\"",
      "LIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS",
      "Criminal defense attorney John W. Day, owner of the Santa Fe, New Mexico-based law practice John Day Law, told Fox News Digital that jurors may have had a difficult time comprehending the RICO charge.",
      "\"Was Diddy's high-flying and maybe disturbing lifestyle just that, or can you really pick out a criminal enterprise that is the equivalent of an organized crime family?\" Day said. \"But tomorrow morning the judge will be hoping that after a night of thinking about it, the jurors will have second thoughts about a split verdict on RICO \u2014 one way or the other \u2014 and come back with a unanimous verdict on that most serious charge.\"",
      "Cassie Ventura gave emotional testimony during Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' federal trial. (Jane Rosenberg)",
      "Potential juror issues threatened the Sean \"Diddy\" Combs trial multiple times. (Jane Rosenberg)",
      "Criminal defense attorney Nicole Blank Becker, who represented R. Kelly, explained that the predicate acts against Diddy were the \"building blocks\" to establish a RICO charge. Whether a jury can agree on a verdict or not remains to be seen.",
      "\"So what happens is now they're forced to go back in there, and there's probably going to be a lot of frustration back there, more fighting back and forth,\" Becker said. \"My understanding is that the jurors' verbiage was something to the effect of that they're at a point where there's unpersuadable opinions on both sides. So clearly some of the jurors thinking, 'Well, obviously he's guilty.'\"",
      "The judge instructed the jury to continue deliberating for now. A second option would be to give supplemental jury instructions. Lastly, the jury could return a partial verdict. However, Judge Subramanian said he is not considering the third option at this point, and chose to have a portion of the jury charge re-read.",
      "Criminal defense attorney\u00a0Eric Faddis, founding partner of Colorado-based\u00a0Varner Faddis,\u00a0agreed that the RICO charge was the most complicated of all the charges.",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER",
      "\"The jury could be hung up on the different requirements of the charge, including the criminal enterprise element,\" Faddis said. \"I suspect that may be a sticking point because the government didn\u2019t charge any co-conspirators and never called any other alleged members of this criminal enterprise.\"",
      "WATCH: PROSECUTORS ACCUSED DIDDY OF RUNNING A \u2018CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE\u2019",
      "He added, \"At this point, it\u2019s unclear whether the partial verdict could give rise to any grounds for appeal.\"",
      "The government emphasized in their argument that Diddy ran an alleged criminal enterprise with full control. The prosecution pointed out that the jury heard testimony, saw texts, viewed bank records and heard audio allegedly showing the \"Last Night\" rapper committing crime after crime for decades.",
      "According to the prosecution, the government showed Diddy didn\u2019t take no for an answer. \"Up until today, Diddy was able to get away with crime because of money and power,\"\u00a0Assistant U.S. Attorney Christine Slavik said. \"That stops now.\"",

      "Diddy was arrested and charged with multiple counts in September. (Stan Honda/Getty Images)",
      "\"It seems the jury has struggled and spent most of their time debating the more serious and complex racketeering count,\" Bassett noted. \"If I was the defense, I\u2019d be concerned, but you never know what a jury will do. For this lengthy of a trial, a 13-hour deliberation is on the short side of expectations.\"",

      "\"Both sides stated that they do not want to accept a partial verdict,\" attorney David S. Seltzer told Fox News Digital. \"This forces the jury to render a complete verdict, which ultimately could lead to a hung jury on the count at issue if they cannot render a verdict on all counts, and thus lead to a possible retrial on the hung count.",
      "\"As for appellate issues, there will be many, and depending on how the case resolves, this may be another issue for appeal.\"",

Further: Without that sexual activity, will the drug and weapons allegations suffice to demonstrate an actual racketeering entity?

      "On Monday, before court ended for the day, the jury sent a note asking \"If a recipient asks for a controlled substance, and another person hands it over to them, are they distributing?\" Judge Subramanian chose to send a note back to the jury Tuesday morning as deliberations resumed. He pointed the group to page 37 of the charge document, which explained the law behind the distribution of drugs allegation.",
      "Diddy took notes while the prosecution, defense and judge discussed what to respond to the jury's note asking for clarification on drug distribution.

Diddy also glanced over to his other lawyers, Teny Geragos and Alexandra Shapiro, seated to his left.",
      "Combs and his lawyer, Xavier Donaldson, chatted a bit with some smiles afterward. Diddy spoke with the defense lawyer for a few minutes.

      "Problems within the jury could have been avoided, according to attorney David S. Seltzer, who told Fox News Digital that simply sequestering the jurors throughout the duration of the seven-week trial could have prevented additional issues reaching a verdict.",
      "\"I don\u2019t see how people are not influenced by outside factors,\"\u00a0Seltzer said. \"We live in a technology world where everyone wants their information now.\u00a0I know the jury was instructed not to read anything, but I don\u2019t think that was realistic given the length of the trial.\"",
      "Seltzer noted that not sequestering the jury was a mistake. \"I have been saying from day one that it is impossible to tell people to stay off media and/or computers for six weeks-plus, when people are addicted to their devices.\u00a0I think the court is relying on the admonishment, but respectfully turning a blind eye.\"",

I remind every juror of their duty to deliberate and their obligation to follow my instruction on the law. With that instruction in mind, please continue deliberating.\" The note also explained not to include specific details about deliberations in any future notes.",

      "\"Courts will always push a jury to get to a unanimous verdict, but at the end of the day, it is up to the jury if they think they can get there,\"\u00a0Seltzer noted. \"Often times when there are issues within the jury, they cannot get there, and it ends up in a hung jury.\"",
      "Right before the end of the court day, the jury asked for clarification regarding the alleged distribution of drugs. \"If a recipient asks for a controlled substance, and another person hands it over to them, are they distributing?\" The judge told the court that the jury would be given an answer on Tuesday.",
      "While sequestering a jury \u2014 essentially isolating the 12 jurors and six alternates assigned to the case from the outside world \u2014 can be challenging, the process may prove to be essential in eliminating external influences.",
      "Albany-based criminal defense attorney Paul DerOhannesian explained to Fox News Digital that jurors may have been swayed by the Internet and access to social media.",
      "LIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS",
      "\"Unfortunately, courts are reluctant to utilize one of the few tools historically used to inoculate jurors against external sources of information during a trial or deliberations \u2014 sequestration,\" DerOhannesian said. \"We did see sequestration of the jury in the Casey Anthony and OJ Simpson trials.\u00a0Sequestration in a federal trial is virtually non-existent in recent history.\"",
      "Judge Arun Subramanian received multiple notes from the jury on the first day of deliberations. (Jane Rosenberg)",

      "\"I think the lack of sequestration favors the defense,\" Seltzer told Fox News Digital. \"The media/coverage in the Karen Read trial, as I saw it, was pro-defense.\u00a0The trial was very technical and not something that favors a prosecution case.\u00a0The Diddy trial, while not technical, it was much of the same from all the witnesses and the media was not very favorable to the prosecution in meeting their burden.\"",
      "DerOhannesian said he wouldn't \"necessarily compare the Combs and Read trials. However, I would note Read benefited from some favorable publicity and information, particularly concerning the integrity of the investigation.\"",

      "Diddy remained in the courtroom for about 20 minutes after the judge decided to provide the jury with the government\u2019s proposed response to their first letter.

      "Jurors in Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' sex trafficking and racketeering trial began deliberations Monday.",
      "The jury sent two notes to the court throughout the five and a half hours of deliberations. Right before the end of the court day, the jury asked for clarification regarding the alleged distribution of drugs. \"If a recipient asks for a controlled substance, and another person hands it over to them, are they distributing?\" The judge told the court that the jury would be given an answer on Tuesday.",
      "The first note from the jury claimed one juror could not follow Judge Arun Subramanian's instructions. The issue during the first day of deliberations could signal a \"stealth juror\" leading to the possibility of jury nullification, a legal expert told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"A juror who \u2018cannot follow your honor\u2019s instructions\u2019 is a potential stealth juror and we\u2019re looking at the possibility of jury nullification,\" former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani told Fox News Digital. \"Judge Subramanian can admonish the juror, but if they still refuse to follow instructions, his only real options are to dismiss the juror under Rules 23 and 24 and replace them with an alternate, but that will create an appellate issue, or declare a mistrial and we\u2019ll have to start all over.\u00a0The defense has to be feeling good right now.\"",

      "Roughly an hour after deliberations began, the jury sent back a note. The note said that one of the jurors is not able to follow the instructions given by the judge.",
      "After a lengthy discussion on what to send back to the jury, the judge adopted the language for the note proposed by the prosecution. The note sent read, \"I received your note. I remind every juror of their duty to deliberate and their obligation to follow my instruction on the law. With that instruction in mind, please continue deliberating.\" The note also explained not to include specific details about deliberations in any future notes.",
      "Combs remained in the courtroom for about 20 minutes after the judge decided to provide the jury with the government\u2019s proposed response. He was sitting at the defense table with his attorneys. On his way out of the courtroom, he held up the two books he had with him.

      "A 12-person jury comprised of eight men and four women will make the decision on whether to convict Diddy of federal crimes or let the fallen music mogul walk free following a seven-week trial.",
      "After the judge sent the jury to decide on a foreperson and begin deliberations, the defense raised a request for a slight change in how evidence is presented concerning subject lines as they appear in Blackberry messenger-formatted text messages. The two sides reached an agreement, and it was said that the substance of the evidence would remain unchanged.",
      "The judge then complimented the two sides for a well-tried case. He admired the cooperation of the sides in a logistically complicated case. Subramanian also said this was a great experience for the young attorneys in the room.",
      "Combs then, through Marc Agnifilo, asked if he could be allowed to bring books with him while he waited for a verdict, saying the marshals did not have an issue with it. The judge allowed him to have the books. They did not address which books he would be taking.",

      "With closing arguments completed, Judge Arun Subramanian will hand down a detailed list of jury instructions, a detailed list with defining terms and elements of the law agreed upon by both parties to help guide jurors to reach a unanimous verdict.

      "\"At this point, Harry\u2019s resentment towards William seems less about the Sussexes' actual exit in 2020 and more about what came after: the silence, the distance, and the sense that the family iced them out because they dared to speak up,\" royal commentator and podcast host Amanda Matta told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"There simply has to be frustration that the family won't engage in good faith with the points that Harry has raised, even though he's done so publicly,\" Matta added.",

      "\"Their lives and priorities have diverged dramatically since Harry decided to depart from royal duties.

      "\"As for whether William is jealous of Harry\u2019s freedom... if he is, he\u2019d never phrase it that way,\" said Matta. \"He\u2019s too rooted in the idea of his duty to openly admit wanting anything else. But you can see hints of that in how he\u2019s quietly carving out more space for his personal life, seizing more privacy for his wife and kids and taking more control over his platform. He may not want Harry\u2019s lifestyle, but he\u2019s taken note of what boundaries look like from his brother.\"",

      "\"There\u2019s a wide range of breads \u2014 from those that can negatively impact your health to options that offer potential health benefits,\" she said in an interview with Fox News Digital.",
      "\"The first ingredient is what makes up the majority of the bread, so this should be a whole grain.\"",
      "Breads made from refined flours, such as white bread, can cause rapid spikes and crashes in blood sugar, increasing the risk of weight gain and type 2 diabetes over time, the dietitian warned.",
      "Instead, she recommends opting for whole-grain and high-fiber breads that break down more slowly, helping to stabilize blood sugar and improve long-term glycemic control.",

      "\"When choosing bread with fewer preservatives and simpler ingredients, consumers need to be aware that the bread will not last as long, and may need to be frozen and toasted to eventually make use of an entire loaf.\" (iStock)",
      "\"This is because the flour is very refined \u2014 removing fiber, fats, proteins and bran, which all slow absorption \u2014 and is also very finely machine ground. This fine grind creates white flour, which is a dust that is quickly absorbed by intestinal cells.\"",
      "The texturizers and emulsifiers in commercial white breads \u2014 which are added to make them softer and easier to eat \u2014 also cause them to be more quickly digested and absorbed, Fung noted.",
      "\"You can see the effect of this on the glycemic index, which measures how quickly bread spikes your glucose,\" he said.",
      "The GI is a scale of 0 to 100, with 100 being the highest glucose spikes. White bread has a very high GI of 73, Fung said, while machine-ground whole wheat is not much better, at 70.",

      "FIRST ON FOX: The Trump administration approved millions in disaster relief loans for small businesses that were rocked by the anti-ICE riots that plagued Los Angeles in June after Gov. Gavin Newsom downplayed the riots and blamed the violence on the Trump administration, Fox News Digital exclusively learned on Tuesday.",
      "Small Business Administration chief Kelly Loeffler announced in a press release first shared with Fox News Digital on Tuesday that Newsom's government had applied for an SBA Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) declaration, which the administration quickly approved. Small businesses are now able to apply for up to $2 million in low-interest EIDL loans \"to support working capital and normal operating expenses such as payroll, rent, and utilities that could not be met due to the destruction enabled by Newsom\u2019s failed governance,\" according to the SBA.",
      "\"Governor Newsom allowed a mob to rampage Los Angeles \u2013 standing with violent rioters, paid protestors, and criminal illegal aliens over law-abiding citizens. Despite an estimated $1 billion in damage, he refused federal relief for weeks, insisting that the riots were peaceful even as small business owners stood in the rubble,\" Loeffler said in the press release.",
      "\"Although the SBA has approved California\u2019s disaster relief request and will begin delivering immediate aid to the innocent victims, Governor Newsom must take accountability for his state-sanctioned crisis \u2013 and stop playing politics with Americans\u2019 livelihoods.\"",

      "The relief follows SBA previously approving an additional 11,583\u00a0loans that totaled $2.99 billion in relief earlier this year following the California wildfire disasters in January, Fox News Digital learned, and marked the largest sum of disaster dollars ever approved by SBA for non-hurricane or flooding events.",

Although local leaders are allowing Los Angeles to burn, federal partners are ready to help American citizens rebuild \u2013 and we will do so, as soon as the Governor answers their call for help.\"",

You might see a message claiming your account has been locked, offering a gift card or refund, confirming an order you never placed, or asking you to verify payment details or login credentials. These tactics are meant to create urgency or curiosity. It\u2019s important to remember that Amazon will never ask for your password, banking information, or gift card codes by email.",
      "2. Double-check every message: If something feels off, don\u2019t click anything. Instead, visit Amazon.com or open the app to check your order history and account messages. If the email doesn\u2019t appear in your Amazon Message Center, it\u2019s not real. Also hover over the sender\u2019s name to see the full email address. Genuine messages come from @amazon.com and may show the Amazon smile logo if your inbox supports it.",
      "Genuine email sent from @amazon.com\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "3. Avoid clicking on unknown links and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Phishing emails often contain links that appear to lead to Amazon but actually take you to fake websites designed to steal your information. Instead of clicking, it\u2019s safer to type amazon.com directly into your browser to verify any claims. For added protection, consider using antivirus software that can detect scam links, block dangerous sites, and alert you to phishing emails or ransomware threats.

      "4. Reduce your exposure to scammers:\u00a0Phishing emails often originate from personal information found on public databases, people-search sites, and data broker platforms. To limit how often you're targeted, consider using a data removal service. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time. Check out my top picks for data removal services by visiting here\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Delete.",
      "5. Report suspicious emails: If you receive a phishing message pretending to be from Amazon, report it right away. This helps Amazon investigate the scam and improve their ability to block similar messages in the future. You can forward the suspicious email to stop-spoofing@amazon.com, or submit it through Amazon\u2019s official reporting form.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Scam emails that pretend to be from Amazon are getting more realistic, but there are still clear ways to protect yourself. Use the Message Center to confirm any message tied to your account. Always double-check the sender's address, look for the smile logo in your inbox when supported, and never click on links unless you're certain they're safe.

    "published": "Tue, 01 Jul 2025 15:00:06 -0400",
    "summary": "The Berkeley Humanoid Light (BHL) is a lightweight, open source humanoid robot that anyone can build using 3D-printed parts and off-the-shelf components.",
    "story": [
      "A few hundred robots moved a building that covers about 43,400 square feet.",
      "Building an open-source humanoid robot has traditionally been out of reach for most people due to high costs and complex proprietary systems. While robotics has made major strides in automation, healthcare, and research, accessible robot design still poses a challenge-especially for students, hobbyists, and small research teams. Most humanoid robots are expensive, hard to modify, and difficult to repair.",
      "That's why a new project from UC Berkeley is getting a lot of attention. The Berkeley Humanoid Light (BHL) is a lightweight, open-source humanoid robot that anyone can build using 3D-printed parts and off-the-shelf components. It's a major step toward making robotics more affordable, customizable, and accessible to all.",

      "The Berkeley Humanoid Light (BHL) is a lightweight, open source humanoid robot that anyone can build using 3D-printed parts and off-the-shelf components.\u00a0 (Berkeley)",
      "Why accessible robot design is essential for innovation",
      "Building a robot from scratch usually means needing fancy equipment like CNC machines or custom electronics. Most people don't have access to those tools, which makes learning and experimentation hard. That's exactly what the Berkeley team wanted to change.",
      "The goal behind the BHL project was to create an accessible robot design that doesn't require a massive budget or a fully equipped lab. The entire robot can be made with parts ordered online and printed at home. It costs less than $5,000 to build, which is far cheaper than most commercial humanoid robots.",
      "Inside Berkeley\u2019s open-source humanoid robot",
      "The robot stands about 39 inches tall and weighs just over 35 pounds. It's powered by modular actuators that use 3D-printed cycloidal gearboxes. These gearboxes distribute pressure across larger gear teeth, which helps the joints last longer and perform more like those found in high-end commercial robots.",
      "Because the design is modular, you don't have to build the whole robot all at once. You can start by printing and testing a single actuator, then gradually move on to assembling full limbs and eventually the entire humanoid. That's a big plus for anyone just getting started with robotics or working with limited resources.",
      "It's a major step toward making robotics more affordable, customizable, and accessible to all. (Berkeley)",
      "Open source robotics with a strong community focus",
      "Everything about the BHL robot is open source. That includes the hardware design, control software, and even a custom teleoperation system that uses SteamVR. It's built to be easy to control, simple to repair, and endlessly customizable.",
      "There's also a growing community around the project. Builders are sharing tips, upgrades, and full robot builds on Discord and GitHub. That kind of collaboration is a big part of what makes accessible robot design so powerful-it brings more people into the conversation and helps everyone learn faster.",
      "The goal behind the BHL project was to create an accessible robot design that doesn't require a massive budget or a fully equipped lab. (Berkeley)",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "The Berkeley Humanoid Light proves that accessible robot design doesn't have to mean cutting corners. With smart engineering, affordable parts, and a commitment to openness, the team behind BHL is making it easier than ever for anyone to dive into humanoid robotics. Whether you're a student, a maker, or just curious about how robots work, this is one project that shows what's possible when technology is made for everyone.",

      "Meta\u2019s new AI chatbot is getting personal, and it might be sharing more than you realize. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is Meta AI, and what does the \"Discover\" tab do?",
      "Meta\u2019s AI app, launched in April 2025, is designed to be both a chatbot and a social platform. Users can chat casually or deep dive into personal topics, from relationship questions to financial concerns or health issues.",
      "What sets Meta AI apart from other chatbots is the \"Discover\" tab, a public feed that displays shared conversations. It was meant to encourage community and creativity, letting users showcase interesting prompts and responses. Unfortunately, many didn\u2019t realize their conversations could be made public with just one tap, and the interface often fails to make the public/private distinction clear.",
      "The feature positions Meta AI as a kind of AI-powered social network, blending search, conversation, and status updates. But what sounds innovative on paper has opened the door to major privacy slip-ups.",
      "Why Meta AI\u2019s Discover tab is a privacy risk",
      "Privacy experts are sounding the alarm over Meta's Discover tab, calling it a serious breach of user trust. The feed surfaces chats containing legal dilemmas, therapy discussions, and deeply personal confessions, often linked to real accounts. In some cases, names and profile photos are visible. Although Meta says only shared chats appear, the interface makes it easy to hit \"share\" without realizing it means public exposure. Many assume the button saves the conversation privately. Worse, logging in with a public Instagram account can make shared AI activity publicly accessible by default, increasing the risk of identification.",
      "Some posts reveal sensitive health or legal issues, financial troubles, or relationship conflicts. Others include contact details or even audio clips. A few contain pleas like \"keep this private,\" written by users who didn't realize their messages would be broadcast. These aren't isolated incidents, and as more people use AI for personal support, the stakes will only get higher.",

      "Even casual users should take a moment to review their settings and chat history to make sure personal details aren\u2019t being shared without their knowledge.",
      "Are AI chat platforms really private?",
      "This issue isn\u2019t unique to Meta. Most AI chat tools, including ChatGPT, Claude, and Google Gemini, store your conversations by default and may use them to improve performance, train future models, or develop new features. What many users don\u2019t realize is that their inputs can be reviewed by human moderators, flagged for analysis, or saved in training logs.",
      "Even if a platform says your chats are \"private,\" that usually just means they aren\u2019t visible to the public. It doesn\u2019t mean your data is encrypted, anonymous, or protected from internal access. In many cases, companies retain the right to use your conversations for product development unless you specifically opt out, and finding that opt-out isn't always straightforward.",
      "If you\u2019re signed in with a personal account that includes your real name, email address, or social media links, your activity may be easier to connect to your identity than you think. Combine that with questions about health, finances, or relationships, and you\u2019ve essentially created a detailed digital profile without meaning to.",
      "Some platforms now offer temporary chat modes or incognito settings, but these features are usually off by default. Unless you manually enable them, your data is likely being stored and possibly reviewed.",
      "The takeaway: AI chat platforms are not private by default. You need to actively manage your settings, be mindful of what you share, and stay informed about how your data is being handled behind the scenes.",
      "Meta\u2019s AI app, launched in April 2025, is designed to be both a chatbot and a social platform. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How to protect your privacy when using AI chatbots",
      "AI tools can be incredibly helpful, but without the right precautions, they can also open you up to privacy risks. Whether you're using Meta AI, ChatGPT, or any other chatbot, here are some smart, proactive ways to protect yourself:",
      "1) Use aliases and avoid personal identifiers: Don\u2019t use your full name, birthday, address, or any details that could identify you. Even first names combined with other context can be risky.",
      "2) Never share sensitive information: Avoid discussing medical diagnoses, legal matters, bank account info, or anything you wouldn\u2019t want on the front page of a search engine.",
      "3) Clear your chat history regularly: If you\u2019ve already shared sensitive info, go back and delete it. Many AI apps let you clear chat history through Settings or your account dashboard.",
      "4) Adjust privacy settings often: App updates can sometimes reset your preferences or introduce new default options. Even small changes to the interface can affect what\u2019s shared and how. It\u2019s a good idea to check your settings every few weeks to make sure your data is still protected.",
      "5) Use an identity theft protection service: Scammers actively look for exposed data, especially after a privacy slip. Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number, and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Visit\u00a0Cyberguy.com/IdentityTheft\u00a0for tips and recommendations.",
      "6) Use a VPN for extra privacy: A reliable VPN hides your IP address and location, making it harder for apps, websites, or bad actors to track your online activity. It also adds protection on public Wi-Fi, shielding your device from hackers who might try to snoop on your connection. For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices\u00a0at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/VPN.",
      "7) Don\u2019t link AI apps to your real social accounts: If possible, create a separate email address or dummy account for experimenting with AI tools. Keep your main profiles disconnected.\u00a0 To create a quick email alias you can use to keep your main accounts protected visit\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Mail.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Meta\u2019s decision to turn chatbot prompts into social content has blurred the line between private and public in a way that catches many users off guard. Even if you think your chats are safe, a missed setting or default option can expose more than you intended. Before typing anything sensitive into Meta AI or any chatbot, pause. Check your privacy settings, review your chat history, and think carefully about what you're sharing. A few quick steps now can save you from bigger privacy headaches later.",

      "Thanks to a team at the University of California, Davis, there's a new brain-computer interface (BCI) system that's opening up real-time, natural conversation for people who can't speak. \"Cyberguy\" Kurt Knutsson explains.",
      "When someone loses the ability to speak because of a neurological condition like ALS, the impact goes far beyond words. It touches every part of daily life, from sharing a joke with family to simply asking for help. Now, thanks to a team at the University of California, Davis, there's a new brain-computer interface (BCI) system that's opening up real-time, natural conversation for people who can't speak. This technology isn't just about converting thoughts into text. Instead, it translates the brain signals that would normally control the muscles used for speech, allowing users to \"talk\" and even \"sing\" through a computer, almost instantly.",

      "There's a new brain-computer interface (BCI) system that's opening up real-time, natural conversation for people who can't speak. (UC Davis)",
      "Real-time speech through brain signals",
      "The heart of this system is four microelectrode arrays, surgically implanted in the part of the brain responsible for producing speech. These tiny devices pick up the neural activity that happens when someone tries to speak. The signals are then fed into an AI-powered decoding model, which converts them into audible speech in just ten milliseconds. That's so fast, it feels as natural as a regular conversation.",
      "What's especially remarkable is that the system can recreate the user's own voice, thanks to a voice cloning algorithm trained on recordings made before the onset of ALS. This means the person's digital voice sounds like them, not a generic computer voice. The system even recognizes when the user is trying to sing and can change the pitch to match simple melodies. It can also pick up on vocal nuances, like asking a question, emphasizing a word, or making interjections such as \"aah,\" \"ooh,\" or \"hmm.\" All of this adds up to a much more expressive and human-sounding conversation than previous technologies could offer.",
      "It translates the brain signals that would normally control the muscles used for speech, allowing users to \"talk\" and even \"sing\" through a computer, almost instantly. (UC Davis)",
      "How the technology works",
      "The process starts with the participant attempting to speak sentences shown on a screen. As they try to form each word, the electrodes capture the firing patterns of hundreds of neurons. The AI learns to map these patterns to specific sounds, reconstructing speech in real-time. This approach allows for subtle control over speech rhythm and tone, giving the user the ability to interrupt, emphasize, or ask questions just as anyone else would.",
      "One of the most striking outcomes from the UC Davis study was that listeners could understand nearly 60 percent of the synthesized words, compared to just four percent without the BCI. The system also handled new, made-up words that weren't part of its training data, showing its flexibility and adaptability.",
      "The AI learns to map these patterns to specific sounds, reconstructing speech in real-time.\u00a0 (UC Davis)",
      "The impact on daily life",
      "Being able to communicate in real-time, with one's own voice and personality, is a game-changer for people living with paralysis. The UC Davis team points out that this technology allows users to be more included in conversations. They can interrupt, respond quickly, and express themselves with nuance. This is a big shift from earlier systems that only translated brain signals into text, which often led to slow, stilted exchanges that felt more like texting than talking.",
      "As David Brandman, the neurosurgeon involved in the study, put it, our voice is a core part of our identity. Losing it is devastating, but this kind of technology offers real hope for restoring that essential part of who we are.",
      "The UC Davis team points out that this technology allows users to be more included in conversations. (UC Davis)",
      "Looking ahead: Next steps and challenges",
      "While these early results are promising, the researchers are quick to point out that the technology is still in its early stages. So far, it's only been tested with one participant, so more studies are needed to see how well it works for others, including people with different causes of speech loss, like stroke. The BrainGate2 clinical trial at UC Davis Health is continuing to enroll participants to further refine and test the system.",
      "The technology is still in its early stages. (UC Davis)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Restoring natural, expressive speech to people who have lost their voices is one of the most meaningful advances in brain-computer interface technology. This new system from UC Davis shows that it's possible to bring real-time, personal conversation back into the lives of those affected by paralysis. While there's still work to be done, the progress so far is giving people a chance to reconnect with their loved ones and the world around them in a way that truly feels like their own.",

      "Open 24/7 and installable in under a week,\u00a0VenHub is designed for high-traffic environments, such as transit centers, airports, and city hubs, where speed, security, and efficiency are in high demand. Instead of relying on cashiers or attendants, VenHub uses two industrial robotic arms, named Barb and Peter, to handle all product selection and delivery. The process is simple yet futuristic.",
      "Customers place their orders through the VenHub app, pay digitally, and receive a QR code. Upon arrival at the store, the customer scans the code at a secure pickup window. One of the robotic arms then retrieves the items from storage and delivers them to the window within about 90 seconds. The entire transaction is seamless, contactless, and designed to eliminate the frustrations of traditional vending machines or checkout lines.",

      "AI HUMANOID ROBOT IS CHANGING THE WAY YOU BUY CARS AT DEALERSHIPS",
      "The technology powering VenHub",
      "VenHub's foundation is a sophisticated blend of robotics, artificial intelligence, and real-time analytics. The robotic arms are similar to those used in automotive manufacturing, engineered for speed, precision, and reliability. Rather than attempting to mimic human appearance, these arms are optimized for repetitive, high-accuracy tasks that are perfect for retail fulfillment.",
      "Artificial intelligence drives every aspect of store operations. AI algorithms manage inventory by tracking purchasing patterns, adjusting stock levels, and predicting demand based on time of day, location, and customer behavior. Machine vision allows the robots to accurately identify products and handle them with minimal errors or downtime. The entire system is connected through IoT sensors, providing real-time data on inventory, system health, and order status. This data-driven approach enables VenHub to operate efficiently, minimize waste, and ensure popular items are always available.",
      "From the customer's perspective, everything is managed through a mobile app. This app handles payment, order tracking, and pickup notifications, creating a frictionless and transparent shopping experience.

The rapid setup time enables these stores to quickly appear in busy locations, ranging from transportation hubs to college campuses and urban centers. Since the store operates around the clock without breaks, it maximizes both convenience for shoppers and revenue for operators. Eliminating on-site staff dramatically reduces overhead, allowing for competitive pricing and improved profitability.",
      "Security is a major focus for VenHub. The store uses bulletproof glass to protect inventory and customers. If one robot requires maintenance, the other can take over, ensuring reliable service with minimal downtime. VenHub's design is also environmentally conscious, featuring compact, energy-efficient layouts and optional solar power compatibility to reduce its carbon footprint. Each store can be customized to fit local demand, whether that means stocking snacks, electronics, or other essentials.",

      "If you're considering bringing a VenHub Smart Store to your city, here's a quick breakdown of the costs and what's included. The price for a VenHub Smart Store ranges from $250,000 to $275,000, depending on your chosen configuration. To secure your spot in the production queue, you'll need a $2,500 pre-order deposit, which is fully refundable up until production begins. Financing is available through select financial institutions, with some buyers qualifying for up to 100% financing. However, all arrangements are handled directly between you and the lender; VenHub does not influence approval decisions.",
      "Once you own a VenHub Smart Store, it's yours outright; there are no leases or franchise agreements.

A monthly software-as-a-service fee of $2,500 covers software updates, AI analytics, remote monitoring, and cloud-based management tools. If you require additional support, an optional maintenance package is available for $1,300 per month, which includes servicing and preventive care.",
      "VenHub does not secure locations for you, but they do offer guidance on choosing high-traffic spots, such as shopping centers, universities, business districts, or commuter hubs, to help maximize your store's performance.

      "\"I've since changed my email address and passwords for important accounts. Also have created a new FB account. However, I was admin for 3 FB groups, and the hacker got into them.

The relocation of the complex in Huayang, a Shikumen-style building weighing about 7,500 metric tons (approximately 8,267 U.S. tons) and covering roughly 43,400 square feet, is truly rewriting the rules.",

      "The Huayanli complex is a set of three brick-and-wood buildings constructed between the 1920s and 1930s. Located in the heart of Shanghai's historic Zhangyuan area, these structures are classic examples of shikumen architecture, which is a unique blend of Western and Chinese design.

The city is building a three-story underground center beneath the complex that will include over 570,000 square feet of cultural and commercial space, a parking garage with more than 100 spots and a transportation hub that will connect three major subway lines.

      "Moving a building of this size is tough enough, but the challenge is multiplied by Zhangyuan's dense web of narrow alleys and closely packed historic buildings. Traditional relocation methods simply would not fit.

These robots gently lift the building and slowly move it forward, inch by inch, covering about 33 feet each day. To achieve this incredible level of precision, the project relies on several advanced technologies. Special low-clearance drilling robots, which can be operated remotely, navigate tight corridors and doorways to create new foundations beneath the historic structure.",

Engineers also use building information modeling and point cloud scanning to create highly detailed 3D blueprints. These digital models help the team plan exact movement routes, avoid potential collisions and design curved paths for removing soil.",
      "To keep the construction site efficient and minimize disruption, soil is carried out using a conveyor belt system, much like an assembly line. The move is only temporary.

      "SaaS firm leads to major healthcare blunder",
      "Episource, a big name in healthcare data analytics and coding services, has\u00a0confirmed a major cybersecurity incident (via\u00a0Bleeping Computer). The breach involved sensitive health information belonging to over 5 million people in the United States. The company first noticed suspicious system activity Feb. 6, 2025, but the actual compromise began ten days earlier.",
      "An internal investigation revealed that hackers accessed and copied private data between Jan. 27 and Feb. 6. The company insists that no financial information was taken, but the stolen records do include names, contact details, Social Security numbers, Medicaid IDs and full medical histories.",
      "Episource claims there\u2019s no evidence the information has been misused, but because they haven\u2019t seen the fallout yet doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t happening. Once data like this is out, it spreads fast, and the consequences don\u2019t wait for official confirmation.",

      "OVER 8 MILLION PATIENT RECORDS LEAKED IN HEALTHCARE DATA BREACH",
      "Why healthcare SaaS is a growing target",
      "The healthcare industry has embraced cloud-based services to improve efficiency, scale operations and reduce overhead. Companies like Episource enable healthcare payers to manage coding and risk adjustment at a much larger scale. But this shift has also introduced new risks. When third-party vendors handle patient data, the security of that data becomes dependent on their infrastructure.",
      "Healthcare data is among the most valuable types of personal information for hackers. Unlike payment card data, which can be changed quickly, medical and identity records are long-term assets on the dark web. These breaches can lead to insurance fraud, identity theft and even blackmail.",
      "Episource is not alone in facing this kind of attack. In the past few years, several healthcare SaaS providers have faced breaches, including Accellion and Blackbaud. These incidents have affected millions of patients and have led to class-action lawsuits and stricter government scrutiny.",

      "5 ways you can protect yourself from healthcare data breach",
      "If your information was part of the healthcare breach or any similar one, it\u2019s worth taking a few steps to protect yourself.",
      "1. Consider identity theft protection services: Since the healthcare data breach exposed personal and financial information, it\u2019s crucial to stay proactive against identity theft. Identity theft protection services offer continuous monitoring of your credit reports, Social Security number and even the dark web to detect if your information is being misused.",
      "These services send you real-time alerts about suspicious activity, such as new credit inquiries or attempts to open accounts in your name, helping you act quickly before serious damage occurs. Beyond monitoring, many identity theft protection companies provide dedicated recovery specialists who assist you in resolving fraud issues, disputing unauthorized charges and restoring your identity if it\u2019s compromised.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "2. Use personal data removal services:\u00a0The healthcare data breach leaks loads of information about you, and all this could end up in the public domain, which essentially gives anyone an opportunity to scam you.",
      "One proactive step is to consider personal data removal services, which specialize in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan\u00a0to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "3. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Hackers have people\u2019s email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data. These messages are socially engineered to catch them, and catching them is nearly impossible if you\u2019re not careful. However, you\u2019re not without defenses.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0While passwords weren\u2019t part of the data breach, you still need to enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA). It gives you an extra layer of security on all your important accounts, including email, banking and social media. 2FA requires you to provide a second piece of information, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password when logging in. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. Enabling 2FA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data.",
      "5. Be wary of mailbox communications: Bad actors may also try to scam you through snail mail. The data leak gives them access to your address. They may impersonate people or brands you know and use themes that require urgent attention, such as missed deliveries, account suspensions and security alerts.",
      "WINDOWS 10 SECURITY FLAWS LEAVE MILLIONS VULNERABLE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "What makes this breach especially alarming is that many of the affected patients may have never even heard of Episource. As a business-to-business vendor, Episource operates in the background, working with insurers and healthcare providers, not with patients directly. The people affected were customers of those companies, yet it's their most sensitive data now at risk because of a third party they never chose or trusted. This kind of indirect relationship muddies the waters when it comes to responsibility and makes it even harder to demand transparency or hold anyone accountable.",

      "Most phishing scams try (and fail) to impersonate big companies. You\u2019ve probably seen the classics: weird grammar, suspicious email addresses, Microsoft spelled with a \"k\". They\u2019re laughably bad. But this scam flips the script because it uses PayPal against you. Here's how the scam operates:",
      "Exploiting real features:\u00a0Scammers abuse PayPal\u2019s \"add address\" or \"money request\" tools. By entering your email, they can trigger real emails from PayPal\u2019s real domain. And this works even if you don\u2019t have a PayPal account.",
      "Bypassing filters: Because these emails come directly from PayPal\u2019s servers (service@paypal.com), they pass all security checks and appear legitimate in your inbox.",
      "Lack of suspicion: Some versions contain no phishing links at all, just a scammer\u2019s phone number, making them even harder to detect.",
      "Panic bait: The message often claims a new address was added, or a large payment is being processed, getting your attention and provoking a quick reaction.",
      "Follow-up attacks: After the initial email, scammers may later contact you pretending to be PayPal support. Some urge you to click a link to \"secure your account\", which leads to a fake login page designed to steal your credentials.",

      "Phishing email sent from\u00a0service@paypal.com (Reddit)",
      "In a newer and more sophisticated twist, scammers are removing links altogether. Instead, they include a phone number and ask you to call. Once you do, you\u2019re connected with a fake PayPal representative who says they need to verify your identity. They then instruct you to download what appears to be a PayPal-branded support tool, but really it\u2019s a customized remote access app hosted on a different server. And once it\u2019s installed, it gives the scammer full access to your device.",

      "How scammers are hijacking PayPal\u2019s system to send fake alerts",
      "This part is still a bit of a mystery. With typical PayPal invoice scams, content is tightly controlled, which means you normally can\u2019t change the email structure or messaging. However, these new emails suggest that scammers may be exploiting internal features, like business tools or API fields, to sneak custom content into PayPal-generated alerts. It\u2019s not just phishing, it\u2019s weaponizing a legitimate system to create trust and evade detection.",
      "Why this PayPal phishing attack is so dangerous",
      "This scam is especially effective and dangerous because the emails come directly from PayPal\u2019s official servers, making it difficult to distinguish them from legitimate messages. Since the sender address and branding are authentic, recipients are more likely to trust the communication without suspicion.",
      "The scammers also use urgent language that creates a sense of panic, such as warnings about unauthorized activity or large charges. This pressure encourages people to act quickly and often before fully considering whether the alert is genuine.",
      "Additionally, the scam often involves follow-up contact through calls or texts from individuals posing as PayPal personnel, further exploiting the initial confusion and increasing the chances of victims giving up sensitive information.",

      "5. Report the scam:\u00a0Forward suspicious PayPal messages to phishing@paypal.com. You can also\u00a0report phishing attempts to the FTC.",
      "6.

      "Governor Hochul didn't mince words at her press conference. She made it clear that if New York wants to keep fossil fuels in check and meet its climate goals, nuclear energy has to be part of the mix. The new plant is expected to generate at least one gigawatt of electricity, which is enough to power about a million homes. That's a big deal for a state that's been working hard to cut carbon emissions and transition to cleaner energy sources.",
      "Right now, the New York Power Authority is in the driver's seat, tasked with figuring out where the plant will go and what it will look like. The project is still in its early days, but the state plans to work with private companies to build and operate the facility.

There's a lot of hope that new designs, like small modular reactors, could make things faster and cheaper, but those technologies haven't been proven at scale just yet.",
      "Gov. Hochul pointed out that a lot of the hurdles are at the federal level. Getting the necessary permits and approvals can take years, and the process is anything but simple.

      "This type of scam often begins after someone posts about Musk, Tesla or cryptocurrency. Scammers monitor public Facebook activity, then send a friend request from an account using Musk\u2019s name and photo. The profile may look legitimate, with copied images, reposted news articles or AI-generated content.",
      "Once the request is accepted, the impersonator encourages the victim to continue the conversation on WhatsApp. From there, the scam unfolds in a way that feels casual but calculated. The victim is congratulated on being randomly selected to win a brand-new Tesla and a large cash prize, often around $250,000. But before the reward can be delivered, they are told to cover \"delivery fees\" using an Apple Gift Card.",
      "In the case of the woman from Jensen Beach, she sent multiple gift cards totaling $800 before realizing the story was a setup. After claiming that a delivery truck had broken down, the scammer requested even more money. That's when she recognized the pattern and blocked the account.

But scammers also use Google Play, Amazon, Steam and Visa prepaid cards, depending on what they think the victim can access. These requests usually come with urgency. Victims may be told to stay on the phone while buying the cards or to scratch off the back and send a photo of the code right away. That sense of pressure is designed to override second thoughts.

The scammer may use deepfake video, AI-generated voice clips or doctored screenshots to make the offer feel more real. Once the target engages, the pressure begins.

      "1. Never send gift card codes to anyone you do not know: If someone asks for Apple, Amazon or Google Play cards as payment or verification, it is a scam. No real prize, agency or company will request gift cards.",
      "2. Be skeptical of prize claims from celebrity accounts: Musk is not messaging people on Facebook to give away Teslas or cash. If the profile is unverified or the offer feels random, trust your instincts and ignore it.",
      "3. Do not move conversations to private apps like WhatsApp or Telegram: Scammers often push for this because these platforms have fewer safeguards, no public comment threads and limited reporting tools. Once the chat moves off Facebook, it becomes much harder to verify or report what\u2019s happening. If someone you do not know insists on switching platforms, it\u2019s usually a sign they are hiding something.",
      "4. Consider using a data removal service: If a scammer has targeted you or impersonated you online, chances are your personal information is floating around on data broker websites. These sites collect and sell everything from your home address to your family members\u2019 names, making you a bigger target for future scams. Data removal services can help you scan the web and request the deletion of your info from these brokers. While you can do this manually, it\u2019s time-consuming. Services like\u00a0Incogni offer subscriptions that automate the process and monitor for new exposures. If you\u2019ve been scammed or suspect your information was leaked, using a data removal service adds another layer of protection and peace of mind.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "5. Watch for common red flags: Be cautious of sudden friend requests from unfamiliar accounts, vague messages that mention surprise winnings, poor grammar or any pressure to act quickly. Scammers often use emotional triggers to override your judgment. If something feels off or too convenient, it probably is.",
      "6. Install strong antivirus software on all devices: Some impersonation scams include links to phishing pages or malware. Antivirus tools can block these threats before they reach your inbox. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "7. Use two-factor authentication and a password manager: If a scam compromises your login credentials,\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA) can block unauthorized access. A password manager also helps protect against reused or weak passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",

(AHMAD AL-RUBAYE/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "\"What the IRGC tried to achieve over the last 25 years is basically toast,\" Ostovar told Fox News Digital, \"Their campaign to build a military deterrent at home through missiles and nuclear enrichment, and to expand regionally through proxies, has essentially collapsed.\"",
      "Founded in the wake of the 1979 revolution, the IRGC was created to safeguard and spread the Islamic Republic\u2019s values \u2014 often through violence. Ostovar describes how its legitimacy evolved over time, initially drawn from the overthrow of the Shah, then the Iran-Iraq War, and later through the manufactured narrative of an eternal struggle with the U.S. and Israel.",
      "Behnam Ben Taleblu, Senior Director of FDD's Iran Program Behnam Ben Taleblu, told Fox News Digital the IRGC\u2019s origin reflects a deep mistrust of Iran\u2019s traditional military, which had remained loyal to the Shah.",
      "\"The IRGC were created through efforts to collect pro-regime armed gangs called Komitehs. They enforced revolutionary edicts and developed a parallel and ideological military force due to clerical skepticism in the national army,\" he explained.",

      "\"The IRGC are tasked with preserving and defending the revolution in Iran,\" Taleblu said. \"That\u2019s one reason why the 1979 Islamic Revolution has not been tamed, nor has the regime\u2019s extremism lost any luster. If anything, terrorism and hostage-taking have continued.\"",
      "\"They created a boogeyman in the U.S. and Israel,\" Ostovar added. \"But today, that ideology no longer resonates with most Iranians. The majority want better relations with the West and are tired of the regime\u2019s isolationist stance.\"",
      "Today, the IRGC is deeply intertwined with the clerical elite. \"The IRGC and the clerical elite are partners in power, treating Iran as a springboard to export their revolution,\" Taleblu noted.",
      "EXILED IRANIAN PRINCE TELLS TRUMP HE CAN BE 'ONE OF HISTORY'S GREAT PEACEMAKERS' AMID TALK OF REGIME CHANGE",
      "Over the past year, Iran has suffered a series of strategic defeats: Hezbollah has been degraded in Lebanon, Hamas crippled in Gaza, Syria effectively lost, and Iranian military infrastructure \u2014 including nuclear and missile sites \u2014 destroyed in many cases by U.S. and Israeli strikes. Ostovar says these losses have decimated the IRGC\u2019s regional footprint and forced the regime to reevaluate its strategy.",
      "\"They can try to rebuild everything \u2014 but that would take too long and be too difficult,\" he said. \"More likely, we\u2019ll see them repress harder at home and lean on China and Russia to rebuild conventional military capabilities like air defense and advanced jets.\"",
      "Members of the Iranian revolutionary guard march during a parade. The IRGC is designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the State Department. A large part of its work is to covertly operate outside of Iran. (Reuters)",
      "Internally, the IRGC\u2019s economic empire is also under growing strain. Sanctions, cyberattacks, and battlefield losses have made operations far more difficult. Ostovar said that foreign banks avoid any connection with Iran out of fear they may inadvertently deal with IRGC-linked entities, forcing the group to operate through front companies abroad. \"They\u2019ve lost a lot, and now they\u2019ll have to redirect their limited resources to rebuild. That\u2019s going to stretch them even thinner.\"",
      "ISRAEL'S 'RESOUNDING' MILITARY CAMPAIGN AGAINST IRAN COULD BE HISTORIC TURNING POINT, EXPERTS SAY",
      "Despite these pressures, both Ostovar and Taleblu agree that the IRGC is unlikely to turn against the regime. \"Much like the regime elite, the IRGC is at a crossroads,\" Taleblu said. \"They have lost much of their strategic brain trust, but are likely to remain loyal for a combination of ideological and material reasons \u2014 so long as the status quo doesn\u2019t change.\"",
      "Looking ahead, Iran may shift focus inward, relying more on domestic repression than on external terror. \"They can\u2019t get weapons into Gaza. They\u2019ve lost access to Lebanon. They may still attempt terrorism, but they\u2019ve failed repeatedly \u2014 especially against Israeli targets,\" Ostovar said. \"In contrast, repressing their own people is something they can do easily.\"",
      "He warns that Iran could become \"more insular, more autocratic \u2014 more like North Korea than what it is today.\" While regime collapse is always a possibility, Ostovar believes autocracies are often resilient. \"Look at Venezuela or Cuba \u2014 they\u2019ve run their countries into the ground but still hold on to power.\"",
      "In this photo released by the Iranian Red Crescent Society rescuers work at the scene of an explosion after an Israeli strike in Tehran, Iran, Friday, June 13, 2025. (Iranian Red Crescent Society via AP)",
      "Ostovar thinks change \u2014 and not for the better \u2014 could come via generational shift. \"The IRGC\u2019s younger cadre is less religious but no less hardline,\" he said. \"They may not care about hijabs, but they\u2019ve spent the last two decades fighting the U.S. and Israel in Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon. That\u2019s the war they know.\"",
      "Some reformist elements within the regime envision a different path \u2014 one focused on normalization and growth. \"They want to preserve the regime not by fighting the world, but by opening up to it,\" Ostovar said. \"They look more to Vietnam or China as models.\"",

      "Taleblu warned that despite recent setbacks, the IRGC\u2019s grip remains strong. \"Right now, the Guards have power without accountability, wielding political, economic, and military influence in Iranian policy. How this influence is channeled by the next generation of Guardsmen remains to be seen.\"",

    "summary": "The Wisconsin Supreme Court on Wednesday formally struck down an abortion ban from 1849 that had technically retaken effect after the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "The Wisconsin Supreme Court on Wednesday formally struck down an abortion ban from 1849 that had technically retaken effect after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned federal abortion rights.",
      "In a 4-3 decision that came down along ideological lines, the court\u2019s liberal majority affirmed a lower court ruling that overturned the 176-year-old ban and left in place a more recent law in Wisconsin allowing most abortions until about the 20th week of pregnancy.",
      "\"We conclude that comprehensive legislation enacted over the last 50 years regulating in detail the 'who, what, where, when, and how' of abortion so thoroughly covers the entire subject of abortion that it was meant as a substitute for the 19th century near-total ban on abortion,\" liberal Justice Rebecca Dallet wrote in the majority opinion. \"Accordingly, we hold that the legislature impliedly repealed [the 1849 ban] to abortion, and that [that law] therefore does not ban abortion in the State of Wisconsin.\"",
      "The ruling is a win for abortion rights activists in the battleground state, where Democrats had put the issue at the forefront of many  elections \u2014 including two races in 2023 and 2025 that recalibrated the state Supreme Court's ideological balance \u2014 in the years since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.",
      "The state\u2019s 1849 law \u2014 enacted the year after Wisconsin was granted statehood \u2014 banned abortion in almost all cases by making performing the procedure a felony. Under the law, doctors who perform the procedure technically faced up to six years in prison and thousands of dollars in fines. The law included an exception for abortion care only to save the life of the woman, but not for her health or for rape or incest.",
      "As was the case in many states with similar older laws, or newer so-called trigger laws, the ban technically snapped back into effect almost immediately after the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision to strike down Roe v. Wade in 2022. In short order, the decision prompted Planned Parenthood\u2019s Wisconsin operations to suspend abortion services in the state.",
      "But a series of legal developments then put the question of the law\u2019s future before the state Supreme Court.",
      "Shortly after the Roe decision, Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers and Attorney General Josh Kaul, both Democrats, filed a suit arguing that the law had been effectively deemed invalid by more recent, more lenient abortion restriction legislation in the state. Evers and Kaul said at that time, in 2022, that they wouldn\u2019t enforce the law. Both won re-election later that year and have maintained their promise.",
      "But a state judge in July 2023 declared that the 1849 law did not apply to consensual medical abortions \u2014 the judge found that the original law intended to outlaw attacks on women that were intended as attempts to kill her unborn child \u2014 prompting abortion providers to resume care in the state in September 2023.",
      "The district attorney of conservative-leaning Sheboygan County, Joel Urmanski, backed by abortion opponents and other Republican attorneys, appealed that ruling, arguing that the 1849 ban should remain the law of the land, eventually elevating the case to the state Supreme Court.",
      "Meanwhile, in a separate case, Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin sued in February asking the state Supreme Court to decide whether a constitutional right to abortion care exists in the state. Arguments haven\u2019t been scheduled. But part of Wednesday's decision could well forecast how judges decide on that case.",
      "The decision Wednesday is the latest consequence of liberals having regained the majority of the technically nonpartisan court for the first time in 15 years in a bitter and expensive 2023 election that ended with progressive Janet Protasiewicz\u2019s victory.",
      "The race was largely defined by Protasiewicz\u2019s support for abortion rights and opposition to the state\u2019s heavily gerrymandered legislative maps. Both issues quickly came before the court following the election, and both ended with victories for the liberal parties in the cases.",
      "The issue of abortion played a prominent role in this year\u2019s state Supreme Court race as well, allowing liberals to maintain their narrow majority. Susan Crawford will be sworn in next month and did not participate in Wednesday's decision.",
      "The issue could also animate yet another race for a seat on the high court next year. Conservative Justice Rebecca Bradley has announced she will run for another term, triggering what promises to be another expensive and contentious race. State Supreme Court elections are scheduled in Wisconsin each year from 2026 to 2030.",
      "In her dissent, Bradley said the opinion by the court's liberal majority \u201cerases a law it does not like, making four lawyers sitting on the state\u2019s highest court more powerful than the People\u2019s representatives in the legislature.\u201d",
      "\u201dAny remaining doubt over whether the majority\u2019s decisions are motivated by the policy predilections of its members has been extinguished by its feeble attempt to justify a raw exercise of political power,\u201d she added.",
      "Wisconsin Democrats quickly said they'd use that dissent against Bradley in her re-election campaign next year \u2014 and would also highlight the ruling in what are expected to be competitive campaigns in 2026 in Wisconsin for the governorship and control of the legislature.",
      "\"It's something that's been front and center in our state as a top issue for voters,\" Wisconsin Democratic Party spokesperson Philip Shulman said in an interview, adding that Democrats would plan to focus on the ruling \"as we're looking towards the 2026 cycle.\"",
      "Wisconsin Republican party Chair Brian Schimming said in a statement that, \"The Wisconsin Supreme Court\u2019s role is to follow the Constitution, not to make law. This issue should be resolved in the legislature and by voters, not by far-left justices parading as legislators.\""

      "This is a free article for Diddy on Trial newsletter subscribers.",
      "Diddy\u2019s federal trial reached a stunning conclusion this morning when the jury of 12 everyday New Yorkers delivered a mixed verdict, acquitting him on the more serious counts, racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking, butfinding him guilty on two interstate prostitution charges.",
      "Diddy faces a potential prison sentence of as much as 20 years. But with the not guilty verdict on the three other counts in the U.S. government\u2019s case, he has avoided a maximum possible sentence of life behind bars.",
      "The seven-week trial inside the federal courthouse in Manhattan featured 34 government witnesses and reams of oftentimes graphic testimony about drug-dazed \u201cfreak offs\u201d and alleged physical assaults. U.S. government prosecutors attempted to paint a scathing portrait of a man who, they argued, refused to take \u201cno\u201d for an answer.",
      "Ultimately, though, the jury panel was not convinced that the Grammy-winning rapper led an alleged criminal enterprise or sex-trafficked two of his ex-girlfriends, the R&B singer Cassie Ventura and a woman identified by the pseudonym \u201cJane.\u201d",
      "The mogul\u2019s lawyers insisted that both Ventura and Jane were willing participants in marathon sexual encounters with male escorts in luxury hotel rooms. The defense didn\u2019t call any witnesses to the stand, but it used cross-examinations to portray Ventura and Jane as consenting adults and highlighted text messages in which both women expressed enthusiasm about \u201chotel nights.\u201d",
      "Diddy, who had pleaded not guilty to all counts, still faces a raft of civil lawsuits accusing him of rape and sexual assault \u2014 and it remains to be seen whether he can ever recover his position at the height of American music, where he helped catapult hip-hop into a worldwide phenomenon.",
      "Thank you for following along with us over the last two months. Stay tuned for more coverage of this case on NBCNews.com.",
      "\ud83d\udd0e The view from inside",
      "The tension and anxiety inside the courtroom were palpable when the jury informed the court it had reached a unanimous verdict. Diddy, who appeared increasingly on edge yesterday, sat at the defense table with his head down. You could practically hear a pin drop.",
      "Then the verdict was read to the court. The jurors were stoned-faced and didn\u2019t appear to look directly at the defendant.",
      "Diddy\u2019s team was clearly elated. Teny Geragos, one of his lawyers, wept and wiped away tears with a tissue. The attorneys hugged each other. (In fact, defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo hugged Geragos so tightly he picked her up off the floor.) Diddy, for his part, got down on his knees, put his head on his chair and prayed.",
      "Diddy\u2019s family members\u2014 including his mother, Janice Combs \u2014 clapped and cheered loudly. They left the building without taking questions, ignoring the throngs of photographers and passersby who had massed outside the courthouse.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 House Republican leaders moved rapidly  Wednesday to try to pass the party's massive domestic policy package after the Senate approved it, launching a full-court press and enlisting the help of President Donald Trump to sway a broad group of holdouts.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., can afford only three defections to pass the legislation through his narrow majority, presuming all members attend and Democrats vote against it. Johnson privately huddled just off Capitol Hill with members of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus, who are demanding deeper spending cuts.",
      "At the White House, Trump was holding multiple meetings with holdouts and on-the-fence members, one GOP lawmaker said, including with the moderate members of the Republican Main Street Caucus.",
      "The bill must pass the House before Trump can sign it into law, which he wants to do by Friday, July 4.",
      "Within hours of it narrowly passing the Senate on Tuesday, House Republicans advanced the bill through the Rules Committee in a 7-6 vote, with Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C., voting \"no\" due to concerns that it would add to the debt.",
      "Norman said he and other conservatives also planned to meet with Trump at the White House.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s going to be mad,\u201d Norman said of Trump, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know what to tell him.\u201d",
      "Norman said he could not give an example of what would change his mind to vote for the package in his current form and made it clear he would not be swayed by promises of future legislation.",
      "\u201cThe only thing driving this is the tax cuts,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce that goes away, how are we going to get anything passed?\u201d",
      "The legislation would extend the tax cuts Trump signed into law in 2017 while boosting funding for immigration enforcement and the military. It would also makes significant cuts to Medicaid, food stamps and clean energy funding, while raising the debt limit by $5 trillion.",
      "The Senate-passed bill would add $3.3 trillion to the national debt over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which found that the loss of revenue from tax cuts would outstrip the spending cuts in the legislation.",
      "Several House conservatives complained that the spending cuts were insufficient after shrinking in the Senate package. They raged against the fact that various provisions were stripped out due to budget rules in the chamber, including immigration-related restrictions they strongly support.",
      "But nearly all of those lawmakers have developed a track record of folding and voting in alignment with Trump when the pressure is on them. GOP leaders are counting on them to do so again.",
      "One House Republican lawmaker said conservatives in the Freedom Caucus used to get political cover from groups like Club for Growth, but Trump has scrambled the calculus on the right. The Club for Growth is backing the bill, and conservative figures like Russell Vought and Stephen Miller are in Trump\u2019s inner circle and some of the loudest cheerleaders for the package.",
      "Freedom Caucus members \u201chave no cover\u201d if they vote no, the lawmaker said Wednesday. \u201cWho\u2019s going to protect them from Trump? Thomas Massie?\u201d",
      "Trump has been in a bitter feud with the conservative Massie, a  Republican congressman from Kentucky, threatening to recruit a primary challenger against him after he was one of just two Republicans to vote against the bill in the House in May. Massie, who walks around Capitol Hill wearing a live debt clock, has said the legislation would make the deficit worse and has railed against it.",
      "And politically vulnerable Republicans were unhappy with the more aggressive Medicaid cuts in the Senate bill, along with a series of clean energy funding rollbacks that they warned against.",
      "On the Capitol steps Wednesday morning, Democrats blasted the legislation as a massive tax cut for the wealthiest Americans, paid for by slashing programs that help the working class.",
      "\"It is the cruelest bill that I've ever seen in my tenure in the House of Representatives,\" said Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., the ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, who has served in the House since 1988."

    "published": "Wed, 02 Jul 2025 15:06:26 GMT",
    "summary": "President Donald Trump wants the U.S. to increase its exports and lower its imports.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump wants the U.S. to increase its exports and lower its imports. Thanks to a historic decline in the value of the U.S. dollar, he may get his wish \u2014 but at a cost he may not have anticipated.",
      "Over the past six months, the dollar has declined more than 10% compared with a basket of currencies from the U.S.\u2019 major trading partners \u2014 something it has not done since 1973. Today, it sits at a three-year low.",
      "The simplest explanation for the decline is that global investors now expect the U.S. economy to no longer outperform the rest of the world as a result of Trump\u2019s tariffs and worsening fiscal issues. Even with U.S. stocks returning to record highs, the return on other countries\u2019 equities has been even stronger. Meanwhile the return on lending to the U.S. is expected to decline as growth here slows.",
      "It wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way. Many, including members of Trump\u2019s own Cabinet, assumed his tariffs strategy would strengthen the value of the dollar relative to foreign currencies. The thinking behind it was that as American consumers began to purchase fewer foreign goods, those other countries\u2019 currencies would weaken relative to the dollar.",
      "Instead, the opposite has occurred. U.S. growth prospects have weakened \u2014 in part because of Trump\u2019s tariffs. That has made U.S. debt relatively less attractive for foreign investors, especially compared with the returns on lending to other countries, like Germany and Japan, that are now expected to experience higher growth.",
      "In theory, the advantage of a weaker U.S. dollar is that it makes goods produced in the U.S. more attractive to foreign markets.",
      "Yet it is too soon to say whether that is occurring. In anticipation of Trump\u2019s tariffs, U.S. firms massively increased their imports in the first three months of this year to avoid paying the new duties, and it will be weeks before second-quarter data is released.",
      "Even then, that data will likely only show a snapback effect from the first quarter\u2019s upswing. And while Trump has announced a flurry of new investments designed to beef up U.S. production capacity, many of those endeavors are months or even years from coming on line.",
      "One obvious effect of a weakening U.S. dollar is that it becomes more expensive for Americans to go to popular destinations abroad, since the greenback will be worth less than local currencies. In essence, your money won\u2019t stretch as far. Of course, such excursions tend to be taken largely by travelers who are less worried about increased costs.",
      "At home, a bigger concern is inflation, and lost purchasing power for U.S. consumers and businesses, who still remain heavily reliant on imports. Until America is able to sustainably produce more goods on its own at higher volumes, purchasing power will decline as it becomes relatively more expensive to import goods from abroad.",
      "In the meantime, analysts say, a more alarming trend may be taking root: Foreigners are no longer buying U.S. financial assets, like stocks and bonds, at the levels that have allowed the U.S. to finance its trade deficit in the first place. Although U.S. stocks have returned to record levels, on a relative basis, they\u2019ve underperformed their counterparts in Europe and elsewhere.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s often forgotten that the U.S. is not only reliant on foreigners\u2019 goods, but we\u2019re also meaningfully reliant on foreign capital to support our financial markets,\u201d said Bob Elliott, chief investment officer at Unlimited Funds financial group. \u201cYour bonds are bought by European investors, your stock is bought by European investors \u2014 that is making you feel wealthier.\u201d",
      "A weaker dollar, he said, could weigh on foreign investors\u2019 willingness to buy U.S. financial assets, \u201cwhich are so critical to supporting U.S. household balance sheets.\u201d",
      "\u201cAn emerging theme in asset management is the rotation out of US assets into Europe as investors seek non-US exposure,\u201d Bank of America\u2019s Hubert Lam and Christiane Holstein said in a late June note. \u201cSentiment toward US markets has turned negative due to mounting concerns over protectionist trade measures, abrupt policy shifts, a rising deficit, and a proposal for taxes targeting foreign investors in the US.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs such, investors are starting to diversify out of the US in both public and private markets,\u201d they said.",
      "The Bank of America analysts added that many international investors are reallocating their investment choices to their home markets, especially in Europe, \u201cfor policy stability\u201d and \u201cpatriotic\u201d reasons.",
      "On the other hand, a handful of analysts say fears of continued U.S. dollar weakness are overblown, and that U.S. economic exceptionalism will ultimately prevail. The U.S. has always outperformed on growth thanks to its dynamic markets and pro-growth regulations, and Trump\u2019s bill cementing massive tax cuts \u2014 plus initial data showing the U.S. labor market remained relatively sturdy in June \u2014 have already provided a brief rally in the dollar\u2019s value this week.",
      "But assuming U.S. growth does weaken, the Federal Reserve will likely start cutting interest rates, further making U.S. financial assets less attractive to outside investors. That will cause the value of the dollar to decline even further, making it even more expensive to buy goods from abroad.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a doom loop,\u201d said Danny Dayan, an investor and former hedge fund manager.",
      "\u201cSo far, the inflation data have been quite benign,\u201d Dayan said. \u201cBut we know tariffs will raise prices to some degree.\u201d A weakening dollar will only contribute to accelerating price growth, he said."

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk\u2019s threat this week to form his own political party isn\u2019t the first time he has flirted with the idea.",
      "In 2022, just before he became heavily involved in Republican politics, Musk mused about striking out on his own politically in a series of social media posts saying he didn\u2019t feel at home in either the Democratic or the Republican parties.",
      "\u201cA party more moderate on all issues than either Reps or Dems would be ideal,\u201d Musk posted on X, then known as Twitter, in May 2022.",
      "It was a short-lived dalliance. After a blip of media coverage, Musk never followed through on the idea for a third party and instead began pouring money into right-wing groups.",
      "But now he is returning to the idea of a third U.S. party, with him and President Donald Trump feuding again over the Republican megabill that could increase the national debt by $3.3 trillion.",
      "\u201cIf this insane spending bill passes, the America Party will be formed the next day,\u201d Musk wrote Monday on X in a post that had more than 42 million views within a day. The bill passed the Senate on Tuesday and will be deliberated upon in the House, where Republican leaders hope to pass it by July 4.",
      "Musk has posted at least eight times this week promoting the idea of a new political party. He said his party would focus on reducing the national debt \u2014 which he said neither Democrats nor Republicans were capable of doing. He said the two major parties acted in concert like a \u201cPORKY PIG PARTY!!\u201d",
      "Musk didn\u2019t elaborate on his plans beyond the name \u201cAmerica Party\u201d and the focus on debt. He didn\u2019t respond to an emailed request for comment. Experts told NBC News that Musk would face an uphill battle if he chose to actually try to build a new party.",
      "Trump responded to Musk\u2019s announcement with a threat to cut government support for Musk\u2019s businesses, saying his administration might \u201ceat Elon.\u201d",
      "And Musk\u2019s unpopularity, including among those who don\u2019t identify with either major party, would make him an unlikely person to launch a third political party. Among political independents, 59% viewed him unfavorably and 29% viewed him favorably in a Quinnipiac University poll of registered voters last month.",
      "His standing in the public has, if anything, gotten worse since he left his job in the Trump administration a month ago, according to a tracker of his popularity run by statistics writer Nate Silver.",
      "But Musk has access to vast resources as the world\u2019s wealthiest person, largely because of his stakes in Tesla and SpaceX, and he controls a significant media outlet in X. Those assets could come in handy for launching a political party.",
      "The number of registered independents and third-party members is also growing as voters break from the two-party system at increasing rates, according to an NBC News analysis of voter registration data.",
      "The Democratic and Republican parties have had a near-stranglehold on the American political system for decades, and while independents have been elected to Congress, including two currently in the Senate, they generally caucus with the major parties and don\u2019t operate as true third-party candidates. The major parties regularly change state laws or take other steps to block third parties from getting on the ballot.",
      "Richard Winger, who helps run Ballot Access News and is a longtime advocate for easier ballot access for third parties, said he wasn\u2019t sure what to make of Musk\u2019s announcement.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s so flighty,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s achieved a great deal in life, but to look at him in politics, he seems so unserious.\u201d",
      "Last year, Musk became the biggest spender in Republican politics, giving more than $290 million to help put Trump back in the White House. He has also pushed right-wing politics around the globe, including a German party that has downplayed Nazi atrocities. But he has distanced himself from many Republicans after he stepped away from the Trump administration a month ago.",
      "Few third parties have found major success.",
      "A handful of small third parties, such as the Libertarian and Green parties, hold conventions and run candidates for office, but their wins are few. Many other attempts at third parties, such as former President Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s Progressive Party in 1912, haven\u2019t lasted.",
      "The American system is an outlier globally. Democracies in Canada, Europe and elsewhere usually have multiparty systems, often with parties forming coalitions with one another to win control in legislative chambers.",
      "Bernard Tamas, a political science professor at Valdosta State University in Georgia, said Musk would have to overcome many hurdles to establish a third party.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not like running a business,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be more like a social movement. It\u2019s got to be kind of a grassroots thing, where people are motivated and energized to fight.\u201d",
      "And although Musk appeared to help energize some Trump voters in swing states last year, a truly competitive third party would involve a far larger organization than Musk\u2019s super PAC.",
      "\u201cEven if he could put in the money, he cannot replicate the amount of institutional structure that these two parties\u201d have, Tamas said. \u201cIt\u2019s an open question whether he can do it or not, but money is not enough. Money is not the only obstacle in front of third parties.\u201d",
      "At least one third-party organizer, Andrew Yang, who ran unsuccessfully in the 2020 Democratic primaries for president, has expressed an interest in teaming up with Musk, and Musk said in 2022 that he supported Yang earlier. But it\u2019s not clear that Musk is still interested. Yang, who didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment Tuesday, criticized Trump\u2019s budget bill as a symptom of wider problems, writing on X, \u201cSo many people hate this bill; it\u2019s a great example of how messed up our political system is.\u201d",
      "Yang\u2019s Forward Party hasn\u2019t enjoyed widespread success, but it does have a handful of members in elected office around the country, including a state senator in Utah.",
      "The laws for setting up political parties vary by state but generally require organizers to gather thousands of signatures and meet other requirements. In Texas, where Musk lives, a party would need to identify about 81,000 supporters \u2014 which experts said is achievable with enough time and money.",
      "\u201cYou can hire paid petitioning firms and you can get people on the ballot,\u201d Winger said. \u201cEspecially since it\u2019s so far from the next election, he has oodles of time.\u201d",
      "But the requirements have lately gotten worse, he added, with several states raising the requirements for third parties or independent candidates to get on the ballot.",
      "\u201cWhen the country is feeling good and calm, the ballot access laws tend to get better. When there\u2019s a lot of anxiety, the laws get worse. This decade has just been horrible,\u201d Winger said.",
      "\u201cWe had an excellent decade in the 1990s,\u201d he said, recalling the rise of billionaire presidential candidate Ross Perot and his Reform Party aided by changing state laws.",
      "Perot won 19% of the popular vote in 1992 as an independent candidate for president, running largely on the platform of reducing the national debt. And although he didn\u2019t win any electoral votes or create a lasting competitive third party, he did push deficit reduction to the top of the national agenda, and the federal budget was briefly balanced at the end of the century. He died in 2019.",
      "Trump himself once flirted with a third-party run. In 2000, he explored pursuing the presidential nomination of the Reform Party, claiming that his polling was \u201cunbelievable.\u201d But he quit the race after four months, saying the Reform Party was controlled by \u201cfringe\u201d extremists and likely to be shut out of national debates.",
      "Musk didn\u2019t cast his first ballot in an election until 2016, when he was 45 years old.",
      "Tamas said one possible scenario is Musk\u2019s launching a third party that then gets co-opted by a major party competing for the same voters. Tamas said third parties that have succeeded in accomplishing their goals usually disappear within 10 years.",
      "\u201cWhat you\u2019re doing as a third party is you\u2019re supposed to be causing pain,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to hurt them and hurt them by causing them to lose seats or lose elections, and then, once they lose, the hope is they co-opt whatever the third party is selling. They change themselves in order to stay alive.\u201d"

      "The jury\u2019s verdict, delivered on the third day of deliberations, declared Combs, 55, not guilty of one count of racketeering conspiracy and two counts of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, but guilty of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution.",
      "The verdict is seen as a win for Combs and his defense team, which did not call a witness during the seven-week trial. After the verdict was read, his family stood in the background, clapping and cheering. Combs fell to his knees in prayer. As he left the courtroom, he told his family, \u201cthank you, love you.\u201d",
      "Teny Geragos, one of Combs\u2019 attorneys, broke out in tears. His lead attorney, Marc Agnifilo, made a fist in triumph as the defense team hugged each other and hugged his family.",
      "At sentencing, the prostitution transportation charge carries as much as 10 years in prison per count. Prosecutor Maurene Comey said the government would seek the maximum of 20 years.",

      "Sign up for the \u201cDiddy on Trial\u201d newsletter for key developments and analysis",
      "Agnifilo asked U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian to release him from federal detention, where he has been for nearly a year. He also asked for Combs to be released on conditions to his home in Miami and offered a $1 million bond.",
      "Subramanian said he would review whether to release Combs later Wednesday after receiving arguments from prosecutors and the defense.",

      "The partial conviction caps an astonishing moment for Combs, a self-made rapper from New York who rose to the pinnacle of hip-hop culture and became a household name. After a three-decade run in the spotlight, it was allegations by his ex-girlfriend, the R&B singer Cassie, that began his precipitous fall from impresario to convicted criminal.",
      "Over the course of the trial, a jury of eight men and four women heard the U.S. government accuse the Bad Boy Records founder of leveraging his power, wealth and influence as the head of a \u201ccriminal enterprise\u201d to sexually abuse and exploit women for his own gratification over two decades.",
      "His defense pitched to jurors that the case against Combs was \u201cbadly exaggerated,\u201d and he was simply on trial for a \u201cswingers\u201d lifestyle \u2014 one tinged with violent behavior and included supplies of drugs and baby oil \u2014 that was ultimately consensual.",
      "The dueling depictions cast a far-different image of the Harlem-born hitmaker, who once ruled the hip-hop and R&B charts, was a fixture in celebrity circles and propelled his exuberant personality, lavish lifestyle and business pursuits, including in reality television and fashion, as an entrepreneur and brand ambassador.",
      "The trial heard from almost three dozen government witnesses, from former personal assistants to stylists to label artists, some willingly testifying against Combs, while others were granted immunity in exchange for their testimony.",
      "Three women, including Cassie, whose real name is Casandra Ventura, were central figures in the case, as they provided graphic testimony of allegations of sexual assault and violence or threats of blackmail.",

    "summary": "The Wisconsin Supreme Court on Wednesday formally struck down an abortion ban from 1849 that had technically retaken effect after the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "The Wisconsin Supreme Court on Wednesday formally struck down an abortion ban from 1849 that had technically retaken effect after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned federal abortion rights.",
      "In a 4-3 decision that came down along ideological lines, the court\u2019s liberal majority affirmed a lower court ruling that overturned the 176-year-old ban and left in place a more recent law in Wisconsin allowing most abortions until about the 20th week of pregnancy.",
      "\"We conclude that comprehensive legislation enacted over the last 50 years regulating in detail the 'who, what, where, when, and how' of abortion so thoroughly covers the entire subject of abortion that it was meant as a substitute for the 19th century near-total ban on abortion,\" liberal Justice Rebecca Dallet wrote in the majority opinion. \"Accordingly, we hold that the legislature impliedly repealed [the 1849 ban] to abortion, and that [that law] therefore does not ban abortion in the State of Wisconsin.\"",
      "The ruling is a win for abortion rights activists in the battleground state, where Democrats had put the issue at the forefront of many  elections \u2014 including two races in 2023 and 2025 that recalibrated the state Supreme Court's ideological balance \u2014 in the years since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.",
      "The state\u2019s 1849 law \u2014 enacted the year after Wisconsin was granted statehood \u2014 banned abortion in almost all cases by making performing the procedure a felony. Under the law, doctors who perform the procedure technically faced up to six years in prison and thousands of dollars in fines. The law included an exception for abortion care only to save the life of the woman, but not for her health or for rape or incest.",
      "As was the case in many states with similar older laws, or newer so-called trigger laws, the ban technically snapped back into effect almost immediately after the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision to strike down Roe v. Wade in 2022. In short order, the decision prompted Planned Parenthood\u2019s Wisconsin operations to suspend abortion services in the state.",
      "But a series of legal developments then put the question of the law\u2019s future before the state Supreme Court.",
      "Shortly after the Roe decision, Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers and Attorney General Josh Kaul, both Democrats, filed a suit arguing that the law had been effectively deemed invalid by more recent, more lenient abortion restriction legislation in the state. Evers and Kaul said at that time, in 2022, that they wouldn\u2019t enforce the law. Both won re-election later that year and have maintained their promise.",
      "But a state judge in July 2023 declared that the 1849 law did not apply to consensual medical abortions \u2014 the judge found that the original law intended to outlaw attacks on women that were intended as attempts to kill her unborn child \u2014 prompting abortion providers to resume care in the state in September 2023.",
      "The district attorney of conservative-leaning Sheboygan County, Joel Urmanski, backed by abortion opponents and other Republican attorneys, appealed that ruling, arguing that the 1849 ban should remain the law of the land, eventually elevating the case to the state Supreme Court.",
      "Meanwhile, in a separate case, Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin sued in February asking the state Supreme Court to decide whether a constitutional right to abortion care exists in the state. Arguments haven\u2019t been scheduled. But part of Wednesday's decision could well forecast how judges decide on that case.",
      "The decision Wednesday is the latest consequence of liberals having regained the majority of the technically nonpartisan court for the first time in 15 years in a bitter and expensive 2023 election that ended with progressive Janet Protasiewicz\u2019s victory.",
      "The race was largely defined by Protasiewicz\u2019s support for abortion rights and opposition to the state\u2019s heavily gerrymandered legislative maps. Both issues quickly came before the court following the election, and both ended with victories for the liberal parties in the cases.",
      "The issue of abortion played a prominent role in this year\u2019s state Supreme Court race as well, allowing liberals to maintain their narrow majority. Susan Crawford will be sworn in next month and did not participate in Wednesday's decision.",
      "The issue could also animate yet another race for a seat on the high court next year. Conservative Justice Rebecca Bradley has announced she will run for another term, triggering what promises to be another expensive and contentious race. State Supreme Court elections are scheduled in Wisconsin each year from 2026 to 2030.",
      "In her dissent, Bradley said the opinion by the court's liberal majority \u201cerases a law it does not like, making four lawyers sitting on the state\u2019s highest court more powerful than the People\u2019s representatives in the legislature.\u201d",
      "\u201dAny remaining doubt over whether the majority\u2019s decisions are motivated by the policy predilections of its members has been extinguished by its feeble attempt to justify a raw exercise of political power,\u201d she added.",
      "Wisconsin Democrats quickly said they'd use that dissent against Bradley in her re-election campaign next year \u2014 and would also highlight the ruling in what are expected to be competitive campaigns in 2026 in Wisconsin for the governorship and control of the legislature.",
      "\"It's something that's been front and center in our state as a top issue for voters,\" Wisconsin Democratic Party spokesperson Philip Shulman said in an interview, adding that Democrats would plan to focus on the ruling \"as we're looking towards the 2026 cycle.\"",
      "Wisconsin Republican party Chair Brian Schimming said in a statement that, \"The Wisconsin Supreme Court\u2019s role is to follow the Constitution, not to make law. This issue should be resolved in the legislature and by voters, not by far-left justices parading as legislators.\""

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Day camp providers and schools are warning that a Trump administration funding freeze could wreck summer for low-income American families and wipe out some after-school programming next year.",
      "The administration is withholding more than $6 billion in federal grants for after-school and summer programs, English language instruction, adult literacy and more as part of a review to ensure grants align with President Donald Trump's priorities.",
      "The move leaves states and schools in limbo as they budget for programs this summer and in the upcoming school year, introducing new uncertainty about when \u2014 or if \u2014 they will receive the money. It also sets the stage for a clash with Democrats, who say the administration is flouting the law by holding back money Congress appropriated.",
      "Without the money, schools say they won't be able to provide free or affordable after-school care for low-income kids while their parents work, and they may not be able to hire staff to teach children who are learning English. Even classes or camps underway this summer could be in jeopardy.",
      "For instance, the Boys and Girls Clubs of America depend on some of the withheld money to run camps and other summer programming for low-income students. If funding isn't restored soon, the programming may end mid-season, said Boys and Girls Club President Jim Clark.",
      "After-school programming in the fall could also take a hit. \"If these funds are blocked, the fallout will be swift and devastating,\" Clark said. As many as 926 Boys and Girls Clubs could close, affecting more than 220,000 kids, the group said.",
      "Programs that rely on the money were expecting it to be distributed July 1, but an Education Department notice issued Monday announced the money would not be released while the programs are under review. The department did not provide a timeline and warned that \"decisions have not yet been made\" on grants for the upcoming school year.",
      "\"The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President's priorities and the Department's statutory responsibilities,\" Education Department officials wrote in the notice, which was obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "The department referred questions to the Office of Management and Budget, which did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "After-school child care at risk",
      "In Gadsden City Schools in Alabama, officials say they'll have no choice but to shutter their after-school program serving more than 1,200 low-income students if federal funds aren't released. There's no other way to make up for the frozen federal money, said Janie Browning, who directs the program.",
      "Families who rely on after-school programs would lose an important source of child care that keeps children safe and engaged while their parents work. The roughly 75 employees of the district's after-school programs may lose their jobs.",
      "\"Those hours between after school and 6 o'clock really are the hours in the day when students are at the most risk for things that may not produce great outcomes,\" Browning said. \"It would be devastating if we lost the lifeline of afterschool for our students and our families.\"",
      "Jodi Grant, executive director of the Afterschool Alliance, said withholding the money could cause lasting damage to the economy.",
      "Some advocates fear the grants are being targeted for elimination, which could force schools to cut programs and teachers. Trump's 2026 budget proposal called for Congress to zero out all of the programs under review, signaling the administration sees them as unnecessary.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., pressed the administration to spend the money as Congress intended.",
      "\"Every day that this funding is held up is a day that school districts are forced to worry about whether they'll have to cut back on afterschool programs or lay off teachers instead of worrying about how to make sure our kids can succeed,\" Murray said in a statement.",
      "What the money funds",
      "The six grant programs under review include one known as 21st Century Community Learning Centers. It's the primary federal funding source for after-school and summer learning programs and supports more than 10,000 local programs nationwide, according to the Afterschool Alliance. Every state runs its own competition to distribute the grants, which totaled $1.3 billion this fiscal year.",
      "Also under review are $2 billion in grants for teachers' professional development and efforts to reduce class size; $1 billion for academic enrichment grants, often used for science and math education and accelerated learning; $890 million for students who are learning English; $376 million to educate the children of migrant workers; and $715 million to teach adults how to read.",
      "These programs account for over 20% of the federal money the District of Columbia receives for K-12 education, according to an analysis by the Learning Policy Institute, a think tank. California alone has over $800,000 in limbo, while Texas has over $660,000.",
      "\"Trump is illegally impounding billions of dollars appropriated by Congress to serve students this fiscal year,\" said Tony Thurmond, California's state superintendent, in a statement. \"The Administration is punishing children when states refuse to cater to Trump's political ideology.",
      "The loss of funds could \"put several more school districts in extreme financial distress,\" said Chris Reykdal, superintendent of public instruction in Washington state. Districts have already adopted budgets, planned programming and hired staff, assuming they'd receive the money, Reykdal said.",
      "If the funding freeze remains, children learning English and their parents would be especially affected. Some districts use the money to pay for summer programming designed for English learners, family engagement specialists who can communicate with parents and professional development training for staff. Rural districts would be hit the hardest.",
      "\"They're trying to send a message,\" said Amaya Garcia, who oversees education research at New America, a left-leaning think tank. \"They don't believe that taxpayer funding should be used for these children.\"",
      "Umatilla School District in rural eastern Oregon \u2014 with a sizable population of migrant families and students learning English \u2014 relies heavily on federal funding for its after-school and summer school programs. Superintendent Heidi Sipe says she is meeting with state officials soon to find out if the district will have to plan an early end to summer school, an option 20% of students are using. Come this fall, if federal money stays frozen, she'll have to lay off staff and eliminate after-school programs attended by around half the district's students.",
      "\"It's an essential service in our community because we don't have any licensed child care centers for school-age children,\" she said.",
      "Sipe said it's particularly frustrating to deal with these funds being put into limbo because the school district was in the middle of a five-year grant period.",
      "\"It feels preventable,\" she said, \"and it feels as though we could have done a better job planning for America's children.\""

    "story": [
      "Flint has replaced most of its lead water pipes, more than 10 years after contaminated water was found in the Michigan city's water system, prompting national outrage.",
      "State officials submitted a progress report in court on Tuesday showing that they had replaced 11,000 lead pipes in the city and restored more than 28,000 affected properties.",
      "\"Thanks to the persistence of the people of Flint and our partners, we are finally at the end of the lead pipe replacement project,\" said Allen C. Overton of the Concerned Pastors for Social Action, one of the plaintiffs in a 2017 lawsuit against officials over the scandal. \"While this milestone is not all the justice our community deserves, it is a huge achievement.\"",
      "The Michigan Attorney General's Office did not immediately return a request for comment.",
      "In 2013, officials stopped buying water from Detroit and created a pipeline to Lake Huron as a cost-cutting measure. Until the pipeline\u2019s completion, the city\u2019s primary water source came from the Flint River in 2014.",
      "Quickly, residents reported a murky, foamy quality of the water coming from their pipes. After testing positive for high levels of trihalomethanes \u2014 a disinfectant byproduct \u2014 E. coli bacteria and lead, city officials said that the water was still safe for consumption. It wasn't until October 2015 that the majority-Black city switched back to Detroit water.",
      "The Center for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that the water crisis exposed nearly 100,000 residents of Flint to lead due to the crisis.",
      "Criminal charges were brought for several deaths related to the contamination, but were later dismissed.",
      "The 2017 lawsuit was settled in 2021 for $626 million, which included an agreement to replace the lead pipes free.",
      "\"We would not have reached this day without the work of so many Flint residents who worked to hold our leaders accountable,\" Overton said. \"I have never been prouder to be a member of the Flint community.\"",
      "The report says that roughly 4,000 homes still have lead pipes. Those homes were likely either vacant or homes that belonged to Flint residents who opted out of having the pipes replaced, according to a spokesperson for the advocacy group that led the lawsuit, the Natural Resources Defense Council."

      "Researchers on Wednesday announced a new expedition to find \u200b\u200bAmelia Earhart\u2019s plane, based on evidence that suggests the famed aviator may have crash-landed on a remote island in the South Pacific.",
      "A satellite photo may appear to show the remains of Earhart\u2019s plane peeking through the sand on the small, remote and inhospitable island lagoon of Nikumaroro in Kiribati, nearly 1,000 miles from Fiji, according to Richard Pettigrew, the executive director of the nonprofit Archaeological Legacy Institute in Oregon.",
      "In one of the world\u2019s most intriguing mysteries, Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan vanished while attempting to fly around the world exactly 88 years ago on July 2, 1937.",
      "Now, Purdue University \u2014 which had employed Earhart and helped fund her historic flight \u2014 said it will send a team to Nikumaroro in November in hopes of digging up her Lockheed Electra 10E aircraft and returning what\u2019s left of it.",
      "\u201cWe believe we owe it to Amelia and her legacy at Purdue to fulfill her wishes, if possible, to bring the Electra back to Purdue,\u201d Steve Schultz, Purdue\u2019s general counsel, said.",
      "The satellite photo was captured in 2015, a year after an intense tropical cyclone shifted the sand, potentially revealing the plane, said Pettigrew, who took the evidence to Purdue.",
      "He said the size and composition of the object matches Earhart\u2019s plane. The location is also close to Earhart\u2019s planned flight path and almost precisely where four of her radio calls for help seem to originate, said Pettigrew, who has traveled to Nikumaroro.",
      "\u201cIt satisfies all the criteria,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything fits.\u201d",
      "The archaeologist, who has tried to solve Earhart\u2019s disappearance for years, said other evidence, including the discovery of American-made tools and a medicine vial, suggests Earhart may have been on Nikumaroro.",
      "And in 2017, four forensic dogs and a team of archaeologists with the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR) ventured to Nikumaroro, where the canines indicated they had detected the scent of human remains, according to National Geographic.",
      "Still, there\u2019s been no clear proof of her presence there, Pettigrew said, and the object seen in the satellite photo has been elusive. In images taken since 2015, it is hidden under the sand again, he said.",
      "\u201cWhat we lack now so far is what you call, what I call the smoking gun evidence,\u201d he said.",
      "TIGHAR executive director Ric Gillespie doubts they will find that proof.",
      "Gillespie's team on The Earhart Project has conducted a dozen expeditions over 35 years and recovered other physical evidence they believe shows Nikumaroro is where Earhart landed and died. But he believes the object in the satellite image is a coconut palm tree with a root ball, washed up in a storm.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve looked there in that spot, and there\u2019s nothing there,\u201d he said.",
      "Gillespie, who published the book \"One More Good Flight: The Amelia Earhart Tragedy\" last year, said the plane would not be hidden in the sand but buried in coral rubble.",
      "\u201cI understand the desire to find a piece of Amelia Earhart\u2019s airplane. God knows we\u2019ve tried,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the data, the facts, do not support the hypothesis. It\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d",
      "Earhart was the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean.",
      "The trailblazer worked at Purdue, serving as a career counselor for women and an adviser on its aeronautical engineering department, from 1935 until her disappearance in 1937, according to the university\u2019s website.",
      "Schultz, Purdue\u2019s general counsel, said Earhart\u2019s post-flight plan was to return the plane to the school to be studied by future aeronautical engineers and aviation students.",
      "The Purdue Research Foundation has given the first phase of the expedition a line of credit of $500,000, Schultz said.",
      "It will take six days for the team of explorers to get to Nikumaroro by boat in November, he said. They\u2019ll then have another five days on the island to find the object in the sand and identify it as the missing plane.",
      "\u201cIf we hopefully solve the mystery and confirm that it is, then there will be further efforts to bring it back, hopefully to a permanent home,\u201d Schultz said."

      "Now, Nickelodeon\u2019s animated series \u201cDora the Explorer\u201d is celebrating its 25th anniversary with a live-action movie, premiering on Nickelodeon and Paramount+ on Wednesday, ahead of the July 4 holiday weekend.",
      "\u201cDora and the Search for Sol Dorado\u201d tells the story of 16-year-old Dora (played by Samantha Lorraine) who is budding into a skilled treasure hunter.",
      "The movie follows Dora and her friend Diego (Jacob Rodriguez) as they trek through a jungle to find an ancient treasure that could grant a magical wish.",
      "This teenage version of Dora, Mexican director Alberto Belli says, is like Indiana Jones and Lara Croft, but with a spunky \u201clo hicimos\u201d (\u201cWe did it\u201d) attitude that makes her uniquely Latina.",
      "But according to Belli, Dora is more interested in the adventure because it can help her figure out who she is and what other people are like.",
      "Developing this larger sense of finding her place became a guiding theme for the movie.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re taking a cartoon character into a live action, you need to go a little bit deeper. So we tried to create some more problems,\u201d Belli said in an interview, accompanied by actress Samantha Lorraine. \u201cShe (Dora) loses her bag, which is a spoiler, but it\u2019s also in the trailer. So now she needs to find who she really is. And I think right now, more than ever, people feel a little lost.\u201d",
      "Dora\u2019s backpack typically contains specific items, including a map, which she will need on her adventures. And Belli says that when \u201cyou don\u2019t know exactly where you need to go,\u201d you have to look inside yourself to figure it out.",
      "Lorraine says that \u201cSol Dorado\u201d (\u201cGolden Sun\u201d) is more about finding an internal space \u2014 \u201cwho you are as a person.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen she (Dora) finds Sol Dorado, to me, it was this full circle moment that we had finally finished this character arc,\u201d the young actress said.",
      "Many iconic action-adventure characters \"usually go and explore someone else\u2019s culture. They never explore their own culture,\u201d Belli said. \u201cWhat\u2019s really exciting about Dora is she loves history. She\u2019s exploring her own culture.\u201d",
      "The movie incorporates Indigenous Latino traditions that influence Dora\u2019s identity.",
      "One such tradition was based on \u201cayllu,\u201d which is the Andean way of organizing communities to support each other through shared land, resources and responsibilities.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to ayllu, friendship and connection is so important, and I think Dora is the epitome of that. She\u2019s the connection through most cultures of the world,\u201d Lorraine said, adding that \u201cDora the Explorer\u201d has been translated into more than 30 languages.",
      "Belli said that they had an expert on set to guide them through different Indigenous traditions, including quipus, which are knotted cords that were used by the Incas to record information.",
      "They also had two consultants to work on pronunciation for when Dora had to speak in Quechua, which is an Indigenous language spoken by people in parts of Per\u00fa, Bolivia and Ecuador.",
      "Lorraine, who identifies as Cuban American, says that playing Dora was a privilege because she offers many Latino children visibility.",
      "\u201cI kept thinking to myself, what do I want my little cousins to see when they watch this movie?,\u201d she said.",
      "Lorraine wants \u201cDora and the Search for Sol Dorado\u201d to help viewers  \u2014 regardless of their age \u2014 keep their sense of adventure and curiosity alive.",
      "Dora has \"always been part of pop culture,\" Belli said, adding that he has a 5-year-old who's a big fan.",
      "\"When I got the job, he got more excited than I did,\" the director said with a laugh.  \"What I love about Dora is she's a positive influence in people; she teaches you how to be positive, energetic and adventurous \u2014 and at the same time she teaches Spanish in a fun way, which I think is very cool.\""

The bill might not have an easy path to passage in the House, where Republicans can only spare three votes and changes made by the Senate could be met with opposition.",
      "The Senate narrowly passed the legislation yesterday in a 51-50 vote. Vice President JD Vance broke the tie after three Republicans \u2014 Sens.

      "Also notable: Republicans used a trick known as \u201ccurrent policy baseline\u201d to obscure the cost of extending the tax cuts, essentially lowering the sticker price of the bill by $3.8 trillion, and setting a lasting precedent in weakening the Senate\u2019s usual 60-vote threshold.",
      "A hurdle to passage in the House could come from the far-right Freedom Caucus, which fought for a $40,000 state and local tax, or SALT, deduction cap. The Senate\u2019s bill keeps the $40,000 cap, but the deduction would be cut back to a $10,000 cap after five years.",

      "NEW YORK \u2014 A federal judge in New York on Tuesday blocked the Trump administration from ending temporary legal status for more than 500,000 Haitians who are already in the United States.",
      "District Court Judge Brian M. Cogan in New York ruled that moving up the expiration of the temporary protected status, or TPS, by at least five months for Haitians, some of whom have lived in the U.S. for more than a decade, is unlawful.",
      "The Biden administration had extended Haiti's TPS status through at least Feb. 3, 2026, due to gang violence, political unrest, a major earthquake in 2021 and several other factors, according to court documents.",
      "But last week, the Department of Homeland Security announced it was terminating those legal protections as soon as Sept. 2, setting Haitians up for potential deportation. The department said the conditions in the country had improved and Haitians no longer met the conditions for the temporary legal protections.",
      "The ruling comes as President Donald Trump works to end protections and programs for immigrants as part of his mass deportations promises.",
      "The judge's 23-page opinion states that the Department of Homeland Security 's move to terminate the legal protections early violates the TPS statute that requires a certain amount of notice before reconsidering a designation.",
      "\"When the Government confers a benefit over a fixed period of time, a beneficiary can reasonably expect to receive that benefit at least until the end of that fixed period,\" according to the ruling.",
      "The judge also referenced the fact that the plaintiffs have started jobs, enrolled in schools and begun receiving medical treatment with the expectations that the country's TPS designation would run through the end of the year.",
      "Manny Pastreich, president of the Service Employees International Union Local 32BJ, which filed the lawsuit, described the ruling as an \"important step\" but said the fight is not over.",
      "\"We will keep fighting to make sure this decision is upheld,\" Pastreich said in a statement. \"We will keep fighting for the rights of our members and all immigrants against the Trump Administration \u2013 in the streets, in the workplace, and in the courts as well. And when we fight, we win.\"",
      "DHS did not immediately respond to an email from The Associated Press requesting comment. But the government had argued that TPS is a temporary program and thus \"the termination of a country's TPS designation is a possibility beneficiaries must always expect.\"",
      "Haiti's TPS status was initially activated in 2010 after the catastrophic earthquake and has been extended multiple times, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Gang violence has displaced 1.3 million people across Haiti as the local government and international community struggle with the spiraling crisis, according to a report from the International Organization for Migration. There has been a 24% increase in displaced people since December, with gunmen having chased 11% of Haiti's nearly 12 million inhabitants from their home, the report said.",
      "In May, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to strip Temporary Protected Status from 350,000 Venezuelans, potentially exposing them to deportation. The order put on hold a ruling from a federal judge in San Francisco that kept the legal protections in place.",
      "The judge's decision in New York also comes on the heels of the Trump administration revoking legal protections for thousands of Haitians who arrived legally in the U.S. through a humanitarian parole program."

      "Spoilers ahead for \u201cThe Bear\u201d Season 4.",
      "So, did Carmy (Jeremy Allen White) and the rest of the crew get that Michelin star, or what? Well, the answer, like all things \u201cThe Bear,\u201d is equal parts heartwarming, soul-stirring and frustratingly chaotic.",
      "Before Season 4 dropped, Tina (Lisa Col\u00f3n-Zayas) visited TODAY with Jenna and Friends and said that the season goes \u201cmuch deeper\u201d with the themes of \u201cpersonal responsibility and reckoning,\u201d guaranteeing more of the show\u2019s heightened restaurant-kitchen anxiety that is now a trademark of the show.",
      "\u201cDoomsday could be coming,\u201d she said in a spoiler-free preview, before adding, \u201cI\u2019m not saying it is, because I\u2019m not saying that.\u201d",
      "On June 25, all 10 episodes of Season 4 dropped on Hulu/FX, and if you\u2019re like me, you\u2019ve binged every moment in rapid succession, much like sandwich orders coming through the gang\u2019s long-abandoned ticket machine.",
      "Now we know what Col\u00f3n-Zayas meant: the future could be doomsday, or it could be exactly what all of our characters \u2014 especially Carmine \u201cCarmy\u201d Berzatto \u2014  need to survive and finally thrive.",
      "We\u2019ve reached the end of another season full of marinara and mayhem, and here\u2019s where our main players stand after Episode 10, \u201cGoodbye.\u201d",
      "Sydney now knows Carmy\u2019s plans",
      "The episode opens on Sydney (Ayo Edebiri) resting her head against a fence in obvious frustration behind the restaurant. The following half hour and change is what is called a bottle episode, in that it unfolds on one set. Just like the tension that follows, the entire episode stews in this alleyway amongst the dumpsters.",
      "Carmy enters and notes that Syd has pretty much ignored him all night.",
      "\u201cYou good?\u201d Carmy asks. (No, she is not good.)",
      "At the end of Episode 9, after we find out Marcus has won Best New Chef from Food and Wine, Sydney finally found out from Pete (Chris Witaske) the exact terms of the updated partnership agreement she has avoided signing this season. Carmy wants to sign away his ownership of the restaurant, turning over The Bear to Uncle Jimmy (Oliver Platt), Natalie \u201cSugar\u201d (Abby Elliott) and Syd.",
      "As one would expect, Syd feels blind-sided, particularly after choosing her love for The Bear over her partnership with Adam Shapiro in Episode 8. Now, she\u2019s ready to hash things out with Carmy.",
      "Yes, Carmy does actually want to leave The Bear",
      "It seems almost unbelievable that, after all this effort and at such a crucial time for the health of this very family-oriented business, that the restaurant's main driving Berzatto would want to leave, but there have been clues into Carmy's intentions all season.",
      "First is Carmy\u2019s actual efforts to heal some wounds, especially with Claire (Molly Gordon), his on-and-off (and maybe on again) girlfriend he fell out with thanks to a locked walk-in \u2014 and truly cruel admission \u2014 at the end of Season 2. He\u2019s also timidly starting talking to his mother Donna (Jamie Lee Curtis) again.",
      "Also, he\u2019s seemed distant all season long; changes to the menu that would normally set this character on a roller coaster of screams and epithets were met with an eerie calm.",
      "When he had no notes for Syd\u2019s scallop dish, it felt like his work mentoring her was done \u2014 but neither her nor the audience picked up on it until now.",
      "Sydney and Carmy fight over The Bear's future",
      "\u201cCan I actually just not hear you talk for one f---ing second?\u201d Syd says as she attempts to smoke a cigarette, something our white t-shirted hero points out she does not usually do. She takes a trembling drag anyway.",
      "Carmy tries to explain his thinking behind leaving the restaurant. First, he plans on staying on until the restaurant is financially viable, something it is very much isn\u2019t at this juncture.",
      "Nearly 1,440 hours \u2014 or two months \u2014 have passed on the clock Uncle Jimmy set up to show when he would stop funneling money into the restaurant, leading its employees to subsist solely on profit, which we\u2019ve repeatedly been shown does not exist.",
      "The chaos \u2014 both in action and the recently-shelved chaos menu of old \u2014 has led to the debt, in Carmy\u2019s opinion.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have anything to draw on, I don\u2019t have anything to pull from,\u201d Carmy says. \u201cI was trying to put hurdles in the way.\u201d",
      "Syd lists many of the issues Carmy has: tensions with family, shaky mental health, non-existent stress management, anger issues and more, and he fully agrees with her. Carmy also reveals that he knew Syd was considering leaving for Shapiro\u2019s new venture, but says he understands that, too, because of all of his issues.",
      "Carmy thinks Syd, with her natural leadership, love of cuisine and her empathy, is the true future of the restaurant and she finally begins to see where he\u2019s coming from, at least a little bit.",
      "\u201cI believe in you more than I\u2019ve ever believed in myself,\u201d he says, and she asks why. \u201cBecause you\u2019re The Bear.\u201d",
      "The conversation devolves into screaming once again when Carmy says that Syd doesn\u2019t need him.",
      "\u201cI know I don\u2019t need you but that\u2019s not the point,\u201d Syd says through tears at someone she considers her partner. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be here.\u201d",
      "Richie joins the argument and gets a promotion",
      "Richie (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) hears all the shouting outside and enters the scene. He misunderstands when Syd says Carmy is leaving at first, just thinking he\u2019s leaving early after closing.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s leaving the f---ing restaurant,\u201d Syd clarifies.",
      "Richie is shocked at Carmy \u201cretiring,\u201d saying he\u2019s \u201cf---ing 12,\u201d and accusing him of being on drugs. This whole season, Richie has been dealing with his feelings about belonging: his acceptance of another father figure in his young daughter\u2019s life, mistakes he\u2019s made at work and his efforts to grow.",
      "They fight and Carmy blurts out that he went to his brother Mikey\u2019s (Jon Bernthal) funeral \u2014 everyone thought he had skipped it, but the audience found out that he did when Uncle Lee (Bob Odenkirk) said he saw him earlier in the season.",
      "Carmy and Richie have a heart to heart: Richie thought Carmy wasn\u2019t at the funeral out of anger and resentment at him for not figuring Mikey out. Carmy says that he was actually jealous of Richie and Mikey\u2019s relationship.",
      "\u201cYou were like, inside my family,\u201d Carmy says.",
      "Richie also admits he resented Carmy for his abilities, even disclosing that he purchased a fine dining cookbook, \u201cThe French Laundry\u201d written by Season 3 cameo\u2019s Thomas Keller. Carmy is impressed, even though Richie calls the book \u201cdemented,\u201d and after a beat, the main reason of this shocking departure is succinctly explained.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m like, Richie,\u201d Carmy says. \u201cLike, outside of the kitchen.\u201d",
      "Richie becomes part owner of The Bear and Sugar gets read in",
      "Sydney finally agrees to Carmy\u2019s terms, but has one addition: that Richie also becomes part owner of The Bear.",
      "\u201cUpdated partnership terms,\u201d Sydney says. \u201cOne side Jimmy, and the other side me, Nat and Richie.\u201d",
      "Richie doesn\u2019t believe it at first, thinking it was just a kind gesture, but Syd is serious, saying it\u2019s what she needs and Carmy accepts the update to the updated terms.",
      "\u201cF--- yes, Chef Sydney, it is a f---ing honor,\u201d he says. \u201cIn my official capacity as partner, I do have one question though, how the f--- do we keep this place open?\u201d",
      "Sugar then enters, and Richie tells her that Carmy went to Mikey\u2019s funeral. Rather than yell like everyone else, she wordlessly hugs her brother, bursting into tears. Cut to the empty restaurant, where the clock ticks away to zero.",
      "It\u2019s been an emotional rollercoaster with these four, who all delivered performances in this episode we'll likely see clipped come next Emmy awards season.",
      "FX has renewed \"The Bear\" for a fifth season, so Syd, Carmy, Richie and Sugar will leave that alleyway soon enough toward an uncertain future. Just like our sweet, swearing and sweaty faves, though, we\u2019re just going to have to live in tension until those episodes drop."

      "Who Are Huda and Jeremiah, and What Happened With Them on \u2018Love Island USA\u2019?",
      "This interview has been edited for clarity.",
      "So how involved are you on the production side of things? Do you get to decide when new bombshells are coming in, when to change up the rules for Casa, like we did this year?",
      "No, I just hear about things maybe a couple days beforehand. Or, you know, of course, if there\u2019s something that\u2019s planned way in advance, I\u2019ll hear about it, and I can say, \u201cWow, I love that.\u201d Or, \u201cHmm, I\u2019m not sure about that,\u201d but it doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m not in charge.",
      "Let\u2019s talk about Nic and Olandria. Do you think we\u2019ll be seeing a return of them later this season? I know on \u201cAftersun,\u201d you mentioned that you saw some chemistry between them.",
      "Yeah, I think the chemistry, when you watch that kiss in Soul Ties, was palpable from watching it on the screen. When they said that they didn\u2019t feel any sparks, I was very confused because I feel like I saw sparks. That being said, you know, I think, honestly, I just want both of them to find whatever it is that they\u2019re looking for. And I\u2019m so happy that whatever it took to get Olandria a little bit away from thinking about Taylor, I think is a positive.",
      "I mean, that being said, I love Cierra and Nic together, so I don\u2019t want to speak ill of that relationship, because I think that is a really good relationship, too. But you know, who knows? You never know what\u2019s going to happen day to day in that villa. Things happen so fast.",
      "What do you think about some of the other couples on the show, like Chelley and Ace, and Zak and Amaya?",
      "I mean, I feel like Chelley and Ace, they took so long to actually couple up, which was interesting, because I felt like they had had this flirtation for so long, but you know, watching the episode with the heart-rate challenge, you see that Chelley still wants to remain open to Chris, so that\u2019s going to be interesting. I feel like Ace might be getting a little bit of a taste of his own medicine there, because he was really putting on the pressure when Chelley was with Austin. And now Chelley\u2019s with Ace, and Chris is putting on the pressure, so he feel knows what it feels like to be on the other side of that.",
      "Amaya and Zach. I think they\u2019re so cute. I love getting to see these little moments of them talk about cats or, you know, hula hooping in Casa. I just love the slice-of-life moments in the villa that we get to see because to me, that\u2019s when you really get to see what everyone\u2019s like around each other. So I hope we get to see more of that and more of them as well.",
      "Let\u2019s talk about the virality of it all. \u201cLove Island\u201d has been blowing up absolutely everywhere. Do you see these viral moments as they\u2019re happening, or are you just as surprised as we are?",
      "I mean, I watch all the episodes, of course, and then you never know what\u2019s going to gain traction online, what\u2019s going to be something that people really connect with. And so with the \u201cmommy-mamacita\u201d moment, I feel like watching the episode, I thought that was a hilarious moment, but then when it took on a life of its own online, it made it even more fun. And I feel like I\u2019m constantly reposting people doing that audio now, because it\u2019s just too funny.",
      "Megan Thee Stallion came on the show! Let\u2019s talk about that iconic and surprising collaboration, as well as whether any other influential figures might be fans of the show.",
      "It\u2019s funny, because I feel like every year, we find more and more influential figures that are big fans. Or, even right now, with Olivia Rodrigo and Ed Sheeran doing the \u201cLove Island\u201d audio \u2014 I\u2019m pretty sure Ed Sheeran communicates via email, so he probably does not watch \u201cLove Island USA\u201d \u2014 but to have Olivia explaining to him what is \u201cLove Island USA,\u201d to me, is a moment that I wish I could be a fly on the wall for because I can only imagine how funny that is. And Megan Thee Stallion, is someone I\u2019ve been a huge fan of for a very long time. I\u2019ve gone to see her live performing so many times, and getting to meet her, she is an absolute delight of a person. She has the most beautiful energy, and I\u2019m in love with her.",
      "Viewers didn\u2019t get to see the deliberation process when Hannah and Jeremiah left the villa, which Iain told us earlier was the most shocking thing he\u2019d seen all season long. What might be a little bit of the process behind that deliberation? If you heard anything, would you be able to speak on that?",
      "I wasn\u2019t in the villa that day, so I wasn\u2019t watching, you know, the monitors of what they were talking about. But considering that, it was a big moment, and when they\u2019re editing that episode and putting it together, my major guesstimation is that they really wanted to keep in other conversations that they felt were really important to the storyline. So maybe more showing him or other people talking earlier in the episode about things, and then maybe after the fact, they wanted to really be able to show more of what it was like when everyone was saying goodbye and stuff like that. And if the deliberation was redundant or boring or fairly inconsequential or not really different to what they were talking about outside of the actual deliberation, there\u2019s really no point in showing it.",
      "I know you didn\u2019t want to say earlier who you\u2019re rooting for this season, but is there a couple that maybe you\u2019re not as excited to see on your screen?",
      "I guess ... they\u2019re not a couple as of this point that I know of right now, but I am never excited to see Taylor be wishy-washy about who he wants to be in a couple with, and I\u2019m definitely never excited to see Olandria second-guess her worth. Those are two things I\u2019m never excited to see. So I am kind of hoping that she finds the right person for her and not someone who\u2019s wishy-washy about whether or not they want to be with her.",
      "What is the most shocking thing that you\u2019ve seen this season?",
      "Oh, I think Charlie\u2019s dumping was very shocking. I really did not expect that at all.",
      "Do you ever expect the dumps going in? What\u2019s the preparation process behind that?",
      "Sometimes you never really know. I feel like going in, it\u2019s a little bit of you can guess, or you can say, like, OK, I feel like I\u2019ve seen these two people become a little bit closer, but whether or not they\u2019re actually going to pick this person or that person \u2014 there\u2019s really no way to know. And it\u2019s really down to the moment, and the islanders make their decisions. And sometimes I\u2019m like, OK, that makes sense, I get it. And other times I\u2019m just completely shocked \u2014 like Charlie, for example.",
      "What\u2019s next for you?",
      "Well, I will be going back to Los Angeles, and I have a long list of things that I need to get done, and I will be back in the sandwich shop in West Hollywood. Please come see us \u2014 Something About Her \u2014 and have a sandwich. I\u2019ll be there for some time."

    "summary": "Broadway actress Jennie Harney-Fleming was singing an encore when her daughter screamed, \"I want to go home.\" The video of what happened next went viral.",
    "story": [
      "Broadway actress Jennie Harney-Fleming had just starting singing the encore at her solo concert in the New York City area when she heard a little voice yell: \"I want to go home!\"",
      "The heckler was none other than Harney-Fleming's 3-year-old daughter Olivia, who was up past her bedtime.",
      "Without missing a beat, Harney-Fleming said, \"Come here, baby. Come here, Olivia. Come to Mommy. It's too loud, I know.\"",
      "Wearing a fitted sequin dress and heels, Harney-Fleming picked Olivia up, returned to the mic and restarted the classic song \"Feeling Good.\" The video of Fleming singing the entire song while holding her daughter with one arm has garnered more than 2.7 million views on Instagram in 10 days ... plus the attention of celebrities.",
      "But in the moment, Olivia only wanted attention from one person: her mom.",
      "\"When I came back and started singing the second song, my daughter was like, 'Girl, we got to wrap this up!'\" Harney-Fleming tells TODAY.com.",
      "The concert began at 8pm and it was only an hour long, but that was way past bedtime for Olivia and her 5-year-old sister Ella. \"They did very well sitting through that show,\" Harney-Flemming shares. \"But I think my little one just reached her breaking point.\"",
      "The actress has grown used to changing plans on a dime. After all, before she played Angelica Schuyler in the Broadway company of \"Hamilton,\" she became the \"universal swing\" for the Schuyler sisters on tour in 2017. That meant that if any one of the actresses playing Angelica, Eliza or Peggy were sick in any production across the country, she would grab her suitcase of costumes, hop on a plane and perform on stage that evening.",
      "So when she heard Olivia complaining, Harney-Fleming says she  \"didn't give it a second thought. I think if we tried to deal with it any other way, she might have had a meltdown and caused a scene. I just knew what needed to be done and told her she was safe to come stay with me while I finish up the show.\"",
      "Another familiar face was on stage that evening: Olivia's father, DeWitt Fleming Jr., who was playing the drums.",
      "The actors first met \u2014 where else? \u2014 while starring in an off-Broadway show. And in late 2024, the couple enjoyed a musical dream: performing in principal roles in Broadway's \"A Wonderful World: The Louis Armstrong Musical.\" Ella and Olivia spent every Saturday hanging out with their mom and dad backstage at the theater.",
      "\"It was important for them to see Mommy and Daddy on stage,\" Harney-Fleming says. \"We feel that it's very important to keep our children in the loop of what it means when we say we're going to work.\"",
      "Theater is in the girls' blood: Harney-Fleming's father received the Tony Award for his role as Curtis Taylor, Jr. in the original production of \"Dreamgirls.\"",
      "\"He went on to have a really wonderful career, but ultimately made the decision to leave the industry, both for ministry as well as for his family,\" says Harney-Flemming. \"That really left an indelible mark on me in terms of how I move through the industry now, and how we prioritize our time and our relationships in these professional spaces.\"",
      "Many notable performers expressed support for Harney-Fleming's viral video.",
      "The original Angelica Schuyler (and fellow Broadway mom) Ren\u00e9e Elise Goldsberry wrote, \"Thank you for the master class!\"",
      "Natasha Bedingfield commented, \"I love this so much. \u2764\ufe0f Incredible mom and incredible singing.\"",
      "Holly Robinson Peete added, \"I needed this today,\" and Amy Schumer reposted the video.",
      "Questlove commented, \"I did this to my dad at MSG once in 1973 \u2026 Did not end like this lol.\"",
      "Harney-Fleming says she feels incredibly grateful for the support, and to answer the question everyone seemed to be asking: she's not sure how she sang a song with such incredible breath control while holding her daughter in one arm.",
      "\"Sometimes as a mom, you look back on your day and you're like, 'How the heck did I get all those things done?'\" she says. \"You rise to the occasion, and you don't give the workload a second thought. You just do it because it needs to be done.\""

      "The Dalai Lama said on Wednesday that the ancient Tibetan Buddhist institution he leads will live on after he dies, putting an end to speculation that he would be the last person to hold the role as he plans to reincarnate.",
      "As part of celebrations marking his 90th birthday, the Nobel Peace laureate also signalled that China, which Tibetan activists accuse of suppressing their language, culture and religion, should stay out of the process of choosing the next Dalai Lama.",
      "The 14th Dalai Lama's rare remarks came as anxiety mounts over who will follow him as the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism.",
      "\u201cI am affirming that the institution of the Dalai Lama will continue,\u201d said the Dalai Lama, who has spent almost 70 years living in exile in India after fleeing Tibet, an autonomous Himalayan region of China.",
      "\u201cI hereby reiterate that the Gaden Phodrang Trust has sole authority to recognize the future reincarnation,\u201d he said, referring to an organization he founded. \u201cNo one else has any such authority to interfere in this matter.\u201d",
      "The Chinese government responded`to the comments swiftly, with a Foreign Ministry spokesperson saying that any succession planning must comply with laws and regulations, according to Reuters.",
      "The Tibetan spiritual leader made the announcement days ahead of his 90th birthday on July 6, after a conference of representatives of the four major traditions of Tibetan Buddhism in the Indian city of Dharamsala, the seat of the Tibetan government-in-exile.",
      "It\u2019s unusual for a living Dalai Lama to talk about his successor, the search for whom begins only upon his death because it involves reincarnation. But as the 14th Dalai Lama grows older, there is growing worry that a gap in leadership could be taken advantage of by the Chinese government.",
      "\u201cI think His Holiness feels the need to reassure people by basically letting them know that he is thinking about the succession,\u201d Thupten Jinpa, his English translator of four decades, said in a phone interview from India last week.",
      "Identified as a baby in 1937, the 14th Dalai Lama was formally recognized two years later. In addition to his role as spiritual leader, he served as temporal leader of Tibet starting in 1950, when he was 15 and China began annexing the region.",
      "In 1959, when he was 23, the Dalai Lama and thousands of other Tibetans fled to India after a failed uprising against Communist rule, eventually settling in Dharamsala.",
      "Since the 1970s, the goal of the movement has shifted from Tibetan independence to achieving genuine autonomy within China. In recent years the Dalai Lama has also stepped down from his political role, which is now a democratically elected position.",
      "In March, the Dalai Lama said in a new book that his successor would be born in the \u201cfree world\u201d outside China, so that the traditional mission of the Dalai Lama could continue. According to the Central Tibetan Administration, there are about 130,000 Tibetan exiles around the world, mostly in India and Nepal.",
      "The Dalai Lama had previously said in 2011 that the institution of the Dalai Lama did not necessarily have to continue at all, and that he would leave it up to the Tibetan Buddhist community.",
      "Since then he has received appeals from a variety of constituencies, and the \u201cunanimous\u201d response, Jinpa said, has been that there should be a 15th Dalai Lama.",
      "\u201cFor the Tibetan people, his name has come to symbolize the nation,\u201d said Jinpa, who has assisted the Dalai Lama with a number of books including the recent \u201cVoice for the Voiceless.\u201d",
      "There is also concern that if they don\u2019t select a new Dalai Lama, China could name one who goes unchallenged.",
      "\u201cSadly, the PRC government probably will want to play a role, just as it inserted itself in the process of the recognition of the Panchen Lama,\u201d Jinpa said, referring to the second-highest spiritual leader in Tibetan Buddhism.",
      "In 1995, the Dalai Lama recognized a 6-year-old boy in Tibet as the 11th Panchen Lama, after the previous one died six years earlier. The boy was forcibly disappeared by the Chinese government three days later, rights groups say, and has not been seen in public since.",
      "China then chose its own Panchen Lama, imposing him on the six million people in Tibet.",
      "The Tibetan government-in-exile does not recognize the Beijing-appointed Panchen Lama, who rarely appears in public but pledged loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party in a closed-door meeting last month with President Xi Jinping, state media reported.",
      "If Beijing also tries to name a Dalai Lama, \u201cTibetans would not be surprised,\u201d Jinpa said. \u201cThey would be disappointed and annoyed, but I don\u2019t think they would be surprised.\u201d",
      "The Chinese government says Tibet has prospered under its rule, and that it has improved infrastructure and social conditions and promoted economic development. It says the Dalai Lama is \u201ca political exile engaged in separatist activities under the guise of religion,\u201d and that the reincarnation of Tibetan lamas should be controlled by Beijing.",
      "Reincarnation \u201cmust comply with Chinese laws and regulations\u201d and \u201cfollow the process that consists of search and identification in China, lot-drawing from a golden urn, and central government approval,\u201d foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said in March."

    "summary": "After unprecedented attacks on Iran, the U.S. and Israel have shifted toward an ambitious diplomatic push in the Middle East.",
    "story": [
      "TEL AVIV \u2014 As the dust settles on Iran after unprecedented Israeli and American attacks, the U.S. and Israel have shifted their focus toward an ambitious diplomatic push they hope will translate into the kind of enduring political stability that has evaded the region for decades.",
      "Despite apparent Iranian unwillingness, President Donald Trump is pushing for more talks with Tehran about its nuclear program. But Israel appears more interested in formalizing diplomatic relations with some of its long-standing adversaries, as well as ending the 18-month conflict in Gaza \u2014 which Trump has repeatedly pleaded for.",
      "\u201cThis victory presents an opportunity for a dramatic widening of peace agreements,\u201d Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement Thursday. \u201cWe are working on this with enthusiasm.\u201d",
      "The previous Trump administration brokered what it called the Abraham Accords, in which Israel established diplomatic relations with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain and later normalized its relations with Morocco in 2024 and Sudan, though that deal has yet to be ratified.",
      "Having devastated the powerful, Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon, its northern neighbor, and seen a Tehran-friendly regime toppled in Syria to the east, Israel is now interested in establishing formal diplomatic relations with both countries, Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Monday",
      "The shift represents a broader change in Israeli policy toward its neighbors. Until around two weeks ago, Israel\u2019s modus operandi was to assert military dominance as a political strategy, according to Michael Oren, who served as the country\u2019s ambassador to the U.S. from 2009 to 2013.",
      "\u201cNow it\u2019s the first time that I\u2019ve seen in history when we have the opportunity to make the strategy the strategy. It\u2019s not a tactic,\u201d Oren, a former member of Israel\u2019s Knesset, or parliament, who served as deputy minister in the prime minister\u2019s office, told NBC News in a phone call on Friday.",
      "Before the Hamas-led terror attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, Israel relied on a method known in Hebrew as \u201cmowing the grass.\u201d The term was used by strategists to describe the country\u2019s periodic attacks against Palestinian militants and their supply of weapons in Gaza, attacks that faced widespread criticism from rights groups often because of the disproportionate number of deaths caused by Israeli forces.",
      "The phrase could also apply to Israel's behavior toward Iran and its proxies in taking out military commanders, nuclear scientists and senior advisers to the country\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, while attacking nuclear and military sites. In Lebanon, it has wiped out large swaths of Hezbollah\u2019s leadership.",
      "Today, Netanyahu\u2019s most formidable challenge will be finding a resolution to end the conflict in Gaza, where, despite nearly 20 months of war, Hamas remains nominally in control.",
      "Under pressure from Trump, who on Truth Social on Sunday again called for a \u201cdeal in Gaza\u201d and to \u201cget the hostages back,\u201d the negotiations are also still captive to the same disagreements that have long delayed a deal.",
      "Hamas has refused to release its remaining hostages and surrender \u2014 key demands of far-right members of Netanyahu\u2019s government, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben Gvir, his national security minister, both of whom have threatened to quit and bring down the fragile coalition if he does otherwise. Along with other lawmakers they have also called for the complete destruction of Hamas.",
      "Hamas, meanwhile, has demanded a permanent truce, a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and guarantees about humanitarian aid.",
      "The decline of power in Iran, Hamas' primary patron, will likely sap the group\u2019s confidence and influence, according to Yohanan Plesner, the president of the Israel Democracy Institute, an independent research center.",
      "\u201cFrom an Israeli standpoint, this is a dramatic shift in the acceptance for the Jewish state in the region,\u201d added Plesner, a former member of the Israeli parliament.",
      "But he cautioned that as long as Hamas is the governing body in Gaza, a deal to end the war there \u201cwill be something that is possible but it will be very difficult for the Israeli government to swallow.\u201d",
      "For now, Israel is in the ascendancy: Iran\u2019s nuclear program has been badly damaged, its 46-year-old Islamic regime is weakened and its proxy groups and allies throughout the region have been extensively damaged.",
      "Perhaps most important is that while the Israeli and U.S. attacks on Iran were publicly criticized, they were also quietly welcomed by its Arab neighbors, many of whom were quicker to condemn Iran\u2019s reprisal attack on the U.S. military base in Qatar than the American attack on Iran.",
      "For decades Iran has fostered allied regimes and proxy militia throughout the Middle East in order to fight Israel, its major ally in the region, the United States, and Shiite-majority Iran\u2019s adversaries among the Sunni-led Gulf kingdoms.",
      "Israel will now need those states to blaze a path toward an enduring peace, analysts said, or risk inflaming regional conflict even more.",
      "\u201cI think we see imperial Iran is in retreat,\u201d Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, an associate professor of political science at the United Arab Emirates University in Al Ain, said in a phone interview last week. \u201cIt probably means a more stable Middle East, a more stable region.\u201d",
      "Israel and the United States would do better to cultivate what Abdullah described as an \u201cAxis of Moderation\u201d of monied Gulf Arab kingdoms, many of whom have normalized relations with Israel \u2014 a play on the \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d used to describe Iran and its regional proxy groups that Israel has largely defeated.",
      "Israel has nonetheless made clear its intention to continue attacking Iran\u2019s nuclear program should a perceived need arise. And in Gaza and Lebanon, it has continued to launch regular strikes against what it says are militant targets long after ceasefires were put in place.",
      "But Trump, whose angry outburst appeared to rein in an Israeli strike on Iran after he declared a ceasefire in the region, has shown he is capable of halting Israel\u2019s responses. Oren said this could help pave the way toward lasting stability by restraining Israel\u2019s more militant instincts.",
      "\u201cThe difference between tactics and strategy is in the hands of Donald Trump,\u201d Oren said. \u201cTo the greatest extent in Israel\u2019s history, our fate is in the hands of one person, and it\u2019s not the prime minister.\u201d"

    "summary": "Foxes have been digging burrows and leaving their droppings at the site of Google's new headquarters in London's King's Cross neighborhood.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Google's much-hyped new U.K. headquarters in London's King's Cross neighborhood hasn't opened yet, but it's already drawn some unexpected attention from locals.",
      "Local foxes, that is.",
      "The building, which is under construction, has been nicknamed the \"landscraper\" because it spans 1,082 feet wide and 11 floors tall.",
      "Created by British designer Thomas Heatherwick, it will reportedly be completed later this year and cost the tech giant upwards of \u00a31 billion ($1.3 billion). Construction began in 2017. It is anticipated to eventually house up to 7,000 Google employees.",
      "For now, however, some of the more frequent visitors might be the foxes that have been digging burrows in the manicured grounds and leaving their droppings behind on the building's nearly 1,000-foot-long rooftop garden.",
      "\u201cFox sightings at construction sites are pretty common, and our King\u2019s Cross development is no exception,\u201d a Google spokesperson told NBC News. But, the person added, \u201cWhile foxes have been occasionally spotted at the site, their appearances have been brief and have had minimal impact on the ongoing construction.\u201d",
      "NBC News spoke to nearly two dozen construction workers at the construction site, where a cacophony of noise from the drilling and hammering filled the streets as dust dispersed into the air. But when asked whether they had seen any foxes, most refused to comment, citing nondisclosure agreements.",
      "One worker, who requested anonymity due to the NDA, told NBC News, \u201cPersonally, I haven\u2019t seen one, but there are so many open entrances to the building I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it had gotten inside.\u201d",
      "Still, Kareen Mascerenhas, 25, who works at a store directly across from the construction site, said she had spotted a fox last winter. \u201cI was shutting the store when I saw one just run past that side and in there,\u201d she said, pointing to Google\u2019s construction.",
      "But any sightings of the bushy-tailed vulpines feel neither rare nor unique in a city where the number of foxes soars between 10,000 and 15,000, accounting for nearly 16 foxes per square mile.",
      "Around the country, their population ebbs and flows depending on the season, from 150,000 in the winter to around 400,000 during cub season, according to Terry Woods, who founded the fox removal company Fox-a-Gon, which advocates for the humane treatment of the animals.",
      "For decades, foxes have also captured the British imagination, appearing as the sly character Mr. Tod in Beatrix Potter's novels, and in Roald Dahl's \"Fantastic Mr. Fox.\" And most recently, one even served as a memorable symbol for the \u201chot priest\u201d in the hit television show \"Fleabag\" by Phoebe Waller-Bridge.",
      "Though they are often seen boldly trotting along sidewalks and rummaging through residential bins, foxes have also roused strong reactions from onlookers, ranging from adoration to outright resentment.",
      "\u201cThey may appear cuddly and romantic, but foxes are also a pest and a menace, particularly in our cities,\u201d former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told BBC News in 2013, then as the mayor of London, when a fox horrified the British public after biting off a baby\u2019s finger.",
      "For years, foxes perfectly concealed their identity as the main culprits behind hundreds of cat mutilations in the south London suburb of Croydon, where the grisly carcasses strewn across streets and backyards led distressed residents to suspect that a deranged cat killer was on the loose until police realized what was happening in 2018.",
      "While some residents cherish their presence, hoping to charm the typically contact-averse creatures by trying to feed them, a series of British wildlife laws also gives foxes the protection and freedom to roam the United Kingdom\u2019s cities endlessly.",
      "\u201cFoxes are quite popular around this area; they are just virtually everywhere,\u201d said 31-year-old Ode Tomitoba, who works at the King\u2019s Cross Visitors Center.",
      "For Hanei Mokenen, 23, who manages a restaurant in King\u2019s Cross, news of the latest fox incursion came by way of a TikTok video.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s King\u2019s Cross, anything can happen here,\u201d he said about the bustling commercial neighborhood in Central London, adding that he had occasionally seen a fox running around the area.",
      "But their stealth around the giant Google edifice had nonetheless taken Mokenen by surprise. \u201cHow the hell did they get inside? Security is strong in this area; it\u2019s not a place where you can just walk around,\u201d he said.",
      "The foxes\u2019 newfound home at Google\u2019s offices isn\u2019t the first time the animals have made themselves comfortable in London\u2019s skyscrapers. In 2011, a fox called Romeo was discovered living in The Shard, surviving on the food scraps left by construction workers.",
      "\u201cIt is a fairly common occurrence with the creatures being so adaptable,\u201d said Woods from Fox-a-Gon, who helped remove Romeo from the site by capturing him safely and releasing him back into the urban jungle.",
      "\u201cThey are such an adaptable animal that they can survive almost anywhere and overcome great hardships,\u201d he added."

      "Extreme temperatures soared across Europe on Wednesday as several countries issued heat alerts, with a Swiss power company shutting down one of its reactor units, France partially closing the Eiffel Tower and two people in Spain dying in a heat wave.",
      "In Switzerland, energy company Axpo shut down one of the reactor units at its Beznau nuclear power plant because of high water temperature in the River Aare. The plant, which typically takes cooling water from the river for use before returning it, is prevented from doing so by Swiss regulations when temperatures reach 25 degrees Celsius (77 degrees Fahrenheit) or higher to avoid causing damage to aquatic fauna and flora.",
      "\u201cDue to the high river water temperatures, Axpo has been increasingly reducing the output of the two reactor units at the Beznau nuclear power plant for days,\u201d the company said in a statement Wednesday, adding that one unit was currently operating at 50% capacity.",
      "In France, the national weather service Wednesday issued a rare red alert in four regions where the heat wave was expected to last until 9 p.m. local time (3 p.m. ET).",
      "In Paris, officials said the Eiffel Tower's top level would remain closed to visitors because of the current heat wave. According to its website, rising temperatures cause the puddled iron of the tower to expand in size and tilt slightly, but without causing any impact to its structural integrity.",
      "French Environment Minister Agn\u00e8s Pannier-Runacher said at a news conference Wednesday that firefighters had responded to more than 300 weather-related emergencies.",

      "In a separate post on X, Catalonia\u2019s civil protection services said Wednesday that it was still working to extinguish the fire that was ablaze in three different areas and warned of a \u201chigh risk of forest fires\u201d in two more.",
      "Spain recorded its hottest June to date with temperatures passing 40 C (104 F) in some of its cities Tuesday.",
      "In the United Kingdom, the national weather service said last month's mean temperature of 16.9 C (62\u00b0F) was the second warmest June recorded in the country since record keeping began in 1884.",
      "Studies have shown that climate change is increasing the frequency, intensity and duration of heat waves around the world. As the world continues to warm, these extremes are expected to compound, according to the World Meteorological Organization.",
      "Europe is the world\u2019s fastest-warming continent, according to the European Union\u2019s Copernicus Climate Change Service, which said the region is heating up at twice the global average speed.",
      "On Monday, the United Nation\u2019s human rights chief, Volker Turk, said the heat wave underscored the need for climate adaptation by moving away from fossil fuels, the main cause of climate change, according to the U.N.\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.",
      "\u201cRising temperatures, rising seas, floods, droughts, and wildfires threaten our rights to life, to health, to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment, and much more,\u201d Turk said.",
      "Other European countries also felt the sweltering effects.",
      "The Italian Health Ministry issued heat wave red alerts for 16 cities, including Rome and Milan. In 13 regions, including Lombardy and Emilia, people were advised not to venture outdoors for work during the hottest periods of the day.",
      "Two people in the country died from separate heat-related causes, including a 47-year-old working on a construction site near Bologna.",
      "In Turkey, wildfires burned for a second day and more than 50,000 people were evacuated by rescuers Wednesday, according to the AFAD emergency management authority.",
      "The blistering temperatures were caused by a \u201cheat dome,\u201d a high-pressure system that stalled over western Europe, trapping hot air from northern Africa over the region \u2014 akin to a lid on a pot of boiling water. Heat domes can linger for days or weeks, driving up heat and humidity for extended periods of time."

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates \u2014 Iran\u2019s president on Wednesday reportedly ordered the country to suspend its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency after American airstrikes hit its most-important nuclear facilities.",
      "State media online reported the decision by President Masoud Pezeshkian.",
      "It follows a law passed by Iran\u2019s parliament to suspend that cooperation. It also already received the OK of a constitutional watchdog as well.",
      "It wasn\u2019t immediately clear what that would mean for the IAEA, the United Nations\u2019 nuclear watchdog.",
      "The Vienna-based IAEA long has monitored Iran\u2019s nuclear program. The agency didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "After the law\u2019s passage, Iran\u2019s Supreme National Security Council was to oversee the bill and implementation. While the council itself hasn\u2019t said anything publicly, Pezeshkian is the head of the council, so his reported order signals that the bill would be implemented.",
      "However, under Iran\u2019s theocractic government, there is room for the council to implement the bill as they see fit. That means that everything lawmakers asked for might not be done.",
      "Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, negotiated under then U.S. President Barack Obama, allowed Iran to enrich uranium to 3.67% \u2014 enough to fuel a nuclear power plant, but far below the threshold of 90% needed for weapons-grade uranium. It also drastically reduced Iran\u2019s stockpile of uranium, limited its use of centrifuges and relied on the IAEA to oversee Tehran\u2019s compliance through additional oversight.",
      "But U.S. President Donald Trump, in his first term in 2018, unilaterally withdrew Washington from the accord, insisting it wasn\u2019t tough enough and didn\u2019t address Iran\u2019s missile program or its support for militant groups in the wider Middle East. That set in motion years of tensions, including attacks at sea and on land.",
      "Iran had been enriching up to 60%, a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels. It also has enough of a stockpile to build multiple nuclear bombs, should it choose to do so. Iran has long insisted its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, but the IAEA, Western intelligence agencies and others say Tehran had an organized weapons program up until 2003."

      "LONDON \u2014 It was not her best goal or most important soccer match, but when the ball hit the back of the net in Natalie Washington's debut on a women's team in 2017, she felt a sense of belonging that had been missing.",
      "It was long in coming: Washington had struggled to fit in on a men's team and eventually stopped playing when she decided to transition to being a woman and go through gender-affirming surgery. When she joined a women's team, she quickly felt accepted.",
      "Now, after the United Kingdom's highest court in April said that for anti-discrimination purposes the terms \"woman\" and \"man\" refer to biological sex, Washington's opportunity to play the sport she loves in the league she wants is in doubt.",
      "The head of the U.K's Equality and Human Rights Commission followed the ruling a day later by saying the court had provided clarity and that transgender women would be excluded from women-only spaces such as toilets, single-sex hospital wards and sports teams.",

      "\"It feels like things are being taken away from trans people on an almost daily basis,\" Washington said. \"It's another blow, another kick at a time when people are already hurting.\"",
      "Long a divisive issue",
      "Beyond Britain, inclusion of trans players in sports has long been a divisive issue, with arguments primarily focused on whether it's fair to have athletes born as boys compete against girls and women. In the U.S., it has been particularly politicized, with most Republican-controlled states banning transgender athletes in girls' sports and President Donald Trump signing an executive order to prohibit participation of transgender athletes from girls' and women's sports.",
      "The U.K. court said trans people were still protected from discrimination under British law, such as in employment, housing and education, but the ruling means access to certain single-sex facilities could be curtailed.",
      "Trans rights groups condemned the decision, which is likely to have a profound effect for thousands. Out of some 66 million people in England, Scotland and Wales, about 116,000 identified as trans in the latest census count.",
      "The feminist groups who led the legal challenge cheered the ruling and others, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer, welcomed the clarity it brought.",
      "\"Everyone knows what sex is and you can't change it,\" said Susan Smith, co-director of For Women Scotland, which brought the case.",
      "A difficult decision",
      "Washington, who leads the group Football v Transphobia, was one of 28 transgender women registered with the Football Association to play amateur soccer. In order to play the women's game, they had to have testosterone levels reduced to the range of biologically born females.",
      "After the ruling, the organization changed its rules, saying that although it had aimed to make soccer accessible to as many people as possible, it was always prepared to alter its policy if there were changes in the law or science.",
      "\"We understand that this will be difficult for people who simply want to play the game they love in the gender by which they identify,\" the FA said, adding that it would contact transgender women currently playing to explain the changes and how they can remain involved.",
      "Some clubs have responded by finding ways around the ban. Goal Diggers FC, a women and nonbinary inclusive soccer club based in London, has withdrawn from all FA-affiliated leagues.",
      "On June 1, the day the ban took effect, Goal Diggers hosted an inclusive women's tournament in London, drawing more than 100 players in a show of solidarity.",
      "\"I'll always have a place here and I'll always be a trans woman,\" said Billie Sky, a 28-year-old trans player for Goal Diggers. \"No one can take that away from me.\"",
      "Other voices, other sports",
      "Groups that have campaigned to keep trans athletes from girls' and women's teams, citing a matter of safety and fairness, welcomed the move by the FA.",
      "\"The FA had ample evidence of the harms to women and girls caused by its nonsensical policy of letting men who identify as women play in women's teams,\" said Fiona McAnena of Sex Matters.",
      "Groups that oversee cricket and netball, an offshoot of basketball that is played mainly by women, also limited women's competition to those who were assigned at birth as females.",
      "The England and Wales Cricket Board said transgender women and girls could continue playing in open and mixed cricket. England Netball said it would allow anyone to play in a new mixed category beginning in September.",
      "How the ruling came about",
      "The legal case involved a 2018 Scottish law requiring at least half of the seats on public boards to be held by women. Trans women with certificates recognizing their gender were to be included in meeting the quota.",
      "The court said that using the certificates to identify someone's gender clashes with the definitions of man and woman. Under the ruling, a transgender person could not claim they had been discriminated against if barred from a single-sex space.",
      "Alexander Maine, a senior lecturer at The City Law School specializing in gender, sexuality and law, said the ruling clouds the value of a document sanctioned by the U.K. Gender Recognition Act that allows them to later update their birth certificate reflecting their acquired gender.",
      "\"There may be a challenge at the European Court of Human Rights brought by trans individuals who say that there is a problem where they may be two sexes at once,\" Maine said.",
      "Someone could hold \"a gender recognition certificate stating that they are their acquired gender, whereas under the U.K. Equality Act, they are still recognized in their birth gender,\" he said.",
      "Washington and many others say they worry the ruling may lead to more hatred aimed at trans people.",
      "\"For the first time in a long time, I felt scared about how people are going to react to me in public,\" Washington said. \"I don't feel anymore that I can guarantee I have support to turn to from authorities.\""

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/world/asia/thailand-prime-minister-suspended-leaked-phone-call-cambodia-official-rcna216151",
    "published": "Tue, 01 Jul 2025 08:26:09 GMT",
    "summary": "A Thai court suspended Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra from office Tuesday pending investigation over a leaked phone call with a senior Cambodian leader.",
    "story": [
      "BANGKOK \u2014 Thailand's Constitutional Court suspended Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra on Tuesday, pending an ethics investigation over accusations that she was too deferential to a senior Cambodian leader when the two discussed a recent border dispute in a phone call that was leaked.",
      "Paetongtarn has faced growing dissatisfaction over her handling of the dispute, which involved an armed confrontation on May 28, in which one Cambodian soldier was killed. In a call with Cambodian Senate President Hun Sen, she attempted to defuse tensions \u2014 but instead set off a string of complaints and public protests by critics who accused her of being too fawning.",
      "Familiar pattern",
      "Paetongtarn's suspension raises the possibility of renewed instability in Thailand, a still fragile democracy that has suffered several similar bouts of uncertainty. At the root of much of that were concerns from the conservative establishment, including the military, that the political dynasty started by Paetongtarn's father, the popular but divisive former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, was growing too powerful.",
      "She is the third member of her family to hold the prime minister's office \u2014 and the third to face the possibility of removal before her term ended. Thaksin was removed from office in a 2006 coup and driven into exile, while his sister, former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawtra, was removed by a court order in 2014, followed shortly after by a coup.",
      "This \"recurring cycle of political instability\" would likely keep repeating unless Thailand goes through a genuine democratic reform that includes limiting power of unelected institutions, said Purawich Watanasukh, a political science lecturer at Thammasat University in Bangkok.",
      "\"Without such foundational reforms, any government, regardless of who leads it, will remain vulnerable to the same forces that have repeatedly disrupted Thailand's democratic development,\" he said.",
      "Growing discontent",
      "The suspension also comes at a time when the country is facing an economic slowdown and growing discontent with Paetongtarn and her Pheu Thai party, in general, with critics saying her government's performance has been underwhelming.",
      "The judges voted unanimously Tuesday to review the petition accusing her of a breach of the ethics, and voted 7-2 to immediately suspend her from duty as a prime minister until a ruling is given. The court gave Paetongtarn 15 days to give evidence to support her case.",
      "After the court order, Paetongtarn said that she would accept the process and defended her actions.",
      "\"I only thought about what to do to avoid troubles, what to do to avoid armed confrontation, for the soldiers not to suffer any loss,\" she said.",
      "She also apologized to people upset over the leaked call and left the Government House shortly after.",
      "Suriya Jungrungruangkit, who is a deputy prime minister and a transport minister, will take charge as acting prime minister, said Chousak Sirinil, minister of the prime minister's office.",
      "Earlier Tuesday, before the court suspended Paetongtarn, King Maha Vajiralongkorn had endorsed a Cabinet reshuffle after a major party left the government coalition over the leaked call.",
      "In the reshuffle, Paetongtarn also received the position of culture minister, in addition to prime minister, though it's not clear if she can take the oath to take up that role.",
      "In the call about the border tensions, Paetongtarn could be heard urging Hun Sen \u2014 a longtime friend of her father \u2014 not to listen to a Thai regional army commander who had publicly criticized Cambodia about the border dispute, and called him \"an opponent.\"",
      "Thousands of conservative, nationalist-leaning protesters rallied in central Bangkok on Saturday to demand Paetongtarn's resignation.",
      "Paetongtarn also faces separate investigations by another agency over the leaked call \u2014 a case that could also lead to her removal.",
      "The Constitutional Court last year removed Paetongtarn's predecessor over a breach of ethics. Thailand's courts, especially the Constitutional Court, are viewed as a defender of the royalist establishment, which has used them and nominally independent agencies such as the Election Commission to cripple or sink political opponents.",
      "Fallout from leaked call",
      "Paetongtarn, 38, is the youngest daughter of Thaksin. Her father has remained beloved by many of the Thailand's poor and working classes who long saw him as their champion.",
      "But the family's political fortunes now may be on the wane.",
      "Thaksin alienated many of his supporters with what looked like a self-serving deal with his former conservative opponents. It allowed his return from exile in 2023 and the party he supported to form the new government, while sidelining the progressive Move Forward Party, which finished first in a national election, but was seen by the conservative establishment as a greater threat.",
      "Thaksin has faced several legal challenges since his return. On Tuesday, he attended a court hearing in a case alleging he defamed the monarchy in 2015.",
      "He also is under investigation over the handling of his return to face an eight-year prison term on charges related to corruption and abuse of power. At the time, he was transferred almost immediately to a hospital, and later granted clemency because of his age and health without spending a single night in jail.",
      "The complaints argue he avoided properly serving his sentence and raise the possibility that Thaksin could be forced to serve prison time."
