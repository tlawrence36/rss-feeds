      "A cutting-edge nighttime show at Disneyland Paris is heralding a bold new chapter for Europe\u2019s most-visited theme park",
      "CHESSY, France -- A cutting-edge nighttime show at Disneyland Paris is heralding a bold new chapter for Europe\u2019s most-visited theme park, as a raft of ambitious developments comes to fruition under a 2 billion euro ($2.05 billion) expansion plan.",
      "The overhaul includes the completed revamp of the luxury Disneyland Hotel, the upcoming renaming and doubling in size of Walt Disney Studios Park, and the much-anticipated arrival of The World of Frozen and a first-of-its-kind The Lion King land \u2014 cementing the resort\u2019s gains after the wilderness years for theme parks during the pandemic.",
      "Disney Tales of Magic was unveiled this month. It's a dazzling 20-minute spectacle blending drones, synchronized fountains, high-definition projections and ultra-bright lasers.",
      "\u201cFor the very first time, not only will we be projecting onto Sleeping Beauty\u2019s Castle, but also Main Street USA,\u201d said Tim Lutkin, artistic director of the production, referring to the park\u2019s main commercial artery lined with boutiques and merchandise.",
      "The show\u2019s standout feature \u2014 ultra-bright lasers \u2014 has been used only once before, at the Paris 2024 Olympics at the Eiffel Tower during the iconic opening ceremony that featured a performance with Celine Dion. The lasers, which travel 23 miles (37 kilometers), deliver extraordinary power while remaining safe near crowds.",
      "\u201cThe Paris Olympics used it first. But we saw it first,\u201d said Dana Harrel, executive entertainment director at Disneyland Paris.",
      "Featuring Disney and Pixar tales brought to life by drone-made 3D figures, synchronized fountains and a 100-piece orchestra, the show is elevated further by the original anthem \u201cLive in Magic.\u201d",
      "Audiences have been awestruck. \u201cIt\u2019s marvelous. We\u2019ve never seen such a beautiful light show,\u201d said Sacha Tellier, a 33-year-old mother visiting with her family. \u201cIt gave me goosebumps,\u201d added Nathan Ruiz, a graphic designer from Madrid. \u201cThe combination of music, lights, and the drones felt like pure magic. I\u2019ve been to Disney before, but this show is on another level.\u201d",
      "The spectacle also reflects Disney\u2019s storytelling evolution. Lutkin noted the shift from classic ballgown tales to modern narratives like \u201cEncanto\u201d and \u201cInside Out 2,\u201d which delves into deeper themes such as anxiety and depression. The latter\u2019s unexpected box office success, Lutkin said, proved that \u201cthe world and its relationship with Disney are ready to embrace more complex stories.\u201d This shift is mirrored in the show\u2019s selection of movies, spanning Disney\u2019s timeless classics and emotionally resonant modern hits.",
      "At the heart of Disneyland Paris\u2019 expansion is the transformation of Walt Disney Studios Park, doubling in size and reimagined as Disney Adventure World. Opening in spring 2025, a new park entrance, World Premiere, will greet visitors with the glamour of a Hollywood film premiere, leading them into immersive themed areas.",
      "\u201cThese projects reflect our commitment to innovation and storytelling,\u201d said Natacha Rafalski, head of Disneyland Paris, adding that they will further strengthen it as Europe\u2019s top tourist destination.",
      "Already Europe\u2019s most-visited theme park and France\u2019s top tourist attraction outdrawing the Louvre, Disneyland Paris welcomed over 10 million visitors in 2023.",
      "The expansion includes two eagerly awaited themed lands. The World of Frozen, debuting in 2026, will transport guests to Arendelle with a central lake hosting water performances and the Frozen Ever After boat ride, alongside themed dining, shopping, and accommodations. Meanwhile, The Lion King land will bring the Pride Lands to life with a log flume cascading from Pride Rock and encounters with beloved characters like Simba and Timon.",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic delivered one the toughest challenges to Disneyland Paris, as with all resort parks around the world, forcing an eight-month closure in 2020 and another in 2021.",
      "But Disney doubled down.",
      "The ongoing \u20ac2 billion expansion is part of a $60 billion global investment announced in September 2023, aiming to redefine Disney parks, cruises and attractions over the next decade.",
      "A centerpiece of the Paris overhaul is the revamped Disneyland Hotel, with suites themed around classic Disney royalty.",
      "Disneyland Paris opened in 1992 under its original name, Euro Disney Resort. Situated just outside Paris in Marne-la-Vall\u00e9e, it marked Disney\u2019s first foray into Europe. However, the park\u2019s early years were fraught with challenges, including cultural missteps, financial struggles and lower-than-expected visitor numbers. Critics in France derided it as an American cultural invasion, dubbing it a \u201ccultural Chernobyl.\u201d",
      "To reverse its fortunes, the park underwent significant rebranding, changing its name to Disneyland Paris in 1994 to emphasize its French location and connection to the capital. Over time, strategic changes, including the addition of new attractions and a shift in marketing, helped the resort recover. It is now a cornerstone of Disney\u2019s global operations."

    "story": [
      "A$AP Rocky is about to go to trial on charges that he fired a gun at a former friend outside a Hollywood hotel in 2021",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 A$AP Rocky is at a crossroads. He could soar to new heights of celebrity in 2025, or be brought back to earth quickly by a trial starting Tuesday that could led to his imprisonment for years.",
      "The hip-hop star, and longtime partner to Rihanna, with whom he has two toddler sons, is set to touch the highest levels of high fashion as one of the celebrity chairs of the Met Gala in May along with Pharrell Williams, LeBron James and others.",
      "And his modest acting career will get a major boost from starring alongside Denzel Washington in director Spike Lee's \u201cHighest 2 Lowest,\" planned for a summer release.",
      "But at the Los Angeles trial that's expected to last about three weeks, he is charged with two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm. He's accused of firing on a former friend on the streets near a Hollywood hotel in 2021. If convicted, he could get up to 24 years in prison.",
      "The 36-year-old has pleaded not guilty, and his attorney says he committed no crime.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re ready to go. It\u2019s been a long time,\u201d defense lawyer Joe Tacopina said after a hearing Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s been something that\u2019s waiting over Rocky\u2019s head and Rihanna and their family\u2019s heads for a while. We\u2019re anxious to get this thing underway and get this behind him.\u201d",
      "The trial has its roots in high school in New York, when the Harlem-raised Rakim Mayers, now known as A$AP Rocky, met Terell Ephron, also known as A$AP Relli, who will be the trial's most important witness.",
      "Ephron testified at a 2023 preliminary hearing that he brought Rocky into a crew of young creators who called themselves A$AP \u2014 for \u201cAlways Strive and Prosper.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe had dreams, pretty much,\u201d Ephron said.",
      "He testified that the members remained close even as Rocky became rich and famous, but the relationships would eventually erode.",
      "The feud came to a head in Hollywood on the night of Nov. 6, 2021, when according to Ephron, Rocky fired at him three or four times, the shots grazing his knuckles.",
      "Ephron went to the police two days later, and brought shell casings he had picked up himself \u2014 both points the defense will seize on.",
      "\u201cYou need nothing more than Mr. Ephron\u2019s testimony by itself,\u201d Deputy District Attorney Paul Przelomiec, the case's lead prosecutor, told a judge at the 2023 hearing,",
      "The trial is full of large personalities, along with two huge names that will loom over the proceedings despite having no direct role: President-elect Donald Trump and Rihanna.",
      "The trial begins the day after the second inauguration of Trump, whom Tacopina represented in the defamation and sexual abuse lawsuit of writer E. Jean Carroll. And Rocky himself became an unlikely cause celebre for then-President Trump during his first term when Trump publicly declared he was trying to get the rapper freed and returned to the U.S. when he was jailed after a brawl in Sweden in 2019.",
      "But Trump has no power over these proceedings, and could not pardon Rocky if he's convicted.",
      "Those anticipating the trial have long been asking whether Rihanna may attend.",
      "\u201cThe mother of his children is she going to be here?\u201d Superior Court Judge Mark Arnold asked the defense at an October hearing. \u201cShe\u2019s welcome to be here whenever she wants I\u2019d just like to know.\u201d",
      "Tacopina has been unable to give a definitive answer, but has said that he does not expect it.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s very protective of Rihanna and doesn\u2019t want her anywhere near this proceeding,\" he said after Wednesday's hearing. \"But that\u2019s a family decision they\u2019ll make.\u201d",
      "Tacopina said he has no intention of bringing Rihanna's name up at trial, but Arnold suggested he may when screening jurors.",
      "The judge, a former sheriff\u2019s deputy, has an affable but no-nonsense style and dispenses with many court formalities. He said he will keep the juror selection process simple, and a jury should be seated quickly.",
      "In an uncommon move in LA County courts, he will allow cameras in court for nearly the entire trial.",
      "\u201cI believe that the public deserves to see what goes on in the courtroom,\u201d he said.",
      "Tacopina has also represented other hip-hop figures, including Meek Mill and YG. The lawyer who normally practices in New York is gregarious, quick with a joke and always happy to talk to the media, but can be ruthless in cross-examination.",
      "When discussing Ephron's minor injuries at the 2023 hearing, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle he survived that shooting\u201d and was admonished for his tone.",
      "Deputy District Attorney John Lewin, best known for his successful murder prosecution of real estate scion Robert Durst, was a late addition to the prosecution team. He's also known for his aggressive cross-examination, including a relentless, weeks-long questioning of Durst.",
      "The case against Rocky will largely depend on how credible the jurors find Ephron.",
      "Police officers who searched the Hollywood sidewalk after a report of shots fired found no shell casings. Police recovered no fingerprints from the 9 mm casings Ephron brought them, and no 9 mm pistol was found when a search warrant was served on Rocky.",
      "Surveillance video captured parts of the incident. Prosecutors at the 2023 hearing showed a video still with a man in a hooded sweatshirt whose face is not visible holding what appears to be a gun, along with another image showing the face of the man in the sweatshirt, with no gun visible. A detective testified that investigators established it was Rocky.",
      "Tacopina said he has not decided whether Rocky will testify, which he is legally allowed to avoid.",
      "\u201cHe is eager to tell his story, he would love the opportunity to do so,\u201d the lawyer said Wednesday. \u201cHe is very articulate and very intelligent, he\u2019s a good human being, that would come out if he testifies, but that decision has not been made yet. It depends on how the case goes.\u201d"

      "Even as Tom Brady goes through his first postseason and prepares to call his first Super Bowl as a television analyst in three weeks, rumors about his future continue to be rampant, much to the dismay of Fox Sports.",
      "Fox Sports president of production and operations/executive producer Brad Zager understands the spotlight Brady and the network are under. Still, Zager said Brady is in it for the long haul.",
      "\u201cThe whole group that said he would never be there then turned into, he\u2019s not going to stay there. It\u2019s just a never-ending, merry-go-round of people trying to come up with the next narrative,\u201d Zager said in a phone interview with The Associated Press on Friday. \u201cTom has done nothing but be engaged with us every time he\u2019s asked about broadcasting. When he was retired and getting in, getting ready, he talked about how excited he was for it, that he was 100% and has never wavered on that. So the fact that there are people on that crew that have to read articles and narratives and predictions that Tom isn\u2019t engaged does wear on you,\u201d",
      "Friday\u2019s comments by Zager are the first about Brady by someone from Fox Sports. Brady has not been made available for media interviews this season. He has discussed his first season in the booth during appearances on Colin Cowherd\u2019s show on FS1.",
      "On Thursday, Don Yee, Brady\u2019s agent, told Sports Business Journal that Brady \u201chas had a tremendous amount of fun working with Fox this year, and he\u2019s really excited about the future with Fox.\u201d Brady signed a 10-year, $375 million contract with Fox in May 2022 while still playing for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He retired after that season and decided in February 2023 to take a year off before moving into the booth.",
      "\u201cTom has had a tremendous amount of fun working with Fox this year, and he\u2019s excited about the future with Fox and his growth on their team,\u201d Yee said. \u201cAnd this year was the first year of a long relationship.\u201d",
      "Yee did not return an email or text message by The Associated Press seeking comment.",
      "Fox Sports has tried to weather the rumors and criticism surrounding Brady\u2019s future and his dual roles as the analyst on its NFL crew and being a minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders.",
      "Everything has come to a head this week with Brady and Kevin Burkhardt calling Saturday night\u2019s NFC divisional round game in Detroit between the Lions and the Washington Commanders.",
      "Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson and defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn are candidates for the Raiders' head coach opening. Brady is involved in the franchise\u2019s coach and general manager selection.",
      "Brady cannot participate in Fox\u2019s production meetings with teams \u2014 either in person or via Zoom \u2014 watch practices, or step foot in a team\u2019s training complex. The only team complex Brady is allowed in is the Raiders.",
      "The league put those parameters in place going into the season after Brady purchased a 5% stake in the Raiders in May 2023. NFL owners approved the purchase last October.",
      "Zager said any inferences about a potential conflict of interest between Brady calling the game and being part of the Raiders\u2019 decision-making process are unfounded.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s questioning his professionalism and integrity. It\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Zager said.",
      "Any questions Brady would have for the coordinators or head coach Dan Campbell could be asked by Burkhardt or a member of the Fox crew in the production meetings. However, Brady receives the same film and statistical information as everyone else on the crew.",
      "\u201cAnytime you\u2019re around crew members and doing something as a crew, that\u2019s a good thing for the crew. So, we\u2019ve have to overcome that. You\u2019re not going to have that time to bond,\u201d Zager said. \u201cBut when it comes to analyzing the game and learning information, what is available at the fingertips of the average fan now is probably light years ahead of what was available even to the broadcast crew 15-20 years ago. Not being in the meetings has not stopped him from growing as an analyst throughout the season.\u201d",
      "Brady\u2019s analysis of teams and officiating is subject to more scrutiny by the league because of his stake in the Raiders, but it would have to be egregiously critical or call into question the integrity of a team or referee.",
      "Zager pointed out that Brady has been critical of play calls or strategy, just like any analyst is expected to do.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been awesome to watch Tom jump into this, having no broadcast experience, and calling the NFL\u2019s biggest games. He continues to find his rhythm and those spots where he can really shine during a game,\u201d Zager said. \u201cI think he\u2019s hitting a great stride as we head to the postseason in our biggest games. And I\u2019m looking forward to these next three games, which are three biggest games, and what he\u2019s going to add to the broadcast.\u201d",
      "Attention and rumors about Fox\u2019s top NFL crew are nothing new. Troy Aikman and Joe Buck\u2019s future during the 2021 season was constant fodder before both moved to ESPN\u2019s \u201cMonday Night Football.\u201d When Brady would join Fox then dominated the 2022 and \u201923 seasons. Brady, though, did take a lot of pressure off the network before Super Bowl 57 in 2023 when he said early in the week leading up to the game that he wouldn\u2019t be joining Fox in 2023, which allowed Greg Olsen to answer questions about the game instead of his future and not be a one-year, lame duck analyst on a top network team."

      "\u201cWe have here perhaps the largest thermal complex in a private house in Pompeii,\u201d said Gabriel Zuchtriegel, director of the Pompeii archaeological park. \u201cThe members of the ruling class of Pompeii set up enormous spaces in their homes to host banquets.",

      "Zuchtriegel said wealthy habitants of Pompeii often used first to take a bath and then to have a banquet, so the private spa complex allowed to do that altogether inside the same house.",
      "\u201cThere is room for about 30 people who could do the whole routine, and that could also be done in public baths. So there is the calidarium, a very warm environment and also a large tub with cold water,\u201d he said.",

      "In a statement Friday, her family said Plowright died the previous day at Denville Hall, a retirement home for actors in southern England, surrounded by her loved ones.",
      "\u201cShe enjoyed a long and illustrious career across theatre, film and TV over seven decades until blindness made her retire,\u201d the family said. \u201cWe are so proud of all Joan did and who she was as a loving and deeply inclusive human being.\"",

      "The suit filed in federal court in New York by Baldoni and production company Wayfarer Studios seeks at least $400 million for damages that include lost future income. It alleges that Lively and Reynolds hijacked the production and marketing of \u201cIt Ends With Us\" and manipulated media to smear Baldoni and others on the production with false allegations of sexual and other harassment.",
      "\u201cThis is a case about two of the most powerful stars in the world deploying their enormous power to steal an entire film right out of the hands of its director and production studio,\u201d the suit says. \u201cThen, when Lively and Reynolds\u2019 efforts failed to win them the acclaim they believed they so richly deserved, they turned their fury on their chosen scapegoat.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit comes about two weeks after Lively sued Baldoni and several others tied to the film, alleging they retaliated against her for coming forward about her treatment on the set. That lawsuit came just hours after Baldoni sued the New York Times for libel, alleging the paper worked with Lively to smear him.",
      "An email sent to publicist Leslie Sloane \u2014 who is also named as a defendant \u2014 seeking comment was not immediately answered.",
      "The Times said it stood by its reporting and planned to \u201cvigorously defend\u201d against the allegations.",
      "\u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d based on the bestselling 2016 novel by Colleen Hoover, was released in August and exceeded box office expectations with a $50 million debut. It begins as a standard romantic drama before taking a dark turn into domestic violence.",
      "The film's release was shrouded by speculation over discord between co-stars Lively and Baldoni, and the fallout has made make major waves in Hollywood and led to discussions of the treatment of female actors both on sets and in media.",
      "\u201cHeartbreakingly, a film that Baldoni envisioned years ago would honor the survivors of domestic violence by telling their story, with the lofty goal of making a positive impact in the world, has now been overshadowed beyond recognition solely as a result of Lively\u2019s actions and cruelty,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "Allegations from Lively that she was shown pornography and subjected to unwanted discussions about it from Baldoni and a producer were utterly false, the suit alleges.",
      "\u201cLively was so close and comfortable with Baldoni that she freely breast-fed in front of him during meetings,\u201d the suit says.",
      "She would later take moments like these that she encouraged and recast them as sexual harassment and misconduct from Baldoni, the lawsuit alleges.",
      "It also says that counter to Lively's allegations, every request she made for an intimacy coordinator to help with sensitive scenes on the film was honored. It focuses especially on a a birthing scene, saying Lively's contention that she was \u201cmostly nude\u201d with non-essential people present including the film's financier were \"knowingly false.\"",
      "\u201cLively was wearing black briefs and a pregnancy suit that covered her midsection, and her top was covered by a hospital gown,\u201d the suit says.",
      "Baldoni says that at another point during the production, because he has back problems, he privately and politely asked Lively her weight so that he could work with his personal trainer to be able to safely lift her in the film.",
      "Reynolds later \u201cswore at Baldoni and accused him of fat-shaming his wife,\" the suit says.",
      "\u201cIn fact, Lively had earlier expressed insecurity about her postpartum figure, and Baldoni made every attempt to genuinely reassure her,\u201d his lawsuit says.",
      "Baldoni took a backseat in promoting the film while Lively took center stage along with Reynolds, who was on the press circuit for \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d at the same time.",
      "Baldoni says the \u201ctone-deaf\u201d and \u201cdisastrous\u201d moves from Lively that led to her attempt at a counter-narrative included naming a drink at the post-premiere party \u201cRyle You Wait,\u201d after the character who engages in domestic violence.",
      "The backlash against Baldoni led to his being dropped by his agency WME, which also represents both Lively and Reynolds,",
      "The suit alleges Reynolds was responsible for this, saying that he approached a WME executive at the \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d premiere and \u201cexpressed his deep disdain for Baldoni, suggesting the agency was working with a \u2018sexual predator.\u2019\u201d",
      "Prior to \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d Baldoni starred in the TV comedy \u201cJane the Virgin,\u201d directed the 2019 film \u201cFive Feet Apart,\u201d and wrote \u201cMan Enough,\u201d a book pushing back against traditional notions of masculinity.",
      "\u201cLively knew full well that making those allegations would be a career death sentence for Plaintiffs, especially given that Baldoni has lived his private and public life as an impassioned advocate for gender equality and healthy masculinity,\u201d his lawsuit says.",
      "Lively came to fame through the 2005 film \u201cThe Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,\u201d and bolstered her stardom on the TV series \u201cGossip Girl\u201d from 2007 to 2012. She has since starred in films including \u201cThe Town\u201d and \u201cThe Shallows.\u201d",
      "Baldoni's lawsuit says Lively's cruelty even extended to having her suit served on Baldoni and his co-defendants during the onset of the wildfires that have ravaged the Los Angeles area, saying that on a day when they were \"gathering their kids and pets, preparing 'go bags' and monitoring evacuation orders while fearing for their homes, Lively\u2014from the safety of her penthouse in New York\u2014 deployed process servers.\u201d",
      "The suit against Baldoni and other defendants was filed on Dec. 31, but the serving of papers as required by law came the following week."

      "Nearly all of the new film \u201cSeptember 5\u201d takes place in the darkened, smokey control room from which ABC Sports broadcast the hostage crisis of the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich",
      "NEW YORK -- Nearly all of the new film \u201cSeptember 5\u201d takes place in the darkened, smokey control room from which ABC Sports broadcast the hostage crisis of the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich.",
      "All around the room is a buzzing clutter of period analog equipment. The video monitors act like windows, offering perspectives of the drama just outside: the taking of Israeli Olympic team members by the Palestinian militant group Black September.",
      "Inside the control room are the sports producers who were thrown into covering one of the first breaking news events televised worldwide. Some 900 million viewers are estimated to have watched.",
      "\u201cSeptember 5,\u201d a taut procedural recently nominated for best film, drama, by the Golden Globes, suggests this was a seminal moment in media history. Inside the control room, a handful of producers reckon in real time with questions that still pervade today\u2019s journalism: What\u2019s appropriate to show? Are we informing or sensationalizing? Do we have our facts straight?",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is show this moment where media forever changed,\u201d says John Magaro, who stars as producer Geoffrey Mason. \u201cThese people didn\u2019t know what they were unlocking, what they were letting out of a Pandora\u2019s Box. They were just trying to tell the story. But in doing that, they opened up a road to more sensationalism in journalism.\u201d",
      "\u201cSeptember 5,\u201d which opens in theaters Friday, has been hailed as an expertly crafted pressure cooker of journalism ethics. While the Munich Olympics terrorist attack has been the subject of several previous films, including Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cMunich\u201d (2005) and the 1999 documentary \u201cOne Day in September,\u201d \u201cSeptember 5\u201d \u2013 a kind of combination of \u201cSpotlight\u201d and \u201cRear Window\u201d \u2013 keeps its focus entirely on the broadcast that culminated in Jim McKay\u2019s much-remembered announcement of the hostages' tragic end: \u201cThey\u2019re all gone.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a group of experienced or trained news journalists reporting on this crisis,\u201d says Swiss director Tim Fehlbaum, who wrote the screenplay with Moritz Binder. \u201cIt was a bunch of sports TV people. That offered an interesting opportunity to confront them with these questions, in an almost innocent way.\u201d",
      "In \u201cSeptember 5,\u201d what was on TV screens in 1972, like McKay\u2019s report, is likewise what's seen in the movie. Real archival footage is a co-star. But everyone inside the studio is played by a sterling ensemble, including Peter Sarsgaard (a veteran of another striking journalism movie, 2003\u2019s \u201cShattered Glass\u201d ) as \u201cWide World of Sports\u201d creator Roone Arledge and Ben Chaplin as producer Marvin Bader.",
      "But if there\u2019s a central figure in \u201cSeptember 5,\u201d it\u2019s Mason, a then-young ABC Sports producer thrown into covering one of the biggest news stories of the decade. It was likewise a leading-man chance for Magaro, the talented 41-year-old Ohio native whose sensitive performances in films like \u201cFirst Cow\u201d and \u201cPast Lives\u201d have made him a standout character actor.",
      "\u201cIn a lot of ways, that\u2019s what was the most intriguing part of the script for me,\u201d Magaro says. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you can be an actor without feeling this competitive nature and need to seize opportunities when they\u2019re presented because there\u2019s not a lot them. I think it was the same for Geoff Mason at the time.\u201d",
      "Magaro\u2019s first time on a movie set was as an extra in \u201cMunich.\u201d Since then, though, he\u2019s grown as an actor through an ethic of hard work that he traces back to his family\u2019s immigrant, working-class roots.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s be honest, I\u2019m a 5-7 nebbishy white kid from Cleveland, Ohio,\u201d says Magaro. \u201cThis kind of journey doesn\u2019t happen to many of us. It\u2019s been a hard road at times and it\u2019s been a continuous climb. I never expected to get this far but I always had a drive in me to get better as an actor.\u201d",
      "In \u201cSeptember 5,\u201d Fehlbaum put a premium on authenticity. From museums and collectors he gathered the then-cutting edge video technology of the early 1970s and brought it up to working order. Walking onto the set, which with near-accuracy recreated the ABC control room, was \u201clike stepping onto a submarine everyday,\u201d says Magaro. (The U-boat-set 1981 film \u201cDas Boot\u201d was, appropriately, as inspiration for Fehlbaum.)",
      "The actors leaned into the same ethos. Magaro depended considerably on the anecdotes and advice of Mason who went on to have a decorated, decades-long career in television. With his help, Magaro sat in on CBS\u2019s Sunday NFL control room and games at Madison Square Garden to soak up the fast-paced atmosphere.",
      "\u201cGeoff told me that day there was no chance to think. Their singular goal was to stay on the air to keep the story going, to do their job as sports broadcasters,\u201d Magaro says. \u201cOnce the clock starts ticking, there\u2019s no chance to think.\u201d",
      "In chronicling the minute-by-minute drama of covering the Munich terrorist attack, \u201cSeptember 5\u201d sidesteps the political repercussions of one the most infamous chapters of Israeli-Palestinian relations. The film was in post-production when Hamas attacked Israel in October 2023. It first debuted at film festivals last fall while the Israeli war in Gaza continued.",
      "On Wednesday, Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire, raising hopes that the 15-month conflict could be nearing an end. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, said the agreement was still not complete.",
      "Yet \u201cSeptember 5\" strives to keep its focus on media, not politics.",
      "\u201cHas anything ever really changed? That conflict has been going on since 1948 when Israel was created,\u201d says Magaro. \u201cIt\u2019s a question, no matter what side you\u2019re on, you can ask yourself, even with the current situation: Is the media covering this the best way possible?\u201d",
      "Earlier foundational moments in the history of live news broadcasting stretch back to April 1949, when 3-year-old Kathy Fiscus fell down an abandoned well in San Marino, California. KTLA in Los Angeles televised more than 27 hours of the rescue effort live.",
      "Today's media landscape, populated by social media and digital platforms that are often riddled with misinformation in some ways makes the ethical questions wrestled over in \u201cSeptember 5\u201d seem almost quaint. But for Fehlbaum, it's less about what's changed than what hasn't.",
      "\u201cWhat I\u2019ve observed is that while technology changes a lot, the bigger ethical or moral questions are still the same,\u201d Fehlbaum says. \"For both those reporting on a crisis and us consuming news.\u201d"

      "Comedian and host Conan O\u2019Brien is the newest recipient of the Mark Twain Prize for lifetime achievement in comedy",
      "WASHINGTON -- Comedian and host Conan O'Brien was named the newest recipient of the Mark Twain Prize for lifetime achievement in comedy on Thursday.",
      "O'Brien, 61, has carved out an improbable decadeslong career arc, moving from goofy television interloper to comedic elder statesman. Along the way, he survived one of the most public failures in the history of television on \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d \u2014 only to launch a successful, and sustained, next act.",
      "His travel series \u201cConan O'Brien Must Go\u201d sparked popular and critical acclaim, with a second season coming. In March, O'Brien will host the Academy Awards three weeks before his own Mark Twain ceremony in Washington.",
      "Deborah Rutter, president of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, in a statement called O'Brien \u201ca master of invention and reinvention, consistently pushing the envelope in search of new comedic heights.\"",
      "O\u2019Brien offered his own tongue-in-cheek assessment, saying in the Kennedy Center statement that he would be \u201cthe first winner of the Mark Twain Prize recognized not for humor, but for my work as a riverboat pilot.\u201d He will be honored on March 23 in a special ceremony in which he will receive a bronze bust of Twain, the iconic American writer and satirist whose real name was Samuel Clemens.",
      "Mark Twain recipients are honored with a night of testimonials and video tributes, often featuring previous award winners. The ceremony will stream on Netflix at a later date yet to be announced.",
      "O'Brien leaped into the spotlight from near-total obscurity in 1993, when he was chosen to replace the legendary David Letterman as host of \u201cLate Night\u201d despite no significant on-camera experience. The former Harvard Lampoon editor had spent the previous years as a writer for \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d appearing on camera only as an occasional background extra in \u201cSNL\u201d skits.",
      "Bringing a skittish, awkward energy that contrasted with Letterman's deadpan persona, O'Brien constantly made fun of his own gangly appearance and inappropriateness for the job. He went on to host \u201cLate Night\u201d for 16 years, longer than any other host.",
      "In 2009, O'Brien's career and persona took a turn. He became the man who publicly gained and lost his dream job while America watched.",
      "O'Brien was tapped to replace Jay Leno as host of \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d despite public warnings from his own guests that Leno wasn't ready to cede the throne. After seven months of declining ratings, NBC executives brought Leno back for a new show that would bump \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d back. O'Brien refused to accept the move, leading to a public spat that ended with a multimillion-dollar payout for O'Brien and his staff to exit the network in early 2010.",
      "The aftermath split the comedy world, with Leno cast as the villain and O'Brien as the victim who was set up to fail.",
      "In an emotional goodbye on his final \u201cTonight Show,\u201d O'Brien described himself as lucky and refused to sound bitter.",
      "\u201cEvery comedian dreams of hosting 'The Tonight Show,' and for seven months I got to do it,\" he said. \"I did it my way with people I love, and I don't regret one second.\u201d",
      "He ended with a sort of generational rallying cry.",
      "\u201cAll I ask is this one thing, particularly of young people that watch: Please do not be cynical,\u201d O'Brien said, his voice cracking. \u201cNobody in life gets exactly what they thought they were going to get, but if you work really hard and you're kind, amazing things will happen.\u201d",
      "O'Brien reemerged later in 2010 with a new talk show on the cable station TBS. Despite the channel's lower profile, the show ran for 11 years while he launched parallel ventures like the podcast \u201cConan O'Brien Needs a Friend\u201d and the travel show \u201cConan Without Borders,\u201d a precursor to his current show.",
      "Other comedians receiving the lifetime achievement award include both Letterman and Leno, along with George Carlin, Whoopi Goldberg, Bob Newhart, Carol Burnett and Dave Chappelle. Bill Cosby, the 2009 recipient, had his Mark Twain Prize rescinded in 2019 amid multiple allegations of sexual assault."

      "Walter Salles' film \u201cI'm Still Here\u201d tells the story of Eunice Paiva after the disappearance of her husband",
      "It\u2019s easy to fall in love with the Paiva family. Filmmaker Walter Salles makes sure of that in \u201cI\u2019m Still Here.\u201d",
      "He drops the audience into the warm everyday of the beautiful home of Eunice (Fernanda Torres) and Rubens Paiva (Selton Mello), in 1970s Rio de Janeiro, where their five kids run freely between the beach and their living room. Life is calmly chaotic, full of affection, gentle familial teasing and various life stages (one is about to lose a tooth, another about to go to university). Someone always seems to have wet hair, be covered in sand, or bringing in a mangy stray, as their youngest, Marcelo, does in the film\u2019s lovely opening. Even if their life is technically worlds away from any one person in the audience, it feels familiar and close.",
      "Anyone coming to \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d will surely know that this domestic tranquility does not and cannot hold. It was about seven years into Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship, which would last until 1985. And while the film suggests that there was a semblance of normalcy in their day to day, there are also ominous signs of change and oppression \u2014 reports of ambassadors being kidnapped on the news, and tense \u201crandom\u201d traffic stops that their eldest daughter endures one night. Some left-leaning citizens are making plans to leave, but the Paiva family is not in a terrible rush. They\u2019re even making plans to build a new home.",
      "So when three men in civilian clothes enter their home one afternoon and tell Rubens, a former left-leaning congressman, that he needs to come in for questioning, it happens with little incident. Everyone is on guard \u2014 they\u2019re not naive \u2014 but you sense that Eunice believes he will come back that night. Maybe even the next day. Rubens is calm changing into a collared shirt and tie and lying to his daughter that he is going into the office, even though it\u2019s a holiday. But he also savors this moment with her, perhaps because he knows he\u2019s likely to not return.",
      "The film is based on a memoir written by Paiva\u2019s son, Marcelo, but you don\u2019t need to know that to know that it is first and foremost a memory piece. It is deeply personal and imbued with the kind of tenderness that is extremely difficult to see or appreciate in the moment. And although it\u2019s certainly idealized and wistful, we accept any assumed white lies because we all wish that for ourselves: to truly recognize what we have before it\u2019s gone.",
      "This story is not about the abduction, however, or what may have happened to Rubens after that day. It\u2019s about how Eunice continues on, through uncertainty, absence and, ultimately, the loss of hope. Salles chooses to tell this story in a rather straightforward manner, which works well, allowing the compelling narrative and the talented actors to carry the audience through.",
      "At the heart of it is Torres, who has already won a Golden Globe for her performance and whose portrayal of Eunice is a true marvel. Mothers and wives often get the short shrift in movies like this, about Big Important Topics decided on by men, but Torres instills Eunice with a deep emotional and practical intelligence that\u2019s beautifully feminine, whether she\u2019s dealing with a misogynist banker, a dead dog in the street or the thugs surveilling her home. She\u2019s fascinating and resilient in a way that so many women are in times of historical strife but rarely celebrated for.",
      "In one particularly poignant scene, she and the kids are being photographed by a journalist hoping to tell their story. They smile together, as they did earlier in the film when Rubens was there. Now he\u2019s not, and the reporters are confused. They ask Eunice to try a more serious expression. She laughs, \u201cThey want us to look sad,\u201d and instructs her kids to keep smiling. It\u2019s a perfect encapsulation of the complex spirit of the movie. Political disappearances don\u2019t begin and end with the victim, or the toppling of a regime \u2014 they are generational traumas that live on in the survivors and alter everything in their wake.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m Still Here,\u201d a Sony Pictures Classics release in limited release Friday (expanding on Jan. 24), is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for \u201csmoking, drug use, brief nudity, some strong language, thematic content.\u201d Running time: 135 minutes.

      "Horror, not comedy, has been the go-to movie genre in recent years, but a movie like \u201cOne of Them Days,\u201d starring Keke Palmer and, in her big-screen debut, SZA, is a good reminder of what we\u2019ve been missing.",
      "Creepy stuff and jump scares, we\u2019ve been told, have proved better suited for channeling our abiding contemporary dread. But the communal joys of big-screen comedy have, and always will, suit dark days as much as light ones, if not more so. \u201cOne of Them Days,\u201d for instance, happens to arrive while Los Angeles, where the movie is set, has been decimated by wildfires. The Southern California skies, though, are crystal clear in \u201cOne of Them Days.\u201d In the opening moments, someone says, \u201cIt\u2019s always cooler on the West side.\u201d",
      "\u201cOne of Them Days,\u201d which had its premiere cancelled by the fires, is a welcome warm breeze for a movie landscape that has largely frozen out the comedy. There\u2019s one overwhelming reason for this: Keke Palmer.",
      "This is a buddy comedy, so it might seem unfair to single out one half of a duo. SZA, in her first feature, acquits herself well. But this is Palmer\u2019s show.",
      "Palmer plays Dreux, a Los Angeles waitress who, when her artist roommate Alyssa (SZA) gives their rent money to an untrustworthy boyfriend, Keshawn (Joshua David Neal), goes on a madcap, day-long odyssey to raise the money before they\u2019re evicted. This seemingly low-stakes premise is itself a kind of throwback to a more 1990s-flavored movie. The antic spirit of F. Gary Gray\u2019s \u201cFriday\u201d can be felt throughout \u201cOne of Them Days.\u201d",
      "The tone here, courtesy of director Lawrence Lamont, producer Issa Rae and screenwriter Syreeta Singleton, is amiably realistic. Aside from a few cartoonish flourishes, \u201cOne of Them Days\u201d is grounded in a working-class reality where every step toward upward mobility for Dreux and Alyssa is swiftly knocked backward.",
      "They live in a dilapidated apartment complex in the neighborhood of Baldwin Village, nicknamed the Jungles. When they\u2019re forced to raise $1,500 \u2014 a race complete with a ticking-clock countdown to eviction, and, as things develop, until \u201ccertain death\u201d \u2014 Dreux is also scheduled for the biggest job interview of her life, to become a franchise manager for the restaurant chain she\u2019s employed by.",
      "The satire of \u201cOne of Them Days\u201d is mostly directed at the feeble opportunities afforded to those striving to break out of a paycheck-to-paycheck cycle. When the roommates seek a loan, their payday center advertises a comical APR of 1,900.5%. (The agent, who takes great pleasure in their credit scores, is memorably played by Keyla Monterroso Mejia.)",
      "That\u2019s just one of the characters the two encounter in their pleasantly meandering journey to raise money via everything from blood donation to Air Jordans hung on power lines. Some of the characters along the way include Katt Williams, as a conscientious homeless man who warns against predatory lending; Vanessa Bell Calloway\u2019s stripper-turned-blood-bank-worker; a new white neighbor named Bethany (Maude Apatow); and Keshawn\u2019s new hook-up (Janelle James), who proves the movie\u2019s most regular villain, despite the looming presence of a fearsome gangster (Amin Joseph).",
      "Anyone familiar with Rae\u2019s \u201cInsecure\u201d will recognize some of the hallmarks of that HBO series, namely the struggles of Black women trying to get a leg up in Los Angeles while also juggling romantic interests that might come from a wide range of backgrounds. Here, that\u2019s Dreux\u2019s crush, Maniac (Patrick Cage), who drives a Mercedes and who she suspects is a criminal.",
      "If all of this sounds somewhat low stakes (I failed to mention Lil Rel Howery as their prospective sneaker buyer), that\u2019s more of a pleasing feature than a bug in \u201cOne of Them Days.\u201d Besides, filling this movie with anything more \u2014 star cameos or broad comedy set pieces \u2014 would be a mistake. That would leave less room for the interplay between Palmer and SZA.",
      "\u201cOne of Them Days\u201d hinges on central buddy comedy, which Lamont seems to recognize even in his feature directorial debut. SZA\u2019s uber-cool unsurprisingly transfers easily to the big screen; her performance is winning because it\u2019s so unforced.",
      "But it\u2019s a testament to Palmer\u2019s dynamism as a performer that \u201cOne of Them Days\u201d would work no matter where their day takes them.

      "A hip-hop superstar beef was cranked up another notch Wednesday when Drake sued Universal Music Group for defamation over rival Kendrick Lamar's diss track \u201cNot Like Us.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit, filed in federal court in New York City, alleges UMG \u2014 the parent record label for Drake and Lamar \u2014 published and promoted the track even though it included false pedophilia allegations against Drake and suggested listeners should resort to vigilante justice. Lamar is not named in the suit.",
      "The result, the suit says, was intruders shooting a security guard and two attempted break-ins at Drake\u2019s Toronto home, online hate and harassment, a hit to his reputation and a decrease in his brand's value before his contract renegotiation with UMG this year.",
      "\u201cThe lawsuit is not about the artist who created \u2018Not Like Us,\u2019\" the lawsuit says, referring to Lamar. \u201cIt is, instead, entirely about UMG, the music company that decided to publish, promote, exploit, and monetize allegations that it understood were not only false, but dangerous.\u201d",
      "The suit later alleges, \u201cUMG did so because it understood that the Recording's inflammatory and shocking allegations were a gold mine.\u201d",
      "And, the suit claims, the music company has made large investments and used its connections to arrange for \u201cNot Like Us\u201d to be performed at next month's Super Bowl, where Lamar will be the halftime entertainment.",
      "The lawsuit, which is seeking a trial and an undisclosed amount of money for damages, also repeated allegations in other legal filings that UMG falsely pumped up the popularity of \u201cNot Like Us\u201d on streaming services.",
      "The track is nominated for five Grammys, including record of the year and song of the year.",
      "UMG disputed the lawsuit's allegations in a statement Wednesday afternoon.",
      "\u201cNot only are these claims untrue, but the notion that we would seek to harm the reputation of any artist \u2014 let alone Drake \u2014 is illogical,\" the company said. \u201cWe have invested massively in his music and our employees around the world have worked tirelessly for many years to help him achieve historic commercial and personal financial success.\u201d",
      "The company added: \u201cThroughout his career, Drake has intentionally and successfully used UMG to distribute his music and poetry to engage in conventionally outrageous back-and-forth \u2018rap battles\u2019 to express his feelings about other artists. He now seeks to weaponize the legal process to silence an artist\u2019s creative expression and to seek damages from UMG for distributing that artist\u2019s music. \u201d",
      "Representatives for Lamar did not respond to emails seeking comment.",
      "The feud between Drake, a 38-year-old Canadian rapper and singer and five-time Grammy winner whose full name is Aubrey Drake Graham, and Lamar, a 37-year-old Pulitzer Prize winner, is among the biggest in hip-hop in recent years, with two of the genre\u2019s biggest stars at its center.",
      "The two were occasional collaborators more than a decade ago, but Lamar began taking public jabs at Drake starting in 2013. The fight escalated steeply last year.",
      "Drake's lawyers, from New York-based Willkie Farr & Gallagher, said the lawsuit seeks to hold UMG accountable for knowingly promoting false and defamatory allegations against him. They said the shooting and break-in attempts at Drake's home, and the online vitriol, prompted him to move his family out of the house, and that he fears for his and their safety.",
      "\u201cBeginning on May 4, 2024 and every day since, UMG has used its massive resources as the world\u2019s most powerful music company to elevate a dangerous and inflammatory message that was designed to assassinate Drake\u2019s character, and led to actual violence at Drake\u2019s doorstep,\u201d the law firm said in a statement.",
      "\u201cThis lawsuit reveals the human and business consequences to UMG\u2019s elevation of profits over the safety and well-being of its artists, and shines a light on the manipulation of artists and the public for corporate gain,\u201d it said."

      "It will not, of course, because this is a Blumhouse movie called \u201cWolf Man.\u201d It will not be good for Blake and it will not be good for the audience. That's because this film is a terrible misfire using a classic movie monster poorly rebooted by the modern home of horror.",
      "Slack when it should be terrifying, \u201cWolf Man\u201d suffers from cheap sentimentality, laughably obvious script reveals, poor continuity and a creature that is less predatory than painful. Pity comes to mind.",
      "Christopher Abbott stars as Blake, a father and husband whose own estranged dad was a tad unstable, constantly drilling in his son a survivalist ethic. \u201cIt's not hard to die. It's the easiest thing in the world,\u201d his dad says. He being officially declared dead 30 years after he disappeared into the forest starts this sludgy movie off.",
      "\"The Invisible Man\" writer-director Leigh Whannell \u2014 who co-wrote the story with Corbett Tuck \u2014 seems to be attempting a horror movie with his new message: Being overprotective can lead to your family being assaulted by a deranged manbeast. Wait, that can't be right. Maybe it's about inheritance? It's all a little muddled.",
      "A weird human-animal hybrid lurking in the Oregon wilderness \u2014 actually New Zealand pretending to be Oregon \u2014 kicks off what is supposed to be the scary part of this movie, but so much time is spent on the domestic drama set-up that the audience will be bored by the time the supposed thrill ride shows up. When it does, the filmmakers lean on creepy sounds way too much.",
      "There's a Wolf Man out there and he's, well, underwhelming. He is largely unseen for most of the movie because seeing the monster is always a bad idea. At one, point, he attacks through the cabin's doggie door, one of the most disappointing assaults on film.",
      "Now infected inside their barricaded cabin, Blake goes through a body-horror transformation, which includes the sweats, enhanced hearing, uncontrolled peeing, teeth readjustment, mottled skin, being made mute and hair loss. That's right, hair loss. This is the first Wolf Man movie that seems to endorse Rogaine.",
      "His wife, played by Julia Garner, is left here to sniffle and shriek, going from life partner to potential dinner. That means a lot of running and panting with a flashlight in hand. Their daughter, played by Matilda Firth, earlier so precocious, now asks really stupid questions like \u201cWhat's happening?\u201d and \u201cWhat's wrong with Daddy?\u201d",
      "So, outside the cabin lurks a Wolf Man. And inside is potentially another, but one still kind of trying to hold onto his humanity. \u201cMom, he wants this to be over,\u201d the girl says of her dad-wolf. We know the feeling.",
      "\u201cWolf Man,\u201d a Universal Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated R for \u201cbloody violent content, grisly images and some language.\u201d Running time: 103 minutes. No stars out of four."

Walgreens also systematically pressured pharmacists to fill prescriptions without taking the time to confirm their validity, according to the complaint.",

In addition, it allegedly deprived pharmacists of crucial information including by preventing them from warning each another about particular prescribers.",
      "\u201cThis lawsuit seeks to hold Walgreens accountable for the many years that it failed to meet its obligations when dispensing dangerous opioids and other drugs,\u201d Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division, said in a statement. \u201cThese practices allowed millions of opioid pills and other controlled substances to flow illegally out of Walgreens stores.\u201d",

      "HONOLULU -- Some wounds suffered by six Hawaii residents flown to Arizona for medical treatment after a deadly illegal fireworks explosion on New Year's are comparable to battlefield injuries, the doctor overseeing their care said Friday.",
      "Dr. Kevin Foster, the director of the Arizona Burn Center in Phoenix, said flying particles and debris from the explosion inflicted traumatic injuries.",
      "\u201cIn addition to the thermal injury that comes from the heat and the flame and the fire, we also have an explosive nature to this with particles moving at very high speeds striking patients,\u201d Foster said at a news conference from Phoenix that was streamed online.",
      "The blast killed four people, including a 3-year-old boy, and injured about 20 others. The U.S. military flew six of the wounded to Arizona on Jan. 4 because Hawaii\u2019s lone burn unit didn't have enough capacity to care for all the victims.",
      "Medical staff hadn't realized the magnitude of the injuries from the flying particles until the patients had surgery. But Foster said this was to be expected.",
      "\u201cYou really have to get into the operating room and start operating on these people to really understand that. So it\u2019s not surprising that nobody picked up on this,\u201d Foster said.",
      "The traumatic injuries resulted in some unusual infections but Foster said this didn\u2019t catch caregivers off guard. Doctors at the center have seen these types of injuries in fireworks patients before and infections in burn patients are almost unavoidable, he said.",
      "The blast happened at a three-story home with a bottom-level carport in a Honolulu residential neighborhood.",
      "Hawaii Gov. Josh Green earlier this week proposed a range of new penalties to crack down on those who flout the state\u2019s fireworks laws. The state Department of Law Enforcement has asked the Legislature for $5.2 million to hire eight people and expand a forensic lab to counter rampant smuggling of illegal fireworks."

      "The U.S. Justice Department says Alabama is unnecessarily institutionalizing children with physical disabilities in nursing homes and hospitals",
      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- Alabama children with physical disabilities are being unnecessarily institutionalized in nursing homes, the U.S. Justice Department said Thursday, warning it would file suit against the state unless changes are made to allow more of these children to live at home.",
      "A Justice Department investigation found Alabama is violating the requirement of the Americans with Disabilities Act to administer services to individuals with disabilities in the setting most appropriate to the person\u2019s needs.",
      "\u201cMany children with physical disabilities in Alabama are unnecessarily institutionalized or are at serious risk of unnecessary institutionalization,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney General Kristen Clarke wrote to state officials.",
      "Clarke announced the probe's findings in a letter to the Alabama Department of Human Resources, the Alabama Medicaid Agency and the Alabama Department of Senior Services. It listed changes the state should make to provide more community services and threatened a federal lawsuit if action isn't taken.",
      "Alabama\u2019s Gov. Kay Ivey\u2019s office referred questions to the state agencies. The Department of Human Resources did not immediately respond to an email Thursday seeking comment.",
      "The federal investigation found that Alabama policies effectively limit community-based services, or long-term support services, which allow children with physical disabilities to live at home.",
      "Federal officials said the state has not adequately developed its community-based workforce. The Justice Department also said Alabama fails to support foster parents who care for, or are considering caring for, children with physical disabilities.",
      "Alabama parents too often face a difficult choice of sending their children to nursing homes for life or quitting their jobs to become full-time caregivers, the Justice Department wrote.",
      "\u201cSome children who could otherwise be cared for in family homes have spent their formative years growing up in nursing homes, separated from their families and communities. Others live on the brink of such institutionalization, as their families struggle physically, financially, and emotionally to keep them at home,\u201d Clarke wrote.",
      "P.J. Alexander said he and his wife were one of those Alabama families. Their son Kyle was born with a complex set of medical issues, including genetic conditions and cerebral palsy.",
      "\u201cWe were able to keep him at home, just barely,\u201d he said.",
      "They had considered moving to another state that provides more resources for families caring for profoundly disabled children. Kyle passed away suddenly Nov. 25 at age 10 from cardiac failure, Alexander said.",
      "\u201cHe was such a happy boy, he\u2019d always smile. For someone who had so many struggles,\" Alexander said."

      "The vast majority of Americans are about to get an extended taste of frigid Siberian weather",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- The vast majority of Americans are about to get an extended taste of frigid Siberian weather. Another polar vortex disruption will stretch Arctic air across the top of the globe and make Donald Trump's second inauguration the coldest in 40 years, meteorologists said.",
      "After starting in the Rockies Thursday night, the cold will blast eastward and as far south as the upper Florida peninsula over several days. Up to 280 million Americans will have a day or two where it\u2019s colder than Anchorage, Alaska, said private meteorologist Ryan Maue.",
      "\u201cThis would be one of the coldest outbreaks certainly of the past 10 years, 15 years,\u201d said winter weather expert Judah Cohen of Atmospheric Environmental Research. \u201cIt\u2019s pulling air out of Siberia. And, you know, that\u2019s consistent with these stretches because when the polar vortex stretches, the flow starts in Siberia and ends in the United States.\u201d",
      "It will arrive in Washington well before Trump's inauguration Monday outside the U.S. Capitol. The National Weather Service is predicting the temperature to be around 22 degrees (minus-6 Celsius) at noon during the swearing-in, the coldest since Ronald Reagan's second inauguration saw temperatures plunge to 7 degrees (minus-14 Celsius). Barack Obama 2009 swearing-in was 28 degrees (minus-2 Celsius).",
      "But that's not all because the wind is forecast to be 30 to 35 mph (48 to 56 kph).",
      "\u201cThe wind chills would be in the single digits for sure,\u201d the NWS' Weather Prediction Center meteorologist Zack Taylor said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be cold, blustery, basically right up the National Mall. And it can get pretty breezy on the mall there with the west-northwest wind right in the face.\u201d",
      "Washington could see single digits later and on Wednesday morning might get near zero, Maue said. There could be a record low broken in Baltimore, Taylor said. He said most of the records that will be broken in this cold outbreak are not likely to be overnight lows, but still chilly daytime highs.",
      "About 80 million people are likely to have subzero temperatures at some point, Maue said.",
      "\"The coldest will be Tuesday morning for the Lower 48 overall,\" Maue said. The average low that morning for the entire Lower 48 will be around 7 degrees (minus-14 degrees Celsius), he said.",
      "Maue said a stretch from Chicago to Indianapolis to Columbus, Ohio, to Pittsburgh will get the most brutal cold compared to their normal temperatures.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s like a corridor of extreme cold, calm winds at night over snow cover. Temperatures could really drop like a rock there,\u201d Maue said.",
      "Freezes could go as far as the Gulf Coast and northern Florida, meteorologists said.",
      "Earlier this month, long-range forecasts hinted at worst-in-30-years type of cold for the year's first week, but those predictions eased as the cold outbreak got closer. It was cold, but not near record levels. This time, it\u2019s the opposite. Each day\u2019s computer models show it colder than the previous one, Maue said.",
      "There's some possibility of snow squalls here and there, but it's mostly just going to be cold, Taylor said \u2014 what Maue called a dry cold.",
      "As happened earlier this month, this cold snap comes from a disruption in the polar vortex, the ring of cold air usually trapped about the North Pole. That ring is being stretched south across North America like a rubber band, Cohen said.",
      "These stretching events are happening more often in the past decade or so, Cohen said. He and others have linked these polar vortex outbreaks to human-caused climate change and decreasing pressure and temperature differences between the Arctic and the rest of the globe.",
      "Those also trigger changes in the jet stream \u2014 the river of air that usually brings weather from west to east \u2014 that make cold air and weather systems plunge from north to south like a roller coaster.",
      "On the east side of that plunge is cold air and potentially record high pressure, Taylor and others said.",
      "On the west side, in southern California, is not only warmer air but also the extreme pressure differences that could goose the already high winds that are fanning fires around Los Angeles, meteorologists said.",
      "Get used to it. There's some debate among meteorologists about how long this extreme cold outbreak will last but below normal temperatures may stick around through the end of the month for much of the country, said University of Oklahoma meteorology professor Jason Furtado, who organized winter weather workshops at the American Meteorological Society's annual conference in New Orleans.",
      "And Cohen said long-range forecasts suggest the same polar vortex conditions could return in early February.",

      "Kemp's announcement came as President-elect Donald Trump returns to office and more state and federal officials consider Medicaid work requirements.",
      "Georgia is the only state that requires some people to work, study or volunteer to enroll in Medicaid, under the program Georgia Pathways. If the incoming Trump administration approves Kemp's plan, parents and guardians of kids up to age 6 in households at or below 100% of the federal poverty level could receive Medicaid without meeting those requirements.",
      "\u201cIn a growing state that needs more Georgians in the workforce than ever before, providing health insurance to a family or individual with young children may be the last piece they need to restart a career and be on the path for a brighter future,\u201d Kemp said.",
      "Most states cover adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level with primarily federal funds. Kemp has championed Georgia Pathways as an alternative to expanding Medicaid for low-income adults. Enrollees have to complete 80 hours of work, volunteer activity, schooling or vocational rehabilitation a month to receive coverage. Kemp says the goal is to ease them into a job that provides private insurance.",
      "Georgia Pathways had a rough start. After its first year, the program had around 4,300 members, a sliver of those who are eligible. Health policy experts have called the program a \u201cfailure,\" saying the requirements are too burdensome a large number of struggling people.",
      "Opponents also say the program has wasted money. Nonprofit health policy research organization KFF reports the program has costed more than $40 million in state and federal tax dollars that have been spent mostly on administrative costs rather than medical care. Others complain about sign-up complications and the program's slow processing times.",
      "In a written statement, state Senate Democrats called the new plan \u201cdamage control\u201d for the Georgia Pathways program.",
      "\u201cThere are over half a million Georgians who need health insurance, and the governor\u2019s proposal falls well short of that, and we\u2019re leaving federal dollars on the table that would help close the coverage gap in Georgia,\" said Democratic state Sen. Jason Esteves, of Atlanta. \"Because of the governor\u2019s plan, we will continue to struggle to strengthen our healthcare system.\"",
      "Kemp has regularly doubled down on his commitment to Georgia Pathways.",
      "\u201cThe old system is not working,\u201d Kemp said Wednesday. \u201cAnd the other side, their only answer to any of this is they want government-run healthcare. And I am not in that boat.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration approved Medicaid work requirement plans in 13 states, but the Biden administration revoked these waivers in 2021. Georgia Pathways survived after a legal fight.",

      "He said the Biden administration has meanwhile \u201cunfortunately been more interested in finding ways to stop or undermine our efforts rather than working with us.\u201d",

      "Food and Drug Administration officials granted a 2022 petition filed by two dozen food safety and health advocates, who urged the agency to revoke authorization for the substance that gives some candies, snack cakes and maraschino cherries a bright red hue.",
      "The agency said it was taking the action as a \u201cmatter of law\u201d because some studies have found that the dye caused cancer in lab rats. Officials cited a statute known as the Delaney Clause, which requires FDA to ban any additive found to cause cancer in people or animals.",
      "The dye is known as erythrosine, FD&C Red No. 3 or Red 3. The ban removes it from the list of approved color additives in foods, dietary supplements and oral medicines, such as cough syrups. More than three decades ago, the FDA declined to authorize use of Red 3 in cosmetics and externally applied drugs because a study showed it caused cancer when eaten by rats.",
      "\u201cThe FDA is taking action that will remove the authorization for the use of FD&C Red No. 3 in food and ingested drugs,\" said Jim Jones, the FDA's deputy commissioner for human foods. \u201cEvidence shows cancer in laboratory male rats exposed to high levels of FD&C Red No.3. Importantly, the way that FD&C Red No. 3 causes cancer in male rats does not occur in humans.\u201d",
      "Food manufacturers will have until January 2027 to remove the dye from their products, while makers of ingested drugs have until January 2028 to do the same. Other countries still allow for certain uses of the dye, but imported foods must meet the new U.S. requirement.",
      "Consumer advocates praised the decision.",
      "\u201cThis is a welcome, but long overdue, action from the FDA: removing the unsustainable double standard in which Red 3 was banned from lipstick but permitted in candy,\u201d said Dr. Peter Lurie, director of the group Center for Science in the Public Interest, which led the petition effort.",
      "It's not clear whether the ban will face legal challenges from food manufacturers because evidence hasn\u2019t determined that the dye causes cancer when consumed by humans. At a hearing in December, FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf suggested that's a risk.",
      "\u201cWhen we do ban something, it will go to court,\u201d he told members of Congress on Dec. 5. \u201cAnd if we don't have the scientific evidence, we will lose in court.\u201d",
      "When the FDA declined to allow Red 3 in cosmetics and topical drugs in 1990, the color additive was already permitted in foods and ingested drugs. Because research showed then that the way the dye causes cancer in rats does not apply to humans, \"the FDA did not take action to revoke the authorization of Red No. 3 in food,\u201d the agency has said on its website.",
      "Health advocates for years have asked the FDA to reconsider that decision, including the 2022 petition led by CSPI. In November, nearly two dozen members of Congress sent a letter demanding that FDA officials ban Red 3.",

The group points to research by scientific committees operated by the United Nations and the World Health Organization, including a 2018 review that reaffirmed the safety of Red 3 in food.",

    "story": [
      "The Biden administration is floating a long-awaited proposal to make cigarettes less addictive by capping their nicotine levels",
      "WASHINGTON -- Federal officials on Wednesday released a far-reaching proposal to make cigarettes less addictive by capping their nicotine content, a goal long sought by antismoking advocates that is unlikely to go into effect anytime soon.",
      "The proposed rule from the Food and Drug Administration comes in the final days of President Joe Biden\u2019s term, greatly reducing the likelihood that it will actually be enacted. President-elect Donald Trump and his health nominees have not commented on the measure, but a similar effort led by Trump\u2019s first FDA commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, was sidelined during his first term.",
      "Trump\u2019s health secretary nominee, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has said little about how regulating tobacco fits into his plans to overhaul the government's approach to fighting chronic disease. Even if the effort goes ahead under Trump, tobacco companies like Reynolds American and Altria are almost certain to challenge it in court, delaying implementation.",
      "The FDA has spent years studying the issue and said Wednesday that reducing nicotine would help nearly 13 million current smokers quit cigarettes within one year. Roughly 48 million more young people would never take up the habit because cigarettes would essentially become nonaddictive, according to agency projections.",
      "Under the agency's plan, nicotine would be capped at levels that \u201ccould no longer create and sustain this addiction among people who smoke.\u201d The agency's 334-page analysis was posted online in the federal register Wednesday morning.",
      "Antismoking advocates overwhelmingly back the idea and urged Kennedy to help implement it, if he is confirmed.",
      "\u201cTobacco regulation is a huge part of reaching the goals he\u2019s outlined for reducing chronic disease and a really important part of the conversation we need to have in this country,\u201d said Chrissie Juliano of the Big Cities Health Coalition, which represents the heads of more than 30 metropolitan health departments",
      "Smoking causes more than 480,000 U.S. deaths each year due to cancer, heart disease, stroke and other smoking-related illnesses. Those conditions often take decades to develop and remain elevated today despite ongoing declines in smoking among adults and teenagers.",
      "The idea of limiting nicotine has its roots in sweeping powers given to the FDA by Congress in 2009 to regulate the tobacco industry. But the FDA\u2019s efforts on nicotine and a host of other tobacco measures \u2014 such as adding graphic warning labels to cigarette packs \u2014 have been hampered for years by tobacco industry lawsuits.",
      "Under the law, FDA regulators can regulate nicotine but they cannot remove it completely. The agency's ability to set a maximum nicotine threshold is unique worldwide and the attempt would represent a first in global efforts to reduce smoking-related deaths.",
      "Currently, there are no U.S. limits on nicotine, which occurs naturally in tobacco plants. There are several techniques for removing it, including chemical extraction and cross-breeding plants.",
      "The FDA formally announced it would begin work on the proposed rule in 2022 and regulators received thousands of public comments from tobacco companies, retailers, health experts and consumers.",
      "The latest FDA announcement comes as smoking in the U.S. continues to fall. Last year, the smoking rate hit another all-time low of just 1 in 9 adults saying they currently smoke.",
      "Low-nicotine cigarettes are not a new idea. Several companies, including Philip Morris, experimented with selling the products during the 1980s and 1990s, without much success. In 2019, the FDA authorized a cigarette that contains 95% less nicotine than standard cigarettes.",
      "The FDA has sponsored studies showing that when smokers switch to very low nicotine cigarettes they smoke less and are more likely to try quitting. That research is considered pivotal to establishing that smokers won\u2019t compensate by just smoking more cigarettes or inhaling more deeply. That was sometimes the case with \u201clight\u201d and \u201clow tar\u201d cigarettes marketed in decades past. Those products were subsequently banned as misleading.",

They protect themselves from the virus with masks and isolate themselves in small family bubbles. Some grasp for unproven strategies \u2014 gargling with antiseptic mouthwash, carrying a personal carbon dioxide monitor to check the ventilation of indoor spaces.",
      "In online support groups, they trade research about the danger of repeat infections and cognitive impairment. They miss the empathy they felt during the early days of the pandemic. Some have lost friendships, but they strive to maintain the social ties that are important to mental health.",
      "Scarbro\u2019s bowling league helps her feel connected to her neighbors. But recently, she\u2019s detected more stares and skeptical looks from strangers when she bowls in a mask.",
      "\u201cThere was more respect and understanding, but now they\u2019re over it,\" she said. \"They expect me to be over it, but they don\u2019t understand that even before COVID-19, these were the precautions I needed to take.\u201d",
      "Most Americans have developed some level of protection against severe disease from previous COVID-19 infections, vaccinations or both. But immunocompromised people like Scarbro, who has common variable immune deficiency, must be constantly vigilant. Unlike the flu, COVID has not settled into a seasonal pattern.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s never a time when they can relax a little bit,\u201d said Andrew Pekosz, a virologist at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cThat\u2019s a really challenging and exhausting thing to ask someone to do.\u201d",
      "Who are the people still cautious about COVID-19? They include young caregivers of vulnerable relatives, people with chronic health conditions and families rallying around a loved one. In interviews with The Associated Press, they talked about how they manage the trade-offs and the toll of isolation on their mental health.",
      "Before the pandemic, Bazia Zebrowski, 61, of Newbury, Ohio, dined out, shopped for groceries and took her dog, Shadoh, to the park. When she felt well, she occasionally could get together with friends despite having myalgic encephalomyelitis, a condition formerly known as chronic fatigue syndrome that causes inflammation, immune system problems, fatigue and pain.",
      "Now she keeps close to home, venturing out only for medical appointments. Her husband does the shopping and wears a mask at his workplace.",
      "They have not had COVID-19 and hope their luck holds. Getting sick would be a disaster, she said, potentially triggering a relapse or superimposing long COVID-19 onto her illness.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t consider myself COVID cautious. I consider myself COVID competent,\u201d Zebrowski said. \u201cCautious would imply that I have an unreasonable fear of something. I do not have an unreasonable fear of this disease.\u201d",
      "What does Zebrowski miss about pre-pandemic times? \u201cI miss the illusion that people are willing to care for each other,\u201d she said. \u201cHow hard is it to put a mask on? It rattles your faith in humankind \u2026 (you learn) how little the people in your life understood how sick you were to begin with.\u201d",
      "Trauma is part of the experience of having a chronic illness, said DePaul University psychologist Leonard Jason, who has studied myalgic encephalomyelitis for more than three decades.",
      "\u201cThen you're traumatized by the societal reaction to the illness,\" he said.",
      "Some people aren\u2019t sick themselves but are taking precautions to protect a family member. Steve Alejandro, 42, of Wentzville, Missouri, calls himself a COVID shielder.",
      "His wife, Ashley Alejandro, 44, also has myalgic encephalomyelitis. \u201cShe\u2019s got maybe four good hours a day,\u201d Alejandro said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a thing in the world I wouldn\u2019t do to protect those four hours.\u201d",
      "Alejandro changed careers during the pandemic, leaving behind \u201cmy whole support system\u201d so he could sell vintage books online from home. His three children \u2014 now 20, 18 and 12 \u2014 never went back to in-person school after lockdowns ended and are continuing their learning at home.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve really come together,\u201d Alejandro said. \u201cThis is a choice that can be made and you can win at it.\u201d",
      "In Miami, Kira Levin is the primary caregiver for her 98-year-old grandmother. She said the thought of getting COVID-19 and risking her grandmother\u2019s health is terrifying.",
      "So, at a July wedding, the 29-year-old was the only bridesmaid and attendee in a mask \u2014 an N95 layered with a pretty mask to match the bride\u2019s green color scheme.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t take off the mask for pictures and nobody asked me to,\u201d Levin said. \u201cAnd I felt incredibly grateful for that.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe have done everything we possibly could to maintain our mental health and our social life,\u201d said Jacqueline, who has an immune disease that makes her vulnerable to infections. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing worse than being disabled and isolated. As someone who has been disabled and isolated, I don\u2019t want that isolation part.\u201d",
      "Jacqueline, 30, and her sister Alexa, 34, launched a dating app in 2022 for people who are disabled or chronically ill, though all are welcomed. Users can add a \u201cCOVID Cautious\u201d tag to their profiles to signal they\u2019re interested in meeting others who take precautions. The Child sisters say 10% of their 30,000 users add \u201cCOVID Cautious\u201d to their dating profiles.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a market that we didn\u2019t expect to target but we happily accept,\u201d Jacqueline said.",
      "Alexa said the precautions started as a way to protect Jacqueline, \u201cbut they\u2019re no longer about that.\u201d She\u2019s trying to avoid long COVID, a long-term disability.",
      "Tossing aside the threat of long COVID is hard to imagine for Yale University immunologist Akiko Iwasaki. Though people have been studying the virus since its emergence, she said scientists still don\u2019t know how pieces of the virus can stick around in the blood of some people for more than a year after they\u2019ve recovered from the illness.",
      "Iwasaki still wears masks indoors and stays up to date with vaccines.",
      "\u201cI just can\u2019t afford to get sick and become chronically ill,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel that we really are in a position to be able to better understand the disease, to help millions of people.\u201d",
      "While Scarbro understands that others are ready to return to \u201cnormal,\u201d it\u2019s not that easy for her or her family. It's true for many others with chronic immune illnesses, said Jorey Berry, CEO of Immune Deficiency Foundation.",
      "\u201cWhile the rest of the world is able to kind of go back to their regular lives, our community doesn\u2019t have that luxury,\u201d she said.",
      "Scarbro, her husband and children are constantly taking into account other people\u2019s COVID-19 safety practices.",
      "And as the world turns back to pre-COVID life, Scarbro's family is doing what they can to keep her healthy \u2014 but not in complete isolation.",
      "\u201cI feel very scared about the future,\u201d she said. \u201cI know that people are done, and I respect that, but it\u2019s only going to make it harder for me and my family to keep me safe.\u201d",

      "Neither case had known recent contact with infected animals or other sick individuals, the health ministry said.

      "In 2022, the virus was confirmed to spread via sex for the first time and triggered outbreaks in more than 70 countries across the world that had not previously reported mpox.

      "Sierra Leone was previously the epicenter of the 2014 Ebola outbreak, the deadliest in history. The outbreak, primarily concentrated in West Africa, affected Sierra Leone the most, with nearly 4,000 deaths out of the more than 11,000 recorded globally.

      "Hundreds of people are fleeing the area, with some hiding in the nearby lush mountains. Colombia\u2019s government has demanded that the National Liberation Army, known as ELN, cease all attacks and allow authorities to enter the region and provide humanitarian aid.",

      "The ELN has been clashing in Catatumbo with former members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, a guerrilla group that disbanded after signing a peace deal in 2017 with Colombia's government. The two are fighting over control of a strategic border region that has coca leaf plantations.",
      "The ELN said in a statement Saturday that it had warned former FARC members that if they \u201ccontinued attacking the population...there was no other way out than armed confrontation.\u201d The ELN accused ex-FARC rebels of several killings in the area, including the Jan. 15 slaying of a couple and their 9-month-old baby.",

      "Israel\u2019s far-right national security minister resigned from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s Cabinet to express his disapproval of the Gaza ceasefire deal",
      "TEL AVIV, Israel -- Israel's far-right national security minister resigned from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Cabinet on Sunday to express his disapproval of the Gaza ceasefire deal.",
      "The resignation of Itamar Ben-Gvir does not threaten the ceasefire, but it does weaken Netanyahu's governing coalition. If other far-right lawmakers leave the government \u2014 as Ben-Gvir has encouraged them to do \u2014 the prime minister could lose his parliamentary majority, potentially forcing early elections.",
      "It was the latest act of defiance by the 48-year-old ultranationalist settler leader who transformed himself over the decades from an outlaw and provocateur into one of Israel\u2019s most influential politicians.",
      "Here is a closer look at Ben-Gvir:",
      "The ceasefire will pause the war and free dozens of hostages held by militants in Gaza. Ben-Gvir opposed the deal because it requires Israel to free hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and to withdraw troops from Gaza\u2019s southern border with Egypt \u2014 and because it leaves open the possibility of Hamas staying in power in Gaza.",
      "Ahead of the resignation, he said the ceasefire was \u201creckless\u201d and would \u201cdestroy all of Israel\u2019s achievements.\u201d",
      "In his Cabinet post, Ben-Gvir oversaw the country\u2019s police force. He used his influence to encourage Netanyahu to press ahead with the war in Gaza and recently boasted that he had blocked past efforts to reach a ceasefire.",
      "He also has paid multiple visits to Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site \u2014 the contested hilltop compound that houses the Al-Aqsa Mosque \u2014 including last month. In one such visit in July, he said he came to pray for the return of the hostages \u201cbut without a reckless deal, without surrendering.\u201d",
      "The move, while legal, was seen as a provocation, violated a longstanding ban on Jewish prayer there, and threatened to disrupt months of sensitive negotiations. The site is revered by Jews as the Temple Mount.",
      "Ben-Gvir has been convicted eight times for offenses that include racism and supporting a terrorist organization. As a teen, his views were so extreme that the army banned him from compulsory military service.",
      "Ben-Gvir gained notoriety in his youth as a follower of the late racist rabbi Meir Kahane. He first became a national figure when he broke a hood ornament off then-Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin\u2019s car in 1995.",
      "\u201cWe got to his car, and we\u2019ll get to him too,\u201d he said, just weeks before Rabin was assassinated by a Jewish extremist opposed to his peace efforts with the Palestinians.",
      "Two years later, Ben-Gvir took responsibility for orchestrating a campaign of protests, including death threats, that forced Irish singer Sinead O\u2019Connor to cancel a concert for peace in Jerusalem.",
      "The political rise of Ben-Gvir was the culmination of years of efforts by the media-savvy lawmaker to gain legitimacy. But it also reflected a rightward shift in the Israeli electorate that brought his religious, ultranationalist ideology into the mainstream and diminished hopes for Palestinian independence.",
      "Ben-Gvir is trained as a lawyer and gained recognition as a successful defense attorney for extremist Jews accused of violence against Palestinians.",
      "With a quick wit and cheerful demeanor, the outspoken Ben-Gvir also became a popular fixture in the media, paving his way to enter politics. He was first elected to parliament in 2021.",
      "Ben-Gvir has called for deporting his political opponents, and in the past has encouraged police to open fire on Palestinian stone-throwers in a tense Jerusalem neighborhood, while brandishing a pistol. As national security minister, he has encouraged police to take a tough line against anti-government protesters.",
      "Ben-Gvir secured his Cabinet post after 2022 elections that put Netanyahu and his far-right partners, including Ben-Gvir's Jewish Power party, into power.",
      "\u201cOver the last year I\u2019ve been on a mission to save Israel,\u201d Ben-Gvir told reporters before that election. \u201cMillions of citizens are waiting for a real right-wing government. The time has come to give them one.\u201d",
      "Ben-Gvir has been a magnet of controversy throughout his tenure \u2014 encouraging the mass distribution of handguns to Jewish citizens, backing Netanyahu's contentious attempt to overhaul the country's legal system and frequently lashing out at U.S. leaders for perceived slights against Israel.",
      "In May, Ben-Gvir criticized Joe Biden when the U.S. president threatened to withhold certain military aid if Israel invaded Rafah. Ben-Gvir, using a heart emoji in a post on the social media platform X, wrote that Hamas loves Biden.",
      "Ben-Gvir's departure does not endanger the ceasefire, and Netanyahu still has a narrow parliamentary majority needed to keep power.",
      "But if other hard-liners follow suit, Netanyahu's government could collapse, which would trigger early elections.",
      "\u201cIt's probable that he has less survival time,\u201d said Shmuel Rosner, a senior fellow at the Jewish People Policy Institute and analyst for Israeli public television station Kan News.",
      "Opposition leader Yair Lapid has said he will provide a political safety net to Netanyahu to ensure the government will not fall over the deal.",
      "But such a partnership is unlikely to last beyond the ceasefire because the two men do not get along and would have a difficult time working together, said Mairav Zonszein, a senior analyst on Israel with the International Crisis Group."

      "Ceremonies have been canceled in areas as distant as the southern Russian region of Saratov and Karelia, almost 1000 miles away on the country\u2019s border with Finland.",
      "Other regions have vowed to carry on with their ceremonies, although melting ice is not the only concern. In the Russian city of Anapa, officials said that the ritual would be held at its traditional place on the Black Sea, despite the thousands of tons of oil that fell into the nearby Kerch Strait on Dec. 15 when two Russian oil tankers sank in bad weather.",
      "Temperatures across Russia have been increasing over the past quarter of a century in line with global warming, says meteorologist Leonid Starkov, who works for Moscow\u2019s Gismeteo.",
      "\u201cA large part of Russia will be warm for these Epiphany celebrations. The average temperature significantly exceeds the norm,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are already seeing a thaw in St. Petersburg. In Moscow, we are seeing a thaw. And in southern Russia, the temperature is already reaching 5 degrees or 10 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit).\u201d",
      "Officials have reacted so far by creating alternative sites for bathers, often in smaller rivers and lakes. The water is still cold enough to send some worshippers scurrying to wrap themselves in large towels, while onlookers watch on wrapped in scarves, hats and coats.",
      "But Russians will need to adapt to a future where extreme or unseasonable weather is more common, says Starkov \u2014 at both ends of the spectrum.",
      "\u201cOut of the six Epiphany celebrations over the past 25 years where the temperature was colder than usual, five were very cold. Extremes in the weather are increasing,\u201d Starkov said."

    "summary": "Water hyacinth was first sighted on Kenya's popular Lake Naivasha about 10 years ago",
    "story": [
      "Water hyacinth was first sighted on Kenya's popular Lake Naivasha about 10 years ago",
      "NAIVASHA, Kenya -- For someone who fishes for a living, nothing says a bad day like spending over 18 hours on a lake and taking home nothing.",
      "Recently, a group of fishermen were said to be stranded on Kenya's popular Lake Naivasha for that long and blamed the water hyacinth that has taken over large parts of it.",
      "\u201cThey did not realize that the hyacinth would later entrap them,\u201d said fellow fisherman Simon Macharia. The men even lost their nets, he said.",
      "The water hyacinth is native to South America and was reportedly introduced to Kenya in the 1980s \u201cby tourists who brought it as an ornamental plant,\u201d said Gordon Ocholla, an environmental scientist at Mount Kenya University.",
      "Water hyacinth was first sighted on Lake Naivasha about 10 years ago. Now it has become a large, glossy mat that can cover swathes of the lake. To fishermen, the invasive plant is a threat to livelihoods.",
      "Usually, the presence of water hyacinth is linked to pollution. It is known to thrive in the presence of contaminants and grows quickly, and is considered the most invasive aquatic plant species in the world, Ocholla said. It can prevent the penetration of sunlight and impact airflow, affecting the quality of aquatic life.",
      "This has caused a drastic drop in the population of fish in Lake Naivasha and some other affected areas.",
      "The East African Journal of Environment and Natural Resources estimated in a 2023 study that the invasion of water hyacinth in Kenyan lakes \u2014 including Africa's largest lake, Lake Victoria \u2014 has led to annual losses of between $150 million and $350 million in Kenya's fishing, transport and tourism sectors.",
      "The fishermen at Lake Naivasha know that well.",
      "\u201cPreviously we would catch up to 90 kilograms (198 pounds) of fish per day, but nowadays we get between 10 kilograms and 15 kilograms,\u201d Macharia said.",
      "This means daily earnings have dropped from $210 to $35.",
      "Fishermen say they have tried to tackle the invasion of water hyacinth but with little success.",
      "\u201cIt grows back faster than we can remove it,\u201d Macharia said.",
      "There are several ways to deal with the plant, including physically removing it, Ocholla said. Another method is introducing organisms that feed on it. Or chemicals can be sprayed to kill the plant, \u201cbut this is not favorable as it would harm other aquatic life.\u201d",
      "Several attempts have been made to convert the plant into a useful commodity.",
      "\u201cThe government had built a biogas processor near the lake where we were supposed to take the hyacinth, but it has never been operational,\u201d Macharia said. He did not know why.",
      "Recently the fishermen, through a Kenyan start-up, began using a method that converts water hyacinth into biodegradable packaging.",
      "HyaPak started in 2022 as a project at Egerton University in Kenya. It seeks to create environmentally friendly packaging.",
      "\u201cOn one hand there is a problem of water hyacinth, and a problem of plastic waste pollution on the other. What we are trying to do is using one problem, the hyacinth, to solve the plastic waste pollution,\u201d HyaPak founder Joseph Nguthiru said.",
      "He said he created the project following a disastrous field excursion that left him and his classmates stuck on Lake Naivasha.",
      "HyaPak has entered a partnership with the fishermen, who harvest the water hyacinth and sun-dry it for a negotiable fee. Then it is transported to the Kenya Industrial Research and Development Institute in Nairobi, where HyaPak is located.",
      "There, it is mixed with what Nguthiru called \u201cproprietary additives\u201d and converted into biodegradable paper material.",
      "HyaPak is targeting the agriculture sector, creating biodegradable bags for seedlings. The bags decompose with time, releasing nutrients that Nguthiru said are beneficial to the plants.",
      "HyaPak works with 50 fishermen at Lake Naivasha, including Macharia. The company said it processes up to 150 kilograms of water hyacinth per week, converting it to 4,500 biodegradable packages.",
      "Experts said scaling up such work will be a challenge.",
      "\u201cSuch solutions and others that have been applied by similar start-ups may be promising and actually work, but if they cannot be scaled to a higher level that matches the invasiveness of the water hyacinth, then the problem will still persist,\u201d Ocholla said.",

      "CARACAS, Venezuela -- Things seemed to be looking up for Venezuela in 2022. Following years of authoritarian rule and withering economic sanctions, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro had agreed to work toward a democratic presidential election. The White House, in return, granted him a financial lifeline: a permit for U.S. energy giant Chevron to pump and export Venezuelan oil.",
      "Oil wells roared back to life and massive tanker ships returned to Venezuela\u2019s coast to be filled with heavy, hard-to-refine crude destined for the U.S.",
      "Maduro's promised election was neither fair nor free, and the longtime president was sworn in this month for a third six-year term despite credible evidence that his opponent got more votes. Yet, the sanctions reprieve the U.S. offered \u201cto support the restoration of democracy\u201d is still helping fill state coffers.",
      "Venezuela's opposition says Maduro\u2019s government has earned billions of dollars from exports allowed by the permit.",
      "The White House has ignored calls from the main opposition coalition, as well as Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. Congress, to cancel a permit that now accounts for around a quarter of the South American country's oil production.",
      "Senior administration officials have struggled to explain why the permit has been left in place under questioning by reporters, saying only that sanctions policy toward Venezuela is frequently reviewed. President Joe Biden told reporters last week he \u201cdidn\u2019t have enough data\u201d to adjust oil-related sanctions before he leaves office Monday.",
      "Venezuela sits atop the world\u2019s largest proven oil reserves and once used them to power Latin America\u2019s strongest economy. But corruption, mismanagement and eventual U.S. economic sanctions saw production steadily decline from the 3.5 million barrels per day pumped in 1999, when the fiery Hugo Ch\u00e1vez took power and began his self-described socialist revolution, to less than 400,000 barrels per day in 2020.",
      "California-based Chevron Corp., which first invested in Venezuela in the 1920s, does business in the country through joint ventures with the state-owned company Petroleos de Venezuela S.A., commonly known as PDVSA.",
      "The joint ventures produced about 200,000 barrels a day in 2019, but the following year, U.S. sanctions imposed by then-President Donald Trump forced Chevron to wind down production.",
      "In 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a 30% decline in the country's economic activity, Venezuela's Central Bank reported year-over-year inflation of over 1,800%. For many, rummaging through garbage in search of food scraps or valuable items became a common activity.",
      "Locked out of world oil markets by U.S. sanctions, Venezuela sold its remaining oil output at a discount \u2014 about 40% below market prices \u2014 to buyers like China and other Asian markets. It even started accepting payments in Russian rubles, bartered goods or cryptocurrency.",
      "Once Chevron got a license to export oil to the U.S., its joint ventures quickly began producing 80,000 barrels a day, and by 2024, they topped their daily output from 2019. That oil is sold at world market prices.",
      "The terms of the license bar Chevron from directly paying taxes or royalties to Venezuela\u2019s government. But the company sends money to the joint ventures, which are majority-owned by PDVSA.",
      "\u201cWhat Chevron is doing is buying oil from joint ventures,\u201d Venezuelan economist Francisco Rodriguez said. \u201cThis purchase of oil is what generates the revenue of the joint ventures,\" and that revenue pays taxes and royalties to Venezuela's government.",
      "It is not clear exactly how Venezuela\u2019s government, which stopped publishing almost all financial data several years ago, uses this revenue. Neither the government nor Chevron have made public the terms of the agreement allowing the company\u2019s return to Venezuela.",
      "Chevron did not answer questions from The Associated Press regarding the joint ventures, including payments made to Venezuela's treasury.",
      "\u201cChevron conducts its business in Venezuela in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations,\u201d Chevron spokesman Bill Turenne said in a statement.",
      "Economist Jos\u00e9 Guerra, a former economic research manager at Venezuela\u2019s Central Bank, said the license\u2019s impact is partly reflected in the nation\u2019s foreign cash reserves, which increased by roughly $1 billion between February 2022 and November 2024, according to the institution\u2019s data. The government uses its dollar reserves in part to maintain an artificially low exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Venezuelan bolivar.",
      "\u201cThe only explanation is that Chevron exports without discounts, it exports everything \u2014 the 200,000 barrels go abroad \u2014 and that is what is feeding the reserves,\u201d Guerra said. \u201cI call it Saint Chevron.\u201d",
      "The outcome of Venezuela\u2019s presidential election, and a subsequent campaign of repression, have prompted new calls to rescind the licenses.",
      "\u201cIn the end, one wonders, and quite rightly so, why the Biden administration continues to maintain a license whose objective was not achieved,\u201d said Rafael de la Cruz, who is an adviser to the opposition campaign of Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez and Mar\u00eda Corina Machado. He said the opposition has estimated that Maduro\u2019s government has received about $4 billion through the operation of the joint ventures.",
      "Venezuela\u2019s National Electoral Council, stacked with government loyalists, declared Maduro the winner of the July 28 election hours after polls closed. But unlike in previous contests, electoral authorities did not provide detailed vote counts, while the opposition collected tally sheets from 85% of electronic voting machines showing its candidate, Gonz\u00e1lez, won by a more than a two-to-one margin. U.N. experts and the U.S.-based Carter Center, both invited by Maduro\u2019s government to observe the election, said the tally sheets published by the opposition are legitimate.",
      "\u201cThe election was stolen. Therefore, the basis for any lifting of sanctions doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d said Elliot Abrams, who was special representative for Venezuela during Trump\u2019s first term. \u201cSo, why isn\u2019t the administration then reimposing the full sanctions?\u201d",
      "Maduro continues to boast of his resistance to U.S. influence. \u201cVenezuela will not be colonized or dominated, neither by carrot diplomacy nor by stick diplomacy,\u201d he said after taking the oath of office on Jan. 10. \u201cVenezuela must be respected.\u201d",
      "The disputed results have deepened Venezuela\u2019s protracted social, economic and political crisis, which has has pushed millions into poverty, stunted hungry children\u2019s growth and driven entire families to migrate. More than 7.7 million Venezuelans have already left their homeland since Maduro became president in 2013.",
      "Rodriguez said in a December analysis that a U.S. government decision to revoke Chevron\u2019s license or further tighten sanctions \u201cwould have discernible effects on migration.\u201d He estimated that more than 800,000 Venezuelans could emigrate between 2025 and 2029 if Chevron\u2019s license is canceled.",
      "After Maduro\u2019s inauguration, Biden defended his decision not to toughen sanctions on Venezuela\u2019s oil sector, explaining that the idea is \u201cstill being investigated in terms of what impact it would have and whether or not it would just be replaced by Iran or any other\u201d country\u2019s oil market.",
      "\u201cIt matters what would happen afterwards,\u201d he told reporters."

      "\u201cIf the authorities are openly abusing the Nobel laureate and demonstratively turning his life into hell, then it is not difficult to imagine the torment that thousands of other Belarusian political prisoners are experiencing,\u201d Tsikhanouskaya told The Associated Press.",
      "In recent months, Lukashenko has pardoned some political opponents, but critics say it's a revolving door, with his government simultaneously arresting others in a continuing crackdown. Nearly 65,000 people have been arrested since 2020, and many of them alleged they were beaten or tortured in custody, which the government denied. Activists say at least seven have died behind bars.",
      "Bialiatski was arrested in 2021 amid raids by the country's KGB. In March 2023, he was convicted on charges of smuggling and financing actions that \u201cgrossly violated public order,\u201d and sentenced to 10 years. Authorities labeled him as especially dangerous because of alleged \u201cextremist\u201d tendencies.",
      "He was transferred to the harsh Penal Colony No. 9 in 2023, and Bialiatski\u2019s wife, Natalia Pinchuk, hasn't heard from him since August, she told AP in a December interview. A food parcel she had sent to him was returned to her in November \u2014 an ominous sign of his bleak conditions.",
      "She gets only crumbs of information from other inmates: His health has deteriorated from months in solitary confinement, his chronic conditions are flaring up, and he needs \u201cspecial medical care,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cHis most recent letter is written in large script, which points to problems with his eyesight. I also know that he has lost a lot of weight and needs medication,\u201d Pinchuk said.",
      "Many in Belarus and the West link Bialiatski harsh treatment to his activities with his human rights group, Viasna. During the post-election protests, Viasna helped thousands of people targeted by law enforcement and documented its widespread violations.",
      "The government responded by shutting down Viasna\u2019s offices and arresting six prominent members. Four of them -- Valiantsin Stefanovic, Uladzimir Labkovich, Marfa Rabkova, and Andrei Chapiuk -- are serving sentences ranging from five years and nine months to nearly 15 years.",
      "\u201cWhen the repressions worsened and it became very dangerous, I asked Ales to consider leaving Belarus,\" his wife said. \"But by that time, Viasna rights defenders had already been arrested, and he said he cannot leave them behind.\u201d",
      "While in detention, Bialiatski was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize jointly with two other human rights groups \u2014 Russia's Memorial and Ukraine\u2019s Center for Civil Liberties. It was seen as the Nobel committee\u2019s rebuke to Russian President Vladimir Putin after Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "But conditions only got worse for Bialiatski. Penal Colony No. 9, near the eastern city of Horki, is where repeat offenders are sent, former inmates say, and it is known for beatings, food deprivation and forced labor.",
      "Ruslan Akostka, released from the penal colony in July, told AP that inmates were ordered not to speak to Bialiatski, or else they'd end up in an isolation cell.",
      "He recalled seeing a gaunt Bialiatski spending hours assembling wooden pallets and army ammunition boxes in what he described as \u201cslave labor.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor lunch \u2014 a few spoonfuls of potato. Bialiatski is very thin, and like everyone, he constantly walks around hungry,\u201d Akostka said. \u201cIt all looks like a concentration camp. After all, hungry prisoners are easier to manage.\u201d",
      "Leanid Sudalenka, a Viasna activist who fled Belarus in 2024 after serving three years in a different colony, described No. 9 as the place where authorities seek to \u201cbreak\u201d political prisoners.",
      "\u201cBialiatski may simply not survive until his release,\u201d he said. The Nobel laureate will be 70 when his sentence ends.",
      "\u201cAuthorities are creating conditions for political prisoners that are akin to torture,\u201d Sudalenka said, adding that he has seen inmates \u201close first their sight, then their teeth, then collapse\u201d from exhaustion and mistreatment.",
      "Bialiatski has faced arrest over 20 times since becoming involved in the pro-independence movement in the 1980s while Belarus was still part of the Soviet Union. He founded Viasna in 1996, and it has become the country's most prominent rights organization, winning international acclaim.",
      "He spent three years in jail on what he called a politically motivated tax evasion conviction in 2011. Released in 2014 following Western pressure, he returned to his activism.",
      "Bialiatski was behind bars for the Nobel ceremony in Oslo, but Pinchuk spoke in his place, describing Belarus as a country where \u201cthe cold wind from the East collided with the warm (of) the European renaissance.\u201d",
      "Human rights activists urging his release include Oleg Orlov, a co-founder of Memorial in Russia who was freed in August with other Kremlin critics in the largest East-West prisoner swap since the Cold War.",
      "Speaking in Vilnius in October, Orlov said it was \u201cunfair\u201d that Bialiatski and other Belarusian figures were excluded from the exchange.",
      "Since June 2024, Belarus has freed 227 political prisoners, according to Viasna, most of whom were jailed after the 2020 protests. But Bialiatski and other key opposition figures, like Siarhei Tsikhanouski and Viktar Babaryka, remain behind bars.",
      "According to Viasna's Sudalenka, Western leaders seeking Bialiatski's release have hit \"a brick wall,\" with authorities in Minsk demanding the lifting of sanctions imposed on the country.",
      "Belarusian officials \u201csee political prisoners as a commodity, and Bialiatski as a particularly valuable asset,\u201d he said.",
      "The U.N.\u2019s Working Group on Arbitrary Detention said in July that the basis for Bialiatski's imprisonment \"was his exercise of freedom of expression and freedom of assembly.\u201d",
      "According to Viasna activist Pavel Sapelka, Bialiatski\u2019s story speaks to the failure of the U.N. and other world bodies to get autocrats to respect basic human rights.",
      "It \u201cnot only demonstrates the worsening of the situation in Belarus, but also acutely exposes\u201d the inability of the international community to protect those standing up for freedom, Sapelka said."

      "The U.S. Embassy in the Philippines says that nearly 200 Afghan nationals have been flown on to the United States after having their special immigration visas processed in the Philippines",
      "MANILA, Philippines -- Nearly 200 Afghan nationals have been flown on to the United States after their special immigration visas were processed in the Philippines as part of an agreement between Manila and Washington, the U.S. Embassy in Manila said Sunday.",
      "The Afghans left the Philippines in several groups on commercial flights last week after completing their application process for resettlement in the U.S., according to the embassy spokesperson Kanishka Gangopadhyay.",
      "An embassy statement expressed \"deep appreciation to the government of the Philippines for their cooperation and support for U.S. efforts to assist Afghan special immigrants.\u201d",
      "The Afghans, including many children, arrived in the Philippines on Jan. 6. Details of their numbers and location were kept secret by U.S. and Philippine officials. Washington covered the cost of their stay in the Philippines.",
      "The Afghans primarily worked for the U.S. government in Afghanistan or were deemed eligible for U.S. special immigrant visas but were left behind when U.S. and NATO forces withdrew from Afghanistan after 20 years of war in August 2021 as the Taliban seized power.",
      "At the time, the Taliban takeover exposed Afghan supporters of U.S. forces to potential retaliatory attacks by Afghanistan's new rulers.",
      "Outgoing President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump have blamed one another for the chaotic pullout of U.S. forces.",
      "Biden discussed the Afghan resettlement issue with Philippines leader Ferdinand Marcos Jr. when he visited the U.S. last year, Philippine officials said. In July, the Philippines agreed to temporarily host a U.S. immigrant visa processing center for the Afghan nationals although there were concerns over security due to threats faced by some of the Afghans trying to flee from the Taliban rule.",
      "A senior Philippine official said last year that the accommodation in the Philippines was a one-time deal.",

      "The Marcos administration has also broadened military and defense ties with the U.S., Japan and Australia and moved to build stronger security relations with France, New Zealand and Canada to strengthen its territorial defense, including in the disputed South China Sea.",
      "That has dovetailed with the Biden administration efforts to boost an arc of security alliances in the Indo-Pacific to better address concerns over China\u2019s increasingly aggressive actions, including in the South China Sea, the East China Sea and in the Taiwan Strait, that have raised tensions to their highest level in decades."

      "Southeast Asian foreign ministers are gathering for their first meeting this year under the regional bloc\u2019s new chair, Malaysia, seeking a breakthrough over Myanmar\u2019s drawn-out civil war and territorial disputes in the South China Sea",
      "LANGKAWI, Malaysia -- Southeast Asian foreign ministers gathered Sunday for their first meeting this year under the regional bloc's new chair, Malaysia, seeking a breakthrough over Myanmar\u2019s drawn-out civil war and territorial disputes in the South China Sea.",
      "The retreat on the idyllic northern resort island of Langkawi was the first major meeting of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations hosted by Malaysia. Officials said it aims to chart the bloc\u2019s direction for the year as it tries to resolve Myanmar's deadly four-year crisis and tensions over China\u2019s increasing assertiveness in the South China Sea.",
      "Malaysian Foreign Minister Mohamad Hasan said ASEAN must bolster unity and make economic integration a top priority amid global uncertainties and the U.S.-China rivalry in the region. He said the second term of incoming U.S. President Donald Trump has also raised questions on how it will shape dynamics in the region.",
      "\u201cThere is much to prepare for. Above all, what we need to anticipate are the potential challenges to ASEAN centrality,\u201d he told the opening of the meeting. \"We must ensure that ASEAN remains our central go-to platform for solution seeking... We are the speakers and not the spoken-for. We must drive our own path forward.\u201d",
      "The crisis in Myanmar has emerged as one of the bloc\u2019s biggest challenges since a military coup ousted an elected civilian government in February 2021, plunging the country into conflict. It has sparked an armed resistance movement, with rebel forces now controlling large parts of the country. The war has killed tens of thousands of people, and displaced millions.",
      "ASEAN\u2019s peace plan and other efforts to seek a solution have been futile as Myanmar\u2019s junta has not been compliant. ASEAN banned Myanmar\u2019s military leaders from formal ASEAN meetings but the bloc\u2019s non-interference policy has hampered its role. The military government plans an election this year to legitimize its rule but critics say polls are unlikely to be free or fair.",
      "Malaysia, which brought Myanmar into ASEAN during its chairmanship of the bloc in 1997, is expected to take a more proactive stance as the Myanmar crisis has led to the flourishing of criminal activities, online scams and human trafficking along Myanmar's border.",
      "Hasan last month said Malaysia had appointed Othman Hashim, a former foreign ministry senior official, as its special envoy to Myanmar to engage various factions in the country to find a way forward.",
      "Tensions in the South China Sea, one of the world's vital shipping lanes, are also high on the agenda Sunday following violent confrontations in the waters last year. ASEAN members Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei along with Taiwan have overlapping claims with China, which asserts sovereignty over virtually all of the South China Sea.",
      "Chinese and Philippine vessels clashed repeatedly last year. Chinese forces also assaulted Vietnamese fishermen and Chinese patrol vessels ventured into areas that Indonesia and Malaysia claim as exclusive economic zones.",
      "The Philippines has pushed for negotiations between ASEAN and China for a code of conduct in the waterway but talks have stalled over disagreements including whether the pact should be binding and its scope of coverage. ASEAN has not openly criticized China, which is the bloc's top trading partner.",
      "As chair, Malaysia is likely to push for quiet diplomacy as it balances security challenges with economic gains, analysts say.",
      "\u201cIt would be pragmatism on Malaysia\u2019s side, as the country \u2014 as well as ASEAN as a whole \u2014 lack the diplomatic and military heft to confront China on the South China Sea,\u201d said Muhamamd Faizal Abdul Rahman, a research fellow at Singapore's S.Rajaratnam School of International Studies."

    "summary": "The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is set to begin on Sunday, pausing the devastating 15-month war between Israel and the militant Hamas group in the Gaza Strip",
    "story": [
      "The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is set to begin on Sunday, pausing the devastating 15-month war between Israel and the militant Hamas group in the Gaza Strip",
      "TEL AVIV, Israel -- After more than a year of devastating war, the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is set to begin on Sunday, pausing the 15-month conflict between Israel and the Palestinian militant group in the Gaza Strip.",
      "The deal is the most significant breakthrough in the war, but its implementation is complex and fragile. It requires cooperation between Palestinian militant groups, the International Red Cross, the Israeli military, mediators from multiple countries and an Israeli government whose coalition is starting to fray as hard-line ministers express their disapproval.",
      "The pause has lifted spirits in Gaza, where 90% of the population has been displaced by Israel\u2019s punishing ground and air bombardments, and vast swaths of the territory reduced to rubble.",
      "In Israel, families are desperate to embrace relatives Hamas took captive in the Oct. 7, 2023 cross-border attack that triggered the war. Israel says 98 hostages are still being held in Gaza, but little is known about their conditions, including if they are even still alive.",
      "The ceasefire goes into effect at 8:30 a.m. local time (0630 GMT). According to the plan, three living female hostages are to be released after 4 p.m. (1400 GMT). Soon afterward, Israel will release around 95 Palestinian prisoners, who are mostly minors or female.",
      "Hamas was supposed to provide Israel with the names of the three hostages on Saturday afternoon, but as of late Saturday night, Israel still had not received the names. The names are to be made public only after the hostages are returned and officially identified.",
      "In southern Israel, schools will begin only at 10 a.m. in anticipation that Hamas could launch rockets toward Israel just before the ceasefire begins.",
      "Israeli troops inside Gaza will be deployed mostly among the territory's borders with Israel and Egypt, and maintain a presence on a road that divides northern and southern Gaza, according to a map released by the Israeli military.",
      "Meanwhile, hundreds of trucks carrying desperately needed humanitarian supplies are expected to pour into Gaza.",
      "If the ceasefire holds, the next exchange is set for the seventh day of the ceasefire, or Jan. 25. Hamas is supposed to release four living female hostages. In exchange, Israel will release between 30-50 Palestinian detainees for each hostage.",
      "Also on the seventh day, Israel\u2019s ground troops begin withdrawing from the central road that bisects the territory, known as the Netzarim corridor. This will enable Palestinians displaced from northern Gaza to begin to return to what is left of their homes.",
      "Security arrangements, including the inspections of Palestinians heading north, are still being hammered out, according to an Israeli military official who spoke on condition of anonymity under military guidelines.",
      "In each exchange, prisoners will be released only after the hostages have arrived safely in Israel. All Palestinian prisoners who were convicted in deadly attacks will be exiled, either to Gaza or abroad. Some will be exiled for three years, others permanently.",
      "The Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt is expected to start operating \u201csoon,\u201d according to Egyptian officials, as they prepare for a surge of humanitarian aid into Gaza. The crossing, Gaza\u2019s main gateway to the outside world, has been closed since the Israeli army took over the area last May.",
      "Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty said on Saturday that Egypt hopes to facilitate more than 600 trucks of aid per day going into Gaza, almost three times the amount of peak levels during the war. \u201cThe most important thing now, in addition to the sustainability of the ceasefire, is to fix the disastrous humanitarian situation inside the Gaza Strip,\u201d he said.",
      "The first phase will last six weeks, or 42 days. In total, Hamas is to release 33 hostages in exchange for almost 2,000 Palestinians held by Israel. There is no information about how many hostages in the first group of 33 are alive. The hostages most likely to be on the list include women, children, elderly and sick hostages.",
      "The prisoners and detainees that Israel will release include over 700 Palestinian prisoners from the Israel-occupied West Bank and Jerusalem whom Israel accuses of being involved in militant activity, as well as almost 1,200 Palestinians from Gaza who are held in Israeli detention.",
      "As the ceasefire progresses, three hostages will be freed each week in exchange for prisoners and detainees.",
      "By the end of the sixth week, all the remaining hostages on the initial list of 33 hostages will be released.",
      "During the third week of the ceasefire, the sides are to open negotiations on \u201cPhase 2\" that aims to end the war altogether.",
      "But there are scant details on what happens after the first six weeks. To help convince both sides to sign on to the ceasefire, foreign mediators left the second phase particularly ambiguous.",
      "The broad outline says all remaining hostages in Gaza, both alive and dead, are to be released in return for a complete Israeli withdrawal from the strip and a \u201csustainable calm.\u201d",
      "Israel says it won\u2019t agree to a complete withdrawal until Hamas\u2019 military and political capabilities are eliminated, ensuring it can no longer rule. Hamas refuses to hand over the last Israeli hostages until Israel ends the war and removes all its troops.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, hoping to persuade his far-right allies to remain in his wobbly governing coalition despite their opposition to a ceasefire, has offered the public no guarantees that Israel will make it to Phase 2. That leaves many families of hostages afraid that loved ones still in Gaza will be left behind.",
      "\u201cWe must protect our ability to return to fighting if we need,\u201d Netanyahu said late Saturday."

      "An Indian court has found a police volunteer guilty of the rape and murder of a trainee doctor, a crime that sparked nationwide protests and hospital strikes last year",
      "NEW DELHI -- An Indian court on Saturday found a police volunteer guilty for the rape and murder of a trainee doctor, a crime that sparked countrywide protests and hospital strikes last year amid renewed concerns over lack of safety for women.",
      "The killing of the 31-year-old physician while she was on duty at a hospital in the eastern city of Kolkata in August highlighted once again the chronic issue of violence against women in the country. The trial in the case was fast-tracked through India\u2019s notoriously sluggish legal system and arguments began in November.",
      "Judge Anirban Das said the sentence for 33-year-old Sanjay Roy will be announced on Monday and could range from life imprisonment to the death penalty.",
      "Police discovered the bloodied body of the woman at the city\u2019s R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital\u2019s seminar hall on Aug. 9. An autopsy later found the victim had been strangled and confirmed sexual assault.",
      "Roy was arrested a day after the crime. He has since consistently maintained his innocence and told the court that he was not guilty.",
      "The case was initially being investigated by the Kolkata police but later the court handed over the probe to federal investigators after state government officers were accused of mishandling the investigation.",
      "After the incident, doctors and medical students across India held protests and rallies demanding justice and better security for them. Thousands of women across the country also protested on the streets, demanding justice for the victim as they participated in \u201cReclaim The Night\u201d marches. Some protesters called for the perpetrator of the crime to be given the death penalty.",
      "The incident highlighted rising sexual violence against women in India and prompted India's Supreme Court to set up a national task force that suggested ways to enhance safety measures in government hospitals.",
      "Many cases of crimes against women go unreported in India due to the stigma surrounding sexual violence, as well as a lack of faith in the police. Women\u2019s rights activists say the problem is particularly acute in rural areas, where the community sometimes shames victims of sexual assault and families worry about their social standing.",
      "Still, the number of recorded rape cases in the country has increased. In 2022, police recorded 31,516 reports of rape \u2014 a 20% jump from 2021, according to the National Crime Records Bureau.",
      "In 2012, the gang rape and killing of a 23-year-old student on a New Delhi bus galvanized massive protests across India. It inspired lawmakers to order harsher penalties for such crimes, as well as the creation of fast-track courts dedicated to rape cases. The government also introduced the death penalty for repeat offenders.",
      "The rape law amended in 2013 also criminalized stalking and voyeurism and lowered the age at which a person can be tried as an adult from 18 to 16."

      "Moscow and Kyiv are seeking battlefield gains to strengthen their negotiating positions ahead of any prospective talks to end the 3-year-old war.",
      "In the past year, Russian troops have slowly but steadily advancing through Ukrainian defenses, seeking to establish full control of the four regions in the east and south that Moscow illegally annexed early in the war but never completely captured. It's also launching waves of missiles and drones to try to cripple Ukraine's energy network and other vital infrastructure.",
      "Ukraine, in turn, has tried to secure and extend its incursion into Russia\u2019s Kursk region. Kyiv's missiles and drones also have struck Russian oil facilities and other key targets important for Moscow\u2019s war machine.",
      "Both sides have taken tough negotiating postures that leave little room for compromise.",
      "Trump, who vowed during his campaign to settle the war in 24 hours, changed that time frame earlier this month, voicing hope that peace could be negotiated in six months. His nominee for envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, says a deal could be brokered in 100 days.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin has declared Moscow\u2019s readiness for talks but emphasized that any peace deal should respect the \u201crealities on the ground,\u201d a not-so- subtle way of saying it must take into account Russia's land gains.",
      "He emphasized in June that Ukraine must also renounce its NATO bid and fully withdraw its forces from Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson \u2014 the regions Russia annexed in September 2022 \u2014 demands that Ukraine and the West have rejected. Moscow also wants the West to lift its sanctions that has limited Moscow's access to global markets and dealt a heavy blow to Russia's economy.",
      "Massive military spending has bolstered Russian economic output that grew by nearly 4% last year, but the weakening ruble and labor shortages fueled high inflation and increasingly destabilized the economy. Last week, President Joe Biden sharpened the pain for Moscow by expanding sanctions on Russia\u2019s vital energy sector, including its shadow shipping fleet used to bypass earlier restrictions.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's initial \u201cpeace formula\u201d demanded Russia\u2019s full withdrawal from all occupied territories, but he later softened his position as Moscow continued to make gains, and he is no longer making that retreat a condition for talks. Zelenskyy has faced reluctance from some allies to offer Kyiv quick membership in NATO, but he insists on strong security guarantees from the U.S. and other Western partners as the key element of any prospective peace deal.",
      "Zelenskyy has emphasized the need for a comprehensive agreement, not a temporary halt to hostilities that would only allow Russia to replenish its arsenal. He has pushed for the deployment of Western troops to Ukraine as peacekeepers.",
      "Putin has similarly rejected a temporary truce, pointing out that Russian troops are pressing an offensive and any break in the fighting would allow Ukraine to get reinforcements and supplies.",
      "\u201cThe Russians are seeing that Trump is going to push for some kind of resolution or some kind of settlement, and they want to grab as much as they can,\u201d said Kurt Volker, who served as special representative for Ukraine in Trump's first term.",
      "Russia controls about a fifth of Ukrainian territory, including the Crimean Peninsula that was annexed illegally in 2014. It held the battlefield initiative for most of 2024, pressing offensives in several sections of the over 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line. Moscow\u2019s gains in the fall were the largest since the opening stage of the invasion.",
      "Ukraine has faced dire manpower shortages as it struggles to mobilize enough recruits to compensate for its losses and increasing desertions.",
      "Michael Kofman, a senior fellow with Carnegie Endowment, observed that \u201cstabilizing the front line is essential to buying time and forcing Moscow to reassess.\u201d He noted that Ukraine\u2019s mobilization rates fell considerably since summer and \u201cmanning levels continued to decline, especially among infantry units holding the front lines.\u201d",
      "Moscow-based military analyst Sergei Poletaev noted that even though Russia lacks resources for a major breakthrough, it has refined the tactic of small-scale, slow advances in multiple sectors.",
      "\u201cMoscow is betting on the physical exhaustion of the Ukrainian armed forces and the Ukrainian state\u2019s meltdown,\u201d Poletaev wrote recently.",
      "Kyiv sought to change its fortunes by launching an incursion into Russia\u2019s Kursk region in August, aiming to distract Moscow's forces in eastern Ukraine and strengthen its hand in negotiations. Russia, initially caught by surprise, intensified efforts to drive out the Ukrainian forces. The U.S., Ukraine and South Korea said North Korea sent 10,000- 12,000 troops to Russia to fight in the Kursk region.",
      "Kellogg, the new administration's nominee for Ukraine envoy, dismissed European fears that Trump could reduce support for Kyiv, saying \u201che\u2019s not trying to give something to Putin or to the Russians, he\u2019s actually trying to save Ukraine and save their sovereignty.\u201d",
      "Volker predicted Trump would urge Putin to end hostilities and warn him that he would sharply increase pressure on Moscow if the Russian leader fails to heed the demand.",
      "If Putin refuses to halt the fighting, Volker said Trump would \u201copen up the spigot\u201d and allow Ukraine to borrow as much money as it wants and buy whatever military equipment it wants while toughening sanctions on Russian oil and gas sector.",
      "\u201cI think those things would be aimed at driving Putin to conclude, \u2018OK, it\u2019s time to stop,\u2019\u201d Volker said.",
      "Other observers warn that Putin would be unlikely to compromise on his war goals, particularly while Russian troops have the upper hand in Ukraine, and the Russian economy has so far survived ongoing Western sanctions.",
      "While seeking to cement his gains and win Western guarantees that Ukraine will never be invited to join NATO, Putin also wants Kyiv to accept a set of language, education and cultural policies to ensure its friendly policies toward Moscow.",
      "\u201cPutin has tied his war to achieving this and is unlikely to retreat,\u201d Tatyana Stanovaya of the Carnegie Russia and Eurasia Center wrote in a commentary. \u201cInstead, he will likely intensify efforts.\u201d",
      "She added that Russia\u2019s demand for Ukraine\u2019s \u201cdemilitarization\u201d implies not only deep cuts in its armed forces but also seeks Western guarantees it won't rearm its ally.",
      "\u201cMoscow views any military support for Ukraine as inherently hostile,\u201d she said.",
      "Putin is unlikely to walk back his annexation of the four Ukrainian regions, a seizure that already has been written into the Russian constitution.",

      "Many Moscow analysts are skeptical of prospects for a peace deal, noting the widely divergent positions on both sides. Some say a failure in the talks could put Russia and the U.S. on the brink of a direct conflict if Trump decides to ramp up military support for Ukraine.",
      "\u201cThey tend to think in the West that Putin will get scared and agree to a ceasefire,\u201d wrote Poletaev, the Moscow-based analyst. \u201cJust the opposite. Putin will likely opt for an escalation and fight fire with fire.\"",

      "A train station in Damascus was once the pride of the Syrian capital, an essential link between Europe and the Arabian Peninsula during the Ottoman Empire and then a national transit hub",
      "DAMASCUS, Syria -- A train station in Damascus was once the pride of the Syrian capital, an essential link between Europe and the Arabian Peninsula during the Ottoman Empire and then a national transit hub. But more than a decade of war left it a wasteland of bullet-scarred walls and twisted steel.",
      "The Qadam station's remaining staff say they still have an attachment to the railway and hope that it, like the country, can be revived after the swift and stunning downfall of leader Bashar Assad last month.",
      "On a recent day, train operator Mazen Malla led The Associated Press through the landscape of charred train cars and workshops damaged by artillery fire. Bullet casings littered the ground.",
      "Malla grew up near the station. His father, uncles and grandfather all worked there. Eventually he was driving trains himself, spending more than 12 hours a day at work.",
      "\u201cThe train is a part of us,\" he said with a deep, nostalgic sigh, as he picked up what appeared to be a spent artillery shell and tossed it aside. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t see my kids as much as I would see the train.\u201d",
      "The Qadam station was the workhorse of the iconic Hejaz Railway that was built under the Ottoman Empire\u2019s Sultan Abdulhamid II in the early 1900s, linking Muslim pilgrims from Europe and Asia via what is now Turkey to the holy city of Medina in present-day Saudi Arabia. The line also transported troops and equipment for the empire that controlled large swaths of the Arabian Peninsula.",
      "That glory was short-lived. The railway soon became a target of Arab fighters in an armed uprising during World War I backed by Britain, France and other Allied forces that eventually took down the Ottoman Empire.",
      "In the following decades, Syria used its section of the railway to transport people between Damascus and its second city of Aleppo, along with several towns and neighboring Jordan. While the main station, still intact a few miles away, later became a historical site and events hall, Qadam remained the busy home of the workshops and people making the railway run.",
      "As train cars were upgraded, the old wooden ones were placed in a museum. The Qadam station, however, retained its structure of Ottoman stone and French bricks from Marseille.",
      "But war tore it apart after Assad's crackdown on protesters demanding greater freedoms.",
      "\u201cThe army turned this into a military base,\u201d Malla said. Workers like him were sent away.",
      "Qadam station was too strategic for soldiers to ignore. It gave Assad's forces a vantage point on key rebel strongholds in Damascus. Up a flight of stairs, an office became a sniper's nest.",
      "Slogans praising Assad and the Lebanese Hezbollah militant group, a key ally of the ousted leader, can still be seen on the walls.",
      "\u201cWe will kneel and kiss wherever Assad walks,\u201d one says.",
      "The nearby neighborhood of Al-Assali is now mostly in ruins after becoming a no man\u2019s land between the station and the Palestinian refugee camp of Yarmouk that became a rebel stronghold and was besieged and bombarded for years by government forces.",
      "The fighting entered the railway station at least once, in 2013. Footage widely circulated online showed rebels firing assault rifles and taking cover behind trains.",
      "Malla and his family fled their home near the station to a nearby neighborhood. He heard the fighting but prayed that the station that had long been his family's livelihood would be left unscathed.",
      "Assad's forces cleared the rebels from Damascus in 2018. The train station, though badly wrecked, was opened again, briefly, as a symbol of triumph and revival. Syrian state media reported that trains would take passengers to the annual Damascus International Fair. It broadcast images of happy passengers by the entrance and at the destination, but not of the station's vast damage.",
      "Syria\u2019s railway never returned to its former prosperity under Assad, and Malla stayed away as the military maintained control of much of Qadam. After Assad was ousted and the insurgents who forced him out became the interim administration, Malla returned.",
      "He found his home destroyed. The station, which he described as \u201cpart of my soul,\u201d was badly damaged.",
      "\u201cWhat we saw was tragic,\u201d he said. \"It was unbelievable. It was heartbreaking.\u201d",
      "The train cars were battered and burned. Some were piles of scrap. The museum had been looted and the old trains had been stripped for sale on Syria\u2019s black market.",
      "\u201cEverything was stolen. Copper, electric cables and tools \u2014 they were all gone,\u201d Malla said.",
      "The trains' distinctive wooden panels had disappeared. Malla and others believe that Assad's fighters used them as firewood during the harsh winters.",
      "In the former no man's land, packs of stray dogs barked and searched for food. Railway workers and families living at the train station say an urban legend spread that the dogs ate the bodies of captives that Assad\u2019s notorious web of intelligence agencies killed and dumped late at night.",
      "Now Malla and others hope the railway can be cleared of its rubble and its dark past and become a central part of Syria's economic revival after war and international isolation. They dream of the railway helping to return the country to its former status as a key link between Europe and the Middle East.",
      "There is much work to be done. About 90% of Syria's population of over 23 million people live in poverty, according to the United Nations. Infrastructure is widely damaged. Western sanctions, imposed during the war, continue.",
      "But already, neighboring Turkey has expressed interest in restoring the railway line to Damascus as part of efforts to boost trade and investment.",
      "That prospect excites Malla, whose son Malek spent much of his teenage years surviving the war. At his age, his father and uncle were already learning how to operate a steam engine.",
      "\u201cI hope there will soon be job opportunities, so my son can be employed,\u201d Malla said. \u201cThat way he can revive the lineage of his grandfather, and the grandfather of his grandfather.\""

    "published": "Sat, 18 Jan 2025 12:34:16 -0500",
    "summary": "A settlement has been reached by North Carolina's Insurance Department and the industry that sells homeowner policies",
    "story": [
      "A settlement has been reached by North Carolina's Insurance Department and the industry that sells homeowner policies",
      "RALEIGH. N.C. -- Base rates for North Carolina homeowners' insurance premiums will increase on average by about 15% by mid-2026 as part of a settlement reached by the state Insurance Department and the industry.",
      "The agreement announced Friday by Commissioner Mike Causey contrasts with the January 2024 request by the North Carolina Rate Bureau, which represents insurance companies, seeking a 42.2% overall average increase.",
      "Causey, an elected official who began his third term earlier this month, formally rejected the bureau's request last year. That led to a formal hearing that began in October and included multiple weeks of witnesses, evidence and arguments. The state Insurance Department said its witnesses would contend rates should be lowered or increased by less than 3%.",
      "Except for the settlement, a hearing officer \u2014 in consultation with Causey \u2014 would have decided what the new rates should be. The Rate Bureau could have appealed that decision in court.",
      "Causey said in a news release that the proposed rate increases \u201care sufficient to make sure that insurance companies, who have paid out large sums due to natural disasters and face increasing reinsurance costs due to national catastrophes, have adequate funds on hand to pay claims.\"",
      "The bureau attributed its large request to high inflation \u2014 particularly on building materials \u2014 combined with calamitous storms and \u201cseverely inadequate\u201d premium rates to cover claims. The bureau\u2019s requested increases had varied widely from just over 4% in parts of the mountains to over 99% in some beach areas.",
      "The agreed-upon increases, carried out in two parts, will vary based on location. On average statewide, the base rate will increase by 7.5% on June 1 and by another 7.5% on June 1, 2026.",
      "The highest increases generally will occur in parts of eastern North Carolina hit hard by Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and Hurricane Florence in 2018, The News & Observer of Raleigh reported. For example, beach areas from Carteret to Brunswick counties will see an average 16% increase in mid-2025 and an additional 15.9% in mid-2026.",
      "Areas harmed the most by historic flooding from Hurricane Helene in the fall will face lower-than-average increases. Base rates in Buncombe, Watauga and Yancey counties, for example, will increase by 4.4% in 2025 and 4.5% in mid-2026.",
      "Among highly populated areas, base rates in Raleigh and Durham will increase on average by 7.5% in each of the next two years. In Charlotte, rates would increase by 9.3% in 2025 and by 9.2 % in 2026.",
      "The settlement also bars the Rate Bureau from undertaking an effort to increase rates again before June 1, 2027, Causey's release said.",
      "Bureau Chief Operating Officer Jarred Chappell said separately that the settlement is \u201ca step in the right direction\" but that the bureau had asked for a larger increase \u201cbecause that\u2019s what recent claims data called for.\"",
      "\"Storms have gotten stronger and more damaging, more people are living in disaster-prone areas, inflation in the construction industry has been particularly high and reinsurance costs have exploded. All these cost drivers remain an issue,\u201d Chappell said in a written statement.",
      "North Carolina insurance law contains a \u201cconsent-to-rate\u201d exception that allows industry members to insure high-risk homeowners if they agree to pay premiums at rates that are up to 250% of the bureau\u2019s rate.",
      "While some insurers have pulled out of disaster-prone parts of North Carolina, the exception has helped prevent a mass exodus of home insurers from the state. About 40% of the state\u2019s homeowners\u2019 policies were set by consent-to-rate policies in 2022, The News & Observer reported."

      "The U.S. Justice Department has filed a lawsuit accusing Walgreens of filling millions of prescriptions for Americans over the last decade and more without a legitimate purpose, including for dangerous amounts of opioids",
      "DEERFIELD, Ill. -- The U.S. Justice Department is accusing Walgreens of filling millions of prescriptions in the last decade and more without a legitimate purpose, including for dangerous amounts of opioids, according to a lawsuit filed this week.",
      "Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, the complaint says the drugstore chain's pharmacists filled controlled substance prescriptions with clear red flags that indicated they were highly likely to be unlawful. Walgreens also systematically pressured pharmacists to fill prescriptions without taking the time to confirm their validity, according to the complaint.",
      "The lawsuit says Walgreens filled \u201cunlawful\u201d prescriptions in violation of the federal Controlled Substances Act and sought reimbursement from federal health care programs for them in violation of the False Claims Act.",
      "Walgreens, one of the country\u2019s largest pharmacy chains, with over 8,000 locations, said in a statement that it stands behind its pharmacists. It said they say fill legitimate prescriptions for Food and Drug Administration-approved medications written by Drug Enforcement Administration-licensed prescribers in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.",
      "Walgreens is also accused of ignoring evidence, including from its own pharmacists and internal data, that stores were dispensing unlawful prescriptions, according to the complaint. In addition, it allegedly deprived pharmacists of crucial information including by preventing them from warning each another about particular prescribers.",
      "\u201cThis lawsuit seeks to hold Walgreens accountable for the many years that it failed to meet its obligations when dispensing dangerous opioids and other drugs,\u201d Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division, said in a statement. \u201cThese practices allowed millions of opioid pills and other controlled substances to flow illegally out of Walgreens stores.\u201d",
      "The company said it is asking the court to clarify the responsibilities of pharmacies and pharmacists and to protect against the government\u2019s attempt to enforce arbitrary \u201crules\u201d that do not appear in any law or regulation and never went through any official rulemaking process.",
      "\u201cWe will not stand by and allow the government to put our pharmacists in a no-win situation, trying to comply with \u201crules\u201d that simply do not exist,\u201d Walgreens said in the statement.",
      "The company also said it has been a leader in providing education and resource, as well as implementing the best policies and procedures to help combat opioid misuse.",
      "The DOJ filed a similar lawsuit against CVS in December. A spokesperson for that chain has said it strongly disagrees with the allegations and what it called a \u201cfalse narrative\u201d in the complaint.",
      "Federal prosecutors have been trying to hold companies accountable for their alleged roles in the U.S. addiction and overdose crisis, with opioids tied to over 80,000 annual deaths in some recent years.",
      "During the past decade, most of those deaths have mostly been attributed to illicit fentanyl, which is laced into many illegal drugs. Prescription pills were the primary cause earlier.",
      "Over the past eight years, drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies have agreed to approximately $50 billion in settlements with governments, with the majority of the money going toward fighting the crisis."

    "story": [
      "A fire at a one of the world\u2019s largest battery plants in California contained tens of thousands of lithium batteries that store power from renewable energy sources",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- A fire at one of the world\u2019s largest battery plants in Northern California contained tens of thousands of lithium batteries that store power from renewable energy and have become a growing electricity source.",
      "By a long shot, California and Texas are opening more large-scale battery projects than anywhere else in the U.S., bolstering power reliability in two large states where extreme weather fueled by climate change has led to electricity shortages and blackouts.",
      "The fire that started Thursday at the Vistra Energy battery plant in Moss Landing, roughly 80 miles (about 130 kilometers) south of San Francisco, led to 1,700 people evacuating, closed part of Highway 1 and generated huge flames and significant amounts of smoke. The cause is under investigation.",
      "Experts say lithium batteries are a safe technology essential for lowering carbon emissions and making grids more reliable. Still, residents near the fire expressed concerns about the impact.",
      "In Texas, which is bracing for another blast of Artic winter weather next week, officials have credited batteries with helping stabilize the state\u2019s independent grid, which was pushed to the brink of collapse during a deadly winter storm in 2021.",
      "Here\u2019s how and why batteries are booming in the two states:",
      "Both Texas and California grapple with blackouts while trying to meet the energy needs of tens of millions of people as well as industry, including artificial intelligence and data centers.",
      "Batteries soak up excess wind and solar energy for later use. That backup supply helps the grid during times of high demand, such as during a heat wave, when air conditioning use is heavy.",
      "The cost of lithium batteries has dropped dramatically, boosting their popularity. For electric vehicle lithium batteries, as an example, prices fell by about 90% between 2008 to 2022, according to the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Vehicle Technologies Office.",
      "Cheaper lithium has made utility-scale batteries more cost-competitive than some natural gas alternatives. Batteries can also be switched on and discharge power in a matter of seconds.",
      "The Texas grid is rapidly gaining utility-scale batteries and added a whopping 5 gigawatts of storage over the last year, helping to keep up with demand and avoid blackouts.",
      "The 2021 blackout and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 have helped drive the expansion. Texas\u2019 deregulatory environment has also allowed wind and solar projects to develop quickly and easily, increasing the demand for batteries.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot less red tape that power plants have to go through in Texas,\u201d said Joshua Rhodes, an energy researcher at The University of Texas at Austin. \u201cTexas generally doesn\u2019t have any regulations that stop development.\u201d",
      "Some experts say the cheaper cost of batteries is fueling their rapid adoption more than anything, however.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s as much of a story of regulation as it is economic efficiency,\u201d said Jay Turner, professor of environmental science at Wellesley College. \u201cThe price of batteries and renewable generation has fallen so much that batteries and solar and wind, when put together, are so cost-competitive.\u201d",
      "The state has long pursued sustainable energy and in 2002 created a set of clean energy standards that the International Energy Agency considers one of the most ambitious in the nation.",
      "As solar and wind became increasingly popular, there were concerns that it would be extremely challenging to integrate that energy into the grid because of their intermittent nature.",
      "\u201cEven back in 2005, it was like any more than 15% renewables on the grid would be impossible,\u201d said Sally Benson, professor of energy science engineering at Stanford University. Last year California had more than 11 gigawatts of utility-scale storage on the grid.",
      "Part of California\u2019s motivation to act stems from electricity shortages. In 2020 the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) ordered rotating outages because the grid was overwhelmed with demand during a heat wave.",
      "Since then several gigawatts of battery storage has been added, a major reason CAISO hasn\u2019t ordered rotating outages in nearly four years, according to Denise Grab, an energy policy researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles.",

      "With President-elect Trump adding uncertainty around whether a TikTok ban will go into effect, the focus is now turning to companies like Google and Apple",
      "With President-elect Donald Trump adding uncertainty around whether a TikTok ban will go into effect, the focus is now turning to companies like Google and Apple that are expected to take the popular video sharing app off their platforms in just two days.",
      "Though the Supreme Court on Friday unanimously upheld a federal law that could ban TikTok nationwide, it\u2019s unclear how a shutdown of the popular social media platform will play out and what Americans will see when the clock strikes midnight on Sunday.",
      "The court decision comes against a backdrop of unusual political agitation by Trump, who vowed that he could negotiate a solution after he takes office, and the administration of President Joe Biden, which has signaled it won\u2019t enforce the law beginning Sunday, his final full day in office. Now, tech observers \u2014 and some users \u2014 are intently watching to see what happens over the weekend and beyond.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really in uncharted territory here in terms of tech policy,\u201d said Sarak Kreps, the director of Cornell University\u2019s Tech Policy Institute.",
      "Under the law, mobile app stores \u2014 like the ones operated by Apple and Google \u2014 and internet hosting services will face major fines if they continue to distribute the platform to U.S. users beyond the deadline for divestment from ByteDance, TikTok\u2019s China-based parent company. The companies could pay up to $5,000 for each user who continues to access TikTok, meaning penalties could total to a large sum.",
      "A lawyer representing TikTok told Supreme Court justices last week that the platform will \u201cgo dark\u201d on Jan. 19 if the law isn\u2019t struck down. But TikTok, which is not required to block its own platform under the statute, has not said whether it will limit access to the app, or its website, on Sunday. Experts have noted TikTok\u2019s app should remain available for current users, but existing ones will no longer be able to update it, making it unusable in the long term.",
      "Trump\u2019s national security adviser has signaled this week that the incoming administration may take steps to \u201ckeep TikTok from going dark,\u201d though what that looks like \u2014 and if any of those steps can withhold legal scrutiny \u2014 remains unclear.",
      "\u201cMy decision on TikTok will be made in the not-too-distant future, but I must have time to review the situation,\u201d Trump said Friday in a post on Truth Social after the court\u2019s ruling. Earlier in the day, he said in another post that TikTok was among the topics in his conversation with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.",
      "In the meantime, some of the attention has turned to tech companies, such as Apple, Google and Oracle, who currently offer TikTok on their app stores or host company data on their servers.",
      "Tech CEOs have been attempting to forge friendlier ties with Trump, who wants to put the TikTok ban on hold, since he was elected in November. But Kreps said it would \u201cdefy credulity\u201d for them to continue to offer TikTok, even if they want to please Trump, since it would open them up to punitive fines.",
      "Tech companies are also used to removing apps at the behest of governments. In 2023, Apple says it removed nearly 1,500 apps globally. Nearly 1,300 of the apps were taken down in China.",
      "\u201cPenalties for companies like Apple and Google could run as high as $850 billion,\u201d Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., wrote on X on Thursday, while referring to the U.S. TikTok law. \u201cNot sure I\u2019d take a politician\u2019s word if I ran those companies.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, David Choffnes, executive director of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute at Northeastern University in Boston, said he believes there\u2019s a \u201csmall chance\u201d that nothing happens to TikTok, but acknowledged that would require \u201cenormous risk on the on the part of the companies that support them.\u201d",
      "Apple, Google and Oracle did not respond to questions sent this week about their plans on TikTok.",
      "In a video after the court ruling, TikTok CEO Shou Chew, who is expected to attend Trump\u2019s inauguration and be granted a prime seating location on the dais, thanked the president-elect for \u201chis commitment to work\u201d with TikTok to \u201cfind a solution\u201d that keeps the platform available.",
      "\u201cWe are grateful and pleased to have the support of a president who truly understands our platform \u2014 one who has used TikTok to express his own thoughts and perspectives, connecting with the world and generating more than 60 billion views of his content in the process,\u201d Chew said.",
      "Earlier this week, TikTok told its U.S. employees that its offices would remain open for work even if the \u201csituation\u201d won\u2019t be resolved by Sunday. In the memo, which was first reported by The New York Times and confirmed by the company, TikTok told workers that their \u201cemployment, pay and benefits\u201d were secure, adding that the law was written in a way that impacts the U.S. user experience, not the entities that employ them.",
      "Meanwhile, in a letter sent Friday to Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland, an attorney for TikTok creators who sued the government asked the administration to pause enforcement of the law \u201cuntil there is further definitive guidance.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn addition, we request that you clarify that no app store, internet hosting service, or other provider faces any risk of enforcement or penalties with respect to TikTok, CapCut, or any other ByteDance apps, until such further guidance has been issued,\u201d said the letter by attorney Jeffrey Fisher."

      "The U.S. is inching closer and closer to a potential TikTok ban \u2014 with the nation\u2019s highest court upholding a law that\u2019s set to officially cut the cord and halt new downloads off the app starting Sunday",
      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. is inching closer and closer to a potential TikTok ban \u2014 with the nation's highest court upholding a law that's set to halt new downloads of the app starting Sunday. But many questions around what exactly this ban will look like, and whether it will actually be enforced, remain.",
      "That puts millions of users and content creators in limbo \u2014 particularly influencers and small business owners who have come to rely on the mega-popular social media platform as a source of income.",
      "Among those individuals is Terrell Wade, a comedian, actor and content creator with 1.5 million followers on TikTok under the handle @TheWadeEmpire. Wade, who has turned his TikTok presence into a full-time job, said he expects \u201ctwo days of chaos\u201d as the Sunday deadline nears.",
      "\u201cAt this point, I really don\u2019t know what to believe,\u201d Wade told The Associated Press.",
      "In a unanimous decision on Friday, the Supreme Court upheld a federal law that will ban TikTok unless it\u2019s sold by its China-based parent company before Jan. 19 \u2014 ruling that a risk to national security posed by the platform's ties to China overcomes First Amendment concerns about limiting free speech on and by the app.",
      "A sale does not appear imminent, meaning the ban should go into effect Sunday. But the ruling also arrives just days before the inauguration of a new president.",
      "President Joe Biden's administration has maintained that TikTok must change its ownership to address national security concerns, but signaled that it won't enforce the law on Sunday, the Democrat's final full day in office. On Friday, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that actions to enforce the law will fall to the new administration due to \u201cthe sheer fact of timing.\" Meanwhile, Republican President-elect Donald Trump, who once also tried to ban TikTok, has now vowed to preserve access to the platform. But what his options will be following Monday's inauguration remains unclear.",
      "Among other points of confusion is what a ban on TikTok will look like. Experts have said the app will not disappear from existing users\u2019 devices once the law takes effect. But new users won\u2019t be able to download it and updates will not be available. That will eventually render the app unworkable, the Justice Department said in court filings.",
      "All of this is \u201ca reminder to the creator community that social media platforms can come and go,\u201d notes Kelsey Chickering, a principal analyst at Forrester, stressing the disruptions TikTok creators and influencers will feel if the ban takes effect. If access is lost, she adds, many will have to pivot and re-build their presence on other platforms.",
      "While bracing for a potential Sunday ban, Wade is among creators who hope that something happens to avert the shutdown, although he thinks he has enough followers on other platforms to stay afloat.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m still remaining optimistic,\" he said.",
      "Still, many continue to express fears over the potential of losing TikTok.",
      "Janette Ok, a full-time content creator based in Los Angeles, says TikTok is the primary platform she uses today. As an influencer and also an artist, she says the platform has helped her make brand deals and promote her music \u2014 bringing \u201copportunities that I never believed I could experience in my lifetime.\u201d",
      "Ok was also among influencers who TikTok brought to Washington in 2023 to lobby for the preservation of the app, and remembers a ban being discussed as far back as 2020. And as someone who is Asian, the efforts to ban TikTok over the years have also felt \u201ca little xenophobic,\u201d she added.",
      "\u201cI hear all these different things, and I don\u2019t know what to believe \u2014 so that\u2019s where I\u2019m very frustrated. I\u2019m confused. I\u2019m disappointed,\" Ok said. \"It\u2019s a beautiful app, it\u2019s brought so many people together, it\u2019s changed a lot of people\u2019s lives, and for it to just be taken away like that feels ... so not American.\u201d",
      "Jordan Smith, a former WNBA player who operates The Elevated Closet in Austin, Texas \u2014 a clothing brand for tall women \u2014 depends on TikTok and TikTok Shop to find customers that fit her niche demographic that\u2019s difficult to specifically market to otherwise.",
      "\u201cOn TikTok I\u2019ve just been able to find that audience so much easier,\u201d she said.",
      "She fears losing TikTok will hurt her business, and she'll miss it personally, too. So she\u2019s following what people are saying will happen on Sunday and hopes a ban might be diverted.",
      "\u201cIt kind of seems like Biden\u2019s kind of pushing it off to Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cSo people have hopes that maybe we have a few more days and it won\u2019t go dark on Sunday, but I don\u2019t really know.\u201d",
      "Alejandro Flores-Munoz owns a catering business in the Denver area called Combi Taco, or @combicafe on TikTok. TikTok helped him reach customers without spending money on marketing, he said. He was optimistic that TikTok would stick around until he heard Friday's Supreme Court decision.",
      "\u201cUp until today, I was extremely optimistic. And after today\u2019s Supreme Court decision to uphold the ban or the sale of TikTok, I weigh my options,\u201d he said. \u201cBut honestly, it\u2019s very disheartening, specifically because I truly did rely on the app for my business and my growth of my business.\u201d",
      "Going viral on TikTok helped Ruben Trujillo market his Cafe Emporos Coffeegrams, a card that includes coffee, tea or hot chocolate. He said he\u2019s growing frustrated with the ever-evolving politics surrounding the ban.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like they keep putting the ball in each other\u2019s court, but who\u2019s going to make the decision?\u201d he said. He said small business owners are told to \u201cbe creative, pull yourself up by the bootstraps,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd a lot of people did that, and it\u2019s like those bootstraps are being cut now.\u201d",

      "She brokered a 2023 deal to stop the government from defaulting on its debt. She worked to keep the government from shutting down, preserve disaster relief and address a baby formula shortage. She helped save aid to Ukraine with a loan based on frozen Russian assets.",
      "Young may have been the most powerful low-profile person in the Biden administration. And while President Joe Biden leaves office with a dismal approval rating and a mixed legacy, she departs as the director of the Office of Management and Budget with a record with more wins than losses.",
      "Her formula for success: a blend of understanding the arcana of federal spending, reading the politics of the moment, and convincing reluctant lawmakers that compromise was in their interest.",
      "\u201cShe was an enormous challenge to negotiate with because of her skills, her intelligence and her wicked sense of humor,\u201d said former Republican Rep. Patrick McHenry. \u201cI mean that as the highest of compliments.\u201d",
      "Sitting on a couch in her high-ceilinged office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, Young attributed her success to \"giving Republicans who want to do the right thing the political space to do that.\u201d",
      "Now, the incoming Trump administration will face some of the same vexing issues: raising the debt limit, preparing a budget and figuring out how to extend roughly $4 trillion in tax cuts set to expire after this year while also taming a budget deficit expected to be $1.9 trillion.",
      "Trump has nominated his previous budget director Russell Vought to return to the post. With Republicans controlling the House and Senate, Vought won't necessarily need Young's nimble political skills. At his confirmation hearing Wednesday, he declined to say whether he would allow the remaining Ukraine aid to be spent in accordance with Congress' wishes.",
      "For their part, Democrats will no longer have Young as a deal broker. At 47, Young, whose judgment was honed by nearly 15 years as a House Appropriations Committee staffer, feels no need to sugarcoat the hard math.",
      "She figured out how to balance conflicting issues caused by the mix of challenging numbers and toxic partisanship. She also did it while juggling the challenge of being a single parent to her daughter, Charlie, 3 \u2014 meaning that her evening phone calls with lawmakers, cabinet officials and others often had the soundtrack of cooing and crying.",
      "\u201cTo talk to me is to know I have a child,\" Young said.",
      "She had decided to undergo in vitro fertilization treatments, believing that a woman could take the most high-powered of government jobs as well as handle the demanding work of parenthood.",
      "It meant a messy existence of little sleep, high-pressure phone calls and only four weeks of maternity leave.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t want to make a choice. I wanted the job and I wanted to at least have a shot at being a parent, and both had a high likelihood of failure,\u201d Young said. \u201cI\u2019m glad I chose chaos.\u201d",
      "The process of parenthood also changed her. She wondered how parents with fewer resources could make it, and concluded that people working 40 hours a week ought to be able to afford decent child care and health care.",
      "Young sees much of her approach stemming from how she grew up in Clinton, Louisiana, where her grandmother came out of retirement to be her middle school basketball coach. She stressed to her that she needed to live as a role model would: \"You don\u2019t know what young girl is watching you. So you are always to be on your best behavior. Be a leader of this team.\"",
      "That guided how she drives a deal. She let lawmakers, colleagues and even the president be human. When she negotiated on Ukraine funding, she thought about visiting that country as a congressional staffer and her trip to a child center there, where she played with the kids.",
      "When negotiations were faltering in 2023 to raise the debt ceiling, she worried about a growing number of Republicans who seemed to view default as an acceptable risk. But she says there is still enough of a governing majority who understood the threat to the nation and their constituents.",
      "The talks had become a circus on Capitol Hill, with reporters chasing the negotiators, so she moved negotiations to the Office of Management and Budget conference room with its relative privacy on the White House campus. She said she needed to get the right Republicans, such as McHenry, in the room.",
      "After agreeing on top-line numbers, Republicans said they needed to be able to go to their fellow lawmakers with work requirements on people who receive food aid. Young agreed to their terms, knowing some would lose benefits.",
      "To ultimately settle the deal, Young needed to bring Biden back from a foreign trip in Asia. At their final meeting on a May Friday, Young felt confident she had a deal. But she needed to fly to New Orleans to deliver a commencement speech at Xavier University. Her final phone calls ended at 3 a.m. and she then spent Saturday morning on the phone with Biden going over the deal.",
      "\u201cI'm glad I went,\u201d she said of the speech, but then added with laughter, \u201cThat weekend almost killed me.\u201d",
      "For her part, Young admitted she was most nervous to present the deal to Democratic lawmakers, scared that they might tear her head off for the resulting compromise.",
      "Instead, she got a standing ovation from the room.",
      "\u201cI cried like a baby,\u201d she said.",
      "Young has a position lined up for life after the White House, but it hasn't been announced yet. She said she's looking forward to the idea of living with just one cellphone."

      "As he assumes the presidency for a second time, Donald Trump brings with him a broad expanse of business relationships and financial entanglements",
      "As he assumes the presidency for a second time, Donald Trump brings with him a broad expanse of business relationships and financial entanglements \u2014 and the possibility that those associations could influence his decision-making in the White House.",
      "Trump's team dismisses such concerns. \u201cPresident Trump removed himself from his multibillion-dollar real estate empire to run for office and forewent his government salary, becoming the first President to actually lose net worth while serving in the White House,\u201d Trump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. \u201cUnlike most politicians, President Trump didn\u2019t get into politics for profit \u2014 he\u2019s fighting because he loves the people of this country and wants to make America great again.\u201d",
      "But questions remain. Here's a look at the various connections and potential conflicts in Trump\u2019s second administration.",
      "Launched in 2021, Winning Team Publishing is run by Donald Trump Jr. and Sergio Gor, a Trump adviser selected by the president-elect to run the White House personnel office. Gor also led the pro-Trump super PAC Right for America.",
      "Trump has earned at least $11.6 million in royalties over the last two years from two of his books produced by Winning Team, according to financial disclosure statements filed with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics.",
      "\u201cLetters to Trump\u201d is an anthology of correspondence from celebrities and politicians written to him over the years. \u201cOur Journey Together\u201d features hundreds of photos from his first presidential term with captions \u201chandpicked\u201d by Trump. Another coffee table book, \u201cSave America,\" features reminiscences from Trump\u2019s presidential campaigns and term in office, as well as a lengthy reflection about his brush with death during a July assassination attempt during a rally in Pennsylvania.",
      "Campaign finance records show Trump\u2019s political fundraising committees have paid Winning Team Publishing more than $242,000 for unspecified books and printing services.",
      "The company also publishes titles written by Trump\u2019s staunchest supporters, including GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Fox News host Jeanine Pirro and conservative provocateur Charlie Kirk.",
      "Trump\u2019s name and image are branded on a dizzying array of merchandise that he promotes and profits from through licensing agreements, including Bibles, diamond-encrusted watches, gold-colored sneakers and guitars that cost as much as $10,000.",
      "Thousands of copies of the \u201cGod Bless the USA\u201d Bible Trump sells were printed in China, a country he has repeatedly accused of stealing American jobs and engaging in unfair trade practices. As president, Trump would be able to exempt Bibles and other religious texts from hefty tariffs he\u2019s threatened to impose on imported Chinese products.",
      "Trump\u2019s endorsement of a line of guitars led to a \u201ccease and desist\u201d letter from Nashville-based Gibson Guitars. A company representative said in a brief statement the design of the Trump guitars infringes upon Gibson\u2019s exclusive trademarks, particularly the body shape of the company\u2019s iconic Les Paul model.",
      "Judgments of more than half a billion dollars from civil lawsuits hang over Trump and will be more difficult to avoid than the criminal cases brought by the federal government and then abandoned after his election in November.",
      "A New York judge ordered Trump and his companies earlier this year to pay more than $450 million after ruling he had manipulated his net worth in financial statements to secure favorable loans. That penalty came shortly after Trump was ordered to pay $83.3 million to the writer E. Jean Carroll for damaging her reputation after she accused him of sexual assault. A separate jury awarded Carroll $5 million from Trump for sexual abuse and defamation.",
      "Trump has appealed the rulings in the fraud case and one of the Carroll cases. His latest financial disclosure list more than $101 million in liabilities stemming from the two cases.",
      "As president, Trump can\u2019t pardon himself for penalties imposed in civil cases unrelated to his official government duties, said Richard Briffault, a professor at Columbia Law School in New York. And because the trials have already occurred, he\u2019ll have difficulty arguing the cases are an undue burden on his time.",
      "The constellation of high-end golf resorts Trump owns or manages generated hundreds of millions of dollars for him in 2024 and may pull in even greater sums once he\u2019s back in the Oval Office.",
      "Trump\u2019s financial disclosure reported close to $267 million in \u201cgolf-related\u201d income, with another $161 million in combined \u201cgolf and hotel\u201d proceeds from his Doral golf club in Miami.",
      "During his first term, Trump frequently promoted his golf courses and routinely played at them with a large, taxpayer-funded entourage in tow, leading to criticism that he was using the power of the presidency to enrich himself. Trump pushed to host the international Group of Seven summit at the Doral property in 2019. But he dropped the plan amid accusations he would violate the emoluments clause of the Constitution that bans presidents from receiving gifts or payments from foreign governments.",
      "The golf courses may also attract foreign officials and special interest groups hoping to gain access and curry favor by spending large sums at Trump properties.",
      "Since the start of Trump\u2019s first term in office, the cost to join his private Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, has soared to $1 million, allowing wealthy people to mix pleasure with politics and government business during his frequent visits to the club.",
      "While Trump collects income from Mar-a-Lago \u2014 $111 million over the last two years \u2014 he\u2019s been accused of charging the U.S. Secret Service \u201cexorbitant\u201d room rates of more than $800 per night for agents assigned to protect him when he traveled there and to other Trump family properties.",
      "Who Trump meets with while at Mar-a-Lago and what he discusses are largely hidden from public view. The Secret Service has no electronic systems to screen or monitor presidential visitors to the estate, according to a 2020 federal appeals court ruling.",
      "Trump launched his social media platform, Truth Social, in early 2022, after he was banned from major sites such as Facebook and the platform formerly known as Twitter following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.",
      "While he\u2019s since been reinstated to both, Trump has often used Truth Social for more personal commentary, leaving traffic on X and other platforms for more formal statements and pronouncements. The company hasn\u2019t disclosed how many users it has, so it\u2019s hard to know how broad Trump\u2019s reach there is.",
      "But what is clear is that Trump is the primary player in Trump Media & Technology Group, which started trading on the NASDAQ stock market in March. The incoming president has a majority stake in the company, and said shortly after his general election win that he had \u201cNO INTENTION OF SELLING\u201d his shares, which have significantly boosted Trump\u2019s net worth, and at that time were valued at around $3.5 billion.",
      "Trump has promised to make America the \u201ccrypto capital of the planet\u201d as he returns to the White House, a promise that would likely pay off for him personally.",
      "Amidst the 2024 campaign, Trump launched a new venture to trade cryptocurrencies that he has promoted on the same social media accounts he used for his campaign. His two eldest sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, have also posted about their new platform, called World Liberty Financial, as has his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, who is married to Eric and also serves as co-chair of the Republican National Committee.",
      "The new moneymaking venture could explode in value if Trump pushes through legislative and regulatory changes long sought by crypto advocates.",
      "During his first term, Trump said he was \u201cnot a fan\u201d of cryptocurrency but he has since taken a more favorable view \u2014 from announcing in May that the campaign would begin accepting donations in cryptocurrency to attending a Bitcoin conference in Nashville, promising to make the U.S. the \u201ccrypto capital of the planet\u201d and create a Bitcoin \u201cstrategic reserve\u201d using the currency that the government currently holds.",
      "Several of Trump\u2019s cabinet nominees, including Commerce Secretary nominee Howard Lutnick and Trump\u2019s pick for the Securities and Exchange Commission, Paul Atkins, have substantial cryptocurrency investments.",

      "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- China's population fell last year for the third straight year, its government said Friday, pointing to further demographic challenges for the world's second most populous nation, which is now facing both an aging population and an emerging shortage of working age people.",
      "China's population stood at 1.408 billion at the end of 2024, a decline of 1.39 million from the previous year.",
      "The figures announced by the government in Beijing follow trends worldwide, but especially in East Asia, where Japan, South Korea and other nations have seen their birth rates plummet. China three years ago joined Japan and most of Eastern Europe among other nations whose population is falling.",
      "The reasons are in many cases similar: Rising costs of living are causing young people to put off or rule out marriage and child birth while pursuing higher education and careers. While people are living longer, that's not enough to keep up with rate of new births.",
      "Countries such as China that allow very little immigration are especially at risk.",
      "China has long been among the world\u2019s most populous nations, enduring invasions, floods and other natural disasters to sustain a population that thrived on rice in the south and wheat in the north. Following the end of World War II and the Communist Party\u2019s rise to power in 1949, large families re-emerged and the population doubled in just three decades, even after tens of millions died in the Great Leap Forward that sought to revolutionize agriculture and industry and the Cultural Revolution that followed a few years later.",
      "After the end of the Cultural Revolution and leader Mao Zedong's death, Communist bureaucrats began to worry the country\u2019s population was outstripping its ability to feed itself and began implementing a draconian \u201cone child policy.\u201d Though it was never law, women had to apply for permission to have a child and violators could face forced late-term abortions and birth control procedures, massive fines and the prospect of their child being deprived an identification number, effectively making them non-citizens.",
      "Rural China, where the preference for male offspring was especially strong and two children were still ostensibly allowed, became the focus of government efforts, with women forced to present evidence they were menstruating and buildings emblazoned with slogans such as \u201chave fewer children, have better children.\"",
      "The government sought to stamp out selective abortion of female children, but with abortions legal and readily available, those operating illicit sonogram machines enjoyed a thriving business.",
      "That has been the biggest factor in China\u2019s lopsided sex ratio, with as many as millions more boys born for every 100 girls, raising the possibility of social instability among China\u2019s army of bachelors. Friday\u2019s report gave the sex imbalance as 104.34 men to every 100 women, though independent groups give the imbalance as considerably higher.",
      "More disturbing for the government was the drastically falling birthrate, with China\u2019s total population dropping for the first time in decades in 2023 and China being narrowly overtaken by India as the world\u2019s most populous nation in the same year. A rapidly aging population, declining workforce, lack of consumer markets and migration abroad are putting the system under severe pressure.",
      "While spending on the military and flashy infrastructure projects continues to rise, China\u2019s already frail social security system is teetering, with increasing numbers of Chinese refusing to pay into the underfunded pension system.",
      "Already, more than one-fifth of the population is aged 60 or over, with the official figure given as 310.3 million or 22% of the total population. By 2035, this number is forecast to exceed 30%, sparking discussion of changes to the official retirement age, which one of the lowest in the world. With fewer students, some vacant schools and kindergartens are meanwhile being transformed into care facilities for older people.",
      "Such developments are giving some credence to the aphorism that China, now the world\u2019s second largest economy but facing major headwinds, will \u201cgrow old before it grows rich.\u201d",
      "Government inducements including cash payouts for having up to three children and financial help with housing costs have had only temporary effects.",
      "Meanwhile, China continued its transition to an urban society, with 10 million more people moving to cities for an urbanization rate of 67%, up almost a percentage point from the previous year.",

      "The economy picked up speed in the last quarter, the government reported Friday, growing 5.4% in October-December.",
      "Exports have surged as companies and consumers rush to beat potential tariff hikes President-elect Donald Trump may impose on Chinese goods.",
      "\u201cThe national economy was generally stable with steady progress and new achievements were made in high-quality development,\u201d the report by the National Bureau of Statistics said. \"Particularly, with a package of incremental policies being timely rolled out, public confidence was effectively bolstered and the economy recovered remarkably,\u201d it said.",
      "Manufacturing was a strong engine for growth last year, with industrial output jumping 5.8% from a year earlier. Total retail sales of consumer goods grew 3.5% at an annual rate. Exports expanded 7.1% in annual terms, while imports grew 2.3%.",
      "The world\u2019s second largest economy has struggled with weaker consumer spending and resulting deflationary pressures as its recovery after the COVID 19 pandemic faltered and the property sector, once a main driver of business activity, fell into a downturn.",

      "Zichun Huang of Capital Economics said that the economy regained some momentum last quarter thanks to recent policy easing.",
      "\u201cIncreased fiscal spending should continue to provide a near-term prop to activity,\u201d Huang said in a report. \u201cWe still expect growth to slow for 2025 as a whole, with Trump likely to follow through on his tariff threats soon and persistent structural imbalances still weighing on the economy.\u201d",
      "China\u2019s population also is aging and declining, adding to pressures on growth. The government reported Friday that the population fell for a third straight year in 2024, to 1.408 billion at the end of 2024, a decline of 1.39 million from the previous year.",
      "With costs of living rising faster than wages, young Chinese are putting off or ruling out marriage and childbirth, accentuating the impact of birth control policies that once limited most families to one child each.",
      "Some economists say the economy is growing at a slower pace than shown in official estimates.",
      "\u201cThe precise achievement of the official growth target is highly dubious at a time when most indicators of economic activity and financial markets are flashing red,\u201d Eswar Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell University, said in an emailed comment.",
      "\u201cThe economy continues to be beset by a combination of weak domestic demand and persistent deflationary pressures, in addition to a hostile external environment that could limit exports,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump, who will be inaugurated next week, has pledged to increase U.S. import duties on Chinese goods. This week, the Biden administration also imposed further restrictions on exports of advanced semiconductors and technology, seeking to maintain the U.S. lead on advanced technologies and block China\u2019s access.",
      "The ruling Communist Party has rolled out a series of stimulus measures, including reducing banks\u2019 reserve requirement ratios, cutting interest rates and frontloading billions from its budget in 2025 to fund construction projects. It has ordered banks to lend to beleaguered property developers that were left mired in debt after authorities cracked down on excess borrowing.",
      "National Bureau of Statistics spokesperson Fu Linghui told reporters in Beijing that boosting consumption and expanding domestic demand are priorities this year.",
      "\u201cWith the coordinated efforts of stock policies and a package of incremental policies, the momentum of economic recovery is strengthening, the recovery of consumer demand has accelerated, and there are more favorable factors for a moderate rebound in prices,\u201d he said.",
      "Beijing has expanded a trade-in scheme for consumer goods and raised the wages of millions of government workers to revive domestic demand.",
      "Those incremental moves need to be accompanied by broader structural reforms, some economists say, that will improve productivity and make the economy less reliant on construction and export manufacturing. In particular, private businesses remain wary of boosting investment or hiring after years of policy shifts that have added to uncertainty over their role in the economy.",
      "Scant social safety nets, meanwhile, lead families to save rather than spend, and falling housing prices and weak stock prices have hurt household wealth, compounding the problem.",
      "\u201cChina needs a strong and multi-pronged policy package to revive growth momentum,\u201d Prasad said. Such a package would need to include substantial and well-targeted monetary and fiscal stimulus, complemented by reforms and other measures to revive private sector confidence.\""

      "The problem of kids working in dangerous slaughterhouses continues to be a concern as the Labor Department announced its third agreement this week with a company in the industry agreeing to pay a penalty and reform its practices to help ensure it won\u2019t...",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- The problem of kids working in dangerous slaughterhouses continues to be a concern as the Labor Department announced its third agreement this week with a company in the industry agreeing to pay a penalty and reform its practices to help ensure it won't hire underage workers again.",
      "On Thursday, the Department said investigators found that another slaughterhouse cleaning company called QSI had employed 54 children at 13 meatpacking plants in eight states on overnight shifts sanitizing the industrial carving and slicing machines companies use to produce beef and chicken between 2021 and 2024. This is at least the fourth example of one of these cleaning contractors being caught employing kids in the last two-and-a-half years. QSI will pay a $400,000 penalty.",
      "QSI disputes the way the Department describes the problem and points out that investigators weren't able to find any current juvenile workers and didn't require a formal court agreement with ongoing monitoring like they did a couple years ago with the most egregious offender: the PSSI cleaning company that ultimately paid more than $1.5 million and agreed to changes.",
      "Earlier this week, Perdue Farms agreed to pay $4 million after children were found working at one of its chicken processing plants in Virginia. One day earlier, meatpacking giant JBS Foods also agreed to pay $4 million and make changes to try to keep kids from getting jobs at its plants.",
      "All three of these announcements come just days before President elect Donald Trump takes office, but they follow a number of other child labor investigations in the meatpacking industry in the past few years. To Debbie Berkowitz, who was a top OSHA official in the Obama administration, the flurry of announcements this week helps solidify the Biden administration's legacy of trying to \u201cstamp out child labor in this very dangerous meat and poultry industry\u201d while putting the new administration on notice.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re just going to have to keep an eye on whether this administration decides to make a total U-turn and say, it\u2019s okay for children to be exploited in these dangerous industries and get injured and die and have their futures robbed,\u201d said Berkowitz, who is now a fellow at George Washington University focused on labor issues.",
      "It's against the law for anyone under the age of 18 to work at a dangerous job like a meatpacking plant, but ever since the PSSI investigation was announced in the fall of 2022 investigators keep finding more examples of it. Over the past fiscal year the department found more than 4,000 children in all industries employed in violation of federal child labor laws.",
      "That PSSI case got started after one 13-year-old suffered a serious chemical burn from the caustic chemicals used to clean the JBS plant in Grand Island, Nebraska, every night. But then investigators found more and more examples of PSSI employing children.",
      "That prompted additional investigations and a broad call for the meatpacking industry to tighten up its hiring practices to make sure kids don't get hired. Sometimes the major meat companies, like JBS, Tyson Foods, Cargill and Smithfield Foods, have pointed to contractors as the ones with hiring problems, but officials maintain that the big companies are responsible for all their contractors taking appropriate precautions.",
      "\u201cThe Department of Labor is determined to stop our nation\u2019s children from being endangered in jobs for which they should never be hired and to leverage our enforcement work to affect industries,\u201d said Solicitor of Labor Seema Nanda.",
      "Some of the settlements included a Mississippi processing plant, Mar-Jac Poultry, that paid a $165,000 penalty following the death of a 16-year-old boy. In May 2023, a Tennessee-based sanitation company, Fayette Janitorial Service LLC, agreed to pay nearly $650,000 in civil penalties after a federal investigation found it illegally hired at least two dozen children to clean dangerous meat processing facilities in Iowa and Virginia.",
      "In addition to the federal investigations some states got involved. Last fall, Smithfield Foods, one of the nation\u2019s largest meat processors, agreed to pay $2 million to resolve allegations of child labor violations at a plant in Minnesota,",
      "The Labor Department said that QSI, which is based in Chattanooga, Tennessee, as part of a company called the Vincit Group, employed children on overnight shifts at 13 meat processing plants in Collinsville, Alabama; Livingston, California; Harbeson and Georgetown, Delaware; Milford, Indiana; Ottumwa, Iowa; Canton and Winesburg, Ohio; Shelbyville and Morristown, Tennessee; and Temperanceville, Virginia. The Department didn't name the companies that own those plants",
      "QSI spokesman Dan Scorpio said he doesn't believe that's accurate because investigators didn't provide details of the violations the company could verify. \u201cQSI has a zero-tolerance policy for any employment of underage workers,\u201d he said. \"We have taken extensive steps over the last two and a half years to strengthen our hiring and compliance practices as we continue to serve our customers with integrity and excellence.\u201d",
      "Perdue was employing children at a Virginia plant using dangerous knives and other tools to slaughter chicken.",
      "The JBS agreement didn't include a finding that children were working directly for that company, but there have been examples at its plants.",
      "\u201cThe Department of Labor has made clear that too often, companies look the other way and claim that their staffing agency, or their subcontractor or supplier is responsible. But everyone has a responsibility to keep children \u2014 our most vulnerable workers \u2014 safe,\u201d the Department said.",
      "The Labor Department has more than 1,000 open child labor investigations it is pursuing. And every one of these settlements includes a set of standards for hiring practices that the Labor Department believes will help keep kids from getting hired.",
      "That includes steps like training all managers about how to spot underage applicants and avoid hiring them. False identification documents continue to be a problem. Companies are also expected to require all of their subcontractors to take precautions.",
      "Companies are also expected to set up hotlines where people can report any child labor concerns. And the Labor Department expects them to maintain accurate records of all their employees including their birth dates and work they do.",
      "And companies should discipline anyone who does hire children in violation of labor laws."

      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners seeking to refinance their home loan to a lower rate, also rose this week. The average rate increased to 6.27% from 6.14% last week. A year ago, it averaged 5.76%, Freddie Mac said.",
      "The uptick in the cost of home loans reflects a rise in the bond yields that lenders use as a guide to price mortgages, specifically the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury. The yield on the 10-year Treasury has climbed from 3.62% in mid-September to 4.61% as of midday Thursday.",
      "The elevated mortgage rates, which can add hundreds of dollars a month in costs for borrowers, have discouraged home shoppers, prolonging a national home sales slump that began in 2022.",
      "While sales of previously occupied U.S. homes rose in November for the second straight month, the housing market was on track to end 2024 as its worst year for sales since 1995. Full-year home sales data are due out next week.",
      "The average rate on a 30-year mortgage is now the highest it\u2019s been since May 9, when it was at 7.09%.",
      "Interest rates have been climbing since the Federal Reserve signaled last month that it expected to lower its benchmark rate just twice this year, down from the four cuts it forecast in September.",
      "The Fed is tapping the brakes on rate cuts because inflation remains stubbornly above the central bank\u2019s 2% target, even though it\u2019s fallen from its mid-2022 peak. Economists also worry that President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s economic policies, notably his plan to vastly increase tariffs on imports, could fuel inflation.",
      "Forecasting the trajectory of mortgage rates is difficult, given that rates are influenced by many factors, from government spending and the economy, to geopolitical tensions and stock and bond market gyrations.",
      "Several economists' forecasts call for the average rate on a 30-year mortgage to remain above 6% this year, with some including an upper range as high as 6.8%.",

      "A Toyota division that manufactures trucks will pay more than $1.6 billion and plead guilty to violations related to the submission of false and fraudulent engine emission testing and fuel consumption data to regulators and the illicit smuggling of engines into the United States.",
      "Hino Motors, a subsidiary of the Toyota, first acknowledged in 2022 that it has systematically falsified emissions data dating back as far as 2003.",
      "That was part of a broader scandal involving emissions tests that ensnared other automakers as well.",
      "The Justice Department said that Hino's unlawful conduct allowed it to improperly secure approvals to import and sell, and cause to be imported and sold, more than 110,000 diesel engines in the U.S. from 2010 to 2022. The engines were primarily installed in heavy-duty trucks made and sold by Hino nationwide.",
      "\u201cHino knew the requirements that engines must meet to be certified to operate in the United States, yet it falsified data for years to skirt regulations,\u201d Assistant Attorney General Todd Kim of the Justice Department\u2019s Environment and Natural Resources Division, said in a prepared statement. \u201cHino\u2019s actions led to vast amounts of excess air pollution and were an egregious violation of our nation\u2019s environmental, consumer protection and import laws.\"",
      "Hino Motors Ltd. has agreed to plead guilty to engaging in a multi-year criminal conspiracy. The plea agreement, which is subject to court approval, requires the company to pay a criminal fine of $521.76 million, serve a five-year term of probation \u2014 during which it will be prohibited from importing any diesel engines it has made into the U.S. \u2014 and implement a comprehensive compliance and ethics program and reporting structure.",
      "Hino has also agreed to a forfeiture money judgment against it in the amount of approximately $1.1 billion. As part of the plea deal, Hino\u2019s future payments towards its civil settlement obligations, as well future payments as part of a civil class action settlement brought by private plaintiffs, will be credited towards its criminal forfeiture money judgment obligation.",
      "The Justice Department, Environmental Protection Agency, FBI, Customs and Border Protection, Department of Transportation\u2019s Office of Inspector General, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and State of California reached criminal and multiple civil resolutions with Japanese Hino, which are subject to approval by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.",
      "In separate civil resolutions of environmental, customs and fuel economy claims by the federal government and the State of California, Hino will pay a civil penalty of $525 million.",

      "\"We deeply apologize for the inconvenience caused to our customers and stakeholders. In order to prevent a recurrence of this kind of issue, we have implemented company-wide reforms, including meaningful improvements to our internal culture, oversight, and compliance practices,\u201d CEO Satoshi Ogiso said."

      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- U.S. defense contractor Anduril Industries is preparing to build a massive advanced manufacturing facility in central Ohio, adding a planned 4,000 jobs to the area's burgeoning high-tech sector, state officials announced Thursday.",
      "The Cosa Mesa, California-based defense technology company plans to begin construction of what it's calling \u201cArsenal 1\u201d as soon as state and local approvals are secured. The 5 million-square-foot (464,515-square-meter) facility will be located on a 500-acre (202-hectare) site near Rickenbacker International Airport in rural Pickaway County, about 16 miles (26 kilometers) southeast of Columbus.",
      "Production of military drones and autonomous air vehicles would begin in July 2026 under the plan, said Christian Brose, Anduril's chief strategy officer.",
      "Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said it is the largest single job creation and payroll project that Ohio has announced. The governor said winning Anduril's manufacturing plant marks a continuation of Ohio's history of advanced advanced aviation, which began with the Wright brothers and continues to grow surrounding the Dayton-area Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.",
      "\u201cWe are an aerospace state,\u201d DeWine said. He called Ohio \u201cthe brains of the Air Force.\u201d",
      "DeWine, Lt. Gov. Jon Husted and JobsOhio CEO J.P. Nauseef said that, through targeted economic development efforts, the state boasts a strong and diverse aerospace workforce. They said it also has a network of job training centers, colleges and universities prepared to educate new advanced manufacturing workers. Those helped attract the nationally-competitive deal, they said.",
      "\u201cOhio has literally built a strategy around this kind of project, and so we are perfect for them,\" Husted said.",
      "The aerospace sector in Ohio includes the global headquarters of GE Aerospace and a new Joby Aviation manufacturing facility near Dayton that's preparing to manufacture electric vertical takeoff and landing, or eVTOL, aircraft beginning this year.",
      "Anduril casts the Ohio facility as integral to its goal to \u201cRebuild the Arsenal\u201d of U.S. military weapons and platforms by \u201chyperscaling\u201d manufacturing with advanced software and production technologies.",
      "The latest development adds to what is becoming known as a \u201csilicon corridor\u201d based in Ohio. It includes Intel, which is building a $20 billion chip factory just east of the Columbus, and Honda and LG Energy Solution of South Korea, which are building a $3.5 billion battery plant in nearby Fayette County that the automaker envisions as its North American electric vehicle hub. Ohio State University also announced plans in 2023 to build a $110 million software innovation center to dovetail with those efforts.",
      "At separate upcoming state meetings, the Anduril project will pursue a job creation tax credit from the Ohio Department of Development and a $70 million infusion from the All Ohio Future Fund, which the DeWine administration and lawmakers established to help local governments prepare sites for economic development projects. JobsOhio also plans to provide the project a sizeable grant, whose exact amount will be announced once agreements are signed, as well as talent acquisition services.",

      "Retail sales rose 0.4% in December from the previous month, the Commerce Department said Thursday, though down from November's upwardly revised 0.8% gain.",
      "The figures suggest that even as many Americans are struggling with higher prices and elevated interest rates, a low unemployment rate and rising wages are encouraging millions of consumers to spend, bolstering economic growth. Last Friday the government reported that employers stepped up hiring in December and the unemployment rate fell to a low 4.1%.",
      "Much of last month's increase in spending was driven by a 0.7% jump in car sales, and a 2.3% spike in purchases of furniture. The report isn't adjusted for price increases, though the sales gains mostly reflects greater buying.",
      "After dropping precipitously in 2023, inflation has been stuck at about 2.7% in recent months, and prices are still much higher than four years ago. Still, on Wednesday the Labor Department said that core prices \u2014 excluding the volatile food and energy categories \u2014 rose more slowly last month, as clothing prices barely increases and apartment rental costs climbed at a slower pace.",
      "The cooler core inflation figures renewed hopes among economists and Wall Street investors that the Federal Reserve will cut its key rate further this year, after three reductions last year reduced by a percentage point to about 4.3%.",

      "Auchincloss said that the company is \u201cfocusing resources on our highest-value opportunities\u201d and that it has stopped or paused 30 projects since June.",
      "The reductions come as BP tries to bring more digital capabilities into the business, with artificial intelligence increasingly playing a role in engineering and marketing operations.",
      "In April, Auchincloss announced a plan to make savings of $2 billion (1.6 billion pounds) by the end of 2026.",
      "The plan is designed partly to reinvigorate the company\u2019s flagging share price, which has fallen about 20% since last spring.",
      "BP also has pulled back from a number of renewable energy projects, and according to media reports, abandoned a previous plan to cut oil and gas output by 40% by 2030.",
      "Auchincloss, however, said that the company was still \u201cuniquely positioned to grow value through the energy transition,\u201d but that it needed \u201cto keep improving our competitiveness and moving at the pace of our customers and society.\u201d",

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- It's time for the eighth installment of the riveting, intergenerational rivalry between Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz. This one, though, will be the first at the Australian Open \u2014 and the first in the quarterfinals of a tournament; each of the others came in either a semifinal or final.",
      "\u201cWell, this is not the right player to play in a quarterfinal, I guess,\u201d a grinning Alcaraz said, looking ahead to Tuesday's encounter. \u201cBut facing Novak, for me, it\u2019s not going to change anything if I\u2019m playing him (in a) quarterfinal or semifinal. Probably change a little bit if it is a final, obviously. Being in a quarterfinal, I\u2019m going to approach the match the same as I did in the previous matches against him, and let\u2019s see.\u201d",
      "Alcaraz reached his 10th career Grand Slam quarterfinal, tied for the most by a man before his 22nd birthday, by advancing when 15th-seeded Jack Draper stopped playing because of a hip injury after dropping the first two sets Sunday afternoon.",
      "Djokovic, who is being coached in Melbourne by old rival Andy Murray, did his part at night in Rod Laver Arena, needing to work a little longer but getting through just the same with a 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (4) victory over No. 24 Jiri Lehecka.",
      "Djokovic smacked a ball off a wall in the third set, drawing boos and whistles from some spectators. When they made more noise moments later, chair umpire Mohamed Lahyani admonished the folks in the stands to be more polite toward the players.",
      "Otherwise, though, Djokovic had plenty of support, from the Serbian flags in the stands to the chants of his nickname, \u201cNole,\u201d that reverberated around the main stadium.",
      "Afterward, Djokovic dispensed with the customary on-court interview, instead holding the microphone himself and telling the crowd: \u201cThank you very much for being here tonight. I appreciate your presence and the support. I\u2019ll see you next round. Thank you very much.\u201d Then he walked off.",
      "There is plenty at stake at this tournament for both No. 3 seed Alcaraz, who is 21, and No. 7 Djokovic, who is 37.",
      "Alcaraz seeks to become the youngest man to complete a career Grand Slam with at least one trophy from all four of the most prestigious events in tennis. His four so far came elsewhere: two at Wimbledon by virtue of wins over Djokovic in the 2023 and 2024 finals, and one apiece at the U.S. Open in 2022 and the French Open last year.",
      "Djokovic, meanwhile, is trying to claim an 11th title in Melbourne to become the first player in tennis history with 25 major singles championships. He leads the overall head-to-head against Alcaraz 4-3, including a victory in the final at the Paris Olympics last August to claim a gold medal for Serbia.",
      "At the majors, though, Alcaraz leads 2-1.",
      "\u201cIf I think about everything he has done in tennis, I couldn\u2019t play. I mean, 24 Grand Slam, the most weeks at No. 1 \u2014 everything. He almost broke every record in tennis. I\u2019m trying not to think about that when I\u2019m in the match. I\u2019m just trying ... to beat him,\u201d Alcaraz said. \u201cI know my weapons. I know that (if) I\u2019m able to play good tennis against him, I\u2019m able to beat him.\u201d",
      "On Sunday, Alcaraz was ahead 7-5, 6-1 when Draper decided he couldn't continue. He'd been dealing with physical issues after winning each of his first three matches at Melbourne Park in five sets.",
      "\u201cIt's not the way I want to win a match, to get through to the next round,\u201d Alcaraz said. \u201cHappy to play another quarterfinal here in Australia, but a little bit sad for Jack.\u201d",
      "Sunday's match goes into the books as a victory for Alcaraz, his first against a top-20 opponent at the Australian Open. He pulled even with Bjorn Borg, Boris Becker and Mats Wilander for the highest number of major quarterfinal appearances before 22.",
      "Alcaraz's best run at Melbourne Park was getting to the quarterfinals last year, before losing at that stage to Alexander Zverev. The other quarterfinal on the bottom half of the men's bracket will be No. 2 Zverev against No. 12 Tommy Paul.",

      "\u201cA week ago, I was very unsure of my level. I was very unsure of my tennis,\u201d the 27-year-old German said. \u201cCouldn't really play a lot of sets in practice. Couldn't really prepare the way I wanted to.\u201d",
      "Paul needed less than 1 1/2 hours on Sunday to finish off a diminished opponent. The 66th-ranked Davidovich Fokina had won his last two matches despite dropping the first two sets in both.",
      "\u201cWhat he did is unreal the past couple matches. ... To do it twice in a row is amazing,\u201d Paul said.",
      "But Paul won nearly twice as many points as his Spanish rival, 85 to 43, and will be well-rested heading into the showdown with Zverev.",
      "\u201cThis week, I did something a little different, where I haven\u2019t practiced on the days in between my matches at all. Like, I haven\u2019t even stepped on the court, just \u2019cause I started with a five-setter, and my body was a little tired. Every match has gotten a little shorter since then,\u201d said Paul, who was born in New Jersey and grew up in North Carolina.",
      "\u201cI mean, my body feels great right now. Especially after the match today, it was a pretty short one,\u201d Paul said. \u201cIt\u2019s helpful (for) going deep into tournaments.\u201d",
      "His best showing at any Slam was getting to the semifinals at the Australian Open in 2023. He will try to repeat that by getting past Zverev, who lost in the finals of the 2020 U.S. Open and the 2024 French Open.",
      "A year ago, Zverev exited in the semifinals at Melbourne Park for the second time.",
      "Paul was one of four American men to reach the fourth round in Australia this year. No. 21 Ben Shelton, qualifier Learner Tien and Alex Michelsen will try to join him in the quarterfinals when they play fourth-round matches on Monday.",
      "Paul has won both matches he and Zverev have played against each other, but the most recent was in 2022.",
      "\u201cI've got to be at my best,\u201d Zverev said. \u201cI've got to play the way I did the first week \u2014 hopefully a little bit better.\u201d",

      "The Detroit Lions worked all season to earn the NFC's top seed and ensure they wouldn't have to play anywhere but Ford Field until the Super Bowl",
      "DETROIT -- The Detroit Lions had everything set up the way they wanted this time.",
      "After losing last season's NFC championship game at San Francisco, they went 15-2 to earn the NFC's top seed. They enjoyed a first-round playoff bye and knew they wouldn't have to play anywhere but Ford Field until the Super Bowl.",
      "It didn't matter.",
      "The Lions self-destructed against the Washington Commanders, turning the ball over five times in a 45-31 loss on Saturday night that ended another chance at the franchise's first Super Bowl.",
      "\u201cWe just didn't complement each other,\u201d said coach Dan Campbell, who nearly came to tears during his postgame news conference. \u201cWe didn't get a stop when we needed one, and when we got a stop, we turned the ball over. With five turnovers \u2014 even if one was at the end and it was really four, that's too much.\u201d",
      "Jared Goff took most of the blame \u2014 he threw three interceptions and lost his first fumble of the season. One of the picks was returned 40 yards for a touchdown by Quan Martin to give the Commanders a 24-14 lead.",
      "\u201cIf I play better, do we win? Quite possibly,\u201d Goff said. \u201cI cost us points by not taking care of the ball, and that's something that's going to hurt for a long time.\u201d",
      "Goff didn't have a great night, but he wasn't playing defense. Washington rookie Jayden Daniels played a lot like Goff at his best \u2014 completing passes that gave his receivers a chance to run. Of his 299 passing yards, 188 came after the catch.",
      "\u201cWe knew what the tape said about him,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cWe knew we were going to have our hands full and we didn't handle it as well as we wanted.\u201d",
      "That wasn't the only problem, though. Detroit's injury-riddled defense gave up 481 yards \u2014 its third most this season \u2014 including 182 on the ground. Brian Robinson Jr. and Austin Ekeler combined for 124 yards on 21 carries and Daniels added 51 more.",
      "Detroit didn't sack Daniels \u2014 a problem it has had since losing Aidan Hutchinson to a broken leg in October. Hutchinson had been aiming to return in time for the Super Bowl.",
      "The Lions also lost cornerback Amik Robertson to a broken arm early in the game \u2014 yet another major injury for a depleted unit.",
      "\u201cThat hurt us a bit, but (Kindle Vildor) came in and played well,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cHe competed for us.\u201d",
      "The injuries didn't explain the mental mistakes, though. Detroit was within 31-28 early in the fourth quarter and had the Commanders facing fourth-and-2 from the Lions 5. A stop could have changed the game \u2014 but the Lions were called for 12 men on the field. Two plays later, Robinson scored to make it 38-28.",
      "Campbell took the blame for the play, but there was still time to rally until an inexplicable decision to have Jameson Williams throw a pass to Jahmyr Gibbs. Williams looked tentative as he rolled right and threw into coverage. Rookie Mike Sainristil grabbed his second interception of the night and Washington ran 4:33 off the clock before scoring another touchdown that made it 45-28.",
      "\u201cObviously, I wish he had run the ball,\u201d Campbell said.",
      "Last year, Campbell talked at length about how hard it is to get into position to win a Super Bowl, and how the 49ers loss might have cost the Lions their best chance.",
      "This time, he couldn't even address that topic.",
      "\u201cThis isn't the time \u2014 this hurts too much,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn't the time to talk about our great season and all our wins. The whole point of playing is to get to the biggest game and we didn't make it.\u201d",

      "Duke freshman Cooper Flagg won\u2019t be making it all the way up to Maine, so his fans trekked to Chestnut Hill on Saturday night to see the likely No. 1 overall draft pick play Boston College in his only game in New England this season",
      "BOSTON -- Duke freshman Cooper Flagg won\u2019t be making it all the way up to Maine, so his fans trekked to Chestnut Hill on Saturday night to see the likely No. 1 overall draft pick play Boston College in his only game in New England this season.",
      "Flagg had 28 points, five rebounds, four assists, two steals and two blocked shots to help the No. 3 Blue Devils beat BC 88-63 for their 12th win in a row in front of BC's first sellout of the season, with many of the fans making the trip of three or more hours just to see him.",
      "\u201cThis was my dream growing up, my entire life. To be in that position I\u2019m in right now,\u201d Flagg told reporters afterwards. \u201cSo I\u2019m just trying to enjoy it and just stay in the moment.\u201d",
      "Fans in Duke jerseys \u2013 many of them making the 215-mile drive from the Newport, Maine, environs -- helped fill the Conte Forum for the first time this season. When the BC supporters filed out in the final minutes, the Dukies stuck around until the buzzer, giving Flagg one last cheer when he left the court following the game.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s huge, the level of support, just to get to see them show up and support me means a lot to me. Just gives me a lot of confidence,\u201d Flagg said. \u201cBeing from Maine \u2026 when I was growing up, it\u2019s easy to just not believe in yourself or just think you can\u2019t do that. I just want to keep proving that it doesn\u2019t really matter where you\u2019re from. As long as you stick to it and keep working, you can make anything happen.\u201d",
      "Flagg said he grew up as a Boston sports fan, rooting for the Celtics, Patriots and Red Sox because they were the closest pro teams to his hometown. On Friday night, Flagg and some of his teammates watched the Celtics \u2013 including ex-Blue Devil Jayson Tatum \u2013 beat the Magic. (Orlando\u2019s Paolo Banchero also went to Duke.)",
      "Duke\u2019s only other scheduled trip up North is to play at Syracuse next month, though there is a March Madness regional final in Providence, Rhode Island. Flagg said he had been hearing from a lot of people back home that they would be making the trip; one television reporter told Flagg after the game he had interviewed fans who came down from Aroostook County, on the border of Quebec and New Brunswick, Canada.",
      "\u201cIt was great for us just to be in that environment,\u201d Duke coach Jon Scheyer said. \u201cWhat a special turnout. Look, this is as close as we\u2019re going to get to Maine. We\u2019ve been here a lot. The representation of Duke fans has always been great. This was, I think, the best I\u2019ve ever seen it.",
      "\u201cAnd I think a lot of it has to do with Maine. So that was a pretty special thing to see,\u201d Scheyer said. \u201cAnd obviously he backed it up with his play.\u201d",

      "About half of U.S. adults have high blood pressure and too few have it under control",
      "WASHINGTON -- Nothing doctors prescribed controlled Michael Garrity\u2019s dangerously high blood pressure \u2014 until they zapped away some nerves on his kidneys.",
      "If that sounds weird, well, kidneys help regulate blood pressure in part through signals from certain nerves. The new treatment disrupts overactive renal nerves.",
      "\u201cMy blood pressure would spike and I\u2019d run out of breath and feel tired, and that doesn\u2019t happen anymore,\u201d said Garrity, 62, of Needham, Massachusetts. He still takes medicine but at lower doses, his blood pressure normal for the first time in years. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled.\u201d",
      "About half of U.S. adults have high blood pressure, a major risk for heart attacks, strokes, kidney failure, even dementia. Many people don\u2019t even realize they have hypertension until it\u2019s done serious damage.",
      "\u201cKnow your blood pressure, know the numbers,\u201d stressed Dr. Randy Zusman of Massachusetts General Hospital, who specializes in the hardest-to-treat cases and advises people who think they\u2019re fine to at least get a yearly check.",
      "And only a fraction of patients have their hypertension well-controlled, meaning there\u2019s a need for novel strategies. The Food and Drug Administration approved that \u201crenal denervation\u201d option about a year ago, based on studies showing a modest benefit in patients whose blood pressure remains high despite multiple medicines.",
      "Now, after the American Heart Association recently deemed it promising, some hospitals including Mass General Brigham are cautiously offering it as they work out who are good candidates \u2014 and whether their insurance will cover a minimally invasive procedure costing thousands of dollars.",
      "Two numbers describe blood pressure. The top, \u201csystolic\u201d pressure, is the force blood puts on the walls of arteries as its pumped out of the heart. The bottom \u201cdiastolic\u201d number measures that same pressure but between heartbeats.",
      "Normal is less than 120 over 80. Blood pressure naturally fluctuates throughout the day, higher when you\u2019re physically active or stressed. But when it stays high \u2014 consistently 130 over 80 or higher, according to the most recent guidelines \u2014 it stiffens arteries and makes the heart work harder.",
      "It doesn\u2019t take a doctor\u2019s visit. Pharmacies and sometimes even libraries offer screening, and people can use at-home monitors.",
      "To avoid falsely high readings, the American Medical Association has tips: Sit quietly with feet on the floor, legs not crossed. Place the cuff on a bare arm, not over clothing. Don\u2019t dangle the arm \u2014 rest it on a table.",
      "Lifestyle changes are the first step, especially for otherwise healthy people. Guidelines urge losing weight, exercise, eating more fruits and vegetables, limiting salt and alcohol, and taking steps to handle stress.",
      "Medicine is a must once hypertension reaches 140 over 90. The average patient requires two or three drugs, sometimes more, along with healthier living, Zusman said.",
      "But the hypertension Garrity has struggled with since his late 20s is treatment-resistant. Despite taking four to six drugs plus a strict diet and exercise, his blood pressure regularly reached 150 over 100 or worse.",
      "Doctors thread a small catheter, or tube, through blood vessels to reach the kidneys, and then beam in ultrasound or radiofrequency energy. Those pulses pass through the renal arteries to selectively target surrounding nerves, said Dr. Joseph Garasic, a Mass General interventional cardiologist who performed Garrity\u2019s procedure. It takes about an hour.",
      "Although already used in other countries, a key U.S. trial of renal denervation failed about a decade ago, prompting changes before researchers tried again. In November 2023, the FDA approved two catheter systems, from Recor Medical and Medtronic.",
      "It\u2019s not a cure \u2013 and some patients get no benefit. But Garasic said multiple studies show on average an 8 to 10-point drop in blood pressure, a modest but important improvement. Some like Garrity see a bigger drop, enough to gradually scale back medications.",
      "The FDA deemed the procedure safe for carefully chosen patients \u2014 it wasn\u2019t tested in those with kidney disease or narrowed arteries, for example. And studies have lasted only a few years, not long enough to tell if the nerves might eventually regenerate.",
      "Guidance from the American Heart Association urges would-be patients and experienced doctors to have \u201cthoughtful and informed discussions\u201d to decide who\u2019s a good candidate.",

      "Emails and videos of burned buildings in Los Angeles versus those still standing have been flying back and forth among architects, builders and fire safety specialists around the world",
      "Emails and videos of burned buildings in Los Angeles next to those left standing have been flying back and forth among architects, builders and fire safety specialists around the world.",
      "For many homeowners, like Enrique Balcazar, the sometimes scattershot nature of the carnage can seem like random chance. Balcazar, a real estate agent, posted video that showed little more than chimneys remaining of most homes on his block after fire leapt through his Altadena neighborhood. Balcazar stood on his neighbor's destroyed classic Mustang to douse his smoldering roof, but his home was otherwise fine.",
      "\u201cIt's an older house and it still has the old wood sidings,\u201d Balcazar said. \u201cTo me there's nothing explainable in logical or scientific reason of why my house would not have burned.\u201d",
      "Many experts say luck does play a part. After all, wind can shift 180 degrees in a split second, pushing fire away from your house and towards a neighbor's. But they also say there are many ways that homes can be made less vulnerable to fire.",
      "\u201cBecause there are, say, 50 ways a fire can burn your house,\" said Greg Faulkner of Faulkner Architects in California, who has focused on less combustible home exteriors for more than a decade. \u201cIf you eliminate half of those, or three-quarters of them, that\u2019s not luck, that\u2019s increasing your odds.\u201d",
      "People in fire country generally know that trees, landscaping and wood fences near homes can be a fire risk. Architects and contractors are going beyond that, using newer materials and techniques in roofing, walls and windows to keep buildings standing. The measures do add cost to the homes \u2014 around 3% to 6%, Faulkner said, or as much as 10% for the most robust protection.",
      "Many of these experts no longer use wood siding. Where it is used, or still allowed, it needs to have a fire-resistant barrier underneath, often made of gypsum, the same material used to make drywall. That way if the wood catches fire, it takes longer for the heat to reach inside the home",
      "But even with that, you\u2019re still putting a combustible material on the building, said Richard Schuh, with Nielsen : Schuh Architects. \u201cSo that would be something we would avoid. Use of fire-resistant materials is critical.\u201d",
      "Stucco, a cement material, is a common exterior for Southern California houses and it's fire-resistant. Reviewing AP photographs showing buildings still standing, Arnold Tarling, who has four decades experience in fire protection and building inspection in Britain, said houses with stucco walls appeared to survive the Los Angeles fires better. Yet if more of them had had a layer of gypsum beneath the stucco, it would have given more protection from the heat, he said.",
      "Windows are a huge factor in whether a home burns down, because so much heat is transmitted through them. Double-pane windows significantly slow heat coming from the burning building next door.",
      "\u201cThe outside layer protects the inside layer until it fails,\u201d said Schuh. Codes in many places require one of the two panes to be tempered, which is much more resistant to heat than conventional glass, he said.",
      "Tarling noted one intact Malibu beachfront home, surrounded by gutted buildings. He speculated that the fact that no windows faced a neighbor helped protect it because radiated heat couldn\u2019t penetrate as easily.",
      "In his buildings, Faulkner builds in fire shutters that can slide closed and cover the windows.",
      "Then there's the roof \u2014 a convenient landing pad for fire embers.",
      "Simpler roof lines can allow red-hot embers to slide off. Spanish Mission, for example, is an iconic Los Angeles style \u2014 part of what says \u201cHollywood\u201d in movies about the city, for example, as well as a reminder of its Mexican and Spanish history. That style doesn\u2019t always have simple roof lines \u2014 the knee walls that are common on Mission-style roofs create corners.",
      "\u201cThe embers could, just like snow, gather in that corner,\u201d Faulkner said.",
      "Many roofs in the U.S. are covered in asphalt. Areas that are designated as wildfire-prone in California \u2013 an ever-growing area \u2013 are required to use roofing that delays the transfer of heat to the inside of the building, called one-hour or Class A.",
      "Still, asphalt is a petroleum product. Some building professionals prefer metal, which doesn\u2019t burn. Metal has its own downside, though: It conducts heat. Putting a layer of gypsum under a metal roof is becoming a common practice in some areas.",
      "Maybe as important as which material is used on a roof is whether the roof offers fire a way to get in. Here, as in so many tradeoffs, one effort to do good conflicts with another: Contractors have been more careful over the years to make sure moisture doesn't build up in attics by making sure air circulates, using those vents that are visible on many roofs or under eaves.",
      "But in a powerful fire, Schuh says, \u201cif you\u2019re on the side where the wind is putting pressure against the house, it\u2019s also blowing the flames into the house like a blow torch,\u201d and fire gets in through the vents.",
      "On the other side of the house, it can create a vacuum, several experts said, sucking fire in.",
      "But you can\u2019t easily just eliminate roof ventilation because it will cause moisture problems, said Cesar Martin Gomez, an architect at the University of Navarra, Spain, who\u2019s worked for 25 years in building services.",
      "Faulkner said in some buildings he's eliminating the need for ventilation in the roof structure by sealing the spaces. Schuh is using a cover on roof vents that can actually respond to fire with a mesh that closes.",
      "Martin Gomez noted that in some parts of Australia, new homes are required to have water tanks. \u201cIf each home has the ability to protect itself, fire won\u2019t be able to spread as much,\u201d he said.",
      "And some homes in the U.S. are now built with sprinkler systems for the outside of the house, not just the inside. It sprays water with a soapy solution to make it flow over the surface of the building, Schuh said.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re adding one more layer of protection to your building, and that\u2019s more of a priority now than ever because your insurance company may or not be around for you,\u201d he said.",

      "Though the Supreme Court on Friday unanimously upheld a federal law that could ban TikTok nationwide, it\u2019s unclear how a shutdown of the popular social media platform will play out and what Americans will see when the clock strikes midnight on Sunday.",
      "The court decision comes against a backdrop of unusual political agitation by Trump, who vowed that he could negotiate a solution after he takes office, and the administration of President Joe Biden, which has signaled it won\u2019t enforce the law beginning Sunday, his final full day in office. Now, tech observers \u2014 and some users \u2014 are intently watching to see what happens over the weekend and beyond.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really in uncharted territory here in terms of tech policy,\u201d said Sarak Kreps, the director of Cornell University\u2019s Tech Policy Institute.",
      "Under the law, mobile app stores \u2014 like the ones operated by Apple and Google \u2014 and internet hosting services will face major fines if they continue to distribute the platform to U.S. users beyond the deadline for divestment from ByteDance, TikTok\u2019s China-based parent company. The companies could pay up to $5,000 for each user who continues to access TikTok, meaning penalties could total to a large sum.",
      "A lawyer representing TikTok told Supreme Court justices last week that the platform will \u201cgo dark\u201d on Jan. 19 if the law isn\u2019t struck down. But TikTok, which is not required to block its own platform under the statute, has not said whether it will limit access to the app, or its website, on Sunday.

      "\u201cMy decision on TikTok will be made in the not-too-distant future, but I must have time to review the situation,\u201d Trump said Friday in a post on Truth Social after the court\u2019s ruling. Earlier in the day, he said in another post that TikTok was among the topics in his conversation with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.",

      "Tech CEOs have been attempting to forge friendlier ties with Trump, who wants to put the TikTok ban on hold, since he was elected in November. But Kreps said it would \u201cdefy credulity\u201d for them to continue to offer TikTok, even if they want to please Trump, since it would open them up to punitive fines.",
      "Tech companies are also used to removing apps at the behest of governments. In 2023, Apple says it removed nearly 1,500 apps globally. Nearly 1,300 of the apps were taken down in China.",
      "\u201cPenalties for companies like Apple and Google could run as high as $850 billion,\u201d Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., wrote on X on Thursday, while referring to the U.S. TikTok law. \u201cNot sure I\u2019d take a politician\u2019s word if I ran those companies.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, David Choffnes, executive director of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute at Northeastern University in Boston, said he believes there\u2019s a \u201csmall chance\u201d that nothing happens to TikTok, but acknowledged that would require \u201cenormous risk on the on the part of the companies that support them.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. is inching closer and closer to a potential TikTok ban \u2014 with the nation's highest court upholding a law that's set to halt new downloads of the app starting Sunday. But many questions around what exactly this ban will look like, and whether it will actually be enforced, remain.",

      "All of this is \u201ca reminder to the creator community that social media platforms can come and go,\u201d notes Kelsey Chickering, a principal analyst at Forrester, stressing the disruptions TikTok creators and influencers will feel if the ban takes effect. If access is lost, she adds, many will have to pivot and re-build their presence on other platforms.",

As an influencer and also an artist, she says the platform has helped her make brand deals and promote her music \u2014 bringing \u201copportunities that I never believed I could experience in my lifetime.\u201d",
      "Ok was also among influencers who TikTok brought to Washington in 2023 to lobby for the preservation of the app, and remembers a ban being discussed as far back as 2020. And as someone who is Asian, the efforts to ban TikTok over the years have also felt \u201ca little xenophobic,\u201d she added.",
      "\u201cI hear all these different things, and I don\u2019t know what to believe \u2014 so that\u2019s where I\u2019m very frustrated. I\u2019m confused. I\u2019m disappointed,\" Ok said. \"It\u2019s a beautiful app, it\u2019s brought so many people together, it\u2019s changed a lot of people\u2019s lives, and for it to just be taken away like that feels ... so not American.\u201d",

      "She fears losing TikTok will hurt her business, and she'll miss it personally, too. So she\u2019s following what people are saying will happen on Sunday and hopes a ban might be diverted.",
      "\u201cIt kind of seems like Biden\u2019s kind of pushing it off to Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cSo people have hopes that maybe we have a few more days and it won\u2019t go dark on Sunday, but I don\u2019t really know.\u201d",

And after today\u2019s Supreme Court decision to uphold the ban or the sale of TikTok, I weigh my options,\u201d he said. \u201cBut honestly, it\u2019s very disheartening, specifically because I truly did rely on the app for my business and my growth of my business.\u201d",
      "Going viral on TikTok helped Ruben Trujillo market his Cafe Emporos Coffeegrams, a card that includes coffee, tea or hot chocolate. He said he\u2019s growing frustrated with the ever-evolving politics surrounding the ban.",

      "DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -- Sebastian Ray Serpa, a 16-year-old high school student from Volusia County, passes by Daytona International Speedway often and hears the roar of race cars from outside the gates but had never before been inside the \u201cWorld Center of Racing.\u201d",
      "After an immersive experience Friday designed for talented STEM students, Ray Serpa \u201cwill definitely\u201d be returning for next week's Rolex 24 at Daytona \u2014 his first ever motorsports event.",
      "IMSA arranged for 27 high school students who excel in STEM programs to come to the speedway to educate the teens on how many opportunities exist in motorsports for those interested in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.",
      "Ray Serpa, who described himself as passionate about mechanical engineering, was blown away. He thought he'd like a future learning about how the human joint works. After stops at four different stations and a tour of the speedway and cars, he's now aware motorsports is an option.",
      "\u201cThis has been a real eye-opener for me,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cI knew that behind almost every concept out there there were opportunities, but I never realized how wide that actually went. There are so many applications that require STEM skills. I heard from marketing people who went to school for mechanical engineering, and then ended up getting greater satisfaction from marketing. Or, they still work hand-in-hand. I would really like to get to a point where I can say the same.\u201d",
      "It is the debut year for the program in IMSA sports car racing, but series president John Doonan ran a similar STEM experience when he was head of Mazda. It took sponsorship from Gainbridge, Konica Minolta and EVERFi, which is working to develop the curriculum to continue the program, to launch it in IMSA.",
      "The students made four stops at the track: Tires, Traction and Tread to learn about physics and engineering at the Michelin Tire Center; Data-Driven Racing at the IMSA Engineering Center to learn about data, science and technology; Engineering Safety at IMSA Tech Inspection Area to learn about material science; and IMSA Technology Lab, with the IMSA GTP Hybrid Electrified Race Car, at Action Express Racing to learn about physics and engineering.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing here is a laboratory. It\u2019s a laboratory for the automakers. It\u2019s a laboratory for Michelin on the tire front. It\u2019s a laboratory for all these teams,\u201d Doonan said. \"For the students to be able to see what they\u2019re doing in the classroom, be applied in a real-world environment, that gives me and all of my IMSA teammates a lot of satisfaction.",
      "\"These students here, some of the top students from the Volusia County schools surrounding the Daytona area, they\u2019re our future. We are going to do it at five other races this year and then have a web portal to allow the educators and students to follow up. For me it\u2019s the best of both worlds.\u201d",
      "Doonan in his morning remarks to the students tried to prep them for what they were about to learn concerning STEM and motorsports.",
      "\u201cI told them, \u2018Look, algebra, calculus, physics, chemistry, as much as you may dislike it at the moment, it\u2019s being applied here real-time,\u2019\u201d Doonan said. \u201cAnd when you say that to the students, the teachers all raise their hand and cheer and tell them \u2018I told you so!\u2019 And then the opposite side, I think, once the web portal gets established by EVERFI, the teachers are going to be able to leverage this resource in story problems and race strategy and aerodynamics, potentially, ride height, all the things that the teams are doing.\u201d",
      "Amy Monahan, a K-12 STEM Specialist for Volusia County Schools, said the students who attended were selected by their teachers for \u201cshowing tenacity in what they do on a daily basis.\u201d One of the students said prior to Friday he'd been thinking of enlisting in the military after high school but now wonders if there might be something in motorsports he can pursue.",
      "\u201cThis whole program is educating them to many opportunities are out there and this one is in your backyard. Some of them think the military or trade jobs are all that is available to them,\" Monahan said. \u201cThey don't know. Most of them have never been to a race, so seeing this and what it looks like, and understanding there are plenty of things to pursue is just a wonderful gift for them.\u201d",

      "The field trip was designed to illustrate the challenges disabled researchers often face \u2014 and how barriers can be overcome.",
      "\u201cJust because you can\u2019t do it like someone else doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t do it,\" said Anita Marshall, a University of Florida geologist leading the outing. The group included scientists with sight, hearing and mobility disabilities.",

      "Disabled people make up about 3% of the science, technology, engineering and math workforce, according to 2021 data from the National Science Foundation.",
      "Scientists with disabilities say that\u2019s in part because labs, classrooms and field sites aren\u2019t designed to accommodate them. Students and faculty are still told that they can\u2019t work in a lab or do research safely, said Mark Leddy, who formerly managed disability-related grants for the National Science Foundation.",
      "The Americans with Disabilities Act, passed in 1990, sets minimum regulations for new buildings and labs, including ramps and wheelchair-accessible walkways.",

      "Leddy said researchers with disabilities are invaluable because of their life experiences. They have to constantly come up with creative ways to get past barriers in their lives \u2014 a problem-solving skill that's indispensable in a lab.",

      "At Purdue University in Indiana, engineering professor Brad Duerstock helped design an accessible biomedical lab years ago with support from the school and a National Institutes of Health grant, removing cabinets under sinks and fume hoods so that wheelchairs can easily pull up.",
      "The cost of making a lab more accessible varies depending on how extensive the changes are, Duerstock said. Some schools set aside money for improvements and science organizations can offer grants.",
      "On the California geology field trip, the group explored the lake carved into the landscape by the San Andreas Fault, where the grating of two tectonic plates can cause earthquakes.",
      "The group included rock enthusiasts at all different stages of their careers. A handful were students. Others were professors, eager to explore the outdoors in a group they could trust to look after them.",

      "Scientists are unraveling the mystery of what triggers Huntington\u2019s disease, a devastating and fatal hereditary disorder that strikes in the prime of life, causing nerve cells in parts of the brain to break down and die.",
      "The genetic mutation linked to Huntington's has long been known, but scientists haven't understood how people could have the mutation from birth, but not develop any problems until later in life.",
      "New research shows that the mutation is, surprisingly, harmless for decades. But it quietly grows into a larger mutation \u2014 until it eventually crosses a threshold, generates toxic proteins, and kills the cells it has expanded in.",
      "\u201cThe conundrum in our field has been: Why do you have a genetic disorder that manifests later in life if the gene is present at conception?\u201d said Dr. Mark Mehler, who directs the Institute for Brain Disorders and Neural Regeneration at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and was not involved in the research. He called the research a \u201clandmark\u201d study and said \"it addresses a lot of the issues that have plagued the field for a long time.\u201d",
      "The brain cell death eventually leads to problems with movement, thinking and behavior. Huntington\u2019s symptoms \u2013 which include involuntary movement, unsteady gait, personality changes and impaired judgment \u2013 typically begin between the ages of 30 and 50, gradually worsening over 10 to 25 years.",
      "Scientists at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, McLean Hospital in Massachusetts and Harvard Medical School studied brain tissue donated by 53 people with Huntington\u2019s and 50 without it, analyzing half a million cells.",
      "They focused on the Huntington\u2019s mutation, which involves a stretch of DNA in a particular gene where a three-letter sequence \u2013 CAG \u2013 is repeated at least 40 times. In people without the disease this sequence is repeated just 15 to 35 times. They discovered that DNA tracts with 40 or more such \u201crepeats\u201d expand over time until they are hundreds of CAGs long. Once CAGs reach a threshold of about 150, certain types of neurons sicken and die.",
      "The findings \u201cwere really surprising, even to us,\u201d said Steve McCarroll, a Broad member and co-senior author of the study, which was published Thursday in the journal Cell. The study was partly funded by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, an organization that also supports The Associated Press Health and Science department.",
      "The research team estimated that repeat tracts grow slowly during the first two decades of life, then the rate accelerates dramatically when they reach about 80 CAGs.",
      "\u201cThe longer the repeats, the earlier in life the onset will happen,\u201d said neuroscience researcher Sabina Berretta, one of the study's senior authors.",
      "Researchers acknowledged that some scientists were initially skeptical when results were shared at conferences, since previous work found that repeat expansions in the range of 30 to 100 CAGs were necessary \u2014 but not sufficient \u2014 to cause Huntington\u2019s. McCarroll agreed that 100 or fewer CAGs are not sufficient to trigger the disease, but said his study found that expansions with at least 150 CAGs are.",
      "Researchers hope their findings can help scientists come up with ways to delay or prevent the incurable condition, which afflicts about 41,000 Americans and is now treated with medications to manage the symptoms.",
      "Recently, experimental drugs designed to lower levels of the protein produced by the mutated Huntington's gene have struggled in trials. The new findings suggest that's because few cells have the toxic version of the protein at any given time.",
      "Slowing or stopping the expansion of DNA repeats may be a better way to target the disease, researchers said.",
      "Though there are no guarantees this would stave off Huntington\u2019s, McCarroll said \u201cmany companies are starting or expanding programs to try to do this.\u201d",

They said it also has a network of job training centers, colleges and universities prepared to educate new advanced manufacturing workers. Those helped attract the nationally-competitive deal, they said.",

It includes Intel, which is building a $20 billion chip factory just east of the Columbus, and Honda and LG Energy Solution of South Korea, which are building a $3.5 billion battery plant in nearby Fayette County that the automaker envisions as its North American electric vehicle hub. Ohio State University also announced plans in 2023 to build a $110 million software innovation center to dovetail with those efforts.",
      "At separate upcoming state meetings, the Anduril project will pursue a job creation tax credit from the Ohio Department of Development and a $70 million infusion from the All Ohio Future Fund, which the DeWine administration and lawmakers established to help local governments prepare sites for economic development projects. JobsOhio also plans to provide the project a sizeable grant, whose exact amount will be announced once agreements are signed, as well as talent acquisition services.",

      "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- Taiwan took another step in enhancing its key role in the production of advanced semiconductor chips used for artificial intelligence on Thursday with the inauguration of a new plant by Siliconware Precision Industries Co.",
      "The opening ceremony for the Tan-Ke factory in the central city of Taichung was attended by Jensen Huang, CEO and co-founder of California-based Nvidia Corp., a world leader in the design of AI chips, reinforcing the companies' partnership in the production of advanced AI chips.",
      "SPIL is a leader in semiconductor packaging and testing.",
      "\u201cThe technology that we\u2019re working on is becoming more sophisticated. Chips are getting more and more complex, and the packaging technology will need to evolve as well. What\u2019s even more exciting is the integration of silicon photonics, enabling us to connect multiple packages into one massive system,\u201d Huang said.",
      "He said Nvidia's partnership with SPIL would be instrumental in pushing the boundaries of innovation in coming years.",
      "Huang also addressed the broader implications of AI development, saying that AI combined with robotics will bring tremendous benefits to Taiwan\u2019s world-leading electronics industry.",
      "SPIL expressed enthusiasm for the collaboration, stating that Huang\u2019s visit highlights the strong relationship between the two companies.",
      "Huang also was to visit Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd., or TSMC, the world's largest independent contract manufacturer of semiconductors.",
      "Huang\u2019s visits reflect the critical role Taiwan plays in the global AI supply chain and underscores the growing importance of partnerships between technology leaders like Nvidia and key Taiwanese players in the semiconductor industry.",
      "The Biden administration has proposed a new framework for exports of the advanced computer chips used to develop AI, an attempt to balance national security concerns with the economic interests of producers and other countries.",
      "Part of the motivation is to make it \u201charder for China to circumvent existing restrictions that were focused on China,\u201d said Johannes Himmelreich, a professor who researches AI policy at Syracuse University.",
      "Chip companies have criticized the policy as hastily drawn up and potentially damaging to the industry.",
      "Because the proposed framework includes a 120-day comment period, the incoming Republican administration could ultimately determine the rules for sales abroad of advanced computer chips designed mostly by California companies such as Nvidia and AMD but manufactured in locations such as Taiwan and South Korea.",

      "Taiwan computer chip maker TSMC has reported its profit in the last quarter rose 57%, buoyed by the artificial intelligence boom",
      "HONG KONG -- Taiwan computer chip maker TSMC reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter rose 57%, buoyed by the artificial intelligence boom.",
      "The world\u2019s biggest semiconductor manufacturer reported a net profit of 374.7 billion new Taiwan dollars ($11.4 billion), higher than expected.",
      "Last week, the company, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., reported that its revenue for 2024 rose almost 34% to 2.9 trillion new Taiwan dollars ($88 billion). Revenue for the fourth quarter rose 38.8% to 868.46 billion new Taiwan dollars ($26.4 billion), also higher than forecasts.",
      "TSMC has been caught in the crossfire of U.S.-China tensions over trade and technology.",
      "The U.S. said this week that it would further restrict exports of chips used for AI and other advanced technology, seeking to limit China's access. The new rules cap the number of AI chips that can be exported to most countries, although about 20 close allies including Taiwan will have unlimited access to U.S. AI technology.",
      "The regulations however could impact demand for AI chips from chipmakers like TSMC.",
      "The Taiwanese chipmaker has plans to open three factories in the U.S. and two more in Japan. Both the Japanese and U.S. governments are offering billions in funding and subsidies to TSMC to boost domestic chip production.",

      "Blue Origin has launched its massive new rocket on its first test flight",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Blue Origin launched its massive new rocket on its first test flight Thursday, sending up a prototype satellite to orbit thousands of miles above Earth.",
      "Named after the first American to orbit Earth, the New Glenn rocket blasted off from Florida, soaring from the same pad used to launch NASA's Mariner and Pioneer spacecraft a half-century ago.",
      "Years in the making with heavy funding by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, the 320-foot (98-meter) rocket carried an an experimental platform designed to host satellites or release them into their proper orbits.",
      "All seven main engines fired at liftoff as the rocket blazed through the predawn sky to the delight of spectators lining nearby beaches. Bezos took part in the action from Mission Control and Blue Origin employees erupted in cheers once the craft successfully reached orbit 13 minutes later, a feat that drew praise from SpaceX's Elon Musk.",
      "The first-stage booster missed its landing on a barge in the Atlantic, but the company stressed that the more important goal was achieved. Bezos said before the flight it was \u201ca little crazy\u201d to even try to land the booster on the first try.",
      "\u201cWe did it!\" Blue Origin\u2019s CEO Dave Limp said via X about reaching orbit. \"On to spring and trying again on the landing.\u201d",
      "For this test, the satellite was meant to remain inside the second stage while circling Earth. Plans called for the second stage to be placed in a safe condition to stay in a high, out-of-the-way orbit in accordance with NASA's practices for minimizing space junk.",
      "New Glenn was supposed to fly before dawn Monday, but ice buildup in critical plumbing caused a delay. The rocket is built to haul spacecraft and eventually astronauts to orbit and also the moon.",
      "Founded 25 years ago by Bezos, Blue Origin has been launching paying passengers to the edge of space since 2021, including himself. The short hops from Texas use smaller rockets named after the first American in space, Alan Shepard. New Glenn, which honors John Glenn, is five times taller.",
      "Blue Origin poured more than $1 billion into New Glenn's launch site, rebuilding historic Complex 36 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. The pad is 9 miles (14 kilometers) from the company's control centers and rocket factory, outside the gates of NASA's Kennedy Space Center.",
      "Blue Origin envisions six to eight New Glenn flights this year, with the next one coming up this spring.",
      "In a weekend interview, Bezos declined to disclose his personal investment in the program. He said he does not see Blue Origin in a competition with Musk\u2019s SpaceX, long the rocket-launching dominator.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s room for lots of winners\u201d Bezos said, adding that this was the \u201cvery, very beginning of this new phase of the space age, where we\u2019re all going to work together as an industry ... to lower the cost of access to space.\"",
      "New Glenn is the latest in a series of big, new rockets to launch in recent years, including United Launch Alliance\u2019s Vulcan, Europe\u2019s upgraded Ariane 6 and NASA's Space Launch System or SLS, the space agency's successor to the Saturn V for sending astronauts to the moon.",
      "The biggest rocket of all, at approximately 400 feet (123 meters), is SpaceX's Starship. Musk said the seventh test flight of the full rocket could occur later Thursday from Texas. He hopes to repeat what he pulled off in October, catching the returning booster at the launch pad with giant mechanical arms.",
      "Starship is what NASA plans to use to land astronauts on the moon later this decade. The first two moon landings under the space agency's Artemis program, which follows the Apollo missions of the 1960s and 1970s, will see crews descending from lunar orbit to the surface in Starships.",
      "Blue Origin's lander, dubbed Blue Moon, will make its debut on the third lunar touchdown by astronauts.",
      "NASA Administrator Bill Nelson pushed for competing moon landers similar to the strategy to hire two companies to ferry astronauts to and from the International Space Station. Nelson will step down when President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Monday.",
      "Trump has tapped tech billionaire Jared Isaacman to run NASA. Isaacman, who has twice rocketed into orbit on his own privately financed SpaceX flights, must be approved by the Senate.",
      "New Glenn's debut was supposed to send twin spacecraft to Mars for NASA. But the space agency pulled them from last October's planned flight when it became clear the rocket wouldn't be ready in time. They will still fly on a New Glenn rocket, but not until spring at the earliest. The two small spacecraft, named Escapade, are meant to study the Martian atmosphere and magnetic environment while orbiting the red planet.",

      "Efforts to ban students' cellphones at school is gaining rare bipartisan consensus in Republican and Democrat-led states",
      "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- Arkansas' Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom have little in common ideologically, but the two have both been vocal supporters of an idea that's been rapidly gaining bipartisan ground in the states: Students' cellphones need to be banned during the school day.",
      "At least eight states have enacted such bans over the past two years, and proposals are being considered in several more states this year.",
      "Here is a look at the push by states for such bans.",
      "The push for cellphone bans has been driven by concerns about the impact screen time has on children\u2019s mental health and complaints from teachers that cellphones have become a constant distraction in the classroom.",
      "Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, who has called on Congress to require warning labels on social media platforms about their effects on young people\u2019s lives, has said schools need to provide phone-free times.",
      "Nationally, 77% of U.S. schools say they prohibit cellphones at school for non-academic use, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. But that number is misleading. It does not mean students are following those bans or all those schools are enforcing them.",
      "Kim Whitman, co-founder of the Phone Free Schools Movement, said the issue is catching on because parents and teachers in both red and blue states are struggling with the consequences of kids on mobile devices.",
      "\u201cIt doesn't matter if you live in a big city or a rural town, urban or suburban, all children are struggling and need that seven-hour break from the pressures of phones and social media during the school day,\u201d she said.",
      "At least eight states \u2014 California, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Ohio, South Carolina and Virginia \u2014 have enacted measures banning or restricting students\u2019 use of cellphones in schools.",
      "The policies range widely. Florida was the first state to crack down on phones in school, passing a 2023 law that requires all public schools to ban cellphone use during class time and block access to social media on district Wi-Fi.",
      "A 2024 California law requires the state\u2019s nearly 1,000 school districts to create their own cellphone policies by July 2026.",
      "Several other states haven't banned phones, but have encouraged school districts to enact such restrictions or have provided funding to store phones during the day.",
      "Sanders announced a pilot program last year providing grants to schools that adopt phone-free policies, and more than 100 schools signed on. In her state of the state address this week, Sanders proposed an outright ban.",
      "\u201cWe will ban cellphones in our schools, bell to bell, so that our kids are not distracted, in class or out of it,\u201d Sanders said.",
      "Other governors recently calling for bans include Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, who was sworn in this month, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul has suggested she'll seek a statewide policy, but has not offered specifics.",
      "The cellphone bans have faced opposition from some parents who say they need to be able to contact their children directly in case of emergency.",
      "Some parents have pointed to recent school shootings where having access to cellphones was the only way some students were able to communicate with loved ones for what they thought might be the last time.",
      "But supporters of the bans have noted that students' phones could pose additional dangers during an emergency by distracting students or by revealing their location during an active shooter situation.",
      "Parents opposed to the ban have also said they want their children to have access to their phones for other needs, such as coordinating transportation.",
      "Keri Rodrigues, president of the National Parents Union, said she agrees about the dangers of social media on children but that the bans sought by states are taking too broad of an approach. Banning the devices during the school day is not going to solve underlying issues like bullying or the dangers of social media, she said.",
      "\u201cWe have not done our job as grown-ups to try to teach our kids the skills they need to actually navigate this technology,\u201d she said. \u201cWe've just kicked the can down the road and thrown them into the deep end of the pool when they're by themselves after school.\u201d",

      "Last week, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a legal challenge to the statute brought by TikTok, its China-based parent company ByteDance, and users of the app. The Justices seemed likely to uphold the law, which requires ByteDance to divest TikTok on national security grounds or face a ban in one of its biggest markets.",
      "\u201cIf the Supreme Court comes out with a ruling in favor of the law, President Trump has been very clear: Number one, TikTok is a great platform that many Americans use and has been great for his campaign and getting his message out. But number two, he\u2019s going to protect their data,\u201d Waltz said.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a deal maker. I don\u2019t want to get ahead of our executive orders, but we\u2019re going to create this space to put that deal in place,\" he added.",

      "Genetic evidence from a late Iron Age cemetery shows that women were closely related while unrelated men tended to come into the community from elsewhere, likely after marriage.",
      "An examination of ancient DNA recovered from 57 graves in Dorset in southwest England shows that two-thirds of the individuals were descended from a single maternal lineage. The cemetery was used from around 100 B.C. to 200 A.D.",
      "\u201cThat was really jaw-dropping \u2013 it\u2019s never been observed before in European prehistory,\u201d said study co-author Lara Cassidy, a geneticist at Trinity College Dublin.",
      "The findings, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, suggest that women stayed in the same circles throughout life \u2013 maintaining social networks and likely inheriting or managing land and property.",
      "Meanwhile \u201cit\u2019s your husband who is coming in as a relative stranger, dependent on a wife\u2019s family for land and livelihood,\u201d said Cassidy.",
      "This pattern \u2013 called matrilocality \u2013 is historically rare.",
      "Archaeologists studying grave sites in Britain and Europe have previously only detected the opposite pattern \u2013 women leaving their homes to join their husband\u2019s family group \u2013 in other ancient time periods, from the neolithic to the early Medieval period, said Guido Gnecchi-Ruscone at the Max Planck Institute in Germany, who was not part of the study.",
      "In studies of pre-industrial societies from around 1800 to the present, anthropologists found that men join their wives\u2019 extended family households only 8% of the time, said Cassidy.",
      "But archaeologists already knew there was something special about the role of women in Iron Age Britain. A patchwork of tribes with closely related languages and art styles \u2013 sometimes referred to as Celtic \u2013 lived in England before the Roman invasion in 43 A.D. Valuable items have been found buried with Celtic women, and Roman writers, including Julius Caesar, wrote with disdain about their relative independence and fighting prowess.",
      "The pattern of strong female kinship connections that the researchers found does not necessarily imply that women also held formal positions of political power, called matriarchy.",

      "A nonprofit research lab is getting attention from some wealthy tech philanthropists",
      "MONTREAL -- Peeps trickle out of a soundproof chamber as its door opens. Female zebra finches are chattering away inside the microphone-lined box. The laboratory room sounds like a chorus of squeaky toys.",
      "\u201cThey're probably talking about us a little bit,\u201d says McGill University postdoctoral fellow Logan James.",
      "It's unclear, of course, what they are saying. But James believes he is getting closer to deciphering their vocalizations through a partnership with the Earth Species Project. The nonprofit laboratory has drawn some of the technology industry's wealthiest philanthropists \u2014 and they want to see more than just scientific progress. On top of breakthroughs in animal language, they expect improved interspecies understanding will foster greater appreciation for the planet in the face of climate change.",
      "The Earth Species Project hopes to decode other creatures' communications with its pioneering artificial intelligence tools. The goal is not to build a \u201ctranslator that will allow us to speak to other species,\u201d Director of Impact Jane Lawton said. However, she added, \u201crudimentary dictionaries\u201d for other animals are not only possible but could help craft better conservation strategies and reconnect humanity with often forgotten ecosystems.",
      "\u201cWe believe that by reminding people of the beauty, the sophistication, the intelligence that is resident in other species and in nature as a whole, we can start to, kind of, almost repair that relationship,\" Lawton said.",
      "At McGill University, the technology generates specific calls during simulated conversations with live finches that help researchers isolate each unique noise. The computer processes calls in real time and responds with one of its own. Those recordings are then used to train the Berkeley, California-based research group\u2019s audio language model for animal sounds.",
      "This ad hoc collaboration is only a glimpse into what ESP says will come. By 2030, Lawton said, it expects \u201creally interesting insights into how other animals communicate.\u201d Artificial intelligence advancements are expediting the research. New grants totaling $17 million will help hire engineers and at least double the size of the research team, which currently has roughly seven members. Over the next two years, Lawton said, the nonprofit's researchers will select species that \u201cmight actually shift something\u201d in people's relationship with nature.",
      "Standing to benefit are animal groups threatened by habitat loss or human activity that could be better protected with better understandings of their languages. Existing collaborations aim to document the vocal repertoires \u2014 the distinct calls and their different contexts \u2014 of the Hawaiian crow and St. Lawrence River beluga whales.",
      "After spending more than two decades extinct in the wild, the crows have been reintroduced to their home of Maui. But some conservationists fear that critical vocabulary has faded in captivity. Lawton said the birds might need to relearn some \u201cwords\u201d before they reenter their natural habitat in droves.",
      "In Canada's St. Lawrence River, where shipping traffic imperils the marine mammals who feed there, the group's scientists are exploring whether machine learning can categorize unlabeled calls from the remaining belugas. Perhaps, Lawton suggested, authorities could alert nearby vessels if they understood that certain sounds signaled the whales were about to surface.",
      "Big donors include LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, the family charity founded by late Microsoft co-founder Paul G. Allen and Laurene Powell Jobs\u2019 Waverley Street Foundation. The latter aims to support \u201cbottom-up\u201d solutions to the \u201cclimate emergency.\u201d At the root of that crisis, according to Waverley Street Foundation President Jared Blumenfeld, is the idea that humans deserve \u201cdominion\u201d over the world.",
      "Blumenfeld finds that ESP's work is an important reminder that we are instead stewards of the planet.",
      "\"This is not a silver bullet,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s certainly part of a suite of things that can help transform how we view ourselves in relation to nature.\u201d",
      "Gail Patricelli -- an unaffiliated animal behavior professor at the University of California, Davis -- remembers when such tools were just \u201cpie in the sky.\u201d Researchers previously spent months laboring to manually comb through terabytes of recordings and annotate calls.",
      "She said she's seen an \u201cexponential takeoff\u201d the past few years in bioacoustics' use of machine learning to accelerate that process. While she finds that ESP has the promise to make finer distinctions in existing \u201cdictionaries,\u201d especially for harder-to-reach species, she cautioned observers against attributing human characteristics to these animals.",
      "Considering this research\u2019s high equipment and labor costs, Patricelli said she\u2019s happy to see big philanthropists backing it. But she said the field shouldn\u2019t rely too much on one funding source. Government support is still necessary, she noted, because ecosystem protection also requires that conservationists examine \u201cunsexy\u201d species that she expects get less attention than more charismatic ones. She also encouraged funders to consult scientists.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot to learn and it\u2019s very expensive,\u201d she said. \u201cThat might not be a big deal to some of these donors but it\u2019s very hard to come up with the money to do this.\u201d",
      "The current work largely involves developing baseline technologies to do all this. A separate initiative has recently described the basic elements of how sperm whales might talk. But ESP is trying to be \u201cspecies agnostic,\u201d AI Research Director Olivier Pietquin said, to provide tools that can sort out many animals\u2019 speech patterns.",
      "ESP introduced NatureLM-audio this fall, touting the system as the first large audio-language model fit for animals. The tool can identify species and distinguish characteristics such as sex or stage of life. When applied to a population \u2014 zebra finches \u2014 it had not been trained on, NatureLM-audio accurately counted the number of birds at a rate higher than random chance, according to ESP. The results were a positive sign for Pietquin that NatureLM might be able to scale across species.",
      "\u201cThat is only possible with a lot of computing, a lot of data and many, many collaborations with ecologists and biologists,\u201d he said. \u201cThat, I think, makes us, makes it, quite serious.\u201d",
      "ESP acknowledges that it isn\u2019t sure what will be discovered about animal communications and won\u2019t know when its model gets it absolutely right. But the team likens AI to the microscope: advancements that allowed scientists to see far more than previously considered possible.",
      "Zebra finches are highly social animals with large call repertoires. Whether congregating in pairs or by the hundreds, they produce hours of data \u2014 a help to the nonprofit's AI scientists given that animal sounds aren't as abundant as the pages of internet text scraped to train chatbots.",
      "James, an affiliated researcher with the Earth Species Project, struggles with the concept of decoding animal communications. Sure, he can clearly distinguish when a chick is screaming for food. But he doesn\u2019t expect to ever translate that call or any others into a human word.",
      "Still, he wonders if he can gather more hints about their interactions from aspects of the call such as its pitch or duration.",
      "\u201cSo can we find a link between a form and function is sort of our way of maybe thinking about decoding,\" James said. \u201cAs she elongates her call, is that because she\u2019s trying harder to elicit a response?\u201d",

      "SpaceX has launched a pair of lunar landers for U.S. and Japanese companies looking to jumpstart business up there",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- In a two-for-one moonshot, SpaceX launched a pair of lunar landers Wednesday for U.S. and Japanese companies looking to jumpstart business on Earth\u2019s dusty sidekick.",
      "The two landers rocketed away in the middle of the night from NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center, the latest in a stream of private spacecraft aiming for the moon. They shared the ride to save money but parted company an hour into the flight exactly as planned, taking separate roundabout routes for the monthslong journey.",
      "It\u2019s take 2 for the Tokyo-based ispace, whose first lander crashed into the moon two years ago. This time, it has a rover on board with a scoop to gather up lunar dirt for study and plans to test potential food and water sources for future explorers.",
      "Lunar newcomer Texas-based Firefly Aerospace is flying 10 experiments for NASA, including a vacuum to gather dirt, a drill to measure the temperature below the surface and a device that could be used by future moonwalkers to keep the sharp, abrasive particles off their spacesuits and equipment.",
      "Firefly\u2019s Blue Ghost \u2014 named after a species of U.S. Southeastern fireflies \u2014 should reach the moon first. The 6-foot-6-inches-tall (2-meter-tall) lander will attempt a touchdown in early March at Mare Crisium, a volcanic plain in the northern latitudes.",
      "The slightly bigger ispace lander named Resilience will take four to five months to get there, targeting a touchdown in late May or early June at Mare Frigoris, even farther north on the moon\u2019s near side.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t think this is a race. Some people say \u2018race to the moon,\u2019 but it\u2019s not about the speed,\u201d ispace\u2019s founder CEO Takeshi Hakamada said this week from Cape Canaveral.",
      "Both Hakamada and Firefly CEO Jason Kim acknowledge the challenges still ahead, given the wreckage littering the lunar landscape. Only five countries have successfully placed spacecraft on the moon since the 1960s: the former Soviet Union, the U.S., China, India and Japan.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve done everything we can on the design and the engineering,\u201d Kim said. Even so, he pinned an Irish shamrock to his jacket lapel Tuesday night for good luck.",
      "The U.S. remains the only one to have landed astronauts. NASA\u2019s Artemis program, the successor to Apollo, aims to get astronauts back on the moon by the end of the decade.",
      "Before that can happen, \u201cwe\u2019re sending a lot of science and a lot of technology ahead of time to prepare for that,\u201d NASA's science mission chief Nicky Fox said on the eve of launch.",
      "If acing their respective touchdowns, both spacecraft will spend two weeks operating in constant daylight, shutting down once darkness hits.",
      "Once lowered onto the lunar surface, ispace\u2019s 11-pound (5-kilogram) rover will stay near the lander, traveling up to hundreds of yards (meters) in circles at a speed of less than one inch (a couple centimeters) per second. The rover has its own special delivery to drop off on the lunar dust: a toy-size red house designed by a Swedish artist.",
      "NASA is paying $101 million to Firefly for the mission and another $44 million for the experiments. Hakamada declined to divulge the cost of ispace\u2019s rebooted mission with six experiments, saying it's less than the first mission that topped $100 million.",
      "Coming up by the end of February is the second moonshot for NASA by Houston-based Intuitive Machines. Last year, the company achieved the first U.S. lunar touchdown in more than a half-century, landing sideways near the south pole but still managing to operate.",

      "With a possible TikTok ban just days away, many U.S. users are looking for alternative social media platforms to help them keep up with pop culture or provide the type of entertaining videos that popularized the short-form video app.",
      "TikTok, which has been a cultural phenomenon, could be banned on Jan. 19 under a law that forces the platform to cut ties with its China-based parent company, ByteDance, or shut down its U.S. operation.",
      "The fate of social media platform will be decided by the Supreme Court, which last week heard oral arguments in a legal challenge to the statute and seemed likely to uphold the law. The court could rule on the case as soon as this week. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump has asked the justices to put the law on hold so he can negotiate a \u201cpolitical resolution\u201d to the issue after he takes office.",
      "TikTok has more than 170 million users in the U.S., and if it does get banned, it\u2019s not clear which competitors will benefit the most. Some experts think established social media platforms, such as Instagram and YouTube, could see the biggest influx of users. But some users are looking for something different and could turn to other apps.",
      "Here are the different alternatives and what to know about them:",
      "Recently, some U.S. TikTok users have flocked to the Chinese social media app Xiaohongshu in protest of the looming ban. Like TikTok, Xiaohongshu, which in English means \u201cLittle Red Book,\u201d combines e-commerce and short-form videos.",
      "The app has gained traction in China and other regions with a Chinese diaspora \u2014 such as Malaysia and Taiwan \u2014 racking up 300 million monthly active users, a majority of whom are young women who use it as a de-facto search engine for product, travel and restaurant recommendations, as well as makeup and skincare tutorials.",
      "On Tuesday, the Xiaohongshu, called \u201cRedNote\u201d by American users and on some app stores, was the top downloaded free app in Apple\u2019s U.S. app store.",
      "Lemon8, also owned by TikTok\u2019s parent company ByteDance, is a lesser-known lifestyle app that allows users to post pictures and short-form videos. Though the platform lets users post TikTok-like videos, it leans more into pictures and has been described as a mixture of Instagram and Pinterest.",
      "In the past few weeks, many creators have hailed Lemon8 as the place to go if TikTok is banned under federal law. Some have also recommended it through paid sponsored posts tagged #lemon8partner, indicating a recent corporate push to generate more users.",
      "But the law that targets TikTok also states the divest-or-ban requirement for ByteDance applies generally to apps that are owned or operated by the two companies or any of their subsidiaries. That means even though Lemon8 is not explicitly named in the statute, its future in the U.S. is also in jeopardy.",
      "Instagram launched Reels in 2020, a TikTok-like feed of short videos users can create or scroll through. The feature has proven to be massively popular and some experts say creators are likely to set up shop there if a TikTok ban does happen. As of 2022, Instagram had 2 billion active monthly users. Meta no longer discloses user numbers for its individual platforms.",
      "But could it replace TikTok? That depends. While many creators currently post on both platforms, some experts say the youngest users are unlikely to migrate to a service made popular by their millennial parents. And while Meta\u2019s algorithm is addictive, it\u2019s still not TikTok.",
      "In the past, some TikTok users have also blamed the surge of scrutiny on the platform on Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, pointing to a Washington Post report from 2022 that said the tech behemoth paid a Republican consulting firm to undermine TikTok through a nationwide media and lobbying campaign.",
      "Though TikTok dominates headlines as a driver of internet trends, Pew Research Center says YouTube is actually the most widely-used platform among teens and adults.",
      "YouTube users can scroll through Shorts just as they can on TikTok or Reels on Instagram and Facebook, allowing them to watch hours of bite-sized videos. Many of the videos featured on YouTube are from TikTok or creators who post to several platforms. That said, YouTube is still known for its longer-format videos so it may not have the variety of content that TikTok users are looking for \u2014 at least not yet.",
      "Snapchat, launched in 2011 with its infamous disappearing videos, remains popular among teens and younger adults. The platform gained so much traction that Meta designed a similar feature in Facebook and Instagram called \u201cStories\u201d that lets users post photos or videos that disappear within 24 hours. In 2020, Snapchat launched another feature that lets users \u201cshine a light on the most entertaining Snaps, no matter who created them.\u201d",
      "The platform is estimated to have roughly 692 million global monthly active users last year, according to eMarketer.",
      "For TikTok users who enjoy the \u201cTikTok Live\u201d feed that features livestreamed videos, Twitch could be a good alternative. The Amazon-owned platform is a leader in the streaming industry and allows users on the platform to watch some of the internet\u2019s most popular streamers, such as Kai Cenat. Twitch says it has 105 million monthly visitors.",
      "Clapper, a TikTok clone, has also been gaining some traction amid the looming ban. The app was launched in 2020 by Dallas-based entrepreneur Edison Chen, and focuses on Gen X and millennial users. In September of that year, the company described itself in a Facebook post as a \u201cfree speech\u201d platform that did not \u201ccensor posts and comments.\u201d But in blog post on its website from 2021, the company wrote it \u201cstopped being a \u2018Free Speech\u2019 platform\u201d in September 2020 and \u201cchanged its mission and goals\u201d to focus on \u201ccommunity\u201d.",
      "For TikTok users who want to get away from the overcrowded spots, there are lesser-known apps like Triller, which is popular for music videos, and Zigazoo, which was designed with kids in mind.",
      "If none of these apps tickle your fancy, it's also possible that other platforms could emerge in the next few months as companies attempt to attract users looking for a new place to go."

      "SAO PAULO -- Brazil's President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva on Monday signed a bill restricting the use of smartphones at school, following a global trend for such limitations.",
      "The move will impact students at elementary and high schools across the South American nation starting in February. It provides a legal framework to ensure students only use such devices in cases of emergency and danger, for educational purposes, or if they have disabilities and require them.",
      "\"We cannot allow humanism to be replaced by algorithms,\u201d Lula said in a closed ceremony at the presidential palace in the capital, Brasilia, adding that the bill \u201cacknowledges the work of every serious person in education, everyone who wants to take care of children and teenagers in this country.\u201d",
      "In May, Fundacao Getulio Vargas, a leading think-tank and university, said Brazil had more smartphones than people, with 258 million devices for a population of 203 million Brazilians. Local market researchers said last year that Brazilians spend 9 hours and 13 minutes per day on screens, one of the world's highest figures.",
      "Education minister Camilo Santana told journalists that children are going online at early ages, making it harder for parents to keep track of what they do, and that restricting smartphones at school will help them.",
      "The bill had rare support across the political spectrum, both from allies of leftist Lula and his far-right foe, former President Jair Bolsonaro.",
      "Many parents and students also approved the move. A survey released in October by Brazilian pollster Datafolha said that almost two-thirds of respondents supported banning the use of smartphones by children and teenagers at schools. More than three-quarters said those devices do more harm than good to their children.",
      "\u201c(Restricting cell phones) is tough, but necessary. It is useful for them to do searches for school, but to use it socially isn't good,\u201d said Ricardo Martins Ramos, 43, father of two girls and the owner of a hamburger restaurant in Rio de Janeiro. \u201cKids will interact more.\u201d",

      "As of 2023, about two-thirds of Brazilian schools imposed some restriction on cellphone use, while 28% banned them entirely, according to a survey released in August by the Brazilian Internet Steering Committee.",
      "The Brazilian states of Rio de Janeiro, Maranhao and Goias have already passed local bills to ban such devices at schools. However, authorities have struggled to enforce these laws.",
      "Authorities in Sao Paulo, the most populous state in Brazil, are discussing whether smartphones should be banned both in public and private schools.",
      "Gabriele Alexandra Henriques Pinheiro, 25, works at a beauty parlor and is the mother of a boy diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. She also agrees with the restrictions, but says adults will continue to be a bad example of smartphone use for children.",
      "\u201cIt is tough,\u201d she said. \u201cI try to restrict the time my son watches any screens, but whenever I have a task to perform I have to use the smartphone to be able to do it all,\u201d she said.",
      "Institutions, governments, parents and others have for years associated smartphone use by children with bullying, suicidal ideation, anxiety and loss of concentration necessary for learning. China moved last year to limit children\u2019s use of smartphones, while France has in place a ban on smartphones in schools for kids aged six to 15.",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to reverse the ban.",
      "A U.S. ban of TikTok began to take effect on Sunday, capping a high-stakes battle that pitted the federal government against one of the nation's most popular social media platforms.",
      "Congress passed the measure last spring with overwhelming bipartisan support, granting TikTok a 270-day window to cut its ties with China-based parent company ByteDance or face a ban.",
      "Instead of initiating a sale, however, TikTok pursued a legal challenge on First Amendment grounds that ended in failure at the Supreme Court on Friday.",
      "The unanimous ruling from the nation's highest court found merit in national security concerns regarding potential user data collection or content manipulation that the Chinese government might undertake.",
      "Yet the ultimate fate of TikTok remains uncertain. Rather than force TikTok to take the app dark, the ban targets third-party companies like cloud-service providers and app stores, meaning TikTok could circumvent such restrictions, at least temporarily.",
      "The platform became unavailable for some users Saturday evening, with a popup message in the app saying, \"Sorry, TikTok isn't available right now.\" By Sunday morning, App stores run by Apple, Google and Samsung began removing the app.",
      "The Biden administration said earlier this week that it would not enforce the ban on Sunday, leaving implementation of the measure to President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on Monday. Trump has vowed to reverse the ban.",
      "Here's what could be next for TikTok.",
      "TikTok could remain available for U.S. users over the coming days and weeks but the app would likely degrade in quality, experts previously told ABC News.",
      "The reason is because the ban would place restrictions on app stores and hosting companies, which provide the digital infrastructure on which web services like TikTok depend.",
      "Mandatory withdrawal of the app from major app stores would not only bar new users from downloading the app, it also would prevent existing users from updating it.",
      "Apple in a support update posted on Sunday said users who already installed ByteDance apps will be able to keep them on their device.",
      "\"But they can\u2019t be redownloaded if deleted or restored if you move to a new device,\" Apple said. \"In-app purchases and new subscriptions are no longer possible.\"",

      "A separate stipulation in the ban would also make it illegal for hosting companies to provide services for TikTok. The measure offers a fairly broad characterization of such firms.",
      "TikTok would stop functioning if the firm's U.S.-based hosting companies stopped providing services. However, the social media giant could establish partnerships with hosting companies outside the U.S., putting them out of reach of U.S. enforcement \u2013 in theory, at least.",
      "Such a move would keep TikTok available to U.S. users, but the service would likely be slower and glitchier as the digital infrastructure moves farther away, experts said.",
      "Trump is considering what executive actions he has available to allow TikTok to keep operating, sources familiar with the matter told ABC News.",
      "One option is an executive order that could attempt to direct the government to not enforce the law, but that avenue faces legal roadblocks, experts told ABC News, chief of which is that an executive order can't override a law that Congress has passed and that has now been upheld by the Supreme Court.",
      "Trump's Justice Department could still opt against enforcement of the law, reassuring app stores and cloud-service providers that they wouldn't face prosecution in the event of a violation.",
      "While the Justice Department has enforcement discretion, app providers like Apple and Google could still be subject to hefty fines under a law that has a five-year statute of limitations, which would extend it beyond the length of Trump's presidential term.",

      "\"I want to thank President Trump for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States. This is a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship,\" Chew said.",
      "TikTok may await a potential repeal of the law that banned the app in the first place.",
      "A repeal would require passage in both houses of Congress, landing the measure on Trump's desk for his signature.",
      "Congress voted in favor of the ban only nine months ago. In the House of Representatives, the ban passed by an overwhelming margin of 352-65. In the Senate, 79 members voted in favor of the measure, while 18 opposed and three abstained.",
      "Since then, however, Trump has voiced his disapproval of the measure and Republicans have taken control of both chambers of Congress. Even so, whether such a repeal would make its way to the floor, and its fate should it do so, are impossible to forecast.",

      "President Joe Biden has posthumously pardoned Black nationalist Marcus Garvey, who influenced Malcolm X and other Black civil rights leaders and was convicted of mail fraud in the 1920s",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden on Sunday posthumously pardoned Black nationalist Marcus Garvey, who influenced Malcolm X and other civil rights leaders and was convicted of mail fraud in the 1920s. Also receiving pardons were a top Virginia lawmaker and advocates for immigrant rights, criminal justice reform and gun violence prevention.",
      "Congressional leaders had pushed for Biden to pardon Garvey, with supporters arguing that Garvey's conviction was politically motivated and an effort to silence the increasingly popular leader who spoke of racial pride. After Garvey was convicted, he was deported to Jamaica, where he was born. He died in 1940.",
      "The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. said of Garvey: \u201cHe was the first man, on a mass scale and level\" to give millions of Black people \"a sense of dignity and destiny.\u201d",
      "It's not clear whether Biden, who leaves office Monday, will pardons people who have been criticized or threatened by President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "Issuing preemptive pardons \u2014 for actual or imagined offenses by Trump\u2019s critics that could be investigated or prosecuted by the incoming administration \u2014 would stretch the powers of the presidency in untested ways.",
      "Biden has set the presidential record for most individual pardons and commutations issued. He announced on Friday that he was commuting the sentences of almost 2,500 people convicted of nonviolent drug offenses. He also gave a broad pardon for his son Hunter, who was prosecuted for gun and tax crimes.",
      "The president has announced he was commuting the sentences of 37 of the 40 people on federal death row, converting their punishments to life imprisonment just as Trump, an outspoken proponent of expanding capital punishment, takes office. In his first term, Trump presided over an unprecedented number of executions, 13, in a protracted timeline during the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "A pardon relieves a person of guilt and punishment. A commutation reduces or eliminates the punishment but doesn\u2019t exonerate the wrongdoing.",
      "Among those pardoned on Sunday were:",
      "\u2014 Don Scott, who is the speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates in a chamber narrowly controlled by Democrats. He was convicted of a drug offense in 1994 and served eight years in prison. He was elected to the Virginia legislature in 2019, and later became the first Black speaker.",
      "\u201cI am deeply humbled to share that I have received a Presidential Pardon from President Joe Biden for a mistake I made in 1994 \u2014 one that changed the course of my life and taught me the true power of redemption,\u201d Scott said in a statement.",
      "\u2014Immigrant rights activist Ravi Ragbir, who was convicted of a nonviolent offence in 2001 and was sentenced to two years in prison and was facing deportation to Trinidad and Tobago.",
      "\u2014Kemba Smith Pradia, who was convicted of a drug offense in 1994 and sentenced to 24 years behind bars. She has since become a prison reform activist. President Bill Clinton commuted her sentence in 2000.",
      "\u2014Darryl Chambers of Wilmington, Delaware, a gun violence prevention advocate who was convicted of a drug offense and sentenced to 17 years in prison. He studies and writes about gun violence prevention.",
      "Biden commuted the sentences of two people:",
      "\u2014Michelle West, who was serving life in prison for her role in a drug conspiracy case in the early 1990s. West has a daughter who has written publicly about the struggle of growing up with a mother behind bars.",
      "\u2014Robin Peoples, who was convicted of robbing banks in northwest Indiana in the late 1990s and was sentenced to 111 years in prison. The White House said in a statement that Peoples would have faced significantly lower sentences today under current laws.",

      "Spotting a dog struggling to stay afloat in a icy Vermont River, Chris MacRitchie never hesitated.",
      "He jumped into the frigid waters and waded over to the dog, gently pulling it ashore where his wife, Erica, draped it with a sweatshirt. The dramatic rescue of the dog Friday afternoon in Berlin, Vermont, was caught on video by his son and has been shared widely on social media.",
      "MacRitchie's son, Ace, first spotted the dog as they were going through the drive-thru of a nearby Dunkin\u2019 Donuts. When they reached the river embankment, the father of two felt he had no choice but to save the pooch.",
      "\u201cIt was like one of those moments everyone probably has in their life like you\u2019re going to make a decision ... either trying to get in the water and help her or the alternative,\u201d MacRitchie said. \u201cSo, I felt I was obligated to at least try to fetch this dog out of the river, as I have two dogs myself, and I would hope someone would do that for them if they were in that spot.\u201d",
      "The video shows MacRitchie \u2014 dressed in a T-shirt, sweats and boots \u2014 approaching the river embankment as the dog struggles to get out. He calls out to the dog at first and his wife, Erica, can be heard encouraging him to rescue it.",
      "MacRitchie gingerly steps through the ice and into the river, audibly gasping as he wades about 20-feet toward the dog, which was on the other side of the frozen tributary of the Winooski River. His wife repeatedly shouts \u201cc'mon\u201d to the dog and exclaims \u201cOh, my God\u201d as MacRitchie lifts the dog, later identified as Arizona, out of the water and onto the icy embankment. He carries it over to his wife.",
      "\u201cThe only real stress I had about it wasn\u2019t getting in the cold water. It was the depth. I did not know if it was 20 feet deep or it was 2 feet deep,\u201d MacRitchie said. \u201cWhen I broke through and I got on my feet and it was like waist high, I was actually relieved by that. In my mind, during the moment, I thought, OK this isn\u2019t that bad. Yeah, it's cold, but I feel this is a very doable situation.\u201d",
      "After retrieving the dog, MacRitchie called the dog's owner, Morgan Cerasoli, whose number was listed on the dog tag.",
      "Cerasoli said she had been looking for her dog, a seven-year-old mutt who had originally been rescued from the side of the road in South Carolina, since Thursday. She was heading to pick up her daughter from school, when she got the call from MacRitchie who said he had \u201cpulled a drowning dog\u201d out of the river.\" He wanted to confirm it was her dog.",
      "\u201cI started crying, and I told him, oh, my God, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you. Let me pull a U-turn and I\u2019m coming right back,\u201d she said, as she sat besides Arizona during an interview. She said the dog has mostly recovered, though a checkup did find it was suffering from Lyme disease.",
      "After reuniting with her dog, Cerasoli said she saw the video and was brought to tears again -- over MacRitchie's exploits as well as the poor condition of Arizona in that moment.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s brave, it\u2019s selfless, it\u2019s commendable. It\u2019s everything that I think that we were on this Earth to be,\u201d she said of the rescue. \u201cSometimes it feels like that\u2019s very rare these days.\u201d"

    "summary": "Baltimore is seeing a sustained reduction in gun violence and city leaders believe investments in robust anti-violence efforts are finally paying off",
    "story": [
      "Baltimore is seeing a sustained reduction in gun violence and city leaders believe investments in robust anti-violence efforts are finally paying off",
      "BALTIMORE -- With his dad in prison and his mom suffering from alcoholism, Malik Grant faced abandonment and instability early on. He got used to people letting him down.",
      "So when outreach workers from a Baltimore anti-violence program offered to help him stay safe and leave the streets behind, he didn\u2019t necessarily have high expectations.",
      "Two years later, Grant has an apartment and a full-time job with the city\u2019s Department of Public Works. He recently started his own business that provides cleaning, landscaping and junk removal services. He plans to hire other young men from his old neighborhood to show them what is possible with hard work.",
      "\u201cI just needed a push,\u201d he said with a smile.",
      "Grant, 29, is among about 200 people receiving support through Baltimore\u2019s relatively new Group Violence Reduction Strategy, which targets the root causes of gun violence: hopelessness, joblessness, poverty, mental health, substance abuse, housing instability, poor conflict resolution and more.",
      "The program uses a \u201ccarrot and stick\u201d approach. Where possible, it offers resources and social services to those most likely to become shooters or victims. But if they stay involved in crime, they face police investigation and potential prosecution, which has led to over 350 arrests since the new strategy launched in January 2022.",
      "The early results are promising.",
      "Baltimore recorded 201 homicides in 2024, the lowest annual total in over a decade, according to police data. It marks a 23% drop from the previous year, a downward trend that began in 2023. Nonfatal shootings also have fallen significantly.",
      "To some extent, the data echoes nationwide trends since many cities saw violence peak during the pandemic. Philadelphia and Detroit are among those recording a recent drop in homicides.",
      "It\u2019s a relief for Baltimore, where gun violence surged after the 2015 death of Freddie Gray exposed an urgent need for police reform. And while other factors almost certainly contributed to the decrease, including changes in policing and strong detective work, city leaders are quick to credit efforts like the Group Violence Reduction Strategy.",
      "The program assigns each participant a life coach to help navigate everything from obtaining a driver\u2019s license and opening a bank account to applying for food stamps, earning a GED, finding stable housing and holding down a job.",
      "That often means leaving behind familiar patterns and embracing the unknown, even when a brighter future seems inaccessible or unlikely, said Sterling Herring with Youth Advocate Programs, which contracts with the city to provide services.",
      "\u201cA lot of our guys won\u2019t know their social security number, but know their jail ID,\u201d Herring said. \u201cThat\u2019s the mindset that we have to change.\u201d",
      "Grant survived a shooting in 2020 that left him hospitalized in a coma. After he connected with Youth Advocate Programs, he was eligible for emergency relocation and spent several months in hotels before moving to his current apartment. It\u2019s the first place he can proudly call home, and he shares the space with his beloved husky-pit bull mix.",
      "After months of receiving rental assistance, he will soon start fully covering the rent on his own.",
      "And Grant\u2019s company recently signed its first contract. He joked that being diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder makes him uniquely suited to run a cleaning business.",
      "\u201cHe turned his childhood trauma into treasure,\u201d life coach Sacha Smith said.",
      "Experts say so-called \u201cfocused deterrence\u201d programs are among the best ways to reduce gun violence, but Baltimore has tried and failed to implement similar strategies in the past.",
      "For them to succeed, participants need a life-changing level of support, which requires dedicated and effective staff with access to sufficient resources. The law enforcement side of the equation requires building strong cases that lead to successful prosecutions.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a hard thing to get right,\u201d said Daniel Webster, a professor at Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Center for Gun Violence Solutions in Baltimore. \u201cWhat you really want that program to do is change an entire system of how law enforcement works to combat gun violence.\u201d",
      "While praising the city\u2019s recent efforts, Webster also pointed to federal and state legislation to tighten gun laws and a more aggressive approach to prosecuting illegal firearm cases in Baltimore.",
      "Meanwhile, the Baltimore Police Department is undergoing significant court-ordered changes aimed at curbing unconstitutional practices. The agency was placed under a federal consent decree after the Justice Department launched an investigation in the wake of Gray\u2019s death from spinal injuries sustained during police transport.",
      "Homicides spiked around that time and remained elevated for years.",
      "Police Commissioner Richard Worley said the city is now proving it\u2019s possible to simultaneously reduce violent crime and reform law enforcement. He attributed the success to strong partnerships between city agencies, community groups and law enforcement.",
      "The new anti-violence strategy now operates in four of nine police districts, with plans to expand citywide. Researchers found it was responsible for reducing shootings and homicides by roughly a quarter in the 18 months after it was implemented in the city\u2019s notoriously violent Western District.",
      "Worley said increased community trust and lower caseloads are also helping detectives solve more homicides. Officers are going after the relatively small number of known shooters, rather than conducting large-scale arrests.",
      "Mayor Brandon Scott, who won reelection last year, released a five-year plan in 2021 that he hoped would reduce Baltimore gun violence by 15% annually. He created a new office to oversee anti-violence efforts, including the city\u2019s flagship Safe Streets program, which employs conflict mediators with credibility and knowledge of the streets.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking about really a herculean effort,\u201d Scott said in a recent interview.",
      "Maryland Gov. Wes Moore visited Baltimore earlier this month for a news conference about the homicide numbers, praising what he called \u201can \u2018all of the above\u2019 approach.\u201d",
      "But officials also acknowledged the still-staggering loss of life.",
      "Kierra Morrison, whose 17-year-old son was shot and killed on Christmas Eve, attended a candlelight vigil this month in downtown Baltimore to mourn last year\u2019s 201 victims. The city\u2019s recent accomplishments brought her little comfort.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m lost for words,\u201d she said.",
      "Morrison said her son had recently been talking about enrolling in a job training program. It made her hopeful he would find a bright future despite recent challenges. If only he\u2019d had more time."

    "summary": "After years of flooding and two presidential administrations, homeowners in Shiloh say they are still waiting for state and federal agencies to make them whole.",
    "story": [
      "Advocates followed top federal officials around the country to call for action.",
      "At a recent church service in Cleveland, a group of visitors from a rural Alabama community nearly 900 miles away, including pastor and business owner Timothy Williams, joined congregants in singing the spiritual \"I Don't Mind Waiting.\"",
      "Williams has grown used to waiting.",
      "After six years of frequent flooding, two presidential administrations and numerous reassurances from top officials, homeowners like Williams who live in the majority-Black Shiloh community say they are still waiting for state and federal agencies to make them whole.",
      "Now, with the Biden administration ending Monday, they feel they are running out of time.",
      "\"The longer they put us on hold, things are getting worse and worse,\" said Williams, who has been advocating for Shiloh since 2018, after community members say a project by the Alabama Department of Transportation (ALDOT) to widen an adjacent highway led to flooding on their properties.",
      "When the state denied responsibility for the flooding, community leaders turned to the federal government for help. In September 2022, the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration opened an investigation into their concerns.",
      "The administration says it aims to complete investigations within six months, but after a year with no resolution, Shiloh residents focused their efforts on reaching the top transportation official in America: U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.",
      "Shiloh residents became hopeful last spring when Buttigieg traveled to their community to see how runoff from the expanded highway drained onto their properties. He toured the historic community, listening to residents and telling them Washington would make things right.",
      "The people of Shiloh say they were optimistic about what was to come, but when the federal investigation came to a close in October -- more than two years after it began -- the resulting Voluntary Resolution Agreement with ALDOT fell short of their expectations.",
      "The deal required the state to mitigate future flooding in Shiloh, but it did not address existing property damage. It also did not assign blame for the flooding, raising questions as to whether any government entity is liable for compensating the residents for their losses.",
      "\"We are closely coordinating with the Federal Highway Administration on our efforts to follow through with the terms of the Voluntary Resolution Agreement,\" ALDOT spokesperson Tony Harris told ABC News.",
      "On the brink of yet another administration change, Williams wants Buttigieg to commit more resources to Shiloh in his final days in office.",
      "\"We want him to give us a binding written agreement that will cover the damages of the people's homes and their properties and make the people whole,\" Williams said. \"That's all we're asking him to do and he can do that.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Transportation, however, said the secretary cannot meet this demand.",
      "\"Congress has not authorized any programs or funding for DOT that can provide emergency relief directly to communities experiencing hardship, so this whole-of-government approach is critical to help the Shiloh community access federal assistance that is not available through DOT alone,\" the spokesperson told ABC News.",
      "The flooding in Shiloh has consequences ranging from transportation to housing to environment, spanning the jurisdictions of a web of federal agencies. Some of these departments are involved in a task force led by the U.S. Transportation Department to identify resources available for Shiloh, Environmental Protection Agency spokesperson James Pinkney told ABC News.",
      "\"EPA shared all funding opportunities and technical assistance available to the community,\" Pinkney wrote, adding that Shiloh community members applied for an EPA grant program in November.",
      "Since the Voluntary Resolution Agreement did not assign liability for the flooding, the responsibility for finding government funds to fix the flood damage has largely fallen to the Shiloh community members. They now say they've been wading through red tape while their homes fill with water.",
      "With the clock ticking toward another Trump administration, Shiloh community leaders are worried they'll be left behind. They aren't waiting for federal agencies to come to them anymore.",
      "In December, Williams and his daughters traveled from Alabama to Ohio, where Buttigieg was scheduled to speak before the City Club of Cleveland.",
      "In his address, Buttigieg discussed the accomplishments of his administration, including tackling infrastructure inequities in vulnerable communities.",
      "\"Many communities had transportation projects done to them rather than with them, often because they lacked the wealth or political power to resist or reshape them,\" Buttigieg said.",
      "Listening closely alongside the Williams family were some of their supporters: Shiloh-area native Dr. Robert Bullard, known as the \"father of environmental justice\" for his pioneering research, and representatives from the Sierra Club.",
      "\"The point of transportation is to connect, and yet there were so many places where transportation functioned to divide, sometimes contributing to racial and economic divisions,\" Buttigieg told the audience. \"We can do something about it, and we are.\"",
      "In the case of Shiloh, however, what exactly can be done and who should do it remains unclear. All the while, the flooding continues.",
      "When asked by ABC News if he would meet with the Shiloh families who'd come to Cleveland, Buttigieg said he \"would want to take that up directly with them.\"",
      "\"We'll continue to do everything we can, both within and beyond any kind of formal and official steps, to try to support that community because I'll never forget what they're going through,\" Buttigieg said.",
      "After they were denied another meeting with the secretary, Williams and Bullard put together a petition with roughly 5,000 signatures demanding a binding agreement to cover damage to residents' properties.",
      "On Tuesday, the group traveled another 900 miles, heading to Washington to deliver their petition directly to the U.S. Transportation Department before Buttigieg's term ends.",
      "\"We want to see a victory,\" Bullard said. \"How this community overcame all odds and got the resources from the federal government to make them whole.\"",
      "Sierra Club Executive Director Ben Jealous joined the group to call for justice in Shiloh.",
      "\"Their community's been turned into a drainage ditch by the Alabama Department of Transportation with U.S. Department of Transportation dollars,\" Jealous said.",
      "After relentless flooding and tireless advocacy, Shiloh's 150-year legacy still hangs in the balance. While Washington politics churn on, their homes continue to sink and runoff drowns their generational wealth.",
      "Bullard stressed that there is still time for Washington to act.",
      "\"It's already been two administrations that have allowed this to happen,\" Bullard said. \"This should not -- and must not -- bleed into a third administration.\"",

      "The Supreme Court unanimously upheld the federal law banning TikTok beginning unless it\u2019s sold by its China-based parent company, holding that the risk to national security posed by its ties to China overcomes concerns about limiting speech by the app. A ban is set to into effect on Jan. 19, 2025.",

      "Donald Trump's inauguration as the country\u2019s 47th president was expected to be an extravagant break from tradition \u2014 before it got moved indoors due to cold weather.",
      "There will still be well-known performers, influential billionaires as guests and foreign heads of state. Unlike his first inauguration eight years ago, Trump will be welcomed back to office by business titans and global leaders, groups that often shunned him in his first term.",
      "Here are some things to look out for during Trump\u2019s inauguration.",
      "Expect to see Melania Trump, the president-elect\u2019s five children and grandkids. Don Jr., his eldest son, and Lara Trump, who is married to Eric Trump, have gained more influence over the past year. The fathers of Trump's two sons-in-law were given key adviser posts as well. While Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner have taken a step back, they are expected to attend just like they did for election night.",
      "But the Capitol Rotunda can only hold around 600 people, according to organizers. There will be precious few spots for Supreme Court justices, military leaders, former presidents and their spouses, Cabinet nominees and visiting dignitaries \u2014 along with the 535 members of Congress who traditionally get prime spots, though some Democratic lawmakers are skipping the ceremony.",

Underwood, who went from 2005 \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d contestant to the most decorated artist in CMT Music Awards history, was a surprise get for the president-elect\u2019s inauguration program.",
      "Another unexpected announcement came from the Village People, the late-70s American disco group behind the hit \u201cY.M.C.A.\u201d The group was booked for a Trump rally in Washington on Sunday and at one of the inaugural balls. The hit song was played at the end of Trump rallies and became a viral trend on social media after the election with people mimicking the president-elect\u2019s signature dance moves.",
      "Other performers will include two of Trump\u2019s musical favorites: opera singer Christopher Macchio, who will sing the \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner,\u201d and country singer Lee Greenwood, known for his patriotic anthem, \u201cGod Bless the USA,\u201d also played at Trump rallies.",
      "Singer-songwriter Gavin DeGraw, best known for his hit song \u201cI Don\u2019t Want To Be,\u201d will perform at one of the three balls Trump is attending. Country singers Jason Aldean, Parker McCollum and country music band Rascal Flatts will be performing at the other two balls.",
      "Trump is known for delivering hour-plus speeches where he makes grand promises, attacks political opponents and mocks some foreign leaders.",
      "During his 16-minute inaugural address in 2017, Trump stuck to his campaign script and painted a bleak picture of the country blaming other countries for shuttering factories and shrinking the middle class. He said he would end \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d and would govern with an \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach.",
      "This time around, his main campaign promise has been to launch the largest deportation operation in history and seal off the U.S.-Mexico border. He has spoken about ushering in a \u201cgolden age\u201d and pledged to impose tariffs on imports, rolling out more details in recent days on how he plans to pursue those goals.",
      "He told NBC News on Saturday that the theme of his inaugural address will be \u201cunity and strength, and also the word \u2018fairness.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cBecause you have to be treating people fairly,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just say, \u2018Oh, everything\u2019s going to be wonderful.\u2019 You know, we went through hell for four years with these people. And so, you know, something has to be done about it. ... You can\u2019t have that happen, and we shouldn\u2019t have that happen.\u201d",
      "Trump may be breaking a tradition on Inauguration Day after extending invitations to world leaders. No heads of state have previously made an official visit to the U.S. for the inauguration.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping was the first foreign leader whose invitation to the inauguration became public last December. Xi will not attend but is sending Vice President Han Zheng as his special representative.",
      "Argentina\u2019s president, Javier Milei, and Italy\u2019s premier Giorgia Meloni, accepted Trump's offer. The offices of Ecuadorean President Daniel Noboa and Paraguayan President Santiago Pe\u00f1a have also said they were invited and were planning to attend."

      "When Donald Trump arrived in Washington in 2017 on the eve of his first inauguration, he was a stranger to most in town",
      "NEW YORK -- When Donald Trump arrived in Washington in 2017 just before his first inauguration, he was a stranger to most in town. As the only president in history without prior experience in public office or the military, it was unclear how he would govern.",
      "Not this time.",
      "After four years in the Oval Office, the once and future president returns to power with know-how and a very different team. The political landscape has been transformed, with both chambers of Congress now filled with Republicans beholden to him. He has stocked the Supreme Court and federal courts at all levels. World leaders who were once critics have left the world stage or are more willing to work with him.",
      "Here are some of the ways things have changed:",
      "Trump's first-term agenda was, particularly in its early days, often stymied by the courts and infighting. Many of his Cabinet picks quietly or openly worked to stop his ideas.",
      "But Trump spent four years learning how legislation in passed, how to deal with world leaders and how to maximize the power of the office.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to do an even better job because now we have a tremendous amount of experience,\u201d he told reporters at a recent news conference at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida resort, as he reflected on how things had changed.",
      "Trump has often cited his inexperience to explain why he had hired people whom he later regretted for bringing on board.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t know the people. I had to rely on people to give me names,\u201d he said during a Turning Point event in 2023. But now, he said, \u201dI know the great ones. I know the smart ones. I know the dumb ones, I know the weak ones, I know the stupid ones.\u201d",
      "Trump and his allies have also had four years out of office to lay the groundwork for his return. Long before his formal transition kicked into gear, allied groups such as the Heritage Foundation and the America First Policy Institute were working to draft hundreds of policy papers, executive orders and legislation ready to push on Day 1.",
      "In 2017, the House speaker was Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who had pulled his endorsement during the 2016 campaign and later called Trump an \u201c authoritarian narcissist.\" The Senate majority leader was Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who labeled Trump \u201cstupid,\" \u201cill-tempered\u201d and a \u201cdespicable human being.\"",
      "Ryan did not run for reelection in 2018. McConnell has stepped down as party leader but remains in the Senate. Vocal critics such as Utah Sen. Mitt Romney and Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney are gone. Trump's aggressive plays in Republican primaries have created a new generation of members who listen to him. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and the new Senate Majority Leader, John Thune of South Dakota, know their power depends, in large part, on Trump's backing.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s single-handedly changed the party,\" said Sen. Jim Banks, R-Ind. Banks was sworn in as a member of the House as Trump arrived in Washington in 2017, when Banks said, Trump often have to deal with Republican pushback.",
      "Now, \u201ceveryone knows that Donald Trump is calling the shots,\" Banks said. \u201cHe\u2019s the quarterback ... and we\u2019re going to follow his lead and back him up and pass the agenda that the American people voted for when they elected him this time.\u201d",
      "Banks cited the reaction when Trump addressed Senate Republicans in the Capitol while in town for former President Jimmy Carter\u2019s funeral. All the members, including past critics, he said, were on their feet, expressing their support for Trump, his agenda and his Cabinet nominees.",
      "Trump went through half a dozen campaign managers over his first two White House runs and four chiefs of staff during his first term. His White House was known for backbiting and squabbling among competing factions.",
      "Trump's 2024 operation was different. Guided by veteran Florida Republican operative Susie Wiles, the campaign was widely praised by both parties as his most disciplined, professional and competent by far.",
      "Wiles is joining Trump in Washington as his chief of staff. While there are still personality clashes, Wiles has made clear she won't tolerate those who try to hijack the operation.",
      "\"I don\u2019t welcome people who want to work solo or be a star,\u201d Wiles told the news outlet Axios in a recent interview. \u201cMy team and I will not tolerate backbiting, second-guessing inappropriately, or drama. These are counterproductive to the 'mission.\u201d",
      "German Chancellor Angela Merkel stepped down in 2021. Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau is on his way out. And there have been turbulent leadership changes in Britain, France and South Korea.",

      "As he prepares to become the nation\u2019s first millennial vice president, JD Vance is already a budding kingmaker in Republican politics and the presumptive heir to the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement",
      "NEW YORK -- As he prepares to become the nation's first millennial vice president, JD Vance is already the presumptive heir to the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement.",
      "Vance hasn't been assigned a specific portfolio in the White House like some of his predecessors. While he has long-standing areas of interest, from tech and disaster relief to immigration, people close to the former Ohio senator say he sees his role as doing whatever is needed to best help President-elect Donald Trump and his incoming administration accomplish his agenda. He is also expected to be a liaison to Capitol Hill, leveraging relationships he built during his two years in the Senate.",
      "\u201cI would say JD\u2019s the guy that will plug any hole or be as beneficial to the administration and be as beneficial to President Trump as possible,\u201d said Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, a friend and ally.",
      "Moreno said Vance would also continue the role he played during the campaign as Trump\u2019s chief messenger, defending him on television and jousting with reporters.",
      "\"His most important job is to be out there and be President Trump\u2019s pit bull,\u201d said Moreno. When Trump needs somebody to defend him or his policies, he added, \u201cJD\u2019s going to be the guy that leads the troops to have President Trump\u2019s back.\u201d",
      "It has been an astounding eight years for the 40-year-old \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d author, who has transformed himself from a former venture capitalist and harsh Trump critic. Vance will be a critical part not just of Trump's return to the White House but the future of his political movement. With Trump prevented by the Constitution from running in 2028, Vance is a natural successor.",
      "But first, he needs to stay in Trump's good graces.",
      "Trump's decision to tap Vance as his No. 2 landed with a thud at first.",
      "Vance faced a barrage of criticism over his past remarks deriding women who weren't parents as \u201cchildless cat ladies\u201d and for suggesting those without biological children should not be in positions of power. Headlines panned him as the least popular vice presidential candidate in modern history.",
      "But Vance soon delivered a widely praised performance during the vice presidential debate and established himself as a top Trump surrogate, someone who regularly answered reporters' questions and sat for interviews with outlets of all stripes. He once appeared on three Sunday shows in a single day.",
      "Vance's willingness to wade into sometimes hostile territory earned Trump's praise.",
      "\u201cHe is a feisty guy, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Trump said during his victory speech the night of the election, describing how he had instructed Vance to \u201cgo into the enemy camp.\" While some Republicans might have resisted going on CNN or speaking with The New York Times, Trump said, Vance \"really looks forward to it, and then he just goes in and absolutely obliterates them.\u201d",
      "Vance, he added, \u201cturned out to be a good choice. I took a little heat at the beginning, but he was \u2014 I knew the brain was a good one, about as good as it gets.\"",
      "Things didn\u2019t go so well for Trump\u2019s last vice president.",
      "Mike Pence, who was unfailingly loyal to his boss, ended his term fleeing from a violent mob on Jan. 6, 2021, after he refused to go along with Trump\u2019s scheme to overturn the results of the 2020 election he lost to Democrat Joe Biden.",
      "Trump would not forgive Pence, blaming him for their loss, and turned legions of his supporters against his second-in-command. Pence would end his own bid for the 2024 nomination months before the first votes were cast after struggling to raise money or draw significant crowds.",
      "\u201cPence and Trump started off on this same footing, with the same high expectations, and had a great working relationship,\u201d said Devin O\u2019Malley, the vice president\u2019s former press secretary and senior adviser to his campaign. O\u2019Malley stressed that he did not expect things to end up the same way for Vance, whom he said \u201cappears to be hitting all the marks to be successful in the role.\u201d",
      "While Trump and Pence were always said to be close before their split, they had very different personalities. Trump picked Pence, someone he barely knew, in part to assuage evangelical Christians alarmed over Trump's behavior and to win over other Republicans skeptical of his outsider candidacy.",
      "Aides have long described Trump and Vance as real friends who enjoy each other\u2019s company. The two speak almost every day on the phone, in person or by text.",
      "Unlike Pence, Vance is also ideologically aligned with Trump on major issues ranging from trade to the use of U.S. forces overseas. He is close to Trump\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and has developed strong relationships with incoming chief of staff Susie Wiles, senior adviser Stephen Miller and others.",
      "He also has ties to the new generation of tech billionaires ascendant in Trump's orbit, including Elon Musk and Peter Thiel, who once employed Vance and backed his rise in politics.",
      "While 2028 is years away, Vance for now is seen by many as the natural torchbearer for the MAGA movement, even as other Republicans with national ambitions circle nearby.",
      "Senior Trump adviser Jason Miller called him \u201cthe future of the Republican Party and this movement that President Trump has started.\u201d",
      "\u201cI really see him as being the person to be the flag bearer going forward, following President Trump,\u201d he said at a recent gathering of business leaders.",
      "When he is sworn in on Monday, Vance will make history as the first millennial to serve in the role and the first vice president in nearly two decades with young children.",
      "Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., recently traveled with Vance to North Carolina to meet with victims of Hurricane Helene. She suggested his relative youth on the national stage gave Vance certain advantages including a comfort with social media and different communication style.",
      "\u201cI think because he is younger he has a boldness that \u2013 with the exception of President Trump \u2013 as you age, your boldness I think becomes shade by lessons learned over the years,\u201d Capito said.",
      "People close to Vance like to stress that he is a regular person \u2014 \u201cabout as normal a guy as there\u2019s ever been in politics,\u201d Moreno said \u2014 with a working-class background.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019ll wear sweatshirts. He roots for sports teams... He\u2019s a guy\u2019s guy. He\u2019s a bro\u2019s bro,\" said Terry Schilling, president of American Principles Project, who has been advising Vance informally on cultural and family issues since he started running for the Senate. \"He\u2019ll have a beer with you. He'll watch a football game with you. He'll tease you, he\u2019ll rib you. He\u2019s also going to work hard and be serious when he needs to.\u201d",
      "Indeed, after his beloved Ohio State clinched a spot in the national football championship game, Vance took to social media to bemoan his dilemma. The Buckeyes play Notre Dame for the title in Atlanta on Monday night, hours after he and Trump are set to be sworn into office.",
      "\u201cHopefully everyone is cool with me skipping the inauguration so I can go to the national title game,\u201d Vance joked on X, sharing a mock comic strip featuring two red buttons \u2014 \u201cAttend your own inauguration\u201d and \u201cGo watch the Buckeyes win a national title\u201d \u2014 and a sweating superhero torn between them.",
      "It was the kind of quip relatable to any sports fan and the latest burnishing of his regular-guy persona.",
      "But Vance is scheduled to stay in Washington \u2014 even if he'll be checking his phone at the Liberty Ball."

      "On the eve of Monday's inauguration of Republican President-elect Donald Trump, Biden planned to deliver a final farewell from the state that brought him to the dance, as he likes to say.",
      "Biden, accompanied by his wife, first lady Jill Biden, was scheduled to visit Royal Missionary Baptist Church in North Charleston to worship and speak on the legacy of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., the White House said. Monday is the federal holiday honoring the slain civil rights leader.",
      "Afterward, the Bidens will tour the International African American Museum. It was built on a waterfront site where tens of thousands of enslaved Africans were brought to the U.S. from the late 1760s through 1808, according to the museum's website.",

      "\u201cI know Joe. We know Joe. But most importantly, Joe knows us,\u201d the congressman said at the time.",

      "It's the day before Donald Trump's inauguration and he plans a series of Washington events that celebrate his return to power and his \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement",
      "WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump is spending the eve of his inauguration in a series of Washington events that celebrate his return to power and his \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement as he prepares to move back into the White House at a time of deep national political divisions.",
      "Washington has prepared in unprecedented ways to keep the unfolding events save and secure. But unlike when Trump helped spark a mob of his supporters to attack the Capitol and tried to retain power in 2021 after his loss to Democrat Joe Biden, officials are not expecting massive protests, unrest and violence this time. Instead, the city is braced for crowds celebrating Trump's second term and MAGA's total control of the Republican Party.",
      "It is a remarkable turnaround after Trump left the nation\u2019s capital four years in disgrace and skipped the inauguration of his successor. Trump blasted his way through the 2024 GOP presidential primary and won November's election by an Electoral College margin unseen since Democrat Barack Obama was reelected in 2012.",
      "Yet even with that comfortable victory and his party in full, albeit narrow, control of Congress, the incoming president remains one of the most polarizing figures in U.S. history, with nearly as many fierce detractors as ardent supporters.",
      "That means it could be difficult to fulfill postelection pledges about promoting bipartisanship while healing political differences. He told NBC News on Saturday that unity would be a theme of his inauguration speech Monday at the Capitol, along with strength and fairness.",
      "\u201cJanuary 20th cannot come fast enough!,\" he posted on his social media site. \u201cEverybody, even those that initially opposed a Victory by President Donald J. Trump and the Trump Administration, just want it to happen.\u201d",
      "Keeping to tradition, Trump spent Saturday night at Blair House, the president's official guest residence on Pennsylvania Avenue, across from the White House. He arrived there after a party at his golf club in Sterling, Virginia, about 30 miles west of the city, that illuminated the night sky.",
      "He had arrived in Washington from his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, aboard a C-32, the military variant of the Boeing 757, painted in the iconic presidential powder blue and white color scheme. The aircraft that would be known as Air Force One if the president were aboard carried the president-elect as Special Air Mission 47.",
      "Sunday will be Trump's first full day back in the capital since the election. It gives him a chance to enjoy the moment and fire up his core supporters before Inauguration Day's heavy dose of official pomp, including the swearing-in at noon.",
      "Trump planned to place a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery before addressing a rally downtown at Capital One Arena, home of Washington pro basketball and hockey teams.",
      "With frigid temperatures expected Monday, Trump directed his oath of office \u2014 now set for the Capitol Rotunda \u2014 and most of Monday\u2019s outdoor events be moved indoors. The traditional parade will be held, in some form, at Capital One Arena.",
      "Trump also was to attend a candlelight dinner Sunday where he was expected to speak.",
      "Biden, in his final full day in office, scheduled a trip to South Carolina, a state that holds special meaning after his commanding win in the 2020 Democratic primary there set him up to achieve his life\u2019s goal of being elected president.",
      "Biden, accompanied by his wife, first lady Jill Biden, was set to visit a church in North Charleston to worship and speak on the legacy of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., the White House said. Monday is also the federal holiday honoring the slain civil rights leader.",
      "The president used his farewell address earlier in the week to warn of a growing \u201coligarchy\" of ultra-rich interests gaining power and threatening the nation's very democracy."

    "story": [
      "Baltimore is seeing a sustained reduction in gun violence and city leaders believe investments in robust anti-violence efforts are finally paying off",
      "BALTIMORE -- With his dad in prison and his mom suffering from alcoholism, Malik Grant faced abandonment and instability early on. He got used to people letting him down.",
      "So when outreach workers from a Baltimore anti-violence program offered to help him stay safe and leave the streets behind, he didn\u2019t necessarily have high expectations.",
      "Two years later, Grant has an apartment and a full-time job with the city\u2019s Department of Public Works. He recently started his own business that provides cleaning, landscaping and junk removal services. He plans to hire other young men from his old neighborhood to show them what is possible with hard work.",
      "\u201cI just needed a push,\u201d he said with a smile.",
      "Grant, 29, is among about 200 people receiving support through Baltimore\u2019s relatively new Group Violence Reduction Strategy, which targets the root causes of gun violence: hopelessness, joblessness, poverty, mental health, substance abuse, housing instability, poor conflict resolution and more.",
      "The program uses a \u201ccarrot and stick\u201d approach. Where possible, it offers resources and social services to those most likely to become shooters or victims. But if they stay involved in crime, they face police investigation and potential prosecution, which has led to over 350 arrests since the new strategy launched in January 2022.",
      "The early results are promising.",
      "Baltimore recorded 201 homicides in 2024, the lowest annual total in over a decade, according to police data. It marks a 23% drop from the previous year, a downward trend that began in 2023. Nonfatal shootings also have fallen significantly.",
      "To some extent, the data echoes nationwide trends since many cities saw violence peak during the pandemic. Philadelphia and Detroit are among those recording a recent drop in homicides.",
      "It\u2019s a relief for Baltimore, where gun violence surged after the 2015 death of Freddie Gray exposed an urgent need for police reform. And while other factors almost certainly contributed to the decrease, including changes in policing and strong detective work, city leaders are quick to credit efforts like the Group Violence Reduction Strategy.",
      "The program assigns each participant a life coach to help navigate everything from obtaining a driver\u2019s license and opening a bank account to applying for food stamps, earning a GED, finding stable housing and holding down a job.",
      "That often means leaving behind familiar patterns and embracing the unknown, even when a brighter future seems inaccessible or unlikely, said Sterling Herring with Youth Advocate Programs, which contracts with the city to provide services.",
      "\u201cA lot of our guys won\u2019t know their social security number, but know their jail ID,\u201d Herring said. \u201cThat\u2019s the mindset that we have to change.\u201d",
      "Grant survived a shooting in 2020 that left him hospitalized in a coma. After he connected with Youth Advocate Programs, he was eligible for emergency relocation and spent several months in hotels before moving to his current apartment. It\u2019s the first place he can proudly call home, and he shares the space with his beloved husky-pit bull mix.",
      "After months of receiving rental assistance, he will soon start fully covering the rent on his own.",
      "And Grant\u2019s company recently signed its first contract. He joked that being diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder makes him uniquely suited to run a cleaning business.",
      "\u201cHe turned his childhood trauma into treasure,\u201d life coach Sacha Smith said.",
      "Experts say so-called \u201cfocused deterrence\u201d programs are among the best ways to reduce gun violence, but Baltimore has tried and failed to implement similar strategies in the past.",
      "For them to succeed, participants need a life-changing level of support, which requires dedicated and effective staff with access to sufficient resources. The law enforcement side of the equation requires building strong cases that lead to successful prosecutions.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a hard thing to get right,\u201d said Daniel Webster, a professor at Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Center for Gun Violence Solutions in Baltimore. \u201cWhat you really want that program to do is change an entire system of how law enforcement works to combat gun violence.\u201d",
      "While praising the city\u2019s recent efforts, Webster also pointed to federal and state legislation to tighten gun laws and a more aggressive approach to prosecuting illegal firearm cases in Baltimore.",
      "Meanwhile, the Baltimore Police Department is undergoing significant court-ordered changes aimed at curbing unconstitutional practices. The agency was placed under a federal consent decree after the Justice Department launched an investigation in the wake of Gray\u2019s death from spinal injuries sustained during police transport.",
      "Homicides spiked around that time and remained elevated for years.",
      "Police Commissioner Richard Worley said the city is now proving it\u2019s possible to simultaneously reduce violent crime and reform law enforcement. He attributed the success to strong partnerships between city agencies, community groups and law enforcement.",
      "The new anti-violence strategy now operates in four of nine police districts, with plans to expand citywide. Researchers found it was responsible for reducing shootings and homicides by roughly a quarter in the 18 months after it was implemented in the city\u2019s notoriously violent Western District.",
      "Worley said increased community trust and lower caseloads are also helping detectives solve more homicides. Officers are going after the relatively small number of known shooters, rather than conducting large-scale arrests.",
      "Mayor Brandon Scott, who won reelection last year, released a five-year plan in 2021 that he hoped would reduce Baltimore gun violence by 15% annually. He created a new office to oversee anti-violence efforts, including the city\u2019s flagship Safe Streets program, which employs conflict mediators with credibility and knowledge of the streets.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking about really a herculean effort,\u201d Scott said in a recent interview.",
      "Maryland Gov. Wes Moore visited Baltimore earlier this month for a news conference about the homicide numbers, praising what he called \u201can \u2018all of the above\u2019 approach.\u201d",
      "But officials also acknowledged the still-staggering loss of life.",
      "Kierra Morrison, whose 17-year-old son was shot and killed on Christmas Eve, attended a candlelight vigil this month in downtown Baltimore to mourn last year\u2019s 201 victims. The city\u2019s recent accomplishments brought her little comfort.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m lost for words,\u201d she said.",
      "Morrison said her son had recently been talking about enrolling in a job training program. It made her hopeful he would find a bright future despite recent challenges. If only he\u2019d had more time."

      "The booming solar industry has found an unlikely mascot in sheep as large-scale solar farms crop up across the U.S. and in the fields of Texas",
      "BUCKHOLTS, Texas -- On rural Texas farmland, beneath hundreds of rows of solar panels, a troop of stocky sheep rummage through pasture, casually bumping into one another as they remain committed to a single task: chewing grass.",
      "The booming solar industry has found an unlikely mascot in sheep as large-scale solar farms crop up across the U.S. and in the plain fields of Texas. In Milam County, outside Austin, SB Energy operates the fifth-largest solar project in the country, capable of generating 900 megawatts of power across 4,000 acres (1,618 hectares).",
      "How do they manage all that grass? With the help of about 3,000 sheep, which are better suited than lawnmowers to fit between small crevices and chew away rain or shine.",
      "The proliferation of sheep on solar farms is part of a broader trend \u2014 solar grazing \u2014 that has exploded alongside the solar industry.",
      "Agrivoltaics, a method using land for both solar energy production and agriculture, is on the rise with more than 60 solar grazing projects in the U.S., according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The American Solar Grazing Association says 27 states engage in the practice.",
      "\u201cThe industry tends to rely on gas-powered mowers, which kind of contradicts the purpose of renewables,\u201d SB Energy asset manager James Hawkins said.",
      "Putting the animals to work on solar fields also provides some help to the sheep and wool market, which has struggled in recent years. The inventory of sheep and lamb in Texas fell to 655,000 in January 2024, a 4% drop from the previous year, according to the most recent figures from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Because solar fields use sunny, flat land that is often ideal for livestock grazing, the power plants have been used in coordination with farmers rather than against them.",
      "Sheepherder JR Howard accidentally found himself in the middle of Texas\u2019 burgeoning clean energy transition. In 2021, he and his family began contracting with solar farms \u2014 sites with hundreds of thousands of solar modules \u2014 to use his sheep to eat the grass.",
      "What was once a small business has turned into a full-scale operation with more than 8,000 sheep and 26 employees.",
      "\u201cJust the growth has been kind of crazy for us,\u201d said Howard, who named his company Texas Solar Sheep. \u201cIt\u2019s been great for me and my family.\u201d",
      "Some agriculture experts say Howard's success reflects how solar farms have become a boon for some ranchers.",
      "Reid Redden, a sheep farmer and solar vegetation manager in San Angelo, Texas, said a successful sheep business requires agricultural land that has become increasingly scarce.",
      "\u201cSolar grazing is probably the biggest opportunity that the sheep industry had in the United States in several generations,\u201d Redden said.",
      "The response to solar grazing has been overwhelmingly positive in rural communities near South Texas solar farms where Redden raises sheep for sites to use, he said.",
      "\u201cI think it softens the blow of the big shock and awe of a big solar farm coming in,\u201d Redden said.",
      "Agrivoltaics itself isn't new. Solar farms are land-intensive and require a lot of space that could be used for food production. Agrivoltaics compensates by allowing the two to coexist, whether growing food or caring for livestock.",
      "There is a lot still unknown about the full effects of solar grazing, said Nuria Gomez-Casanovas, an assistant professor in regenerative system ecology at Texas A&M University.",
      "Not enough studies have been done to know the long-term environmental impacts, such as how viable the soil will be for future agriculture, although Gomez-Casanovas suspects solar grazing may improve sheep productivity because the panels provide shade and can be more cost-efficient than mowing.",
      "\u201cWe really have more questions than answers,\u201d Gomez-Casanovas said. \u201cThere are studies that show that the land productivity is not higher versus solar alone or agriculture alone, so it's context-dependent.\u201d",
      "As one of Texas' largest solar sheep operators, Howard has more clients than he can handle. He expects to add about 20 more employees by the end of this year, which would nearly double his current workforce. As for the sheep, he has enough already.",

      "Now McDaniels, like so many, is facing the gripping realities of grief and questions about what more could have been done. Experts say these survivors are victims themselves; the fires that swept through the Los Angeles area this month were fast-moving and fierce.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really just a different beast of a fire when it\u2019s this propagating entity of just total mayhem,\u201d said Benjamin Hatchett, a fire meteorologist with the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere at Colorado State University.",
      "But that doesn\u2019t ease the pain or the questions for the families of the more than two dozen killed, some unable to escape, others unaware of what was coming, having survived other blazes unscathed.",

      "\u201cMomma Dee, that\u2019s the fire,\" her granddaughter and namesake, Dalyce Kelley, recalls saying as she drove the 95-year-old to her Altadena home on Jan. 7 after a day of medical tests.",

      "Events honoring Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s legacy and advocating for his vision of a just, nonviolent society will occur the same day as Donald Trump's second presidential inauguration",
      "WASHINGTON -- When President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in as president of the United States inside the Capitol\u2019s rotunda, he will do so facing a bust of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. on the federal holiday commemorating King\u2019s legacy.",
      "It's a disquieting contrast for some civil rights advocates who wish to fulfill the late reverend's dream of non-violent social revolution.",
      "Events honoring King and advocating for his vision of a just society will occur across the nation as many in the U.S. observe the peaceful transfer of power in the capital. The concurrent events have been met with mixed feelings by civil rights leaders, who broadly reviled Trump\u2019s rhetoric and stances on race and civil rights during his third presidential campaign.",
      "But many leaders, including King's own family, see the juxtaposition as a poignant contrast and a chance to refocus the work of advancing civil rights in a new political era.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m glad it occurred on that day because it gives the United States of America and the world the contrast in pictures. Is this the way you want to go \u2014 or is this the way you want to go?\u201d said the Rev. Bernice King, the late King\u2019s youngest daughter and CEO of the King Center.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a day that he can be the star, which he loves to be,\u201d King\u2019s daughter said of Trump. \u201cHe has to contend with that legacy on that day, regardless of how he manages it and handles it in his presentation. I hope those around him are advising him well to honor the day appropriately in his speech.\u201d",
      "This is the third time in the nearly 40 years since the federal King holiday became law that it coincides with a presidential inauguration. Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama also were sworn in for their second terms on the holiday. Both praised King in their remarks; it is yet to be seen if and how Trump \u2014 who falsely claimed his first inauguration had larger crowds than King's March on Washington \u2014 will acknowledge the day.",
      "\u201cWill he sound a message of unity and a presidency for all, or will he continue to focus on his base and some of the divisive policies he's championed, like an anti-DEI stance, rounding up immigrants and cutting important parts of the social safety net through this DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) process?\u201d asked Marc Morial, president of the National Urban League civil rights group.",
      "Morial added that Trump's inauguration landing on MLK Day represented \u201ca contradiction of values.\u201d",
      "Many civil rights leaders will spend the day commemorating King\u2019s legacy after a week of public and private organizing, giving speeches and strategizing how to respond to the incoming administration\u2019s agenda.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the best of times and the worst of times,\u201d said Derrick Johnson, president of the NAACP, an organization whose members mentored, collaborated and clashed with King throughout the Civil Rights Movement.",
      "\u201cOur mission doesn\u2019t change. Our job is to make democracy work for all, to make sure that equal protection is ensured under the law,\u201d Johnson said. He added that the group \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to assume\u201d the Trump administration can\u2019t be a partner on advancing civil rights or racial justice.",
      "On Wednesday, Johnson and other civil rights leaders met with Congressional Black Caucus members on Capitol Hill to discuss how to work with and to oppose the Trump administration. That same day, the National Action Network, a civil rights group founded by the Rev. Al Sharpton, hosted a breakfast at which Vice President Kamala Harris urged attendees to stay motivated.",
      "\u201cOurs is a journey,\" she said. \u201cWhatever the outcome of any particular moment, we can never be defeated. Our spirit can never be defeated, because when that happens, we won't win.\u201d",
      "Martin Luther King III, the late King's eldest son, prayed with Harris on stage. King had campaigned for Harris in the fall and called her an advocate who \u201cspeaks to our better angels\u201d and \u201cembodies Dr. King's legacy.\u201d",
      "Many racial justice advocates are set to organize demonstrations, vigils and community service events to mark the holiday and prepare for what they consider an adversarial administration.",
      "Some groups are reflecting on parallels and differences with how King organized in the face of explicitly white supremacist state and local governments and geopolitical tumult.",
      "\u201cThe hostility is similar, particularly in that there is a mobilized, active and aggressive extremist-right hell bent on unraveling rights and any sense of shared purpose, shared problems or shared solutions,\u201d said Maya Wiley, CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. What differs, Wiley said, is the understanding \"there has to be opportunity for everyone.\u201d",
      "King himself worried the legal protections he dedicated his life to realizing would not be followed by greater anti-discrimination efforts or social programs. He proposed it would take white Americans embracing a deeper kinship with Black Americans and engaging in economic and social solidarity to see change.",
      "A year before his 1968 assassination, King wrote in his final book that giving a Black person their \"due\u201d often required \u201cspecial treatment.\u201d",
      "\u201cI am aware of the fact that this has been a troublesome concept for many liberals, since it conflicts with their traditional ideal of equal opportunity and equal treatment of people according to their individual merits,\u201d King wrote in the 1967 book, \u201cWhere Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community.\" \"But this is a day which demands new thinking and the reevaluation of old concepts.\u201d",
      "King's advocacy for \u201cnew concepts\u201d found an heir in the enactment of affirmative action policies in workplaces and schools. Many advocates of diversity, equity and inclusion policies see such programs as realizing his vision, though that argument has come under withering scrutiny from conservative activists.",
      "Trump's views on race have been criticized for decades. He was found liable for discriminating against Black tenants as a New York realtor in the 1980s. He was instrumental in promoting the \u201cbirther\u201d conspiracy theory that Obama was not born in the U.S. And his campaign rhetoric about immigrants and urban communities since 2015 up to November's election has been derided as prejudiced.",
      "As president, Trump enacted some criminal justice reform laws that civil rights advocates praised but then proposed harsh crackdowns on 2020 racial reckoning protests.",
      "In April, Trump did not dispute the notion that \u201canti-white racism\u201d now represents a greater problem in the U.S. than systemic racism against Black Americans.",
      "\u201cI think there is a definite anti-white feeling in this country and that can\u2019t be allowed either,\u201d Trump said during an interview with Time magazine.",
      "At the end of his life, King reflected on the early backlash to civil rights, especially with integrated housing developments, interracial marriage and necessary economic and social programs. He expressed frustration with then-President Lyndon B. Johnson for prolonging the Vietnam War rather than making a greater investment in anti-poverty efforts.",
      "\u201cThis is where the civil rights movement stands today. We will err and falter as we climb the unfamiliar slopes of steep mountains, but there is no alternative, well-trod, level path,\u201d King wrote. \u201cThere will be agonizing setbacks along with creative advances. Our consolation is that no one can know the true taste of victory if he has never swallowed defeat.\u201d",

      "Two days before Christmas, a group led by President-elect Donald Trump's chief architect of immigration policy wrote to state, county and city officials in so-called \u201csanctuary\u201d jurisdictions to threaten criminal prosecution, jail time and their person...",
      "The ominous letters went to hundreds of state and local officials across the U.S. two days before Christmas. It was a potential blueprint for how the Trump administration may attack \u201csanctuary\u201d jurisdictions that resist mass deportations.",
      "They threatened criminal prosecutions and lawsuits going after officials\u2019 personal finances. They invoked RICO, the federal statute often used to fight organized crime.",
      "\u201cYou and your subordinates could potentially face up to 20 years in prison,\u201d America First Legal, a group led by current and former advisors to President-elect Donald Trump, said in the letter. Its president, Stephen Miller, will be deputy chief of policy in the new administration and is a longtime architect of Trump's immigration policies.",
      "The letters\u2019 targets: city, county and state officials in America\u2019s sanctuary jurisdictions, a term rooted in medieval laws that today encompasses a range of protection for immigrants, particularly those living in the U.S. illegally. Sanctuary jurisdictions limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities.",
      "Some targets were chosen for statements they made after Trump\u2019s election. Maura Healey, the Democratic governor of Massachusetts, is taken to task for vowing to use \u201cevery tool in the toolbox\u201d to resist mass deportations in her state. But most made the list for refusing to assist U.S. Immigration and Customs and Enforcement by holding people who are wanted for being in the country illegally.",
      "The warnings may signal part of a legal a roadmap for Trump's crackdown on immigration and pledge of mass deportations. It accuses officials of violating several federal statutes, including one against immigrant smuggling and another against interfering with the work of federal officers.",
      "On Saturday, an official said a federal immigration operation concentrated in Chicago will begin after Trump takes office Monday, targeting more than 300 people with histories of violent crimes. Chicago has been a sanctuary city for decades, and officials there have said they retreat on those commitments.",
      "Courts have repeatedly upheld the legality of most sanctuary laws.",
      "\u201cSanctuary laws don\u2019t shield or harbor or conceal quote-unquote \u2018illegal aliens,\u2019\u201d said Mark Fleming, a lawyer with the Chicago-based National Immigration Justice Center, a pro-immigration group. \"What the laws do is they say \u2019Your role (as federal officials) is to do immigration enforcement. Our role is not, and we\u2019re not going to participate.'\u201d",
      "Immigration lawyers scoffed at the letters\u2019 legal arguments. Police and officials in sanctuary jurisdictions are, they note, enforcing legally enacted laws.",
      "But officials, lawyers and immigration advocates are taking the letters seriously. The involvement of Miller, a senior advisor in Trump\u2019s first term and a major figure in many policy decisions, particularly on immigration, means they have no choice.",
      "Plus, many say, the legal arguments may not even be relevant.",
      "\u201cLetters like these are really more about sowing fear than they are about articulating anything that would hold up from a legal standpoint,\u201d said Sirine Shebaya, an attorney and executive director of the National Immigration Project.",
      "It's a fear that can be used against officials and against immigrants themselves.",
      "\u201cWe are hearing a lot of concern from our immigrant community members about whether the city will continue (as a sanctuary) or will they end it,\u201d said Peter Pedemonti, co-director of the New Sanctuary Movement of Philadelphia.",
      "During the first Trump administration, the White House tried to use financial cudgels against sanctuary jurisdictions by denying them public safety grants that can be key for law enforcement budgets. Courts largely rejected those attempts, though some Trump loyalists say that could happen again in the incoming administration.",
      "The letters may signal that the cudgels will be legal. They went to well over 200 officials, including Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and county officials from Maine, Nebraska and California.",
      "They are largely identical, though occasionally personalized with details of crimes allegedly committed by immigrants in a particular official's jurisdiction.",
      "All are full of dire warnings.",
      "\u201cYou each could face criminal prosecution and civil liability for your illegal acts,\u201d wrote James Rogers, senior counsel for America First Legal Foundation.",
      "\u201cEmployees in your jurisdiction involved in implementing sanctuary policies that prevent federal immigration officers from carrying out their duties would potentially face six years in prison,\" he wrote.",
      "If most lawyers roll their eyes at such threats, they also know that weak legal arguments don\u2019t necessarily stop prosecutions.",
      "\u201cI think these threats are actually a critical cog in the strategy,\u201d said Fleming. \u201cBecause the reality is that even if they lose, they can win by putting someone through this.\u201d",
      "Fear of relentless court cases, particularly in smaller jurisdictions without teams of lawyers, could push officials to ease back on sanctuary laws, or even allow local law enforcement to work with federal immigration officers.",
      "ICE, which has just 21,000 employees, many of them administrators or support personnel, would need immense local law enforcement help to follow through on Trump\u2019s promises of mass deportations",
      "The sanctuary designations have already caused deep divisions in some jurisdictions, with sheriffs in California, Washington and elsewhere vowing to ignore sanctuary policies. In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis has said he\u2019s prepared to suspend elected officials if they are \u201cneglecting their duties\u201d under Trump\u2019s promised immigration mandates.",
      "But Democratic leaders including Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and New York's Hochul vowed after Trump's election that they would stand firm on their sanctuary policies.",
      "A few days after the election, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson insisted that the city's police force would not help ICE agents with deportations.",
      "\u201cWe will not bend or break,\u201d Johnson told reporters.",
      "The question is whether sanctuary officials will continue to stand firm in the face of personal legal threats and an incoming White House that has made clear immigration is a top focus.",
      "\u201cStephen Miller is going to be the deputy chief adviser to the president,\" said R. Linus Chan, an attorney who works with immigrants detained by ICE, and a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School. \u201cSo you can\u2019t really just ignore him.\u201d"

      "Flooded cornfields near the Tennessee River in northern Alabama are a paradise for birders who flock to see tens of thousands of migrating sandhill cranes every winter",
      "DECATUR, Ala. -- In flooded agricultural fields near the Tennessee River, tens of thousands of sandhill cranes stand tall among broken corn stalks and shallow water searching for corn, berries, seeds and insects.",
      "The sound and sight of so many cranes clustered together creates a chorus of trills, trumpets and honks throughout the Wheeler National Wildlife Refuge Center in northern Alabama during the winter.",
      "The annual migration of sandhill cranes brings bird-watchers in droves to see the tall birds up close, but also the chance to catch a glimpse of the rare and endangered whooping cranes that migrate in much smaller numbers to Wheeler. Alongside the cranes, plenty of other birds can be spotted at Wheeler, including geese, ducks, bald eagles, kestrels and hawks.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a birder\u2019s paradise,\u201d park ranger David Young noted.",
      "The cranes, with their distinctive red foreheads and gray feathers, fly to Alabama from the Great Lakes annually. The sandhill cranes started staying overwinter at Wheeler starting in the mid-1990s and the numbers increased dramatically in the mid-2000s, Young said. Last year, the sandhill population that wintered at Wheeler reached a new record of 30,000 cranes.",
      "\u201cHere in the Tennessee Valley, we have three things that these cranes need,\u201d Young said. \"The wide open fields here around our visitor center. The leftover crop and the natural foods that they like to forage on in those fields. And then open mudflats and shallow water on the Tennessee River and its tributaries.\u201d",
      "The refuge has become a hotspot for birders to break out the binoculars and even get closer to the 4-foot (1.2-meter) tall cranes as visitors stay hidden behind photography blinds and a two-level observation center. An annual Festival of the Cranes in January brings more attention and visitors.",
      "The cranes put on an impressive show, dancing on their slender legs, flapping their wings and sticking their long beaks in the air to vocalize with purring and squawks as they socialize.",
      "Diana Maybury-Sharp, from Birmingham, regularly comes to Wheeler with friends to hike and look at birds.",
      "\u201cIt's pretty extraordinary. I've seen them in other parts of the country where there were just a few,\u201d Maybury-Sharp said. \u201cThey're not vocal like they are here. There's so many here that it's an unusual experience.\u201d",
      "The whooping cranes, part of the eastern migratory population that comes from Wisconsin, started migrating to Alabama in 2004 and their population is about between 12 and 20 each winter, said Young.",
      "Whooping cranes were nearly wiped out in the early 1900s by hunters and loss of habitat from farming. Recovery and reintroduction efforts have slowly increased their wild and captive populations to more than 800, according to the International Crane Foundation.",
      "Migratory whooping cranes depend on freshwater wetland habitats in Texas and the southeast, which could be affected by rising sea levels and droughts, according to the foundation.",
      "They are sometimes hard to spot amongst the shorter crowd of sandhills, but their height and white feathers help them stand out. Young said the migration patterns of the cranes may change depending on the climate trends of both their nesting locations and their winter homes.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say how long they will continue to winter here in north Alabama,\" Young said. \"And maybe they may not need to come this far south in the future. But for now, we\u2019re really enjoying their presence and making sure to provide that habitat for them and the opportunity for people to view them here too.\u201d",
      "Rob Broeren, of Huntsville, brought along his telephoto lens and camera and found a good spot to practice his wildlife photography hobby. He comes to the refuge about a dozen times each year to photograph the birds and ducks.",
      "\u201cYou just need to be patient and wait for them to do something interesting and make their calls,\u201d Broeren said. \u201cYou get that cool shot and that's a good day.\u201d",
      "Broeren was scouting locations for friends coming in from out of town who wanted a chance to see the rarest of cranes.",
      "\u201cBirders are big on a checklist of seeing lots of different birds,\" Broeren said. \u201cAnd so people that haven\u2019t seen that species because it is quite rare are willing to drive kind of a long way if they think they have a good shot of seeing it.\u201d",
      "The sandhill cranes will start leaving the refuge in mid-February. Young said he notices a lot more agitation and activity when the birds are signaling they are ready to make the journey back to their nesting grounds.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s usually on a day when we have some sort of a south wind,\" Young said. \"They\u2019re smart and they will ride the wind back to their breeding grounds whenever it\u2019s most convenient for them.\u201d"

      "\u201cThat is the gift that we hand over to the next administration,\u201d she said, \u201cand I hope that they will accept that gift in the spirit in which it is being given to them.\u201d",

      "\u201cShe\u2019s going to be sitting around the table with them on almost a daily basis,\u201d Thomas-Greenfield said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s important to know the individuals you are going to have to engage with, whether they are friends or foes.\u201d",
      "In her final emotional speech to the Security Council, Thomas-Greenfield focused on Sudan, saying she wished there was closure on one crisis the world faces \u2014 ticking off Gaza, Ukraine, Congo and other hotspots.",
      "She told AP the U.N. and the world \u201chave to be more proactive in our engagement\u201d to try to end these conflicts.",

      "Both men have January birthdays. Lee was born Jan. 19, 1807. King was born Jan. 15, 1929.",

      "President Ronald Reagan in 1983 signed legislation naming the third Monday of January as Martin Luther King Jr. Day to honor the slain civil rights leader. States slowly added the day to their roster of state holidays. Alabama and Mississippi in the 1980s adopted Martin Luther King Day as a state holiday, adding it to their existing day honoring Lee.",

      "In many parts of the country, though, those decreases don't match the public perception.",
      "Experts say most cities are seeing a drop in crime levels that spiked during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. But they say misleading campaign rhetoric in the runup to the November elections and changes in how people interpret news about crime have led to a perception gap.",
      "\u201cThe presence of even one murder has a great cost,\u201d said Kim Smith, the director of national programs at the University of Chicago's Crime Lab.",
      "Violence interruption and intervention programs have helped decrease gun violence and homicide numbers in Chicago and elsewhere, Smith said. But even with fewer crimes, people experiencing it in their neighborhood lowers their perception of being safe.",
      "\"The presence of those crimes is the thing that people get the most distress from, and that has the biggest impact on people being able to enjoy their neighborhood and on quality of life,\u201d she said.",
      "Jeff Asher, cofounder of AH Datalytics, tracks crimes across the country using law enforcement data for the group's Real-Time Crime Index. He said the data, which lags by about 45 days rather than being reported quarterly or annually like a lot of crime statistics, allows communities and experts to evaluate and respond to trends as they are happening.",
      "Early in 2024, Asher noticed cities were largely seeing historic declines in homicide numbers, but much more muted declines in other violent crimes.",
      "New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Houston, Detroit, Baltimore and dozens of other cities have reported drops in homicides last year compared to 2023. Some saw small decreases, including New York, which had 14 fewer homicides than the 391 reported in 2023. But others had large decreases, including Philadelphia, which had 255 in 2024 compared to 398 in 2023.",
      "Homicides did increase in a few cities, including Charlotte, North Carolina, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Asher said.",
      "Other crimes were a little more unpredictable. Robberies were down in all of the 10 largest U.S. cities that have released final or preliminary end-of-year figures for 2024. And across the board, car thefts were down by double-digit percentages. But sexual assaults and aggravated or felony physical assaults were up in several of those cities.",
      "\u201cIn some ways, \u2018Is crime up?\u2019 is a poorly defined question. Do you mean murder, do you mean the FBI definitions, are you talking about car theft, or are you talking about shoplifting or things that are difficult to measure?\u201d Asher said. \u201cOr maybe you\u2019re thinking of things that aren\u2019t criminal at all. Maybe you see something happen downtown that makes you feel unsafe and gives you that perception.\u201d",
      "Mike Lawlor, an associate professor of criminology at the University of New Haven and a former legislator, said experience of crime can be skewed by neighborhood apps where anyone who has a package stolen or sees something that might not be criminal posts it for public consumption. He said it also can be skewed by intense media coverage of isolated incidents.",
      "\u201cYou just become much more likely to hear about these things on local tv news and because of social media or these apps,\u201d Lawlor said. \u201cWhen in reality, but for the pandemic, we would have been at historic lows on crime.\u201d",
      "The pandemic put a hold on a lot of programs that have had success decreasing gun violence because a lot of that work requires face-to-face conversations to identify the most at-risk individuals and provide services or programs to them, he said.",
      "But Lawlor said, politics plays a role in why the public perception hasn\u2019t matched the overall decades-long decreases in crime, or the decreases post pandemic.",
      "An October Gallup poll asking Americans to characterize whether they believe crime is up, and how serious of an issue crime is, saw a drop this year over last year in the percentage of respondents who thought crime was increasing, from 77% to 64%. But the disparity between Republicans and Democrats was still high, with 90% of Republicans compared to 29% of Democrats in the most recent poll believing there is more crime.",
      "\u201cWhy do people think it\u2019s worse now than it\u2019s ever been? The person they just elected tells them it\u2019s the worst ever. Those messages from politicians have an impact,\u201d Lawlor said, adding that politicians from both parties try to avoid being labeled soft on crime.",
      "Experts at the University of Chicago's Crime Lab have been diving deeper into the data to look beyond crime being up or down.",
      "In an analysis released in December, researchers found that the lethality of shootings had increased by almost 45% since 2010, and the number of shell casings recovered per shooting victim has more than doubled in that time, meaning someone who heard a shooting in their neighborhood might hear volleys of gunfire rather than a shot or two, which can affect their perception of safety.",
      "Smith stressed that despite the homicide rate decreasing, Black residents are still much more likely to die of gun violence than their white counterparts, a staggering 22 times more likely in Chicago.",
      "\u201cIt's a question of who is seeing the benefits of that progress because of the way violence is concentrated,\u201d she said. \u201cEven though they are safer, that burden still exists disproportionately in communities of color. That to me seems to be the perception difference.\u201d"

      "NEW YORK -- TikTok\u2019s app was removed from prominent app stores on Saturday just before a federal law that would have banned the popular social media platform was scheduled to go into effect.",
      "By 10:50pm Eastern Standard Time, the app was not found on Apple and Google\u2019s app stores, which are prohibited from offering the platform under a law that required TikTok\u2019s China-based parent company, ByteDance, to sell the platform or face a U.S. ban.",
      "When users opened the TikTok app on Saturday evening, they encountered a pop-up message from the company that prevented them from scrolling on videos.",
      "\u201cA law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S.,\u201d the message said. \u201cUnfortunately that means you can\u2019t use TikTok for now.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office,\u201d the message said. \u201cPlease stay tuned!\u201d",
      "Before that announcement went out, the company had said in another message to users that its service would be \u201ctemporarily unavailable\u201d and told them its working to restore its U.S. service \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d",
      "The federal law, that was signed by President Joe Biden last year, required ByteDance to divest its stake in the TikTok's U.S. platform or face a ban. ByteDance had nine months to sell the U.S. operation to an approved buyer. The company, and TikTok, chose to take legal action against the law and ultimately lost their fight at the Supreme Court on Friday.",
      "Under the statute, mobile app stores are barred from offering TikTok and internet hosting services are prohibited from delivering the service to American users.",
      "Both White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre and Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco had said that the Biden administration would leave the law\u2019s implementation to President-elect Donald Trump given that his inauguration falls the day after the ban takes effect.",
      "But TikTok said after the court ruling on Friday that it \u201cwill be forced to go dark\u201d if the administration didn\u2019t provide a \u201cdefinitive statement\u201d to the companies that deliver its service in the U.S.",
      "However, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre called TikTok\u2019s demand a \u201cstunt\u201d and said there was no reason for TikTok or other companies \u201cto take actions in the next few days before the Trump administration takes office.\u201d",
      "In an interview with NBC News on Saturday, President-elect Donald Trump said he was thinking about giving TikTok a 90-day extension that would allow them to continue operating.",
      "The federal law allows the sitting president to extend the deadline by 90 days if a sale is in progress. But no clear buyers have emerged, and ByteDance has previously said it won\u2019t sell TikTok.",
      "If such an extension happens, Trump said it would \u201cprobably\u201d be announced on Monday.",
      "On Saturday, artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI submitted a proposal to ByteDance to create a new entity that merges Perplexity with TikTok U.S. business, according to a person familiar with the matter. If successful, the new structure would also include other investors and allow ByteDance\u2019s existing shareholders to retain their stake in the company, the person said.",
      "Perplexity is not asking to purchase the ByteDance algorithm that feeds TikTok user\u2019s videos based on their interests and has made the platform such a phenomenon.",
      "Other investors have also been eyeing TikTok. \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary recently said a consortium of investors that he and billionaire Frank McCourt put together offered ByteDance $20 billion in cash. Trump\u2019s Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also said last year that he was putting together an investor group to buy TikTok."

      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- An Oregon man has been sentenced to life in federal prison after being convicted of kidnapping and sexually assaulting two women in separate instances, including locking one in a cinder block cell.",
      "Negasi Zuberi, 31, was sentenced Friday in federal court in Medford, Portland television station KGW reported. A federal jury convicted him in October on charges of kidnapping, transportation for criminal sexual activity, being a felon in possession of a weapon and attempting to break out of jail when he tried to smash through his cell window in August 2023.",
      "\u201cThis is not a man who deserves to be around others,\" a victim said at the hearing. \u201cHe shows blatant disregard and lack of care for human life.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press does not usually name people who have been sexually assaulted.",
      "\u201cNegasi Zuberi is a serial predator who committed acts of evil. He hunted women,\u201d assistant United States Attorney Jeffrey Sweet said before Zuberi was sentenced.",
      "In July 2023, Zuberi solicited a woman to engage in prostitution along Aurora Avenue in Seattle, authorities said. He told the woman he was an undercover officer, showed her a badge, pointed a Taser at her and placed her in handcuffs and leg irons before putting her in the back of his vehicle.",
      "He then drove hundreds of miles to his home in Klamath Falls, Oregon, and locked the woman in a cinder block cell in his garage, according to the FBI. After the woman escaped after repeatedly banging on the cell door until it broke open, Zuberi fled and was arrested in Reno, Nevada.",
      "Federal authorities later linked him to a second kidnapping in May 2023, in which he was convicted of abducting a woman outside a Klamath Falls bar. Prosecutors said he threatened her with a Taser, handcuffed her in the back of his vehicle and sexually assaulted her.",
      "Zuberi had pleaded not guilty and continued to claim he was innocent during the sentencing hearing.",
      "He waived his right to testify during the 11-day trial. He attempted to testify on the trial's last day but was denied because he earlier waived that right."

      "Spotting a dog struggling to stay afloat in a icy Vermont River, Chris MacRitchie never hesitated.",
      "He jumped into the frigid waters and waded over to the dog, gently pulling it ashore where his wife, Erica, draped it with a sweatshirt. The dramatic rescue of the dog Friday afternoon in Berlin, Vermont, was caught on video by his son and has been shared widely on social media.",
      "MacRitchie's son, Ace, first spotted the dog as they were going through the drive-thru of a nearby Dunkin\u2019 Donuts. When they reached the river embankment, the father of two felt he had no choice but to save the pooch.",
      "\u201cIt was like one of those moments everyone probably has in their life like you\u2019re going to make a decision ... either trying to get in the water and help her or the alternative,\u201d MacRitchie said. \u201cSo, I felt I was obligated to at least try to fetch this dog out of the river, as I have two dogs myself, and I would hope someone would do that for them if they were in that spot.\u201d",
      "The video shows MacRitchie \u2014 dressed in a T-shirt, sweats and boots \u2014 approaching the river embankment as the dog struggles to get out. He calls out to the dog at first and his wife, Erica, can be heard encouraging him to rescue it.",
      "MacRitchie gingerly steps through the ice and into the river, audibly gasping as he wades about 20-feet toward the dog, which was on the other side of the frozen tributary of the Winooski River. His wife repeatedly shouts \u201cc'mon\u201d to the dog and exclaims \u201cOh, my God\u201d as MacRitchie lifts the dog, later identified as Arizona, out of the water and onto the icy embankment. He carries it over to his wife.",
      "\u201cThe only real stress I had about it wasn\u2019t getting in the cold water. It was the depth. I did not know if it was 20 feet deep or it was 2 feet deep,\u201d MacRitchie said. \u201cWhen I broke through and I got on my feet and it was like waist high, I was actually relieved by that. In my mind, during the moment, I thought, OK this isn\u2019t that bad. Yeah, it's cold, but I feel this is a very doable situation.\u201d",
      "After retrieving the dog, MacRitchie called the dog's owner, Morgan Cerasoli, whose number was listed on the dog tag.",
      "Cerasoli said she had been looking for her dog, a seven-year-old mutt who had originally been rescued from the side of the road in South Carolina, since Thursday. She was heading to pick up her daughter from school, when she got the call from MacRitchie who said he had \u201cpulled a drowning dog\u201d out of the river.\" He wanted to confirm it was her dog.",
      "\u201cI started crying, and I told him, oh, my God, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you. Let me pull a U-turn and I\u2019m coming right back,\u201d she said, as she sat besides Arizona during an interview. She said the dog has mostly recovered, though a checkup did find it was suffering from Lyme disease.",
      "After reuniting with her dog, Cerasoli said she saw the video and was brought to tears again -- over MacRitchie's exploits as well as the poor condition of Arizona in that moment.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s brave, it\u2019s selfless, it\u2019s commendable. It\u2019s everything that I think that we were on this Earth to be,\u201d she said of the rescue. \u201cSometimes it feels like that\u2019s very rare these days.\u201d"

      "Emily, 21, spends around \u00a320 a month at Chinese fast-fashion giant Shein, turning to it whenever she needs a new party or holiday outfit.",
      "\"You can almost always find what you're looking for, even if the quality is bad\", she says.",
      "Like millions in the UK and the US, she buys from the online shop mostly because of how affordable it is.",
      "The firm has faced scrutiny over how it treats workers, with a BBC investigation highlighting 75-hour weeks for workers  in contravention of Chinese labour laws, but it is unlikely shoppers will be put off buying their clothes there.",
      "'Affordable'",
      "Emily has considered stopping buying from Shein due to its labour practices, but says everywhere else \"is way too expensive\".",
      "\"I'm happy to talk about the fact I shop at Shein because I know I'm not the only one,\" she adds.",
      "The numbers show she's right, with Shein transforming from a little-known company just a few years ago into one of the world's biggest clothing firms.",
      "Global sales are estimated to have reached $36.9bn (\u00a330.2bn) last year, according to GlobalData.",
      "Shein is a private company and does not report its global results.",
      "But profits in the UK doubled in 2023 to more than \u00a324m, according to a Companies House filing.",
      "Shein stocks thousands of different clothing lines, dwarfing rival fast fashion brands such as H&M and Zara.",
      "It sells many clothes for below \u00a310, and turns around new designs quickly.",
      "The firm has been gearing up for for a stock market flotation in the UK, putting it under scrutiny over both its working practices and its environmental impact.",
      "Last year, Shein itself found child labour in its supply chain after tightening scrutiny of suppliers.",
      "It has also faced allegations that it uses cotton produced using forced labour, and last week declined to tell MPs whether it used such cotton.",
      "Shein was contacted for comment.",
      "In response to the BBC investigation into worker conditions it said it is \"committed to ensuring the fair and dignified treatment of all workers within our supply chain\" and is investing tens of millions of dollars in strengthening governance and compliance.",
      "\"We strive to set the highest standards for pay and we require that all supply chain partners adhere to our code of conduct,\" it said.",
      "Workers get paid about one to two yuan for making a tee-shirt - which is the equivalent of between 11p and 22p.",
      "Sarah Johnson, the founder of consultancy Flourish Retail, a former head of buying and merchandising for Asos China, said the firm could pay suppliers more, which would give them more leeway to pay workers.",
      "The supplier \"doesn't get paid an awful lot of the final price\" of the garment.",
      "When it comes to workers, \"you could raise their pay and it would make a minimal amount of difference to the garment price,\" she said.",
      "An alternative would be for the firm to make less profit, she added.",
      "'I'm going to save up'",
      "Sophie Wills, from Birmingham, said she had previously bought clothes from the retailer due to their affordability.",
      "\"Times are hard,\" Sophie says, adding she probably couldn't afford higher-end clothes at the moment.",
      "However, she says saving up and \"making investments in stuff that is probably higher quality would be a good way to go\".",
      "'My whole outfit is from Shein'",
      "Thando Sibenke says she regularly shops at Shein.",
      "\"My whole outfit's from Shein right now,\" she says, adding she likes the price, convenience, and variety.",
      "However, Thando says she plans to do more research in the future on how the clothes she buys are made.",
      "'I'm embarrassed'",
      "Georgina, 24, from London, says she is \"embarrassed\" that she has shopped at Shein - and has now stopped.",
      "\"Since reading up on it, the negatives massively outweigh the positives and even when seeing Shein clothing in charity shops, I don't feel comfortable buying it.\"",
      "Fashion designer and academic Shazia Saleem said that people in Generation Z  - those born between about 1995 to 2010 \u2013 often say in surveys that sustainability and ethics are important to them, but that doesn't necessarily come through in their buying choices.",
      "Young people can feel pressure to buy new outfits to keep up appearances on social media, and they don't have much disposable cash, so will probably continue to buy fast fashion, she said.",
      "She added that although people should make informed buying decisions, it should be down to the government to strengthen existing UK trading standards rules to make sure companies are selling sustainable and ethically sound products.",
      "The truth behind your $12 dress: Inside the Chinese factories fuelling Shein's success",

      "Younger customers tend to not have much disposable income due to being in school or low paying jobs, she said.",
      "Shein releases thousands of new products daily, which can encourage shoppers to buy too much - but it's also a response to \"the desire from consumers to constantly update their wardrobes with the latest trends\", she adds."

      "President-elect Donald Trump will want to do a good deal with the UK, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones has insisted.",
      "Jones, the chancellor's second-in-command, said he was confident UK-US trading relationships could be deepened and that Peter Mandelson will be \"brilliant\" as the new UK ambassador to the US.",
      "However, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has claimed Prime Minster Sir Keir Starmer is in a \"weak\" negotiating position due to his wish to strengthen ties with the EU at the same time as with the US.",
      "The PM has insisted he can walk a tightrope and balance strong trading and security relationships on both sides, despite Trump's dislike of the EU.",
      "But some nervousness seems apparent, with Lord Mandelson, launching a charm offensive ahead of Trump's inauguration on Monday, lauding his \"straight talking and deal-making instincts\" and talking up a new \"Atlantic alliance\".",
      "Mandelson praises Trump ahead of inauguration",
      "Peter Mandelson: How the Prince of Darkness became his excellency",

      "\"Donald Trump is well-known for wanting to do a good deal - I think there are plenty of good deals for us to do together,\" he said.",
      "\"There are definitely opportunities to deepen our trading relationships, not least in technology, science and research... and I think that's something that could be a positive outcome.\"",
      "Speaking to the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, the Treasury minister suggested the UK could dodge Trump's pledge for a 20% tax on all imports into the US due to not being in a \"trade deficit\", adding ministers have \"prepared for all scenarios\".",
      "Jones also expressed confidence Lord Mandelson will \"form a very strong partnership with the new administration\", despite some reports that the incoming president may reject him - and a top Trump adviser dismissing him as an \"absolute moron\".",
      "The appointment of Lord Mandelson, who is best-known as a New Labour spin doctor and minister under Tony Blair, is the first time in 50 years that a PM has selected a politician rather than a diplomat for the role, which Jones said was \"because we want to do things differently\".",
      "Asked about the Labour Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, warning of \"resurgent fascism\" ahead of Trump's inauguration, Jones strongly disagreed, insisting the UK government respected Trump's democratic mandate, adding: \"I speak on behalf of the government and we don't agree with it\".",
      "A much less rosy view of the \"special relationship\" was painted by Farage, a long-time supporter of Trump, whose offer of acting as a go-between in negotiations with the president-elect has so far been rejected by the government.",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio 4's The Westminster Hour, the Reform UK leader said the government needs to \"think outside the box\" when dealing with the Trump administration, and that all evidence - including Lord Mandelson's appointment - suggests they are not doing that.",
      "\"I think what this government does, is what all governments do - they stick with the established, status quo methods of appointing people,\" he said.",
      "Farage said he feared the UK would squander \"an amazing opportunity\" to get away from tariffs and negotiate free trade deals due to the prime minister's refusal to choose the US over the EU.",
      "\"This guy [Trump] does business differently to anybody else we've seen in global politics before,\" he said. \"They don't think they need me - but they might find in short order that maybe they do.",
      "\"If we have a deteriorating relationship with America that does hurt us financially, it'll be the Labour government's fault,\" adding that Trump is \"probably more Eurosceptic\" than he is.",
      "'Blind faith'",
      "The fact the UK still does not have a free trade deal with the US, despite this being a priority in Boris Johnson's Conservative manifesto in 2019, has been criticised by the party's current leader Kemi Badenoch, who said leaving the EU without a growth plan was  \"a mistake\".",
      "Shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel, a prominent voice in the Vote Leave Brexit campaign, was questioned about Badenoch's comments by Kuenssberg after she urged swift action to agree a UK-US trade deal.",

      "She said: \"In terms of long-term sustainable proposals Kemi's right to recognise that clearly wider plans needed to be put in place.\"",
      "Responding to Patel, the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Calum Miller claimed the Conservatives were now competing with Reform UK to be \"the most submissive with Trump\" - but the UK should not put \"blind faith\" in the new administration.",
      "He said: \"[Priti Patel's] desire to rush into a free trade deal between the UK and US - one that could sell British farmers and food standards down the river - reminds us of where her and her party's true alliances lie: with the Mar-a-Lago clan, not with constituents here in Britain.\""

      "Incoming President Trump has indicated though that he is opposed to the ban and will find a way to reverse it.",
      "If the US ban goes ahead, experts point to the previous ousting of Chinese and Russian tech companies on national security grounds as a potential blueprint for how the TikTok ban might spread around the world.",
      "\"There are big parallels between TikTok and what happened with China's Huawei and Russia's Kaspersky that indicates it's just a matter of time until a creeping ban takes affect,\" says Emily Taylor, Editor of the Cyber Policy Journal.",
      "In both cases these companies were accused by the US of being a threat to national security - but no smoking gun was ever revealed by cyber security authorities.",
      "The same has happened with TikTok.",
      "Under President Trump, Kaspersky's flagship antivirus software product was banned from civil and military computers in the US after accusations arose in 2017 that it was used by the Kremlin in a hacking incident that was never proven.",
      "The UK followed almost immediately and one by one other allies fell into line with restrictions, warnings or bans.",
      "It took years but eventually a countrywide ban took effect last year in the US but it was all but redundant by then. Kaspersky closed its US operations followed by its UK offices saying there is no viable business there.",
      "The company has always argued that the US government based its decision on the \"geopolitical climate and theoretical concerns\" rather than independently verifying risk.",
      "According to research from Bitsight Kaspersky's decline in usage after the ban was pronounced, not just in the US but in at least 25 other countries too, even those with no overt public policy to ban the software.",
      "Almost the exact same thing happened with Chinese telecoms giant Huawei.",
      "The US accused Huawei and other Chinese tech firms of being too close to the Chinese government. It argued that the company's popular 5G kit should not be used to build telecoms in case it could be used to spy on or degrade communications.",
      "A former Huawei UK member of staff said that once the US decided to ban, block or restrict Huawei it became almost inevitable that allies would follow.",

      "However, as with everything else to do with TikTok, he says there is a huge caveat in the form of the incoming Trump administration.",
      "\"What we don't yet know is whether TikTok will be the exception as Trump has said he is opposed to the ban so will he order allies to replicate a ban? We don't yet know.\"",
      "Trump's position on TikTok has changed dramatically since his first presidency when he tried to get it banned. Since then he has become a supporter after his re-election campaign gained support through TikTok videos.",

      "\"It depends on how much pressure the administration is willing to exert\", she told the BBC.",
      "\"If their foreign policy agenda is packed then forcing other allies to follow the ban might fall down the list and allow countries to wait it out\".",
      "At the moment, there are \"no plans\" for a TikTok ban in the UK, a government spokesperson said on Saturday. \"We engage with all major social media companies to understand their plans for ensuring the security of UK data and to ensure they meet the high data protection and cyber security standards we expect.\"",

      "Any app that loses 170m users would suffer but US users in particular are valuable for creators, advertisers and direct spending in TikTok Shop.",
      "If the rest of the West follows it will reduce the money flowing into the company and curtail development of new features, further entrenching the dominance of US platforms like Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts and Snapchat.",
      "TikTok is already banned in Pakistan, Afghanistan and India too - a massive market. It has no presence in China because of its sister app Douyin.",
      "Kaspersky and Huawei both managed to weather their storms by relying on home-grown customer bases and by pivoting to regions like Africa and the Middle East.",
      "So it might be possible for TikTok to build its user bases here. But if the US ban creeps around the world then the app will likely never be as big as it currently is and may well wither and die a slow death."

      "It is considered opportunistic because it takes advantage of imaging that has already been done for another clinical purpose \u2013 be it suspected cancer, chest infection, appendicitis or belly pain.",
      "It has the potential to catch previously undiagnosed diseases in the early stages, before onset of symptoms, when they are easier to treat or prevent from progressing. \"We can avoid a lot of the lack of prevention that we have missed out on previously,\" says Prof Pickhardt.",
      "Regular physicals or blood tests often fail to pick up these diseases, he adds.",
      "There's a lot of data in CT scans related to body tissues and organs that we don't really use, notes Miriam Bredella, a radiologist at NYU Langone who is also developing algorithms in the field.",
      "And while analysis of it could theoretically be done without AI by radiologists making measurements \u2013 it would be time consuming.",
      "There are also benefits of the technology in terms of reducing bias, she notes.",
      "A disease like osteoporosis, for example, is thought of as mostly affecting thin, elderly white women \u2013 so doctors don't always think to look outside of that population.",
      "Opportunistic imaging, on the other hand, doesn't discriminate that way.",
      "Mr Studholme's case is a good example. Being relatively young for osteoporosis, male and with no history of broken bones, it is unlikely he would have been diagnosed without AI.",
      "In addition to osteoporosis, AI is being trained to help opportunistically identify heart disease, fatty liver disease, age-related muscle loss and diabetes.",
      "While the main focus is on CT scans, for example of the abdomen or chest, work is taking place to opportunistically glean information from other types of imaging too, including chest x-rays and mammograms.",
      "The algorithms are trained on many thousands of tagged previous scans, and it is important the training data includes scans from a wide swathe of ethnic groups if the technology is going to be deployed on a diverse range of people, stress the experts.",
      "And there is supposed to be a level of human review \u2013 if the AI finds something suspect it would be sent to radiologists to confirm before it is then reported on to doctors.",
      "How AI uncovers new ways to tackle difficult diseases",
      "AI is trained to spot warning signs in blood tests",
      "Why 'digital twins' could speed up drug discovery",
      "The AI technology used to examine Mr Studholme's scan belongs to Israeli company Nanox.AI, which is one of only a handful of companies working on AI for opportunistic screening - far more are focused on using AI to assist in the accurate and swift diagnoses of the specific conditions the scans are actually conducted for.",
      "Nanox.AI offers three opportunistic screening products aimed at helping identify osteoporosis, heart disease and fatty liver disease respectively from routine CT scans.",
      "Oxford NHS hospitals began trialling Nanox.AI's osteoporosis focused product in 2018 before officially rolling it out in 2020.",
      "Results from Oxford hospitals show an up to six-fold increase above the NHS average in the number of patients being identified with vertebral fractures \u2013 patients that can then be checked for osteoporosis, and start treatment to combat the disease, says Kassim Javaid, a professor of osteoporosis and rare bone diseases at the University of Oxford who has spearheaded the algorithm's introduction.",
      "Further trials of the algorithm are also now underway at hospitals in Cambridge, Cardiff, Nottingham and Southampton. \"We want to build the evidence to use it across the NHS,\" says Prof Javaid.",
      "Yet while the technology can benefit individuals, there are wider ramifications that need to be considered says Sebastien Ourselin, a professor of healthcare engineering at Kings College London, who heads the AI Centre for Value Based Healthcare.",
      "A big problem that needs to be balanced, he notes, is the extra patient numbers that the use of the technology can create. \"This is increasing the demand on the healthcare system not reducing it,\" he says.",
      "First, people who are flagged by the opportunistic screening as potentially having a disease will likely need further confirmatory testing, which takes resources. And, if the AI is inaccurate or too sensitive, that could result in a lot of unnecessary testing.",
      "Then services need to be in place for those extra people that do end up being diagnosed.",
      "The extra load is a challenge that comes with the technology admits Prof Javaid \u2013 but there are solutions.",
      "Patients confirmed to have the fractures in Oxford are routed for follow up to a largely nurse delivered fracture prevention service so as not to overload doctors. \"The AI does force you to change your pathway,\" he says.",
      "And in the long run, believes Prof Javaid, to have a greater number of people with early-stage osteoporosis identified and receiving the preventative treatment they need will save the NHS money. \"Fracture is one of the top reasons people end up in hospital,\" he says.",
      "Mr Studholme has seen the devastation of osteoporosis first hand: it led to his mother breaking both her hips. It used to just be considered an old person's condition with nothing that could be done, he says. \"I feel quite privileged I can do something before my bones turn into chalk,\" he says."

      "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has upgraded its growth forecast for the UK economy this year, but has also warned about the possible impact of Donald Trump's economic plans.",
      "The global institution upgraded its prediction for UK growth to 1.6% for this year from its previous estimate of 1.5%.",
      "But it said a threatened wave of tariffs by incoming US president Trump could make trade tensions worse, lower investment, and disrupt supply chains across the world.",
      "The IMF also said although tariffs, tax cuts and deregulation could boost the US economy in the short term, they could ultimately backfire.",
      "The prospect of higher taxes being introduced on imports to the US is concerning many world leaders because they will make it more expensive for companies to sell their goods in the world's biggest economy.",
      "Tariffs are a central part of Trump's economic vision - he sees them as a way of growing the US economy, protecting jobs and raising tax revenue - and has threatened to issue tariffs against China, Canada and Mexico on day one of his presidency next week.",
      "He has also said he would impose 100% tariffs on the BRICS bloc of nine nations if they were to create a rival currency to the US dollar.",
      "The IMF said such policies could set the scene for an inflationary boom followed by a bust and could weaken US Treasury bonds as a safe bet.",

      "The pound slipped to $1.216 immediately following the release of the retail sales figures, but then recovered to $1.22. Government borrowing costs over a 10-year period also retreated further from recent peaks, as expectations grow that the Bank of England will cut interest rates next month.",

      "Donald Trump is expected to target undocumented immigrants, most of whom come from Central America, as soon as he takes power next week. What is lesser known is that migrants from some of the same countries have a legal route to work on American farms for a limited time.",
      "Farm labourer Sandra Noemi Bucu Saz is happy.",
      "She's recently returned to Guatemala in Central America from the US, where she was picking strawberries in California.",
      "\"They paid us $19 (\u00a315.60) an hour,\" says Sandra. \"We were asked to pick seven boxes per hour, and if we picked more, then we got paid a bit extra.",
      "\"It's so different to what I get paid in Guatemala, which is around $10 per day, when there's work.\"",
      "Sandra is one of around 5,000 Guatemalans who go and work \u2013 legally - in the US every year, thanks to a US government visa scheme for temporary agriculture workers from overseas, called H-2A.",
      "This allows US farms that cannot find enough locals to do the work to bring in staff from overseas. The foreign workers can stay for up to 12 months, before they then have to go back to their home countries.",
      "For people like Sandra it's a chance to get on in life, and to help her family by sending back some of the money she earns. In Guatemala there are now around 30 recruitment companies that are registered with the Guatemalan government to help people find temporary work in the US via H-2A visas.",
      "It's a cold, grey, windy day in southern Guatemala as Sanda proudly shows off the plot of land she rents in a place called Las Tres Cruces, high up in the hills near a town where she lives with her family, called Santiago Sacatep\u00e9quez.",
      "She and her relatives grow corn, lettuce, beans and spinach for them to eat. And if there's enough left over they sell them at the local market.  Sandra's dream is to save enough money to buy some land, so they don't have to rent.",
      "But first she needs to pay off the rest of the debt that she got herself in to after being scammed when she and her sister first tried to get a visa for the United States.",
      "\"We paid someone $2,000 per person because we wanted to get work in the US,\" she says. \"My sister and I thought we needed to do this so we could move forward and make our dreams come true. So, we got a loan to get the money, but sadly it was all a scam, and they took our money.\"",
      "This is common practice for fraudsters in Guatemala, who play with people's desperation to get to the US, and trick them into handing over money.",
      "Cesia Ochoa is the executive director for the Guatemala branch of a legitimate recruitment company called Cierto. A business that also has offices in the US and Mexico, it is one of the 30 or so officially registered in Guatemala to offer H-2A visas.",
      "\"Part of our inspiration for opening an office in Guatemala was to help locals avoid the scams,\" she says.",
      "When Sandra went to the US via Cierto, she didn't have to pay it a fee. Instead, the company is paid by farm businesses in the US looking for temporary workers.",
      "Ms Ochoa explains: \"For us, it's really important that we make a good contact between businesses and the workers, and that the salaries and contract they are offering are real.\"",
      "While the H-2A visa allows people from Guatemala to legally find temporary farm work in the US, there is estimated to be more than 675,000 undocumented Guatemalans in the US, according to the Pew Research Center think tank.",
      "And a further 200,000 were found to have tried to enter the US without valid documentation in the 12 months to September of last year. That is the third highest number behind Mexicans and Venezuelans.",

      "A big problem is that to raise that amount of money many families need to take out loans secured against the value of their home. They can then lose their properties if the money isn't paid back.",
      "And that is often the case, given that the chance of them making it to the US is far from guaranteed, with the risk of accidents along the way, or being turned back at the US border.",
      "But the rewards are high. The money loved ones send back from the US is known as remittances, and these are propping up Guatemala's economy. In 2023 the country received $19.8bn in total remittances from abroad, according to one study from the Inter-American Development Bank.",
      "President Donald Trump has vowed to get tough on undocumented immigrants, and is threatening to carry out mass deportations .",

      "\"There's a lot of trust in Denmark in that way, and I don't feel a hierarchy at my job. It's all very democratic.\"",
      "It is no surprise to Mr Hoces, a married father of two young daughters, that Denmark is consistently among the top-five countries in the world for work-life balance rankings.",
      "Only 1.1% of Danes have to work 50 or more hours a week, according to the most recent global figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). That's a significantly lower proportion than the world average of 10.2%.",
      "By contrast, the figure for the UK is 10.8% and the US is 10.4%.",
      "Meik Wiking, author of the book The Art of Danish Living, has long regarded his home country as a shining example of what other countries should aspire to mimic with their workplace policies.",
      "\"Danes are actually happy at work,\" he tells the BBC. \"Almost 60% of Danes say they would continue to work if they won the lottery and became financially independent.\"",
      "Mr Wiking, who is also the boss of Danish think tank The Happiness Research Institute, shares several policies that help generate a strong work-life balance in Denmark.",
      "These include the right to a minimum five weeks of paid annual leave per year, in addition to public holidays. In the UK most workers are entitled to 5.6 weeks of paid leave, but in the US it can be as low as  just 11 days.",
      "Denmark also offers a very generous six months of paid maternity and paternity leave. In the UK the father, or non-birthing partner, typically gets one to two weeks of paid leave.",
      "In the US there is only a federal guarantee of unpaid parental leave, although some states, such as California, now offer paid time away from work after the birth of a child. And federal employees can get 12-weeks of paid leave.",
      "Mr Wiking is another Dane who cites the concept of bosses trusting their employees to do the right thing. He uses the example of staff at the Tivoli Gardens amusement park in Copenhagen, where they follow the three-metre rule.",
      "The idea is that you are CEO of everything within a radius of three metres. \"If you see garbage within your three-metre radius you pick it up, and if you see a guest looking for something, you stop and ask them if you can help,\" says Mr Wiking.",
      "He adds that when staff take ownership of their own space it can help them feel empowered and appreciated, which goes a long way to contributing to a healthy sentiment about their workplace.",
      "Janine Leschke, a professor in the department of management, society and communication at the Copenhagen Business School, says Denmark is definitely \"not a work culture where you have to show up and be available all day, all evening, to show that you're working hard all the time\".",
      "Instead, she says flexibility during the workday gives employees the time they need to, say, pick up their children from school or day care. \"The day doesn't have to officially end at five or six, and that's appealing to a lot of Danes with kids.\"",
      "Mr Hoces has noticed how some employers in the US may expect their staff to be available over weekends, to answer the odd email or message. That kind of overtime doesn't fit with his outlook on a positive work-life balance.",
      "\"If I was expected to take calls on the weekend, that would be a huge red flag to me, and I would likely change jobs,\" he says. \"But so far that hasn't happened to me or anyone I know.\"",
      "Casper Rouchmann, a Copenhagen-based CEO and founder of tech firm SparkForce, says his relaxed leadership policy would be familiar to most Danes. \"You don't need to ask me to leave early,\" he says. \"No one takes advantage of my kindness.\"",
      "Mr Rouchmann adds that the element of trust is so ingrained in Danish culture, visitors to Denmark are often aghast at how far it can go. He also highlights Denmark's generous welfare state, and the fact that firms have to give financial compensation to staff who are made redundant.",
      "\"If you lose your job, the government is there to help,\" adds Mr Rouchmann.",
      "As much as other countries can learn from Denmark's work-life balance, he says it has some downsides. \"Some people can rely too much on that safety net, and it might say to them that they don't have to take real risks, which is why we can be less entrepreneurial compared to the US.\"",
      "Samantha Saxby, an American human resources expert, says Denmark has such a good work-life balance because the country \"prioritises collective well-being\".",

      "Yet Ms Saxby, who is director of marketing for the US National Human Resources Association, says that companies in the US and elsewhere around the world may be finally following the lead of Denmark and the other equally happy Nordic nations.",
      "\"Progressive organisations are introducing benefits like unlimited paid time off, mental health days, and wellness programs, to encourage employees to prioritise self-care,\" she says. \"These measures not only alleviate pressure, but also demonstrate that employers value their workforce's overall well-being.",

    "published": "Tue, 14 Jan 2025 00:09:07 GMT",
    "summary": "Should more AI be used to help GPs with consultations and administrative work?",
    "story": [
      "This is the fifth feature in a six-part series that is looking at how AI is changing medical research and treatments.",
      "The difficulty of getting an appointment with a GP is a familiar gripe in the UK.",
      "Even when an appointment is secured, the rising workload faced by doctors means those meetings can be shorter than either the doctor or patient would like.",
      "But Dr Deepali Misra-Sharp, a GP partner in Birmingham, has found that AI has alleviated a chunk of the administration from her job, meaning she can focus more on patients.",
      "Dr Mirsa-Sharp started using Heidi Health, a free AI-assisted medical transcription tool that listens and transcribes patient appointments, about four months ago and says it has made a big difference.",
      "\u201cUsually when I\u2019m with a patient, I am writing things down and it takes away from the consultation,\u201d she says. \u201cThis now means I can spend my entire time locking eyes with the patient and actively listening. It makes for a more quality consultation.\u201d",
      "She says the tech reduces her workflow, saving her \u201ctwo to three minutes per consultation, if not more\u201d. She reels off other benefits: \u201cIt reduces the risk of errors and omissions in my medical note taking.\"",
      "With a workforce in decline while the number of patients continues to grow, GPs face immense pressure.",
      "A single full-time GP is now responsible for 2,273 patients, up 17% since September 2015, according to the British Medical Association (BMA).",
      "Could AI be the solution to help GP\u2019s cut back on administrative tasks and alleviate burnout?",
      "Some research suggests it could. A 2019 report prepared by Health Education England estimated a minimal saving of one minute per patient from new technologies such as AI, equating to 5.7 million hours of GP time.",
      "Meanwhile, research by Oxford University in 2020, found that 44% of all administrative work in General Practice can now be either mostly or completely automated, freeing up time to spend with patients.",
      "One company working on that is Denmark's Corti, which has developed AI that can listen to healthcare consultations, either over the phone or in person, and suggest follow-up questions, prompts, treatment options, as well as automating note taking.",
      "Corti says its technology processes about 150,000 patient interactions per day across hospitals, GP surgeries and healthcare institutions across Europe and the US, totalling about 100 million encounters per year.",
      "\u201cThe idea is the physician can spend more time with a patient,\u201d says Lars Maal\u00f8e, co-founder and chief technology officer at Corti. He says the technology can suggest questions based on previous conversations it has heard in other healthcare situations.",
      "\u201cThe AI has access to related conversations and then it might think, well, in 10,000 similar conversations, most questions asked X and that has not been asked,\u201d says Mr Maal\u00f8e.",
      "\u201cI imagine GPs have one consultation after another and so have little time to consult with colleagues. It\u2019s giving that colleague advice.\u201d",
      "He also says it can look at the historical data of a patient. \u201cIt could ask, for example, did you remember to ask if the patient is still suffering from pain in the right knee?\u201d",
      "But do patients want technology listening to and recording their conversations?",
      "Mr Maal\u00f8e says \u201cthe data is not leaving system\u201d. He does say it is good practice to inform the patient, though.",
      "\u201cIf the patient contests it, the doctor cannot record. We see few examples of that as the patient can see better documentation.\u201d",
      "Dr Misra-Sharp says she lets patients know she has a listening device to help her take notes. \u201cI haven\u2019t had anyone have a problem with that yet, but if they did, I wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, currently, 1,400 GP practices across England are using the C the Signs, a platform which uses AI to analyse patients\u2019 medical records and check different signs, symptoms and risk factors of cancer, and recommend what action should be taken.",
      "\u201cIt can capture symptoms, such as cough, cold, bloating, and essentially in a minute it can see if there\u2019s any relevant information from their medical history,\u201d says C the Signs chief executive and co-founder Dr Bea Bakshi, who is also a GP.",
      "The AI is trained on published medical research papers.",
      "\u201cFor example, it might say the patient is at risk of pancreatic cancer and would benefit from a pancreatic scan, and then the doctor will decide to refer to those pathways,\u201d says Dr Bakshi. \u201cIt won\u2019t diagnose, but it can facilitate.\u201d",
      "She says they have conducted more than 400,000 cancer risk assessments in a real-world setting, detecting more than 30,000 patients with cancer across more than 50 different cancer types.",
      "An AI report published by the BMA this year found that \u201cAI should be expected to transform, rather than replace, healthcare jobs by automating routine tasks and improving efficiency\u201d.",
      "In a statement, Dr Katie Bramall-Stainer, chair of General Practice Committee UK at the BMA, said: \"We recognise that AI has the potential to transform NHS care completely - but if not enacted safely, it could also cause considerable harm. AI is subject to bias and error, can potentially compromise patient privacy and is still very much a work-in-progress.",
      "\"Whilst AI can be used to enhance and supplement what a GP can offer as another tool in their arsenal, it's not a silver bullet. We cannot wait on the promise of AI tomorrow, to deliver the much-needed productivity, consistency and safety improvements needed today.\u201d",

      "AI is trained to spot warning signs in blood tests",
      "Could AI help prevent diabetes-related sight loss?",
      "Alison Dennis, partner and co-head of law firm Taylor Wessing's international life sciences team, warns that GPs need to tread carefully when using AI.",
      "\"There is the very high risk of generative AI tools not providing full and complete, or correct diagnoses or treatment pathways, and even giving wrong diagnoses or treatment pathways i.e. producing hallucinations or basing outputs on clinically incorrect training data,\u201d says Ms Dennis.",
      "\u201cAI tools that have been trained on reliable data sets and then fully validated for clinical use \u2013 which will almost certainly be a specific clinical use, are more suitable in clinical practice.\u201d",
      "She says specialist medical products must be regulated and receive some form of official accreditation.",
      "\u201cThe NHS would also want to ensure that all data that is inputted into the tool is retained securely within the NHS system infrastructure, and is not absorbed for further use by the provider of the tool as training data without the appropriate GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation] safeguards in place.\"",
      "For now, for GPs like Misra-Sharp, it has transformed their work. \u201cIt has made me go back to enjoying my consultations again instead of feeling time pressured.\u201d"

      "The plot twist would be a settlement of his mammoth case against their parent, News Group Newspapers [NGN], the British press arm of the media empire founded by Rupert Murdoch.",
      "Is it likely? You would get better odds on Harry and Meghan announcing a weekly lifestyle column for The Sun on Sunday.",
      "This will be the first time that News Group Newspapers has had to defend itself against allegations that its journalists and executives across the whole organisation were involved in or knew about unlawful newsgathering techniques.",
      "If it were to lose, and lose badly, a finding from the court of corporate-level wrongdoing would be in stark contrast to a longstanding defence that phone hacking was limited to bad apples in one now-closed title.",
      "The prince's allegations of tabloid wrongdoing date back to 1996. Harry and his brother Prince William first became aware they may have been targeted in 2006.",
      "Back then, texting was still in its infancy and everybody left voicemails - and some tabloid journalists realised it was rather easy to listen in.",
      "Clive Goodman, a News of the World journalist, and Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator, were arrested, and later jailed, for intercepting voicemails on phones belonging to the princes' aides.",

      "That means it has seen off potential trials from people who say the newspapers ran stories that could have only been written with access to private or confidential sources of information that could not have been publicly known.",
      "Those settlements left just two claimants - one of them Prince Harry.",
      "When he launched his claim, he alleged that more than 200 articles published by NGN between 1996 and 2011 contained information gathered by illegal means. The trial will look at a sample of around 30 stories in detail.",
      "Some of those will cover ground trodden in his successful Mirror Group case in 2023 and, just like in that case, he will give evidence in person.",
      "There will be hours of analysis of how the Sun got scoops such as \"Emotional Harry rang Chelsy at midnight\" - a story it ran almost twenty years ago to the day about his then girlfriend, Chelsy Davy.",
      "There will be further separate allegations from the second claimant, Lord (Tom) Watson. The former Labour MP says his phone was targeted around the time he was investigating the Murdoch newspapers at the height of the scandal almost 15 years ago.",
      "Mr Justice Fancourt will decide if any of the NGN articles were the product of unlawful information gathering, such as information tricked or \"blagged\" out of phone companies by private investigators.",
      "In Prince Harry's case, he will not rule on whether there was any phone hacking because Prince Harry ran out of legal time to bring those allegations to trial.",
      "None of this is going to be simple in court.",
      "The judge had repeatedly expressed his frustration, referring to the two sides as entrenched well-resourced armies refusing to give any ground to each other.",
      "And at no stage has Prince Harry looked like he was going to settle, despite the enormous financial hit he faces by not doing so.",
      "If a claimant turns down an offer of settlement and is later awarded less in damages by a judge, they have to pay the legal costs of both sides.",
      "Prince Harry has been very open about the hit he will take and why he was pressing ahead.",
      "\"The goal is accountability. It's really that simple,\" he told an audience at a New York Times event in December.",
      "News Group has, in simple terms, three lines of defence. It will firstly argue that Harry has run out of time to bring allegations of unlawful information gathering.",
      "This saw off his mobile phone hacking claim.",
      "Secondly, its lawyers will test, article-by-article, the duke's claims that the information in them came from dodgy sources.",
      "Thirdly, News Group has lined up witnesses to rebut Prince Harry and Lord Watson's broader allegation that the top brass knew what was going on and were party to the mass destruction of purportedly incriminating records in 2011.",
      "While the celebrity focus will inevitably be on the prince when he goes into the witness box, that third allegation of a cover up is the most important element of this trial.",
      "While the hit to Prince Harry's wallet will be big, the damage to NGN's reputation - and that of its executives - would be greater still if the court finds they were involved.",
      "The executives the claimants will accuse of wrongdoing include the current CEO, Rebekah Brooks. She was found not guilty of conspiracy to hack voicemails in the seismic 2014 trial that ended with the jailing of Andy Coulson, her former colleague, News of the World editor and David Cameron's communications chief.",
      "Another is Will Lewis. He played a key role in managing the hacking crisis in 2011. He is now the CEO of the Washington Post - an appointment that has been opposed by many at the newspaper because of this association.",
      "They and others deny wrongdoing.",
      "Will they be giving evidence? A spokesperson for NGN said: \"Both claimants allege unlawful destruction of emails by News International between 2010-2011. This allegation is wrong, unsustainable, and is strongly denied. NGN will be calling a number of witnesses including technologists, lawyers and senior staff to defeat the claim.\"",
      "Exactly what evidence Prince Harry brings to prove this claim - and what NGN says in defence - may define the entire battle.",
      "Tuesday really is the beginning of the end. And someone is going to lose - and lose big."

    "summary": "Apple TV's hit dystopian workplace thriller finally returns after a three-year cliffhanger.",
    "story": [
      "Spoiler warning for season two's opening episode",
      "\"I don't think Mark, in the wildest reaches of his imagination, thought his company could do something as nefarious as faking a death,\" says actor Adam Scott of his character in Apple TV's Severance.",
      "But Mark's is an unusual workplace, to put it mildly.",
      "Employees at biotech conglomerate Lumon Industries are offered the company's pioneering severance programme, a concept inspired by series creator Dan Erickson's desire to escape the mind-numbing drudgery of his office jobs.",
      "Sold as the ultimate work-life balance, the firm's brain microchip procedure splits a person's consciousness and memory into dual existences.",
      "This means when \"severed\" grieving widower Mark Scout and his colleagues take the office lift each morning, their work-self - or \"innie\" - awakens for duty. Once they clock off, their \"outie\" re-emerges, returning to home life blissfully unaware.",
      "But series one's cliffhanger finale - the work of executive producer and director Ben Stiller - saw Mark discover his late wife Gemma may actually still be alive amid a rebellion by his team against their shadowy employers.",
      "The group managed to outsmart floor managers Harmony Cobel (Patricia Arquette) and Milchick (Tramell Tillman) and override the severance system, briefly awakening their real-world bodies. Rebellious sceptic Helly (Britt Lowery) also learned a shattering truth about her outie's company ties.",
      "Fans have been waiting almost three years to find out what happens next, and on Friday, Severance returned to Apple TV for its anticipated second season.",
      "The show got critical acclaim in 2022 to become one of Apple's breakout hits - earning 14 Emmy nominations and a Writers Guild award. It helped, too, that the show arrived at a time when the pandemic had fundamentally shifted the audience's own relationship with office life.",
      "But the Hollywood writers' strike and behind-the scenes issues (resolved for Stiller to return to produce and direct), forced the wait that left audiences hungry for answers.",
      "I ask Scott, who, fittingly, has never worked a real office job but played many office on-screen roles, how that cliffhanger has affected his latest character's psyche on the show's return.",
      "\"Mark is far more self-possessed and septical, possibly, of this company,\" says the 51-year-old, who played manager Ben Wyatt in comedy Parks and Recreation.",
      "Last season, trapped inside Lumon's brutalist architecture and sanitised walls, crunching mysterious numbers for the \"Macrodata Refinement team\", the team was fed cultish Soviet-esque propaganda about company founder Kier Eagan and his family.",
      "Where previously, \"Lumon and Kier and all of its rules and and regulations made up [the innies'] identities\", Scott says their brief escape into the outside world and the chance to taste their alternate existences has \"filled them up\".",
      "Rebel, rebel",
      "If season one darkly satirised corporate greed and rebellion, season two lays bare disingenuous corporation damage control and co-option, in ways once again sure to spark Reddit theories. Nothing is quite as it seems.",
      "Apple need the series to be popular, too, with each episode costing $20m (\u00a316m) to make according to Bloomberg - a big investment given plans to rein in spending after years of streaming services disrupting the market.",
      "In yesterday's season opener, we saw Mark's innie (newly sentient after his team's brief escape into the outside world) return to work to find his team replaced.",
      "Floor manager Milchick explains that in the five months since the uprising, fellow manager Harmony (known to workers as Ms. Cobel) has been fired, with himself promoted in her place. The team is also being promised workplace reform - including improved staff perks.",
      "After all, nothing better conveyed Lumon's unnerving forced fun than its heavily rationed waffle, melon and single-track dance parties. An HR video even reframes the team's rebellion positively, encouraging staff to \"praise Kier\" for the uprising.",
      "Mark's attempts to reunite his team are thwarted by Milchick. But newly empowered by his trip to the outside world, he decides to challenge the shadowy forces that run the company directly.",
      "This push and pull between Mark and a faceless employer may strike a chord with those being forced to go back into the office as companies clamp down on remote working post-pandemic. This month, the bank JPMorgan Chase reportedly closed comments on an intranet page announcing its return-to-work edict, following a tide of negative responses.",
      "This new series comes at a time when the balance of power is arguably shifting in favour of employers again, after a total of 100 million Americans quit their jobs in 2021 and 2022 in what Stanford economics professor Nicholas Bloom called the Great Resignation.",
      "Disillusionment has sparked cultural shifts amongst office workers. The term 'quiet quitting' has emerged, referring to doing the bare minimum in a job. Similarly \"late-stage capitalism\" has gained traction on social media, not for its Marxist roots, but to describe perceived inequalities, societal burnout and a faltering system.",
      "The board will (not) see you now",
      "In series two, we see how Lumon's disorientating, unforgiving corporate culture and its deceptive pleasantries affects those with power too. Floor managers Milchick and newly-demoted Harmony become victims as well as enforcers.",
      "Arquette, who won an Oscar for Richard Linklater's 2014 film Boyhood, says her character is \"furious\" that the corporation, in demoting her, has failed to recognise her loyalty.",
      "Tillman similarly adds that whilst it is unclear whether Milchick betrayed Harmony, he bears a \"heavy responsibility\" on his shoulders. As her replacement, he must now both placate the innies and please a board who \"do not understand what it takes to do the job\".",
      "Unlike Scott, Tillman worked in corporate office roles prior to becoming an actor and landing his breakthrough role as company man Milchick. He says he was never as \"arrogant or ambitious\" as his character, but admits to occasionally being \"adventurous\" in navigating office politics. This either worked well or, sometimes, landed him \"flat on my face\".",
      "Tillman equally recognises Milchick's isolated experience as the sole black managerial figure. Steering clear of spoilers, he says we begin to understand Milchick's experience of being \"othered by the company he serves\".",
      "\"It really speaks to how some organisations and some corporations, in their attempt to be inclusive, miss the boat,\" he adds.",
      "Arquette continues: \"I feel every few years there's a new doctrine throughout the corporate space - some kind of PR switcharoo [about] how to be current and different than we were in the past.",
      "\"I think a lot of times things do need to change, but sometimes it doesn't really feel genuine.\"",

    "summary": "Harry Clark is among the former contestants who reveals some of the show's secrets to the BBC.",
    "story": [
      "The Traitors is one of the few things getting us through a miserable January. For three nights a week, it feels as if the whole country is living and breathing the cloaks-and-daggers drama.",
      "For the other four painstaking days when the show isn't on air, we're sharing our opinions and theories with everyone from colleagues to strangers online.",
      "But it's not just tactics and contestants viewers are talking about - my group chats are incessantly pinging with questions about what happens behind the scenes, where the cast go once they leave the castle, and whether Charlotte will ever reveal her real accent.",
      "Luckily, we no longer need to ponder most of these questions, as former contestants have been speaking to BBC News about the secret workings of the Traitors castle.",
      "What does a typical day in the castle look like, and what happens before breakfast?",
      "The order in which the contestants arrive at breakfast is a source of tension and speculation on the show.",
      "Series one faithful Maddy Smedley explains that contestants are kept in separate holding rooms when they come to the castle in the morning and are called to go into breakfast individually or as a group.",
      "Similarly, in the evenings, contestants wait in a holding room until a runner comes to individually escort them out of the building and into a car.",
      "Traitor and series two champion Harry Clark says there are no clocks in the castle and contestants have no sense of time.",
      "\"You get picked up in the morning and when filming is over, you get dropped back to the lodgings,\" he explains.",
      "\"I don't know what time the mission starts or when lunch is - we rely on the production team to direct us and in between, we all just sit around and chat.\"",
      "Unlike the hour-long episodes we see, Harry says the days aren't filled with wall-to-wall traitor speculation.",
      "\"I spent most the day talking to Paul about Liverpool and Chelsea or finding out if everyone believes in aliens and obviously that stuff doesn't make the final edit because it's not relevant to the game.\"",
      "Series one faithful Dr Amos Ogunkoya describes his days in the castle as \"a really nice holiday camp, until the roundtable\".",
      "\"Most of the day we're just learning about each others lives and so you become really close to everyone there.\"",
      "Matt Harris, another faithful in series one, says that, while the castle is huge, \"you're not allowed out of sight from the cameras so you can't walk around the grounds\".",
      "\"They set up the rooms like the library and bar especially for the show and you're told by producers which rooms you can go into.\"",
      "How long does the roundtable really last?",
      "The lack of clocks make it hard to know exactly how long anything lasts but the roundtable surely far surpasses its 10 minutes of screen time.",
      "\"At the beginning, there are 22 people,\" says Harry. \"Even if everyone only speaks for 10 minutes, that's more than three hours.\"",
      "As viewers, it can be hard to understand why contestants are so emotional during and after the roundtable, but Harry says it's \"really intense\".",
      "\"Everyone has their own story and you're taking someone's chance of winning money away if they are banished.\"",
      "Maddy says she cried so much on the show that \"the security guards would give me ice every morning to help the puffiness of my face go down\".",
      "Where do contestants sleep?",
      "The exact location of contestants' lodgings remains a mystery to us, and apparently to the cast as well.",
      "\"It's about a 30-minute drive from the castle but you're blindfolded as you approach, so you can't see the car in front or figure out exactly where you are,\" Maddy says.",
      "She explains that the whole production team and cast stay in private lodgings but you're kept apart from everyone \"with military precision\".",
      "\"You're allowed to go for a walk but you have to be accompanied by a runner and each floor is manned by two security guards who ensure you don't leave your room unaccompanied.",
      "\"At first, I was really scared of them because I had watched the Dutch version of the show and in that, the faithful are murdered in their hotel room so every time the guard knocked on my door I thought I was going to leave the game,\" she says.",
      "Harry explains he felt lonely at times in the accommodation, especially as contestants have their phones taken away. \"But I can't complain because I slept easy every night knowing I'd be turning up for breakfast!\"",
      "What do contestants eat?",
      "Every now and then viewers get a quick glimpse of a bowl of fruit at breakfast or someone piling carrots onto their plate at dinner time.",
      "The contestants we spoke to gave the food provided on the show mixed reviews.",
      "Dr Amos says \"the breakfast was horrible, you definitely would not want to eat much of it\" but Matt was more generous and described it as \"decent\".",
      "Harry says \"there was a lot of Scottish food like haggis\" adding that as a fussy eater, he \"wouldn't touch it\".",
      "But luckily for Harry, there was the option to request food.",
      "During the day, he says he ate \"a lot of chicken nuggets and chips\" and, in the evening, he would ask for the \"perfect traitor fuel\" to be delivered to his lodgings - a crisp sandwich.",
      "What happens when contestants are banished or murdered?",
      "If a contestant is banished at the roundtable, they \"really do leave immediately\", according to Maddy.",
      "\"You're taken to do an exit interview straight away and then driven to your hotel to pack your stuff. The next day, I was escorted by security in the morning to the airport and was given my phone back.\"",
      "Maddy says the more stressful way of leaving the show is through murder.",
      "\"You turn up in the morning like you're going to breakfast and you are all waiting in these holding rooms. Eventually, you get called as if you're going to breakfast but instead, they take you to another room where the murder letter is sitting on a chair.",
      "\"It was so stressful.\"",
      "Do producers tell contestants what to say and do?",
      "\"The biggest shock was how unscripted everything is,\" Dr Amos says.",
      "Maddy says the only time producers intervened was to tell her to announce that she was an actor over breakfast.",
      "She explains she'd already shared this with her fellow contestants when they were waiting to be taken back to the hotel and had taken their mics off.",
      "Matt says there were some moments that were guided by producers.",
      "\"Occasionally, people were pulled out and told to go and speak to some other people - it's natural that they guide you into a position to make good TV.\"",
      "\"It's weird at first because there are cameras in your face but after a while, you forget they're there and producers don't ever step in,\" Harry adds.",
      "\"Most rooms also just have cameras in the corner and you have a mic attached to you so sometimes, you don't see any of the producers until the end of the day when they check in on you.\"",
      "Mike Cotton, creative director of the studio that makes The Traitors, told the BBC last year there were cameras \"dotted around every single room\".",
      "\"I'd say there's probably about 50 or 60 of those throughout the living space within the castle.\"",
      "He said a team of camera operators worked in pairs to follow the cast around into different rooms - but at a distance.",
      "At the roundtable, he said the cameras were hidden and some were built into the table itself.",
      "\"The contestants can't see any cameras and that's to keep them immersed as they can only see each other,\" he explained.",
      "What is Claudia Winkleman like?",
      "\"When I met Claudia, I was so nervous because she's so powerful,\" says Harry.",
      "\"I wanted to be a traitor so badly and I thought she'd take no notice of us but actually, she knew everything about everyone.",
      "\"She gets really involved and makes you feel really comfortable.\"",
      "How much does Claudia Winkleman know about the challenges?",
      "\"Very little,\" according to Harry.",
      "\"There's a team that create the missions and everyone else is in the dark about them. I would try off-camera to get them to tell me about it or I'd give them ideas but they wouldn't listen.\"",
      "Claudia recently said her biggest fear is accidentally giving away the traitors' identities while filming the roundtables.",
      "\"I am absolutely paranoid about ever looking at the traitors, so I sort of look just above everybody's head,\" she explained.",
      "How are traitors selected?",
      "Speaking to BBC News and other press last month, Claudia explained there's a team of people who make the decision.",
      "\"We talk to all of them, and then six of us go up to a room, the brilliant casting people, and we get through seven packets of biscuits.",
      "\"I'm the smallest voice in the room, but you decide while having had those chats who it's going to be.\"",
      "The team take the players' wishes into consideration and if someone asks not to be a traitor, they wouldn't be picked.",
      "Dr Amos says he made it very clear that he wouldn't appear on the show if he wasn't a faithful.",
      "\"I wanted to take part in the show but as a doctor I think being a traitor and lying to people has real-life consequences as my patients might not trust me.\"",
      "How do you get on The Traitors?",
      "One thing that's clear from speaking to the contestants is applying for the show is hard work.",
      "After firing off your initial written and video applications, you have a number of audiences with producers.",
      "\"They ask you to mainly tell them stories about yourself and your life,\" Dr Amos says.",
      "\"Eventually, if they like you, then you get a phone call a few weeks before [filming starts] to say you're off to Scotland,\" adds Harry.",
      "Where is The Traitors castle?",
      "The Traitors is filmed in Ardross Castle, a 19th Century building about 30 miles north of Inverness.",
      "It is set in about 100 acres of gardens and parkland and has been owned by the McTaggart family since 1983.",
      "Fun fact: its previous owner was Charles William Dyson Perrins whose grandfather, William Perrins (in partnership with John Wheeley Lea) created the recipe for Worcestershire Sauce.",
      "How many people are involved in the production?",
      "Mike Cotton said the crew on location was made up of more than 200 people.",
      "\"It sounds absolutely huge but we film one episode a day,\" he said.",
      "He explained that this team included everyone from producers and camera operators to the art department who worked their magic on interior designing the rooms.",
      "He likened the production to one you might find on set for a Hollywood film.",
      "Dr Amos says that every member of the crew knew who the traitors were.",
      "\"It looks like the faithful are in the majority on the show but in reality, you massively feel in the minority -  everyone down to the psychologist who is there to support you knows who the traitors are.\"",

      "She was initially cautious about a relationship with him - Olivier was 22 years older and already one half of Britain's most celebrated theatrical couple, married to Vivien Leigh.",
      "Plowright herself was married to fellow actor Roger Gage.",

      "\"He has extremes of behaviour, which you understand,\" she later said. \"You just find a way not to be swept overboard by his demons.\"",
      "Their relationship also led her to refuse for five years to appear at the National Theatre, where her husband was director from 1962\u20131973.",
      "The actress felt  she would have been vulnerable to accusations of favouritism.",
      "Eventually though, she took a contract with the theatre for a decade, in far grander roles than those at the Royal Court.",
      "By now, her husband had been elevated to the peerage - which made her Lady Olivier - but she didn't use the title.",
      "Plowright won a Golden Globe and was Oscar-nominated for her appearance in the 1991 film Enchanted April.",
      "In fact, she won two Golden Globes in one year - the other coming for HBO TV movie Stalin.",
      "Her other films included Three Sisters in 1970 and The Merchant of Venice in 1973 - both opposite her husband and both based on National Theatre productions.",
      "She also played Mrs Fairfax in 1996's Jane Eyre, and her range went far beyond the classics in films like Dennis the Menace, Last Action Hero and 101 Dalmatians.",

      "As if in agreement, the theatre in her native Scunthorpe renamed itself in her honour.",

    "title": "David Lynch: Mind-bending Twin Peaks director who embraced the weird",
    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 06:08:12 GMT",
    "summary": "The visionary director's belief in American beauty and horror being two sides of the same coin was perfected in the iconic 1990 TV series.",
    "story": [
      "David Lynch once said he was inspired to become a filmmaker when, while painting, he inexplicably heard a gust of wind and saw the artwork move on canvas.",
      "The moment defined his obsession with \"seeing paintings move\", but also his flair for the bizarre - twisting realities on the small and big screen for almost 40 years.",
      "The 78-year-old US director, who has died months after announcing an emphysema diagnosis, became the contemporary face of weird, unsettling worlds often hidden within everyday society  - from TV series Twin Peaks to films like Blue Velvet, Mulholland Drive and Inland Empire.",
      "A self-professed daydreamer, Lynch burst onto the scene via the midnight movie circuit with 1977's Eraserhead. The disorientating horror, a comment on male paranoia, set the layered template that ran through his work.",
      "Four decades later, he lived to see his style immortalised as an adjective in the Oxford dictionary. Lynchian, it reads, blurs \"surreal or sinister elements with the mundane\" - an accolade fitting of the four-time Oscar nominee turned lifetime achievement recipient, whose character was as big as his films.",
      "David Keith Lynch was born in Missoula, Montana on January 20, 1946. The son of a research scientist for the Department of Agriculture, he spent much of his early life moving around from state to state with his brother and sister.",
      "However, Lynch's parents encouraged his artistic ambitions from an early age. Speaking to Rolling Stone in 1990, he said his mother \"saved\" him by encouraging him to draw on scrap paper rather than using colouring books, where \"the whole idea is to stay between the lines\".",
      "This ethos inspired his films, tinged by a rebellious streak which he teased lasted from the age of 14 to 30. \"People rebel that long these days\", he reasoned, \"because we're built to live longer\".",
      "Youthful frustration at the calm of suburban life left him craving for \"something out of the ordinary to happen\" to challenge the superficiality of 1950s family ideals - a dark dream his films and shows brought to life.",
      "Lynch's black-and-white debut feature Eraserhead achieved this vision far more successfully than his years at art school, with its central character descending into madness after fathering a terrifying baby.",
      "Critics were left confused, but its late-night cinema success sparked a breakthrough when one audience member recommended him to Mel Brooks, who asked him to helm Elephant Man.",
      "Co-written by Lynch, the film's cast of eventual screen icons, including John Hurt as Merrick and Anthony Hopkins, transformed the story of stigma into an emotional, critical hit, outpacing the original stage play.",
      "It saw Lynch receive Oscar nominations for best director and adapted screenplay, as part of the film's eight nominations that included best picture.",
      "But if Hollywood thought it had found a new blockbuster master, Tinseltown quickly discovered Lynch had no interest in playing mainstream with his 1984 adaptation of sci-fi epic Dune.",
      "Featuring questionable special effects, costumes and rock star Sting lathered in baby oil, the Guardian's Charles Bramesco wrote that Lynch's experiments left the franchise \"radioactive for decades\". \"I'm proud of everything except Dune,\" Lynch would later tell a YouTube Q&A, while admitting elsewhere it almost \"killed\" his career.",
      "Coffee, cherry pie... and Twin Peaks",
      "The wounds began to heal, however, when he returned to double down on his signature style - placing his fascination with America's dirty underbelly in his sights.",
      "Blue Velvet, starring Kyle MacLachlan from Dune, followed a small-town boy caught up in the underworld after he discovered a severed ear. Brutal and violent in part, it divided critics but won Lynch his second Oscar nod for best director.",
      "\"This is the way America is to me,\" Lynch would later describe the movie in his book Lynch on Lynch. \"There's a very innocent, naive quality to life, and there's a horror and a sickness as well\".",
      "He won the prestigious Palme d'Or at the Cannes film festival for romance Wild at Heart in 1990, starring Nicolas Cage, Laura Dern and Willem Dafoe.",
      "But it was Lynch's belief in American beauty and horror being two sides of the same coin, perfected in his TV project Twin Peaks released the same year, that came to define him.",
      "On paper, the unsettling drama explored the murky goings-on in the US logging town following the murder of teenage beauty queen Laura Palmer, hauntingly brought to life by Sheryl Lee.",
      "But viewers were truly captivated by what it offered onscreen: a dreamlike nightmare of wonderfully idiosyncratic characters, including FBI agent Dale Cooper, again played by Kyle MacLachlan, in the apparent comfort of picket-fenced America - cherry pie and coffee included - before unflinchingly reaching into living rooms with its chilling undercurrent of sexual abuse and murder. It was one that had no prior place on US TV.",
      "The ABC show won three Golden Globe awards in 1991, including best TV drama series and best actor in a TV drama for MacLachlan.",
      "\"Without Twin Peaks, and its big-bang expansion of the possibilities of television, half your favourite shows wouldn't exist,\" wrote James Parker for The Atlantic.",
      "The show, he continued, \"effectively renegotiated TV's contract with its audience\".",
      "It mattered little that the second season faltered after the killer was revealed. TV was no longer safe, it was viscerally alive - big screen ideas and production values somehow beamed into living rooms in an age when the silver screen still ruled.",
      "In 1992, viewers were taken back to Twin Peaks with a prequel feature film, Fire Walk With Me, but nothing quite matched the original run.",
      "When the nation asked \"Who killed Laura Palmer?\", it wasn't just about solving the mystery, but finding sanctuary from rotten realities society would rather ignore.  Lynch had found his darkness.",
      "He would eventually shift focus back to the big screen to attack Hollywood's devilish tricks of fame, glamour, deceit and identity loss, in films unofficially known as his Los Angeles trilogy.",
      "This began with 1997's Lost Highway, before 2001's Mulholland Drive - perhaps the closest in aesthetic to Twin Peaks.",
      "The psychological drama received critical acclaim, scoring Lynch his third best director Oscar nomination and scooping the best director gong at Cannes. In recent years it has also been recognised for its queer themes, particularly between Naomi Watts' and Laura Harring's characters, that challenged traditional Hollywood storytelling of the time.",
      "Last came 2006's Inland Empire, Lynch's final feature film, which proved as mind-melting as ever - showing Hollywood star culture no mercy.",
      "As Mike Muncer told BBC Arts' Inside Cinema: \"Lynch lures us in with the promise of familiar, traditional genre thrills and mysteries as a safety net, before that weirdness starts to creep in.",
      "\"Eventually, the mystery box is opened, revealing the darker, more sinister story that Lynch has actually been telling us all along.\"",
      "Cult icon",
      "In his latter years Lynch enjoyed revered cult status. In 2017, he directed Twin Peaks: The Return, a new series set 25 years after the events of the original show, with much of the same cast.",
      "At the same time, the show's legacy continues to endure, inspiring dramas like True Detective and 2023's critically acclaimed Playstation survival horror game Alan Wake II.",
      "Away from the camera, Lynch admitted he had sometimes struggled to balance the \"tricky business\" of fatherhood with his career.",
      "He welcomed four children - Jennifer, Austin, Riley and Lula - with ex-wives Peggy Reavey, Mary Fisk and Mary Sweeney, and estranged wife Emily Stofle.",
      "\"I love all my children and we get along great, but in the early years, before you can have a relationship of talking to them, it's tough,\" he told Vulture. \"The work is the main thing, and I know I've caused suffering because of that. But at the same time I have huge love for the kids.\"",
      "Although Lynch never did return to feature film directing to give himself another shot at an elusive Oscar win, he was granted an honorary lifetime achievement statuette by the Academy in 2019. He also made a cameo in Steven Spielberg's semi-autobiographical 2022 film, The Fablemans, playing filmmaker John Ford.",
      "His artistic pursuits increasingly diversified toward the end of his life, from his original passion for painting to music. Just last year, he released Cellophane Memories, an album with Chrystabell. This added to his previous work producing music videos for artists like Moby and Nine Inch Nails.",

      "He added the diagnosis was the \"price to pay\" for his smoking habit, although he didn't regret the enjoyment it gave him.",
      "But his condition deteriorated within months. In a November interview, with People magazine, Lynch said he needed oxygen to walk.",
      "However his ideas live on, as unique as the way he described thinking of them.",
      "Speaking in conversation with musician Patti Smith for BBC Newsnight in 2014, he said: \"I get ideas in fragments. It's as if in the other room there's a puzzle - all the pieces are together.",

      "Wilson himself is now a father-of-two, and settled in Liverpool. He returns to Scotland on Saturday for the Celtic Connections festival, for a gig at Glasgow's Pavilion Theatre that holds special significance for him.",
      "A trip to the festival more than 20 years to see Scottish folk great John Martyn kick-started his own musical ambitions, inspiring him to move to London.",
      "His decision to move was also an attempt to start afresh following teenage years where he \"barely went to school\" and spent his days riding buses around the Scottish capital, listening to old Motown songs on his Walkman.",
      "It left him with what he calls \"a bent for self-destruction.\"",
      "\"I grew up with my mum as a drug addict so she was in and out of jail and rehab,\" he says.",
      "\"My gran raised me until my teens, when I went back to my mum. She was clean for a while, but there was no structure or no boundaries.\"",

      "\"I was living in London and came home one day to find her smoking crack in my kitchen. I didn't know what to do. We have this conventional wisdom that we have an obligation to try again and again but I don't believe blood is thicker than water or anything like that.",
      "\"I don't know if I'd have done it for myself, but with my kids I had to love her from a distance. In the last few months I took them to see her separately, kind of to say goodbye, and I'm at peace with that. I don't feel any guilt, it was just responsible parenting on my part.",
      "\"I love her, but, and I know this sounds heartless, it's also a relief not to worry about trouble coming to my door anymore.\"",
      "As a teenager, Wilson threw himself into two things - music and alcohol. Both remained with him long after his teenage years had faded away.",

      "Martyn's gig on the same Pavilion stage that Wilson will play still brings a smile to the singer's face.",

      "Mr Knight said this warmth was part of her long standing relationship with the Grand, where the funeral of her sister Bernie took place after she too died of cancer in 2013.",
      "He said: \"She [Linda] is part of the Grand Theatre family -  it was almost like her second home.",
      "\"She was here in summer seasons, and of course in Blood Brothers in 2004 and 2007, and most recently she was her for her one woman show.",
      "\"To see the whole family there was beautiful. This was really her adopted home.\"",

      "She said: \"We were really really lucky she was so generous with her time her memories and her stories, and because of that we have been able to showcase her time and experiences here, especially her Maggie May years.\"",
      "Ms Hall added: \"She was ill, but that didn't dominate our experience. It was joyful. We had the joy of sharing all the band did.\"",

      "After 60 years, Match of the Day is abandoning its sole presenter format and taking on three people who will, in turn, host the show. It is a departure, but it is far from a new strategy in TV.",
      "Match of the Day has, extraordinarily, had just five main presenters in its history - with Gary Lineker being in the hot seat for the past 26 years.",
      "His replacements, who will take over the BBC One football highlights show next season, are all broadcasters rather than sports stars who have taken up broadcasting as a second career.",
      "Lineker and, before him in the 70s and 80s, Jimmy Hill, were examples of former players who were comfortable taking the lead in the studio, but they were more an exception than a rule when it comes to hosting sports programmes.",

      "Likewise, Gabby Logan has been presenting for 30 years. And Mark Chapman has 29 years under his belt and is already the face of Match of the Day 2 on Sundays.",

      "And based on their track records, none of them look likely to attract the sorts of headlines that Lineker has had in recent years.",
      "There is good reason to be careful. At a time when TV ratings have been falling year after year, Match of the Day has been holding steady.",
      "In an era when every Premier League match is televised somewhere and social media is awash with clips of goals as soon as they happen, there was always a question about whether anyone would still want to watch a highlights show.",
      "However, over the past five years, Match of the Day's audience of just under 3.5 million has remained almost unchanged. Over a season, the BBC says 33 million people will tune in at some time to one of the Match of the Day programmes.",

      "There have been reports that the corporation will use the shake-up as an opportunity to use the MOTD name more widely on its online platforms.",

      "Putting calories on food labels and menus \"is no silver bullet\", say researchers who analysed the best evidence to date on how effective the policy can be.",
      "A review of 25 studies on calorie labelling in a number of countries found a small reduction in the calories people chose to eat - equivalent to two almonds - but even  this modest effect could help prevent adults putting on weight as they get older.",
      "The new rules on calorie labelling came into force in England in 2022 as part of government plans to encourage people to make healthier choices.",
      "The government said it would continue to evaluate the impact, including on people with eating disorders.",

      "For Imara, a 27-year-old HR assistant from Birmingham, the change has been a positive part of her weight-loss journey.",
      "\"It has meant that I have been able to stay on track, stay within my calorie deficit and still enjoy a nice meal out with friends, or with my husband, and still have a good time and not worry about falling off track.",
      "\"Sometimes I will just have a meal and not think about the calories,\" she says.",
      "\"But if it is a day or a week where I do want to stay on track then I will look at the calories and see whether it is something that will fit within my goals.\"",
      "The research looked at studies of the impact of calorie labels in supermarkets, restaurants and other food outlets in countries including the United States, UK, Canada and France.",
      "In a 600-calorie meal, it found an average reduction of 11 calories (or 1.8%) in the food people chose and bought.",
      "Senior author Dr Gareth Hollands from University College London, said there was \"a small but potentially meaningful effect on people's food choices\" but \"we should not expect miracles\".",
      "He said calorie labelling \"may have a useful role\" alongside other measures, such as taxes on food and drinks, marketing restrictions and reformulation - making manufacturers adjust recipes for food products to make them healthier.",
      "Dr Natasha Clarke of Bath Spa University, who began the project at the University of Cambridge, says the evidence is \"robust\".",

      "The two maternity units at the Leeds Teaching Hospitals (LTH) NHS Trust are rated \"good\" by England's healthcare regulator, but two whistleblowers have told the BBC they believe the units are unsafe.",
      "Separate data shows Leeds has the highest neonatal mortality rate in the UK.",
      "Bereaved parents say they are concerned that the trust's chief executive during the period most of the deaths occurred is now leading the regulator, saying this could affect its independence in investigating LTH Trust.",
      "In a statement, the trust told the BBC the vast majority of births at Leeds were safe, and deaths of mothers and babies were fortunately very rare.",
      "It added that Leeds cares for a higher volume of babies with complex conditions as it is one of a \"handful of specialist centres\" in the UK.",
      "The trust's maternity units are at Leeds General Infirmary and St James's University Hospital.",
      "The families describe a \"tick box\" and \"wait and see\" culture at the trust, plus a lack of compassionate care.",
      "This has been echoed by whistleblower Lisa Elliott, who worked at the two sites in 2023. Describing the care as \"appalling\", she highlighted a failure to listen to patients. \"That's when disasters happen, and a lot of them can be avoided,\" she said.",
      "The families are calling for an independent review into LTH Trust to ensure issues are identified and lessons learned. They also want an independent, judge-led public inquiry to help improve maternity safety across England because of wider concerns about the standard of care.",
      "The BBC obtained data from the trust showing potentially preventable baby deaths through a Freedom of Information request.",
      "This revealed at least 56 cases from January 2019 to July 2024, made up of 27 stillbirths and 29 neonatal deaths - which is a death within 28 days after birth.",
      "In each case, a trust review group had identified care issues it considered may have made a difference to the outcome for babies.",
      "The trust-led reviews were conducted by multidisciplinary teams which regularly included people who did not work for the trust.",
      "The trust also recorded two possibly preventable maternal deaths in the same period.",
      "It did not give any personal details about the 58 deaths, so we do not know whether they include the families we have spoken to.",
      "The deaths reviewed by the trust included babies with congenital abnormalities, and newborns and mothers transferred after birth from other units because they required specialist care.",
      "The trust said the number of neonatal deaths it had recorded as potentially avoidable was \"very small\".",
      "Warning: This article contains images that some may find distressing",
      "LTH had the highest neonatal mortality rate in the UK of 4.46 per 1,000 live births in 2022, according to the latest report by MBRRACE-UK - which reviews stillbirths and neonatal deaths but does not analyse if any of these are potentially preventable.",
      "BBC analysis of this data, which was made public last July, shows this increased from 3.30 per 1,000 live births in 2017.",
      "The LTH 2022 figure is 70% higher than the average rate for comparable NHS trusts.",
      "MBRRACE-UK grouped Leeds with 25 other trusts which it says provide a similar level of care. Specifically, they all have a level three (the highest level) neonatal intensive care unit and perform neonatal surgery. The group is complex, with different specialisms.",
      "LTH told the BBC there are an increasing number of complex pregnancies and births in the region - including an increase in babies born with severe cardiac conditions - leading to an increase in the neonatal mortality rate.",
      "Fiona Winser-Ramm and Dan Ramm's first baby, Aliona Grace, died at Leeds General Infirmary in January 2020, 27 minutes after she was born.",

      "\"Leeds say they've learned lessons, it won't happen again. But it does, and babies keep dying, or being seriously injured, for similar reasons,\" says Dan.",

      "Details of advice and support with child bereavement are available at BBC Action Line",
      "Fiona and Dan also believe the regulator - the Care Quality Commission (CQC) has failed to hold the trust accountable, despite other preventable baby deaths.",
      "The CQC inspects the quality of services across health and adult social care in England and can prosecute providers who fail to provide safe care.",
      "The couple first raised their safety concerns with the body in November 2020. They say the regulator is not fit for purpose.",
      "They are taking legal action against LTH Trust, but also want the CQC to prosecute it for its care failures.",
      "Fiona and Dan don't think any future CQC investigation into Leeds could be independent with the trust's former chief executive in charge of the regulator.",
      "Sir Julian Hartley led the trust for 10 years, until January 2023, and was in post when Aliona died. He took over the CQC in December 2024.",
      "\"There's a huge conflict of interest,\" says Dan.",
      "We approached the CQC and Sir Julian for comment and the regulator replied on behalf of both saying it was independent, with \"robust policies in place to manage any conflict of interest\".",
      "It says there are currently no criminal investigations into Leeds maternity services, but it has been in contact with families and is looking into four incidents for evidence for any future legal action.",
      "Among the bereaved parents are Amarjit Kaur and Mandip Singh Matharoo, who were expecting their first child to arrive last February.",
      "When Amarjit was 32 weeks pregnant, she went to Leeds General Infirmary's maternity unit twice within 24 hours with severe abdominal pain. She says she was told she was experiencing ligament pain in her torso and was sent home each time with paracetamol.",
      "A few days later, Amarjit underwent emergency surgery and she says a massive blood clot was found, exactly where she had described being in pain.",
      "Her daughter, Asees, was stillborn on 6 January 2024. The couple believe she would have survived if her mother had not been sent home earlier.",
      "\"It's been the hardest year of my life,\" Amarjit says.",
      "A review led by the trust of Amarjit's care identified issues it considered may have made a difference to the baby's outcome.",
      "Black mothers are nearly three times more likely to die than their white counterparts (35.1 per 100,000 maternities), with Asian women nearly twice as likely (20.16 per 100,000 maternities), latest UK figures from MBRRACE-UK show.",
      "Last year, 15.7% of registrable births at LTH were recorded as Asian and 11.8% were black.",
      "Amarjit believes she was treated differently because of her Indian ethnicity.",
      "During her first visit, she says she overheard a white woman being told by midwives that she could \"stay as long as you want\" because of her pain - but Amarjit was sent home.",
      "\"The only difference between me and her was the colour of my skin,\" she says. \"But I was in so much pain I couldn't move.\"",
      "The trust's review of Amarjit's care said \"the concerns about institutional racism have been taken seriously\" and escalated to senior management.",
      "The two whistleblowers have described unsafe care while working at both of the units.",
      "One experienced clinical staff member, currently at Leeds and who has asked to remain anonymous, told us the service is \"completely broken\" with chronic understaffing, with the impact being that \"women and babies are not getting the care we want them to get\".",
      "These concerns are echoed by a former temporary staff member, Lisa Elliott, who says she saw \"chaotic\" care when she worked approximately 40 shifts as a maternity support worker during 2023. While in this role, supporting midwives in their care of women, she says she witnessed \"rude\" treatment of patients by staff who showed a lack of empathy.",
      "Lisa, who says she began working shifts in the hospitals in 2020, says she was present for a CQC inspection in 2024, but does not think maternity services should be rated \"good\". She says she flagged concerns about staff attitudes at the time, but they were not \"taken into account properly\".",
      "Prof Phil Wood, chief executive of Leeds Teaching Hospitals told the BBC the trust wished to apologise to the women and families who had shared their negative experiences.",

    "story": [
      "Country music singer Lisa McHugh has told how her baby daughter spent 10 \"horrendous\" days in hospital after contracting respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).",
      "RSV is a common, but highly infectious, respiratory virus that affects the breathing system, particularly in young children and older adults.",
      "\"You feel so helpless, and it's the most horrible feeling for a parent to go through, to not be able to fix what's going on or help,\" said Ms McHugh.",
      "According to the Public Health Agency in Northern Ireland, there have been more than 1,000 cases of RSV in infants under the age of one since 30 September 2024.",
      "About two thirds of the infants have been hospitalised.",
      "An RSV vaccine has been available to pregnant women in Northern Ireland since last September and is offered from 28 weeks into pregnancy.",
      "'My baby was tube fed'",
      "In November 2024, Lisa McHugh's then four-month-old daughter Hallie caught a cold.",
      "Her GP told her to monitor Hallie's symptoms and if the baby was feeding well, was having wet nappies and her temperature was okay, she could manage her at home.",
      "But Hallie's condition deteriorated and she ended up in South West Acute Hospital (SWAH).",
      "She was diagnosed with RSV.",
      "\"From that moment on, it was all a blur and it's still something I don't think I've fully processed,\" said Ms McHugh.",
      "The County Fermanagh-based singer said her daughter had to be tube fed.",
      "\"She had to then go on oxygen, because her oxygen levels were declining below the threshold that they needed to be for her to be doing it on her own.",
      "\"Within days, she just had really declined. It was absolutely horrendous to see your baby lying there, being so helpless.",
      "\"It's horrible because you can't do anything for them, even though you're trying to.",
      "\"I just knew that I wanted to be in the best place for her, and being at home wasn't the safest place,\" she said.",

      "\"Hallie was very, very sick with it, but it could have been also a lot worse,\" she said.",
      "What is RSV?",
      "Respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, is one of the common viruses which cause coughs and colds.",
      "Dr Nicholas Lipscomb, a consultant paediatrician in SWAH, said RSV is a seasonal infection and they see a lot of patients between November and February every year, but this winter has been particularly bad.",
      "He said while most babies and children do not need hospital treatment, the younger the child, the more likely it is for them to need hospitalisation, particularly if they are struggling to breathe and feed.",
      "\"For a very young baby, particularly an ex-premature baby, or baby who maybe has an underlying heart issue, it can be very dangerous,\" he said.",
      "\"For the majority of babies, it's just an unpleasant illness. But for those particularly at risk it can be potentially fatal,\" he said.",
      "Ms McHugh, who is originally from Glasgow, said a vaccine was not available to her before she gave birth.",
      "\"Had it been something that was offered to me at the time, knowing what I know now and what we've been through, I would 100% take it myself,\" she said.",
      "Adults aged from 75-79 years of age are also be offered the vaccine, as they can be vulnerable to the virus.",
      "How to stop RSV spreading",
      "Hallie caught RSV again just four weeks after being discharged from hospital.",
      "\"Thankfully, we were more prepared this time. We knew what to watch out for. We knew how to treat her. And thankfully, her symptoms weren't as bad ,\" she said.",
      "The baby was kept in hospital for a day, but got home for Christmas. Now six months old, she is doing well.",
      "\"Her immune system is just very, very low, and it probably will be for quite some time, until we build it back up again.",

      "She is urging parents to be more aware of RSV and not to be afraid of speaking up to protect your baby.",

    "title": "Rise of vaccine distrust - why more of us are questioning jabs",
    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 00:01:55 GMT",
    "summary": "Confidence in all types of vaccination has taken a hit. The question is why, and what can be done about it?",
    "story": [
      "Covid vaccines saved lives. Lots of them. Research by the World Health Organization (WHO) now puts the number at 475,000 in the UK with many more kept out of hospital or off a ventilator.",
      "The jabs were a \"scientific miracle\" we were told at the time, our best hope of life returning to normal after months of lockdown restrictions. But something has happened in the years since. Research suggests confidence in all types of vaccination has taken a significant hit.",
      "\"It's the great paradox of the pandemic,\" says Dr Simon Williams, a public health researcher at Swansea University.",
      "\"One of the most successful innovations in public health history, the rapid development of Covid vaccines, has actually had the effect of reducing public confidence in vaccination.\"",
      "In 2023 around 70% of UK adults said that vaccinations were safe and effective, down sharply from 90% in 2018, according to research from the Vaccine Confidence Project, run by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM).",
      "This is very much part of a worldwide trend with 52 of the 55 countries polled seeing a drop in confidence since 2019.",
      "And regular polling carried out by YouGov suggests adults are increasingly likely to say that vaccines have harmful side effects that are not being disclosed to the public. The proportion saying that statement is \"probably\" or \"definitely\" true rose to 30% in 2024 from 19% in 2019.",
      "At the same time, childhood vaccination rates have fallen further below recommended levels over the last five years, continuing a longer-term trend.",
      "\"Vaccines are always our best defence against infectious, communicable diseases,\" adds Dr Williams. \"A few percentage drops in the proportion of children covered can make a real difference.\"",
      "So why is there increased distrust in vaccination - and can anything be done to change that?",
      "The sudden 'sea change' in attitudes",
      "The long-running Covid inquiry has already looked at pandemic planning and the impact on the NHS. This week, though, it opened hearings into the vaccine rollout across the UK, from take-up of the jabs, to their safety, to the way they were marketed to the public.",
      "Dr Helen Wall, a GP from Bolton, saw the shift in vaccines attitudes over the pandemic first-hand.",
      "In May 2021 the town became the centre of national attention; Covid infections  more than quadrupled in three weeks driven by the new Delta variant. A huge vaccine drive was ordered with army medics staffing mobile units. Dr Wall led the rollout, as clinical director of the local NHS commissioning board.",
      "\"People were coming out and making tea and coffee for people in the line,\" she says. \"There was this real feeling of camaraderie.\"",
      "But around the middle of 2021, she noticed a sudden \"sea change\" in attitudes.",
      "\"Patients would start to say to me, 'why should I trust you, you work for them, you're being paid by them, you're part of the government'.",
      "\"We very quickly went from being lifesavers to just another part of the system that no-one trusted in some spheres.\"",
      "Before long, protestors appeared outside local clinics with placards trying to convince people not get jabbed, and Dr Wall says that she received death threats.",
      "Nearly four years on, she reflects: \"I think what Covid has done is amplified a confidence issue that was already there and ramped up some of the doubts and question-marks for people.\"",
      "From smallpox to MMR",
      "But vaccine hesitancy certainly did not start with the pandemic. The current wave of scepticism is the latest rekindling of an angry debate going back to the dawn of vaccination in 1796 when Edward Jenner created the smallpox vaccine.",
      "In the 1890s huge crowds protested in Leicester against mandatory smallpox vaccinations. Then in the 1970s the diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough jab was linked to brain injury in children, before later being found safe.",
      "In 1998 British doctor Andrew Wakefield published his now infamous research paper falsely claiming the combined measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine was responsible for rising rates of autism in children.",
      "Wakefield's research, described as the most damaging scientific fraud of all time, has since been thoroughly discredited and he was struck off the doctors' register.",
      "But the damage was done. The number of measles cases in England and Wales jumped to 2,032 in 2012 from just 56 in 1998. It took more than a decade for MMR uptake to return to anything like normal and that debunked link with autism still gets repeated today.",
      "It was the first serious medical scandal of the internet era and also a sign of things to come.",
      "Internet age and misinformation",
      "Since the birth of social media in the early 2000s, with sites like Friendster and MySpace, there have been growing concerns about the spread of health rumours and misinformation.",
      "Research from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) found 20% of parents surveyed in 2023 said they had come across information online that made them worried about vaccines, a sharp jump from just 6% the year before.",
      "As social media sites have gone from niche start-ups to established parts of the media landscape, so the risk of misinformation has changed.",
      "\"Now somebody in one corner of the world can post something and suddenly millions of people in another part of the world can see it within seconds,\" says Dr Williams at Swansea University.",
      "\"It's not just the speed but the reach of misinformation which puts us in completely uncharted territory.\"",
      "Where young people stand",
      "Research has consistently shown that younger adults are the group most likely to use social media to make decisions about their personal health, and the most vulnerable to misinformation.",
      "Lockdowns and other restrictions also meant many of those in their late teens and twenties lost out on education, on early job opportunities and on full social lives in the pandemic. At the same time they were far less likely than older groups to fall seriously ill after catching the virus.",
      "\"They were the ones who felt like they paid the price for what was primarily an older person's problem,\" says Prof Heidi Larson, a former head of global immunisation communication at UNICEF and the director of the Vaccine Confidence Project at LSHTM.",
      "The data suggests younger groups have also seen the biggest falls in vaccine confidence over the last four years, something she says is the \"most concerning\" part of her research.",
      "The proportion of 18-24-year-olds, for example, who say that vaccines are safe and effective has fallen to under 60% in 2023 from 80% in 2019.",
      "\"They should really be the priority, because these are potential young parents and if they are questioning the importance of vaccines, then we are in trouble,\" says Prof Larson, who is giving expert evidence to the Covid inquiry this week.",
      "\"We have to recognise that this is about the whole experience of Covid, and all the controls and pressures. It's like, 'Enough of being told what to do, I just don't want your vaccines anymore'.\"",
      "Speed and safety concerns",
      "The speed at which new Covid vaccines had to be developed has also been at the centre of some of the rumour, concern and distrust there is online.",
      "The data now shows the jabs did their main job \u2013 helping our bodies clear the virus and cutting the risk of severe disease, hospitalisation and death.",
      "In early clinical trials though the vaccines were also said to be effective \u2013 90% so in the case of the Pfizer jab \u2013 at preventing Covid in the first place. In real world use, that protection against infection and transmission faded within months, as immunity \"waned \" and the virus mutated into different variants.",
      "Crucially though protection against severe disease has proved far more long-lasting.",
      "Then there were safety concerns.",
      "The AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines were linked to a rare, but serious, blood clot in the brain and their use was restricted to certain groups.",
      "The Pfizer and Moderna jabs, meanwhile, have been linked to rare cases of heart inflammation, which usually clear up without long-term damage.",
      "The reality is every vaccine, like any medical treatment, always carries a small level of risk, some more than others.",
      "\"The science and public health perspective is quite clear: not only were Covid vaccines safe and effective, but we would have been in a very different world if they hadn't been rolled out so quickly,\" says Dr Williams at Swansea University.",
      "\"[But] we're in this complicated, murky world with public attitudes where some people thought they weren't what was promised.\"",
      "Vaccine fatigue and 'complacency'",
      "Many people in the UK no longer have direct experience of how dangerous viruses such as measles can be.",
      "The UKHSA says it's been seriously concerned for some time about falling childhood vaccination rates.",
      "The organisation's director of public health programmes, Dr Mary Ramsay, believes that trend, which started in the decade before Covid, is more likely to be driven by complacency than a drop in confidence in the childhood vaccination programme.",
      "Modern lives are also busy and finding time to take a child to a GP for a series of jabs is not always straightforward, she suggests.",
      "In 2024 the number of children receiving a first dose of the MMR vaccine fell to 88.9% in England, the lowest level for 14 years and over the last year we've seen significant measles outbreaks in London, Birmingham and Bristol.",
      "A high level of measles vaccination is vital as it prevents transmission of the virus and protects not just those who receive the jab, but those who can't \u2013 young babies and children with weakened immune systems, for example.",
      "Dr Wall, now clinical director of population health in Greater Manchester, also thinks there might be an element of \"vaccine fatigue\" creeping in since the pandemic, with even some NHS staff left \"tired, jaded and fed-up\" after years of vaccines, boosters, rules and restrictions.",
      "Figures from NHS England, for example, show the number of frontline healthcare workers getting their flu vaccine fell to 35% in November 2024 from 62% in the same month in 2019.",
      "In late 2021, the government brought in a policy of mandatory Covid vaccines for care home staff in England, and later tried to extend that to NHS workers. At times the public were also told they needed Covid jabs (or a recent negative test) to travel abroad, to enter nightclubs and to visit cinemas in parts of the UK.",
      "Those kinds of strict health policies might force up vaccination rates in the short-term, argues Prof Larson at LSHTM, but there's a danger we are now starting to pay a \"long term price\".",
      "The worry is if people feel forced or coerced into taking a vaccine at certain times, wider vaccine confidence and uptake may experience a backlash.",
      "Personal liberty versus state control",
      "For 200 years vaccination has been entangled with personal liberty, state control and other political issues. That's increasingly playing out online where the wider debate also takes in global warming, gun control and immigration, for example.",
      "\"It's 'the people' versus the political and financial elites, with medical and scientific experts seen as among those deemed elitist, speaking a different language and entwined with big business and pharma,\" says Prof Larson.",
      "Meanwhile, President Trump's controversial pick for US health secretary, Robert Kennedy Jr, has once again put vaccines firmly on the political agenda.",
      "In the past he has repeated the false claim that vaccines cause autism, urged parents not to jab their children, and had to apologise after claiming the number injured by vaccines was \"a holocaust\".",
      "He has denied on several occasions that he is anti-vaccination, instead saying he is \"pro-safety\".",
      "'We need to be more assertive'",
      "Dr Simon Williams at Swansea University now thinks health authorities have to be clearer about the dangers of some infectious diseases, in the face of online misinformation which often exaggerates the small risk of vaccines.",
      "\"Part of the reason tobacco control campaigns have been so effective since the 1980s was because they were so clear about how dangerous smoking is, and I think we can learn from that,\" he says.",
      "\"We need to be far more assertive about the potential risks of not getting vaccinated.\"",

      "Why wildfires are becoming faster and more furious",
      "How Canada's immigration debate soured - and helped seal Trudeau's fate",
      "Another idea is \"pre-bunking\" - that is teaching people to expect and recognise misinformation online before they encounter it in real life, instead of relying on fact-checking and dull public health videos after the event.",
      "Prof Heidi Larson also thinks now is the time to target and better engage with those most at-risk of rejecting vaccines - in particular the younger groups that her data shows are most affected.",
      "\"I would start in schools, I would start in science classes, I think we are losing the plot if we only focus on disinformation, and don't start to build an appreciation of how vaccines work and their benefits,\" she says.",

      "This is the Inquiry's fourth module, which will consider issues relating to the development of Covid-19 vaccines and their implementation.",
      "Mrs Scott, whose husband Jamie was left severely disabled by a vaccine, said: \"We are an uncomfortable truth, but we are a truth and the truth is for everyone in our group - the vaccine caused serious harm and death.\"",

      "Peter Rossiter was a highly talented, classical pianist who brought music to life while head of music in a school, Jean told the inquiry.",
      "However, despite being a key worker, he only received his first vaccine in May 2021 - five months after the first jab was given in the UK.",
      "That summer he was infected with Covid and became seriously ill, was admitted to intensive care in hospital but died on 11 August 2021.",

      "Calling people obese is medically \"flawed\" - and the definition should be split into two, a report from global experts says.",
      "The term \"clinical obesity\" should be used for patients with a medical condition caused by their weight, while \"pre-clinically obese\" should be applied to those remaining fat but fit, although at risk of disease.",
      "This is better for patients than relying only on body mass index (BMI) - which measures whether they are a healthy weight for their height - to determine obesity.",
      "More than a billion people are estimated to be living with obesity worldwide and prescription weight-loss drugs are in high demand.",
      "The report, published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology journal, is supported by more than 50 medical experts around the world.",
      "\"Some individuals with obesity can maintain normal organ function and overall health, even long term, whereas others display signs and symptoms of severe illness here and now,\" Prof Francesco Rubino, from King's College London, who chaired the expert group, said.",
      "\"Obesity is a spectrum,\" he added.",
      "The current, blanket definition means too many people are being diagnosed as obese but not receiving the most appropriate care, the report says.",
      "'I feel blessed to get weight-loss jab' - but can the NHS afford it for all?",
      "How do weight loss drugs like Mounjaro and Wegovy work?",
      "Natalie, from Crewe, goes to the gym four times a week and has a healthy diet, but is still overweight.",
      "\"I would consider myself on the larger side, but I'm fit,\" she told the BBC 5 Live phone-in with Nicky Campbell.",

      "\"I'm doing everything I can to stay fit and have a long healthy life,\" she said.",
      "Richard, from Falmouth, said there is a lot of confusion around BMI.",

      "In Mike's opinion, you cannot be fat and fit - he says it is all down to diet.",
      "\"All these skinny jabs make me laugh, if you want to lose weight stop eating - it's easy.\"",
      "Currently, in many countries, obesity is defined as having a BMI over 30 - a measurement that estimates body fat based on height and weight.",
      "How is BMI calculated?",
      "It is calculated by dividing an adult's weight in kilograms by their height in metres squared.",
      "For example, if they are 70kg (about 11 stone) and 1.70m (about 5ft 7in):",
      "square their height in metres: 1.70 x 1.70 = 2.89divide their weight in kilograms by this amount: 70 \u00f7 2.89 = 24.22display the result to one decimal place: 24.2",

      "But BMI has limitations.",
      "It measures whether someone is carrying too much weight - but not too much fat.",
      "So very muscular people, such as athletes, tend to have a high BMI but not much fat.",
      "The report says BMI is useful on a large scale, to work out the proportion of a population who are a healthy weight, overweight or obese.",
      "But it reveals nothing about an individual patient's overall health, whether they have heart problems or other illnesses, for example, and fails to distinguish between different types of body fat or measure the more dangerous fat around the waist and organs.",
      "Measuring a patient's waist or the amount of fat in their body, along with a detailed medical history, can give a much clearer picture than BMI, the report says.",
      "\"Obesity is a health risk - the difference is it's also an illness for some,\" Prof Rubino said.",
      "What are the two groups?",
      "Clinically obese",
      "When obesity is a disease, there will be signs of it affecting organs in the body - through heart disease, breathlessness, type 2 diabetes or joint pain - and a person's day-to-day activities. Treatment with drugs or surgery is likely.",
      "Pre-clinically obese",
      "When obesity is a risk to health - but not yet causing any illnesses, people should be offered weight-loss advice, counselling and monitoring, to reduce the chances of health problems developing.",
      "Doctors should also pay close attention to a patient's family history to see if they are at risk of particular diseases.",
      "At a time when drugs that reduce body weight by up to 20% are being prescribed on a large scale, the report says redefining obesity \"is all the more relevant\" because it \"improves the accuracy of diagnosis\".",
      "Access to weight-loss drugs such as Wegovy and Mounjaro is often restricted to patients with a BMI over 30 and a weight-related health condition.",
      "Children's obesity expert Prof Louise Baur, from the University of Sydney, who contributed to the report, said the new approach would allow adults and children with obesity \"to receive more appropriate care\", while reducing the numbers being over-diagnosed and given unnecessary treatment.",
      "The Royal College of Physicians said the report laid a strong foundation \"for treating obesity with the same medical rigour and compassion as other chronic illnesses\".",

      "The report describes sick leave as an \"inappropriate and inadequate\" way of supporting staff through baby loss, and points out that the low rate of statutory sick pay means some people cannot afford to take the time off that they need.",
      "Kath Abrahams, chief executive of Tommy's, the pregnancy and baby charity, said she hoped the government would move quickly to change the law.",
      "\"For too many women, the psychological and physical impact of pregnancy loss is compounded by pressure to return to work immediately and a lack of time to grieve,\" she said.",
      "\"It is unacceptable that sickness absence often remains the only option, potentially leaving women and their partners financially vulnerable,\" she added.",

      "The appointment of Lord Mandelson, who is best-known as a New Labour spin doctor and minister under Tony Blair, is the first time in 50 years that a PM has selected a politician rather than a diplomat for the role, which Jones said was \"because we want to do things differently\".",
      "Asked about the Labour Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, warning of \"resurgent fascism\" ahead of Trump's inauguration, Jones strongly disagreed, insisting the UK government respected Trump's democratic mandate, adding: \"I speak on behalf of the government and we don't agree with it\".",
      "A much less rosy view of the \"special relationship\" was painted by Farage, a long-time supporter of Trump, whose offer of acting as a go-between in negotiations with the president-elect has so far been rejected by the government.",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio 4's The Westminster Hour, the Reform UK leader said the government needs to \"think outside the box\" when dealing with the Trump administration, and that all evidence - including Lord Mandelson's appointment - suggests they are not doing that.",
      "\"I think what this government does, is what all governments do - they stick with the established, status quo methods of appointing people,\" he said.",
      "Farage said he feared the UK would squander \"an amazing opportunity\" to get away from tariffs and negotiate free trade deals due to the prime minister's refusal to choose the US over the EU.",
      "\"This guy [Trump] does business differently to anybody else we've seen in global politics before,\" he said. \"They don't think they need me - but they might find in short order that maybe they do.",
      "\"If we have a deteriorating relationship with America that does hurt us financially, it'll be the Labour government's fault,\" adding that Trump is \"probably more Eurosceptic\" than he is.",
      "'Blind faith'",
      "The fact the UK still does not have a free trade deal with the US, despite this being a priority in Boris Johnson's Conservative manifesto in 2019, has been criticised by the party's current leader Kemi Badenoch, who said leaving the EU without a growth plan was  \"a mistake\".",
      "Shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel, a prominent voice in the Vote Leave Brexit campaign, was questioned about Badenoch's comments by Kuenssberg after she urged swift action to agree a UK-US trade deal.",
      "Patel, who was Johnson's home secretary, said there had been plans to legislate around starting the Brexit process - but she acknowledged a lack of plans for what to do afterwards to rebuild economic relationships.",
      "She said: \"In terms of long-term sustainable proposals Kemi's right to recognise that clearly wider plans needed to be put in place.\"",
      "Responding to Patel, the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Calum Miller claimed the Conservatives were now competing with Reform UK to be \"the most submissive with Trump\" - but the UK should not put \"blind faith\" in the new administration.",
      "He said: \"[Priti Patel's] desire to rush into a free trade deal between the UK and US - one that could sell British farmers and food standards down the river - reminds us of where her and her party's true alliances lie: with the Mar-a-Lago clan, not with constituents here in Britain.\""

    "story": [
      "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has upgraded its growth forecast for the UK economy this year, but has also warned about the possible impact of Donald Trump's economic plans.",
      "The global institution upgraded its prediction for UK growth to 1.6% for this year from its previous estimate of 1.5%.",
      "But it said a threatened wave of tariffs by incoming US president Trump could make trade tensions worse, lower investment, and disrupt supply chains across the world.",
      "The IMF also said although tariffs, tax cuts and deregulation could boost the US economy in the short term, they could ultimately backfire.",
      "The prospect of higher taxes being introduced on imports to the US is concerning many world leaders because they will make it more expensive for companies to sell their goods in the world's biggest economy.",
      "Tariffs are a central part of Trump's economic vision - he sees them as a way of growing the US economy, protecting jobs and raising tax revenue - and has threatened to issue tariffs against China, Canada and Mexico on day one of his presidency next week.",
      "He has also said he would impose 100% tariffs on the BRICS bloc of nine nations if they were to create a rival currency to the US dollar.",
      "The IMF said such policies could set the scene for an inflationary boom followed by a bust and could weaken US Treasury bonds as a safe bet.",
      "As well as upgrading its outlook for the UK, the IMF suggested the UK economy would perform better than European economies such as Germany, France and Italy over the next two years.",
      "The improved forecast could be a boost for Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who has faced pressure over her policy decisions this week, after figures showed the economy had flatlined.",

      "Its 2025 forecast was largely unchanged from a previous one, mainly because it expects higher US growth than previously predicted to offset lower growth in other major economies.",
      "The imminent arrival of Trump in the White House dominates the section on risks in the IMF's twice-yearly forecast for the world economy.",
      "When he was last in power, Trump launched into a trade war with China, and US policy led to tit-for-tat tariffs with the EU.",
      "This time round, Trump has proposed a 10% tariff on global imports, a 25% duty on imports from Canada and Mexico, and a 60% tariff on Chinese goods.",
      "It warns that an inflationary US boom could be followed by a possible bust that would potentially \"weaken the role of US Treasuries as the global safe asset\".",
      "Investors see US Treasury securities as one of the safest possible bets, because the bonds - which are kind of like an IOU -  are backed by the US government.",
      "In addition, if red tape on business is cut too much, this could lead to a runaway dollar that could suck money out of emerging economies, depressing global growth.",
      "Trump going ahead with deportations of illegal immigrants could \"permanently reduce potential output\" and also raise inflation, The IMF said.",

      "Speaking on LBC Radio, she said the UK had a poor record in prioritising assistance to those who need it the most.",
      "Her comments, in response to a question about the state pension, led other parties to accuse her of wanting to water down the \"triple lock\" uprating policy.",
      "A Tory spokesman denied this was on the cards, accusing Labour and the Liberal Democrats of misrepresenting her.",
      "He added that the party would \"look at means testing\" - but did not specify which benefits would be in scope.",
      "How much is the state pension going up?",

      "She added that \"serious thinking\" was required to address the financial impact of more government spending \"on later life\".",
      "Asked whether this included the \"triple lock\" policy - under which state pension payments go up every year by the highest of inflation, average earnings or 2.5% - she replied: \"That's exactly the sort of thing that the policy work we are going to be doing will look at\".",
      "But pressed on whether her party would really look at the \"triple lock\", she then added: \"No, we are going to look at means-testing\".",

      "However, the party has yet to clarify which benefits it would consider subjecting to means-testing, when the level of support is linked in some way to a claimant's income or wealth.",
      "Current benefits paid in this way include housing benefit, Universal Credit and pension credit, a top-up paid to poorer pensioners.",
      "Speaking later on Sky News, Tory co-chair Nigel Huddleston did not clarify the party's position either, but said it wanted to look at a \"whole bunch of policy areas\".",
      "It is not the first time Badenoch has been embroiled in a row over comments made during media appearances.",

      "'Unsustainable'",
      "Originally a Lib Dem manifesto commitment in the 2010 general election, the state pension triple lock was embraced by the Conservatives when the two parties entered office as a coalition government.",
      "It has since has been in place ever since, save for a temporary suspension during the Covid pandemic, and has also been adopted by Labour.",
      "At the last election, Rishi Sunak pledged to strengthen the uprating policy further by applying it to pensioners' income tax thresholds too.",
      "However some economists have questioned whether the policy is financially sustainable given increasing life expectancy. Others have questioned whether it is fair, given working-age benefits do not increase in the same way.",

    "story": [
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has announced plans for a nationwide review of grooming gang evidence and five government-backed local inquiries.",
      "She stopped short of launching a statutory national inquiry, as called for by the Conservatives and some Labour MPs, but this marks a clear shift in the government's position.",
      "Cooper said top lawyer Tom Crowther, who led an inquiry in Telford, would help Oldham and four other pilot areas yet to be named, develop their own reviews.",
      "She also announced a \"rapid\" three month national audit headed by veteran government trouble-shooter Baroness Louise Casey to examine the demographics of the gangs and their victims, as well as \"cultural drivers\" behind the offending.",
      "Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp said the plan was \"wholly inadequate\" and repeated his call for a full national inquiry.",
      "He expressed concern that the local inquiries would not have the powers to compel witnesses to attend and give evidence under oath.",
      "The issue had recently been thrust into the spotlight by tech billionaire Elon Musk, who has criticised the prime minister for not calling a national inquiry.",
      "Mr Musk responded to Cooper's announcement by saying on his X platform: \"I hope this is a proper investigation\". He added: \"This is a step in the right direction, but the results will speak for themselves.\"",
      "Why some want a new Oldham grooming gang inquiry",
      "Starmer attacks those 'spreading lies' on grooming gangs",
      "The 20 child abuse inquiry proposals - what has happened so far?",
      "The row between Mr Musk and Starmer centred on high-profile cases where groups of men - mainly of Pakistani descent - were convicted of sexually abusing and raping predominantly young white girls in towns such as Rotherham and Rochdale.",
      "An independent report, published by Prof Alexis Jay in 2014, estimated 1,400 girls had been abused in Rotherham. She would later go on to lead a national review into child sexual abuse, which lasted seven years and made 20 recommendations when it was published in 2022.",
      "In recent days three Labour MPs publicly expressed support for a national inquiry - Dan Carden, Rotherham MP Sarah Champion, and Rochdale MP Paul Waugh.",
      "Other senior Labour figures, including Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham, also joined the calls, saying they would support a limited new inquiry.",
      "Prof Jay rejected calls for a new national inquiry last week, saying victims want to see action on her recommendations and a new inquiry would cause delays.",
      "The prime minister and Labour ministers had said their priority was to implement the Jay recommendations, and Cooper announced that one of the key points - mandatory reporting - would be added to the Crime and Policing Bill.",
      "In a statement in the House of Commons, Cooper said that despite Prof Jay's report and other inquiries, \"shamefully little progress had been made\".",
      "\"That has got to change,\" she said and added that by Easter, the government would set out a \"clear timetable\" for implementing the Jay report's recommendations.",
      "Cooper argued that \"effective local inquiries can delve into far more local detail and deliver more locally relevant answers, and change, than a lengthy nationwide inquiry can provide\"",
      "She said Tom Crowther, who led an inquiry in Telford, would help the government develop a new framework for \"victim-centred locally-led inquiries where they are needed\".",
      "She said this would begin by working with Oldham Council and up to four other pilot areas, with \u00a35m of an overall \u00a310m package being put up to \"get work off the ground\".",
      "Champion pressed the home secretary on whether the inquires would be able to summon witnesses to give evidence.",
      "\"What we need to do is make sure there have been no cover-ups, and it's only if it's on a statutory footing that we can do that,\" she said.",
      "Cooper replied that different approaches could be taken and the government would work with local mayors and local councils to \"make sure that we can strengthen the accountability arrangements\".",
      "She said this included introducing a \"duty of candour\" which requires public servants to tell the truth.",
      "The separate audit looking at the ethnicity of grooming gangs and their victims will be led by Baroness Casey, who previously led the 2015 review of Rotherham Council.",
      "The crossbench peer has already been appointed to lead a commission into social care, but Downing Street insisted the two pieces of work would not clash, saying her work on grooming gangs would be finished by the start of April.",
      "In her statement, Cooper also announced she would be asking chief constables in England and Wales to re-examine historic gang exploitation cases and re-open investigations \"were appropriate\". This would be backed by \u00a32.5m of funding, she said.",
      "More victims of child sexual abuse and exploitation will be able to seek an independent review of their cases, the government has said.",
      "'We've been fighting for this'",
      "On the same day Cooper was delivering her statement, BBC News spent time with four survivors of historic sex abuse in Oldham.",
      "They had travelled to Birmingham to meet Jess Phillips, the government minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girls.",
      "Listening to Cooper's statement, \"Sarah\" and \"Amelia\" exchanged a hug.",
      "\"We've been fighting for this,\" they said through tears.",
      "After spending time with Phillips, Amelia said: \"I feel like the weight of the world has been lifted off my shoulders. I'm satisfied for now but actions speak louder than words.\"",
      "But survivors \"Sam\" and \"Jane\" were not satisfied and said they did not feel they had been listened to.",
      "\"We want a government inquiry into Oldham and into other towns,\" Sam told the BBC.",
      "\"We know what is right and what is wrong. We know that a government-led inquiry differs from a council-led inquiry.\"",
      "The women expressed their frustration that the government decision for Thursday's announcement was already made before their meeting had taken place.",
      "\"It's not just us being let down,\" Jane explained. \"We're survivors, we've been through what we've been through.",
      "\"It's the children now and other people going through it, we don't want them to be let down.",

      "Badenoch has not named who she holds responsible, but in her speech said: \"We announced that we would leave the European Union before we had a plan for growth outside the EU.",
      "\"We made it the law that we would deliver net zero carbon emissions by 2050. And only then did we start thinking about how we would do that.",
      "\"We announced that we would lower immigration, but immigration kept going up.",

      "As opposition leader, Sir Keir Starmer pledged there would be \"no more revolving doors between government and the companies they regulate\" under Labour.",

    "story": [
      "The UK economy returned to growth for the first time in three months, but the expansion was less than expected.",
      "The 0.1% uptick in November was driven by trade for pubs, restaurants and the construction industry, after it shrank in October and September.",
      "The figures come after recent turbulence in financial markets sent the UK's borrowing costs to the highest level for several years and the value of the pound down.",
      "But with tax rises coming into effect in April, the sluggish figures have fuelled further concerns that stagnant growth could persist in the UK for some time.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who has been under pressure after the market turmoil threatened her economic plans, admitted the government had to \"do more to grow our economy\" as she reiterated her pledge to go \"further and faster\" to improve growth in order to boost living standards.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer added that growing the economy was \"always going to take time\", but said the return to growth in November was a \"step in the right direction\".",
      "November's economic figures were the first following Reeves's first Budget, in which she announced \u00a340bn worth of tax rises with hikes in the National Insurance rate and a reduction to the threshold for employers.",
      "How fast is the UK's economy growing?",
      "Why are prices rising in the UK?",
      "When will interest rates fall?",
      "Ahead of tax increases taking effect in April, businesses have repeatedly warned the extra costs they face, along with minimum wages rising and business rates relief being reduced, could impact the economy's ability to grow, with employers expecting to have less cash to give pay rises and create new jobs.",
      "In the three months to November, the economy is estimated to have shown no growth, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. It has only grown twice in the five months since Labour took office.",
      "Danni Hewson, AJ Bell head of financial analysis, said the bigger economic picture was one of an \"economy still stuck in the muck\", while Ben Jones, lead economist at the CBI business group which claims to represent 170,000 firms, said a \"mood of caution seems to have settled over UK businesses\".",
      "\"We've had a pretty gloomy start to this year,\" said Liz Martins, senior economist at HSBC. \"We're not in recession, but we're not doing much growing either.\"",
      "In a bid to turn the tide, Reeves will meet representatives from some of the country's biggest regulators later, including energy watchdog Ofgem and the Competitions and Markets Authority, to get ideas for growing the economy.",
      "Reeves is understood to have decided to meet them in-person rather than wait to read submissions, with a Treasury source describing the meeting as \"a kick up the backside\".",
      "The ONS said the construction and services sectors drove the marginal growth in November.",
      "Construction was led by new commercial developments, but Liz McKeown, director of economic statistics at ONS, said production continued to decline across several manufacturing industries and oil and gas extraction companies.",
      "\"Services grew a little, with wholesaling, pubs and restaurants and IT companies all doing well, partially offset by falls in accountancy and business rental and leasing,\" she added.",
      "The ONS publishes figures on the economy every month. However, quarterly figures - covering three months at a time - are considered more important.",
      "The pound fell following the data release, trading at $1.221, down 0.2% on the day. Long-term government borrowing costs remained stable.",
      "'Put the handbrake on'",
      "Adrian Haller, who runs the UK arm of Bruderer, a Swiss manufacturer that makes high speed presses, is preparing to open a new factory in Telford, Shropshire, after 10 years of planning.",
      "But he said the Budget \"put a dampener\" on the business, with some of his biggest customers more cautious after the rise in employer National Insurance contributions was announced.",
      "\"Consequently, they've reduced their interest in placing orders with companies like ours,\" he added.",
      "\"Everybody seems to have put the handbrake on,\" he said. \"All that I ask, is that the government listen to what we are trying to say, and the fact they've done too many changes too quickly - and it's making it difficult for us to survive.\"",
      "A growing economy usually means people are spending more, extra jobs are created, more tax is paid and workers get better pay rises.",
      "When the economy is shrinking, it can lead to businesses cutting back on investment and jobs.",
      "Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said tax hikes announced in the chancellor's October Budget and \"global uncertainty\" around Donald Trump's potential tariffs on trade with the US had \"dragged the economy into stagnation\".",
      "The weaker-than-expected growth figures fuelled further expectations that the Bank of England will cut interest rates at its next meeting in February from 4.75% to 4.5%, especially after UK inflation unexpectedly dipped in December.",
      "But Mr Wood said the outlook for 2025 was brighter than the figures were showing for 2024.",
      "He said despite the tax rises on businesses coming in April, the economy should get a boost from Reeves \"recycling increased taxes into even more spending\" in 2025."

    "story": [
      "If you were to produce a political heat map of the government right now, there is one big bit that would be bright red, and probably flashing: the Treasury.",
      "Firstly, there have been all of the headlines about the now former Economic Secretary to the Treasury, Tulip Siddiq.",
      "For all of the complexities and subtleties of this story, and there are plenty, the inescapable crux of it was something even the most polished public relations executive would struggle to add much gloss to.",
      "The minister responsible for the government's anti-corruption drive was named in a corruption investigation.",
      "Awkward.",
      "It is vital to stress Tulip Siddiq has always insisted she has done nothing wrong and the prime minister's independent adviser on ministerial standards concluded she had not broken the ministerial code.",
      "The investigation, by Bangladesh's Anti-Corruption Commission, is looking into claims Tulip Siddiq's family embezzled up to \u00a33.9bn.",
      "The now former minister's aunt Sheikh Hasina was the country's prime minister until she was deposed last year.",
      "In an interview with the Sunday Times at the weekend, her replacement, Muhammad Yunus, said that homes used by Tulip Siddiq in the UK should be handed back to his government if they had been gained through \"plain robbery.\"",
      "And what are the responsibilities of the economic secretary to the Treasury?",
      "Well, tackling economic crime, money laundering and illicit finance among other things.",
      "And remember, politics isn't a court of law, but a court of perceptions \u2013 where unanswered questions are dangerous because they amount to more headlines, however fair or otherwise that might be.",
      "The independent adviser, Sir Laurie Magnus, concluded that \"given the nature of Ms Siddiq's ministerial responsibilities... it is regrettable that she was not more alert to the potential reputational risks.\"",
      "And, he added: \"I would not advise that this shortcoming should be taken as a breach of the ministerial code, but you will want to consider her ongoing responsibilities in the light of this.\"",
      "Oh dear.",
      "And she is out, but this was a resignation with warmth on both sides with the prime minister suggesting publicly she could well serve as a minister again.",
      "Contrast that, incidentally, with the three-sentence missive he rattled off to Louise Haigh, when she resigned as transport secretary in November.",
      "Let's turn next to the Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who has also struggled to get herself out of the headlines.",
      "The prime minister has heaped praise on her and expressed a parliament's worth of confidence in her.",
      "The dip in inflation in the latest figures just published are better than the alternative for Rachel Reeves - albeit the rate at which prices are rising is still higher than the target the Bank of England aims for.",
      "But the soaring cost of government borrowing is a symptom of the markets collectively sounding unconvinced by the government's economic strategy.",
      "The chancellor has said \"the economic headwinds we face are a reminder that we must go further and faster to kick start economic growth that plunged under the last government\".",
      "What does that mean?",

    "story": [
      "Government borrowing costs have been steadily rising in recent months, and have now hit their highest levels for several years.",
      "Why is this happening and how does it affect you?",
      "What's happening in the bond markets?",
      "A bond is a bit like an IOU that can be traded in the financial markets.",
      "Governments generally spend more than they raise in tax so they borrow money to fill the gap, usually by selling bonds to investors.",
      "As well as eventually paying back the value of the bond, governments pay interest at regular intervals so investors receive a stream of future payments.",
      "UK government bonds - known as \"gilts\" - are normally considered very safe, with little risk the money will not be repaid. They are mainly bought by financial institutions, such as pension funds.",
      "Interest rates - known as the yield -  on government bonds have been going up since around August.",
      "The yield on a 10-year bond has surged to its highest level since 2008, while the yield on a 30-year bond is at its highest since 1998, meaning it costs the government more to borrow over the long term.",
      "The pound has also fallen in value against the dollar over the past few days. On 7 January it was worth $1.25 but it has now fallen to just above $1.21.",
      "Why are bond yields rising?",
      "Yields are rising not just in the UK. Borrowing costs have also been going up in the US, Japan, Germany and France, for instance.",
      "There is a great deal of uncertainty around what will happen when President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House later this month. He has pledged to bring in tariffs on goods entering the US and to cut taxes.",
      "Investors worry that this will lead to inflation being more persistent than previously thought and therefore interest rates will not come down as quickly as they had expected.",
      "But in the UK there are also concerns about the economy underperforming.",
      "Inflation is at its highest for eight months - hitting 2.6% in November - above the Bank of England's 2% target - while the economy has shrunk for two months in a row.",
      "Analysts say it is these wider concerns about the strength of the economy that is driving down the pound, which typically rises when borrowing costs increase.",
      "However, the dollar is also rising against all currencies - not just the pound.",
      "The US economy created more jobs than forecast last month which has added to expectations that US rates will remain higher than previously forecast, and this has helped to push up the value of the dollar.",
      "How does it affect me?",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has pledged that all day-to-day spending should be  funded from taxes, not from borrowing.",
      "But if she needs more money to pay back higher borrowing costs, that uses up more tax revenue, leaving less money to spend on other things.",
      "Economists have warned that this could mean spending cuts which would affect public services, and tax rises that could hit people's pay or businesses' ability to grow and hire more people.",
      "The government has committed to having only one fiscal event a year, where it can raise taxes, and this is not expected until the autumn.",
      "So if higher borrowing costs persist, we may be more likely to see cuts to spending before that or at least lower spending increases than would otherwise happen.",
      "Some people may be wondering about the impact of higher gilt yields on the mortgage market, particularly after what happened after Liz Truss's mini-Budget in September 2022.",
      "Although yields are higher now than they were then, they have been creeping up slowly over a period of months, whereas in 2022 they shot up over a couple of days.",
      "That speedy rise led to lenders quickly pulling deals while they tried to work out what interest rate to charge.",
      "Analysts and brokers say the current unease in the markets is having some effect on the pricing of mortgages. Many were expecting to see some falls in rates at the start of the year but instead lenders are holding off from cuts to see what happens.",
      "However, the market is favourable to anyone currently buying an annuity - a product from an insurance company that gives a retirement income for the rest of their life, bought only once.",
      "One annuity expert told the BBC many people would get a better deal now than at any time since 2008, because annuity rates usually move in line with gilt yields.",
      "When will interest rates fall?",
      "Why are prices rising in the UK?",
      "What happens next?",
      "The Treasury has said there is no need for an emergency intervention in the financial markets.",
      "It has said it will not make any spending or tax announcements ahead of the official borrowing forecast from its independent watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), due on 26 March.",
      "If the OBR says the chancellor is still on track to meet her self-imposed fiscal rules then that might settle the markets.",
      "However, if the OBR were to say because of slower growth and higher-than-expected interest rates, the chancellor were likely to break her fiscal rules then that would potentially be a problem for Reeves.",

    "published": "Sat, 18 Jan 2025 01:05:32 GMT",
    "summary": "Gas from the seafloor has scientists wondering if oxygen could be found in the oceans of other planets.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists who recently discovered that metal lumps on the dark seabed make oxygen, have announced plans to study the deepest parts of Earth's oceans in order to understand the strange phenomenon.",
      "Their mission could \"change the way we look at the possibility of life on other planets too,\" the researchers say.",
      "The initial discovery confounded marine scientists. It was previously accepted that oxygen could only be produced in sunlight by plants - in a process called photosynthesis.",
      "If oxygen - a vital component of life - is made in the dark by metal lumps, the researchers believe that process could be happening on other planets, creating oxygen-rich environments where life could thrive.",
      "Lead researcher Prof Andrew Sweetman explained: \"We are already in conversation with experts at Nasa who believe dark oxygen could reshape our understanding of how life might be sustained on other planets without direct sunlight.",
      "\"We want to go out there and figure out what exactly is going on.\"",
      "A dark, controversial discovery",
      "The initial discovery triggered a global scientific row - there was criticism of the findings from some scientists and from deep sea mining companies that plan to harvest the precious metals in the seabed nodules.",
      "If oxygen is produced at these extreme depths, in total darkness, that calls into question what life could survive and thrive on the seafloor, and what impact mining activities could have on that marine life.",
      "That means that seabed mining companies and environmental organisations - some of which claimed that the findings provided evidence that seafloor mining plans should be halted - will be watching this new investigation closely.",
      "The plan is to work at sites where the seabed is more than 10km (6.2 miles) deep, using remotely operated submersible equipment.",
      "\"We have instruments that can go to the deepest parts of the ocean,\" explained Prof Sweetman. \"We're pretty confident we'll find it happening elsewhere, so we'll start probing what's causing it.\"",
      "Some of those experiments, in collaboration with scientists at Nasa, will aim to understand whether the same process could allow microscopic life to thrive beneath oceans that are on other planets and moons.",
      "\"If there's oxygen,\" said Prof Sweetman, \"there could be microbial life taking advantage of that.\"",
      "To mine or not to mine",
      "The initial, biologically baffling findings were published last year in the journal Nature Geoscience. They came from several expeditions to an area of the deep sea between Hawaii and Mexico, where Prof Sweetman and his colleagues sent sensors to the seabed - at about 5km (3.1 miles) depth.",
      "That area is part of a vast swathe of seafloor that is covered with the naturally occurring metal nodules, which form when dissolved metals in seawater collect on fragments of shell - or other debris. It's a process that takes millions of years.",
      "Sensors that the team deployed repeatedly showed oxygen levels going up.",
      "\"I just ignored it, Prof Sweetman told BBC News at the time, \"because I'd been taught that you only get oxygen through photosynthesis\".",
      "Eventually, he and his colleagues stopped ignoring their readings and set out instead to understand what was going on. Experiments in their lab - with nodules that the team collected submerged in beakers of seawater - led the scientists to conclude that the metallic lumps were making oxygen out of seawater. The nodules, they found, generated electric currents that could split (or electrolyse) molecules of seawater into hydrogen and oxygen.",
      "Then came the backlash, in the form of rebuttals - posted online - from scientists and from seabed mining companies.",
      "One of the critics, Michael Clarke from the Metals Company, a Canadian deep sea mining company, told BBC News that the criticism was focused on a \"lack of scientific rigour in the experimental design and data collection\". Basically, he and other critics claimed there was no oxygen production - just bubbles that the equipment produced during sample collection.",
      "\"We've ruled out that possibility,\" Prof Sweetman responded. \"But these [new] experiments will provide the proof.\"",
      "This might seem a niche, technical argument, but several multi-billion pound mining companies are already exploring the possibility of harvesting tonnes of these metals from the seafloor.",
      "The natural deposits they are targeting contain metals vital for making batteries, and demand for those metals is increasing rapidly as many economies move from fossil fuels to, for example, electric vehicles.",
      "The race to extract those resources has caused concern among environmental groups and researchers. More than 900 marine scientists from 44 countries have signed a petition\u00a0highlighting the environmental risks and calling for a pause on mining activity.",
      "Talking about his team's latest research mission at a press conference on Friday, Prof Sweetman said: \"Before we do anything, we need to - as best as possible - understand the [deep sea] ecosystem.",
      "\"I think the right decision is to hold off before we decide if this is the right thing to do as a a global society.\""

    "summary": "A huge private bathhouse is found after lying hidden for 2,000 years under volcanic rock and ash.",
    "story": [
      "After lying hidden beneath metres of volcanic rock and ash for 2,000 years, a \"once-in-a-century\" find has been unearthed in the ancient Roman city of Pompeii in Italy.",
      "Archaeologists have discovered a sumptuous private bathhouse - potentially the largest ever found there - complete with hot, warm and cold rooms, exquisite artwork, and a huge plunge pool.",
      "The spa-like complex sits at the heart of a grand residence uncovered over the last two years during a major excavation.",
      "\"It's these spaces that really are part of the 'Pompeii effect' - it's almost as if the people had only left a minute ago,\" says Dr Gabriel Zuchtriegel, director of the Archaeological Park of Pompeii, who has revealed the new find exclusively to BBC News.",
      "Analysis of two skeletons discovered in the house also shows the horror faced by Pompeii's inhabitants when Mount Vesuvius erupted in AD79.",
      "The bodies belonged to a woman, aged between 35 and 50, who was clutching jewellery and coins, and a younger man in his teens or early 20s.",
      "They had barricaded themselves into a small room, but were killed as a tsunami of superheated volcanic gas and ash - known as a pyroclastic flow - ripped through the town.",
      "\"This is a dramatic place, and everything you find here tells you about the drama,\" says Pompeii conservator, Dr Ludovica Alesse.",
      "A third of the ancient city still lies hidden beneath volcanic debris from the disaster, but the new excavation - the most extensive in a generation - provides new insights into ancient Roman life.",
      "The archaeologists have been followed by a documentary team from the BBC and Lion TV, for a series called Pompeii: The New Dig.",
      "An entire block of Pompeii has now been uncovered, revealing a laundry and bakery, as well as the large private house. It's thought these were all owned by one wealthy individual, possibly Aulus Rustius Verus, an influential Pompeii politician.",
      "The discovery of the bathhouse is further confirmation of his elite status, says Dr Zuchtriegel.",
      "\"There are just a few houses that have a private bath complex, so it was something really for the wealthiest of the wealthy,\" he says. \"And this is so huge - it's probably the biggest bath complex in a Pompeiian private home.\"",
      "Those lucky enough to use the suite of bathing rooms would have undressed in a changing room with vibrant red walls and a mosaic floor dotted with geometric patterns inlaid with marble from across the Roman Empire.",
      "They would then head to the hot room, taking a dip in a bath and enjoying the sauna-like warmth, provided by a suspended floor that allowed hot air to flow underneath and walls with a cavity where the heat could circulate.",
      "Next they would move to the brightly-painted warm room, where oil would be rubbed into the skin, before being scraped off with a curved instrument called a strigil.",
      "Finally, they would enter the largest and most spectacular room of all - the frigidarium, or cold room. Surrounded by red columns and frescoes of athletes, a visitor could cool off in the plunge pool, which is so large 20-30 people could fit in it.",
      "\"In the hot summers, you could sit with your feet in the water, chatting with your friends, maybe enjoying a cup of wine,\" says Dr Zuchtriegel.",
      "The bathhouse is the latest find to emerge from this extraordinary house.",
      "A huge banqueting room with jet black walls and breathtaking artwork of classical scenes was found last year. A smaller, more intimate room - painted in pale blue - where residents of the house would go and pray to the gods was also unearthed.",
      "The residence was mid-renovation - tools and building materials have been found throughout. In the blue room a pile of oyster shells lie on the floor, ready to be ground up and applied to the walls to give them an iridescent shimmer.",
      "Next door to this beautiful space, in a cramped room with barely any decoration, a stark discovery was made - the remains of two Pompeiians who failed to escape from the eruption.",
      "The skeleton of a woman was found lying on top of a bed, curled up in a foetal position. The body of a man was in the corner of this small room.",
      "\"The pyroclastic flow from Vesuvius came along the street just outside this room, and caused a wall to collapse, and that had basically crushed him to death,\" explains Dr Sophie Hay, an archaeologist at Pompeii.",
      "\"The woman was still alive while he was dying - imagine the trauma - and then this room filled with the rest of the pyroclastic flow, and that's how she died.\"",
      "Analysis of the male skeleton showed that despite his young age, his bones had signs of wear and tear, suggesting he was of lower status, possibly even a slave.",
      "The woman was older, but her bones and teeth were in good condition.",
      "\"She was probably someone higher up in society,\" says Dr Hay. \"She could have been the wife of the owner of the house - or maybe an assistant looking after the wife, we just don't know.\"",
      "An assortment of items were found on a marble table top in the room - glassware, bronze jugs and pottery - perhaps brought into the room where the pair had tucked themselves away hoping to wait out the eruption.",
      "But it's the items clutched by the victims that are of particular interest. The younger man held some keys, while the older woman was found with gold and silver coins and jewellery.",
      "These are kept in Pompeii's vault, along with the city's other priceless finds, and we were given a chance to see them with archaeologist, Dr Alessandro Russo.",
      "The gold coins still gleam as if they were new, and he shows us delicate gold and natural pearl earrings, necklace pendants and intricately etched semi-precious stones.",
      "\"When we find this kind of object, the distance from ancient times and modern times disappears,\" Dr Russo says, \"and we can touch a small piece of the life of these people who died in the eruption.\"",
      "Dr Sophie Hay describes the private bathhouse complex as a once-in-a-century discovery, which also sheds more light on a darker side of Roman life.",
      "Just behind the hot room is a boiler room. A pipe brought water in from the street - with some syphoned off into the cold plunge pool - and the rest was heated in a lead boiler destined for the hot room. The valves that regulated the flow look so modern it's as if you could turn them on and off even today.",
      "With a furnace sitting beneath, the conditions in this room would have been unbearably hot for the slaves who had to keep the whole system going.",
      "\"The most powerful thing from these excavations is that stark contrast between the lives of the slaves and the very, very rich. And here we see it,\" says Dr Sophie Hay.",
      "\"The difference between the sumptuous life of the bathhouse, compared to the furnace room, where the slaves would be feeding the fire toiling all day.",
      "\"A wall is all that could divide you between two different worlds.\"",
      "The excavation is in its final weeks - but new discoveries continue to emerge from the ash. Limited numbers of visitors are allowed to visit the dig while it's ongoing, but eventually it will be fully opened to the public.",
      "\"Every day here is a surprise,\" says Dr Anna Onesti, director of the excavation.",
      "\"Sometimes in the morning I come to work thinking that it's a normal working day - and then I discover we found something exceptional.",

    "summary": "Wild tigers killed nearly 40 people in Nepal between 2019 and 2023. Solutions are hard to come by.",
    "story": [
      "Nepal has been celebrated globally for tripling its tiger population in a decade - but Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli thinks the country may have been too successful.",
      "\"In such a small country, we have more than 350 tigers\u2026 We can't have so many tigers and let them eat up humans,\" he said last month at an event organised to review the country's COP29 outcomes.",
      "Attacks by tigers claimed nearly 40 lives and injured 15 people between 2019 and 2023, according to government data. But local communities say the figure is much higher.",
      "\"For us, 150 tigers are enough,\" Oli declared in December, even suggesting that Nepal could send its prized big cats to other countries as gifts.",
      "How many tigers are too many?",
      "There is no one answer, experts say. It depends on the availability of prey in a given area -  ideally, each tiger should be in the vicinity of about 500 prey animals, such as deer, antelopes or wild buffalo, tiger biologist Ullas Karanth says.",
      "Experts argue that Oli's concern with capping tiger numbers is misplaced. Rather, Nepal's government should focus on \"expanding protected areas that have reasonable natural densities of prey and tigers,\" Dr Karanth adds.",
      "If wildlife is spilling out of protected areas in search of prey, that might explain why so many attacks have happened in places that border forests, where tigers have always encountered humans.",
      "An example is the \"buffer zones\" that lie between national parks and human settlements. Wildlife sightings are common here, but locals also use the area for cattle-grazing and collecting fodder and firewood.",
      "Forest corridors - strips of land that connect different parks and bio-reserves allowing wildlife to roam between them - have emerged as yet another flashpoint. Roads sometimes run through these areas, and locals also use them for foraging, leaving them vulnerable to attacks.",
      "The rise in human fatalities is a sign that Nepal's once-successful conservation model is cracking, zoologist Karan Shah says.",
      "\"So far, [Nepal's] focus seems to be on winning international attention, while ignoring the impact on communities living around national parks and protected areas,\" Mr Shah adds.",
      "He argues that conservation is not just \"an ecological or scientific issue\" but also a social one - and that the loss of human lives must be prevented so local communities remain a part of the conservation effort and don't turn against it. Anger among locals has also been growing as tigers have been preying on livestock.",
      "\"A significant portion of our population still live in rural areas and are dependent on forest resources that they help conserve - but they are now increasingly being killed and injured by tigers,\" Thakur Bhandari, president of Federation of Community Forestry Users Nepal, told the BBC.",
      "\"As forest conservationists we cannot be against wildlife, but that does not mean we should ignore its impact on humans and our society.\"",
      "A success story turned deadly",
      "A century ago, some 100,000 tigers roamed Asia - but deforestation and rampant poaching pushed them to the brink of extinction. There are now only about 5,600 wild tigers remaining across 13 countries, including Nepal, China, India, Thailand, Indonesia and Russia.",
      "All of these nations had committed to doubling their tiger numbers by 2022, but Nepal was the first to surpass the target - due in part to a zero-poaching initiative and a doubling of the country's forest cover between 1992 and 2016.",
      "Connecting 16 protected zones in southern Nepal with areas across the border in northern India created forest corridors which helped too.",
      "The growing number of tiger attacks has now tarnished that achievement.",
      "Oli believes Nepal's tiger population is growing at the cost of human lives. Viable solutions, however, are not easy to come by.",
      "The parks and wildlife department has acknowledged the challenge of managing tigers in Nepal, where those that kill humans are tracked down and taken into captivity.",
      "\"Zoos and rescue centres are already overwhelmed with problematic tigers,\" the department said in a conservation report published in 2023. \"A comprehensive protocol is urgently needed to cope with the rescue, handling, and rehabilitation of problem animals.\"",
      "Oli has proposed sending Nepal's tigers abroad.",
      "\"People love to keep birds like falcons and peacocks as pets, so why not tigers?\" he suggested. \"That would boost their status too.\"",
      "Others have different ideas.",
      "Dr Karanth says tigers that have repeatedly taken human lives should be \"killed immediately\". Some argue that humans exacerbated the problem by encroaching into the tigers' natural habitats, using the land for cultivation or infrastructure and reducing the big cats' prey-base.",
      "The BBC spoke to a wildlife management expert, meanwhile, who claims Oli wants to bring down tiger numbers so that more land can be cleared to build infrastructure.",
      "\"It is not about people's safety,\" he said.",
      "For now the situation is at an impasse. It's unclear whether Oli's \"tiger diplomacy\" suggestion will gain traction, or whether over-encroaching humans or tigers are to blame for Nepal's tiger attack crisis.",
      "What is clear is that humans and tigers are struggling to achieve peaceful co-existence in Nepal - and the country's conservation success story has brought many of its own thorny problems to reckon with.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 16:00:04 GMT",
    "summary": "DNA analysis suggests Iron Age societies in Britain were built around women rather than men.",
    "story": [
      "Women in Britain 2,000 years ago appear to have passed on land and wealth to daughters not sons as communities were built around women's blood lines, according to new research.",
      "Skeletons unearthed in Dorset contained DNA evidence that Celtic men moved to live with their wives' families and communities.",
      "Scientists found evidence of a whole community built around the female line of a family over generations, probably originating with one woman.",
      "\"This points to an Iron Age society in Britain where women wielded quite a lot of influence and could shape its trajectory in many ways,\" says Dr Lara Cassidy at Trinity College, Dublin, lead author of the research.",
      "It is the first time this evidence of communities being built around women has been documented in ancient European history.",
      "The scientists believe that the communities also invested a lot in their daughters as they would probably inherit their mother's status.",
      "\"It's relatively rare in modern societies, but this might not always have been the case,\" says Dr Cassidy.",
      "The team found evidence that it happened in numerous places in Britain, suggesting it was widespread.",
      "The communities analysed lived around the same time as Boudica, the warrior Queen who led a rebellion against Roman invaders in East Anglia around AD 61.",
      "Dr Cassidy sequenced DNA taken from the bones of 57 individuals from a tribe called the Durotriges. The people lived in Winterborne Kingston, Dorset around 100 BC to AD 100.",
      "The skeletons were dug up from a cemetery by a team of archaeologists at Bournemouth University.",
      "By tracing mitochondrial DNA, which is only passed on by women, Dr Cassidy found that most women in the community were related by blood dating back generations.",
      "By contrast, there was a lot of diversity in the Y chromosomes, which is passed from father to son, indicating that men from lots of different families married into the community.",
      "The DNA analysis also indicates that most of the ancestral line could be traced back to a single woman.",
      "The work indicates that this society was what is known as matrilocal - meaning that a married man moved to live in his wife's community.",
      "\"The most sort of obvious benefit to a woman is that if you don't leave home, you don't leave your support network. Your parents, siblings, family members are all still around you,\" says Dr Cassidy.",
      "\"It's your husband who's coming in, he's the relative stranger to the community, and he's dependent on your family for his livelihood and land,\" she adds.",
      "The researchers found the same matrilocality evidence in bones from other cemeteries including in Cornwall and Yorkshire.",
      "She says that evidence of powerful women in ancient communities has often been dismissed an a one-off, not the norm, but these findings challenge that thinking.",
      "Archaeologists Prof Miles Russell and Prof Martin Smith found other evidence that women had high status.",
      "\"We find quite elaborately furnished graves with high status objects of wealth. Every time we find that, it occurs in women's graves, so we think wealth was being transferred down the female line,\" says Prof Martin Smith at Bournemouth university.",
      "The findings also back up Roman writings at the time which suggested that women in Britain were quite powerful, more so than in Rome.",
      "But Romans like Julius Caeser viewed that as a sign of backwardness.",
      "\"Women in Britain had power and it was a more egalitarian place. That was the biggest problem that Romans had with the Britons because Rome was a deeply patriarchal society. To them, it marked Britons as the ultimate Barbarians,\" says Professor Miles Russell at Bournemouth University.",
      "The majority of societies today are patrilocal, meaning women move to their husband's communities.",
      "But some matrilocal communities exist today or in the recent past, including the Akans in Ghana, West Africa and Cherokee in North America.",
      "The scientists say that Iron Age Britain may have been matrilocal because men were frequently away fighting.",
      "Dr Cassidy compares it to World War Two when women gained more political and economic power.",
      "Matrilocal societies are also less likely to experience internal conflict, she says.",
      "\"It can promote feelings of unity among neighbouring communities and villages. It disperses groups of related males, stopping groups of related males developing strong loyalties and starting feuds with the related males nearby,\" she suggests.",

      "Indian space agency Isro has for the first time successfully conducted space docking  by joining together two small craft in space.",
      "The technology is essential for the country's future ambition to build an Indian space station and put a person on the Moon.",
      "The mission, called SpaDeX, blasted off from Sriharikota launch pad in southern India on 30 December. The two spacecraft, launched on a single rocket, separated in space. The docking process, initially scheduled for 7 January, was rescheduled a number of times.",
      "On Thursday, the space agency announced it had created history by becoming only the fourth country to have docked spacecraft in orbit.",
      "Prime Minister Narendra Modi was at the Isro office in Bangalore as scientists carried out the test.",
      "\"It is a significant stepping stone for India's ambitious space missions in the years to come,\" he later posted on X.",
      "Federal Science Minister Jitendra Singh expressed relief that the docking had \"finally\" happened.",
      "The two spacecraft on SpaDeX (short for Space Docking Experiment) are called SDX01 or the Chaser and SDX02 or the Target. Each weigh about 220kg (485lbs) and since their launch, they were travelling in space at a carefully chosen speed.",
      "\"They were thrown into space together but at the time of separation, they were placed with different velocity to allow them to build a distance of 10-20km between them,\" Mila Mitra, a former Nasa scientist and co-founder of Delhi-based space education company Stem and Space, told the BBC.",

      "The second time, it said there had been a glitch while trying to bring the satellites closer, but added that the spacecraft were safe.",
      "On Sunday, Isro said scientists had managed to reduce the distance between the Chaser and the Target first to 15metres and then to 3metres. They said after the trial attempt, the spacecraft were \"moved back to safe distance\" and that they were analysing data.",
      "S Somanath, who was Isro chief when SpaDeX (short for Space Docking Experiment) was launched and was monitoring its progress until his retirement a few days ago, had described docking as \"a very complex process\" that needed extreme precision and coordination.",
      "To begin with, the two spacecraft had to be in the same orbit so that the Chaser could start to approach the Target.",
      "On Thursday morning, scientists began by gradually reducing the speed of the two spacecraft - bringing them ever closer until they were just 3 metres apart. Then their connectors were latched together.",
      "In the next step, the two spacecraft were screwed on perfectly, creating an airtight passage for safe transfer of material or crew, completing space docking.",
      "An Isro official told the BBC that over the next two-three days, the mission will carry out what is being billed as one of its most important experiments - it will transfer electrical power from the Chaser to Target.",
      "This, Ms Mitra, says is to demonstrate that a spacecraft can be sent to service another in space.",
      "The experiment will then demonstrate \"undocking and separation of the two satellites\".",
      "Ms Mitra says the mission will also test India's capabilities for inter-satellite communication as during the docking and undocking, the spacecraft will have to communicate with the Earth station and also with each other so that they know each other's position and velocity.",
      "The spacecraft are also carrying scientific instruments and cameras which will then be deployed. Over the next two years, they will measure radiation in space and monitor natural resources on Earth.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 02:08:17 GMT",
    "summary": "The UK led the way in this field of science until recently - but now other countries have overtaken. So, how can that lead be recovered?",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Pallab read this story",
      "Listen to Pallab read this story",
      "In a gleaming laboratory in Edinburgh, robotic machines whirr and mix. The final product that they are creating will be a pine-smelling chemical that can be used as an ingredient in perfumes. But the starting point is very different: a brown, gloopy, fat mixture, recently fished out from below ground - fatbergs.",
      "Fatbergs are the foul phenomenon found lurking in (and blocking up) sewers. The development of the technology used to perform this apparent alchemy is being described by some as a new industrial revolution.",
      "This is the fast-moving field of bioengineering. The good news is that Britain is currently strong in the science compared with other countries.",
      "It is potentially great news for the environment too because it can recycle waste and make things more sustainably. Plus the government is keen because it may mean new industries and new jobs.",
      "But the British lead has slipped away recently because of a lack of investment, poor regulation and the wrong policies. The question now is, can it be recovered?",
      "And if it can, at what cost? Because some experts are concerned that certain potential risks are being overlooked amid the enthusiasm to reap the benefits - and to win back the lead.",
      "A crazy idea 'that works'",
      "Prof Stephen Wallace from the University of Edinburgh is among those turning the fatbergs into perfumes. \"It's a crazy idea,\" he admits to me, \"but it works.\"",
      "Fatbergs are accumulated lumps of fat from cooking oils, toilet and other food waste that people put down their drains. Prof Wallace gets his from a company that specialises in fishing them out of sewers and turning them into biofuels. They arrive at the lab in a tube.",
      "The first step is to sterilise the material in a steamer. Prof Wallace then adds the specially modified bacteria to the remnants of the fatberg. The bacteria have a short section of DNA inserted, to give the bacteria their particular properties.",
      "The fatberg gradually disappears, as the bacteria eat it, producing the chemical with the pine-like smell - this can be used as an ingredient in perfumes.",
      "Prof Wallace says that while the UK has taken a lead role in establishing the technology, it now needs to show it can go to the next step. \"We are at this nervous point where the core technology that enables a huge range of sustainable industrial technologies is established and we are now progressing to the stage of scaling up to manufacturing.",
      "\"But there is a challenge in the UK to create infrastructure... and progress to commercialisation at a rate that is comparable to investment in Europe and the US.\"",
      "Tech advances at break-neck speed",
      "If the UK can scale up, the appetite for investment appears to be there. Prof Wallace is working with two perfume companies that are interested in the process because it is more sustainable than the method they currently use, which involves making the fragrance from chemicals extracted from fossil fuels.",
      "But while the basic technology exists, it is advancing at break-neck speed, meaning the UK's leading role is insecure.",
      "One of Stephen's colleagues, Dr Joanna Sadler, has created microbes that turn used plastic, that would otherwise damage the environment, into vanilla essence and other useful and expensive chemicals.",
      "\"Since I first published the work four or five years ago, the field has absolutely exploded, not just in the UK but across the world,\" she tells me. \"It's an extremely fast-moving field.\"",
      "One member of the University of Edinburgh's hub has created bugs that extract important metals from burnt-out batteries, which would otherwise leak noxious chemicals into landfill. Another is turning waste water from whisky distillation into a plant-based alternative to fish-oil health supplements.",
      "The possibilities are endless, and innovation has accelerated because of the development of cheap and accurate ways of manipulating DNA. It means it is now much easier to harness and adapt the power of nature to create all sorts of things.",
      "However all those possibilities require funding.",
      "A national priority?",
      "The technology was set as a national priority by the previous government in December 2023 with the publication of a policy document called the National Vision for Engineering Biology and an allocation of \u00a32bn over 10 years. The Labour government has indicated that it too regards it as a priority but has made no firm spending commitment.",
      "On the face of it, engineering biology could help Labour achieve two of its five big priorities in government: growth and sustainability. But at present the funding remains uncertain.",
      "The chief scientific advisor Prof Angela McLean, whom the Prime Minister turns to for matters scientific, has been looking into this.",
      "\"We are looking for products like this handbag,\" Prof McLean explained, while stroking a faux leather handbag made by one of the many new start-up engineering biology companies spinning out of university research.",
      "Modern Synthesis based south London made the bag from material grown from a non-genetically engineered microbe.",
      "\"They will be much less polluting, much more sustainable than their current equivalents, as well as generate great jobs, good environment and prosperity,\" she continues.",
      "\"Engineering biology is something the UK is really good at and the world is going to need. It is in its infancy and we need to keep on investing in it as a country.\"",
      "Losing out to Korea and the US",
      "In the 20th Century, the UK led the way in the basic sciences of electronics, computing and the biosciences. But, with some notable exceptions, scientific excellence in these sectors was not translated into truly large world-leading businesses.",
      "In all these cases, there was initial government enthusiasm and funding, but no follow-through. That meant that the science and ideas were bought up by mostly US companies, generating wealth and jobs overseas.",
      "The fear that the UK is losing its way is highlighted in a new House of Lords report, which was out on the 14 January, that says that engineering biology risks going down the same path for exactly the same reasons.",
      "It states that \"other countries are beginning to overtake the UK, and we are at severe risk of losing the prospective benefits of a world-leading engineering biology sector\".",
      "How Biden tarnished his own legacy",
      "Why wildfires are becoming faster and more furious",
      "How Canada's immigration debate soured - and helped seal Trudeau's fate",
      "The report also says that there is a \"small but closing window\" to make some small policy tweaks that could make a huge difference, such as recommitting to the target set out in the National Vision for at least \u00a32 billion of funding over the next decade.",
      "Professor Susan Rosser, co-director of the Edinburgh Genome Foundry, told the Lords Science and Technology committee, which produced the report, \"we were ahead of the game, but we have lost that leadership because of substantial investments in the US and Korea\".",
      "She said: \"We are losing trained people overseas. People from Edinburgh have moved to Singapore, the States, Germany and Austria.",
      "\"If this is genuinely going to be a key part of our economy, we need the skill set trained, and as soon as possible.\"",
      "Brain drain",
      "Dr Carolina Grandellis, a biofoundry manager at the Earlham Institute research park in Norwich, added that it was hard to replenish the brain drain by attracting scientists from overseas because of a tightening of the visa system by both the previous and current government.",
      "\"The government intends to increase restrictions on legal skilled migration. That will have a cost for our field.\"",
      "According to Baroness Brown of Cambridge, who chairs the Lords committee, the heart of the problem is that there is no clear plan to increase the number of skilled scientists or to have the right policies and regulations in place to enable engineering biology to flourish in the UK.",
      "\"All too often we hear that when companies reach a certain size, they move abroad for better investment and development prospects, taking most of the economic benefit with them,\" she says. \"This requires urgent action\".",
      "Another issue is that the UK biofoundries, like the one at Edinburgh University, are not properly funded, according to Prof Paul Freemont, who is a co-director of a biofoundry at Imperial College, London.",
      "\"The scale of investment in biofoundries internationally is enormous. In Korea, it just announced $100m (\u00a382m) for a K-Biofoundry. In Shenzhen in China, about $750m (\u00a3614m) has gone into a building in which each floor [studies] an organism.",
      "\"Our biofoundry in London had \u00a37m of public investment in infrastructure and we have had no funding for staff. We are constantly scrabbling for cash\".",
      "Not all funding can come from government. But the Lords' report found that enough private investment was not forthcoming either. Unlike in the US, UK investors expect returns in a few years, rather than the tens of years that innovative companies need for their ideas to really start making money.",
      "'Living pollution' that could spread",
      "A further barrier for the field is its regulation by government, especially for applications for producing novel foods, according to Will Milligan CEO of Extracellular, which provides products to firms making lab-grown meat.",
      "\"Singapore, on the other hand, has a very clear framework for the approval process in bringing products to market, and the recommended timelines are about half what they are in the UK.\"",
      "In response to criticisms, the government has set up a body to cut through the red tape, the Regulatory Innovation Office.",
      "But \"streamlining does mean deregulation, in many circumstances\", argues Dr Helen Wallace, director of the campaign group Gene Watch. She worries that the risks of engineering biology are being overlooked by the government in its enthusiasm to reap the claimed benefits.",
      "Many applications of the technology involve creating entirely new organisms which are contained inside large vats in the production process. Even if they were to escape, they are unlikely to survive as they have been engineered to thrive in the very specific, artificial conditions they were designed for.",
      "But Dr Wallace is concerned about some applications that are designed to be released into the environment. \"There is one in the US which is made to survive and reproduce in the soil to boost nitrogen levels, which is very worrying because even very small changes in their DNA could make them more harmful to people, animals and plants.",
      "\"This could create a new kind of living pollution that could spread in rivers, the sea, the air, in rain and you would not be able to reverse any adverse consequences\".",
      "Inadvertent creation of superbugs",
      "Scientists and industrialists agree that without public trust, this shining new industry is going nowhere. And to win trust, the advocates of engineering biology must be open and honest about the risks.",
      "Most worrisome is the inadvertent creation of superbugs that could spread disease or create environmental problems by disrupting delicately balanced ecosystems.",
      "A group of 38 leading scientists recently expressed concern about the creation of \"mirror life\", which would be artificially created organisms whose DNA is the mirror image of their naturally occurring counterparts.",
      "Writing in the journal Science, they said that these mirror organisms could pose serious risks and rip through the immune systems of plants and animals. The scientists have called for a moratorium on their creation until more is known about them and what steps can be taken to minimise risks.",
      "But the problem is that the technology has become so cheap and widely available that such a moratorium would be hard to police. And while the creation of mirror life is a highly specialised skill, bad actors could make simpler changes, increasing the risk of bioterrorism.",
      "Government and manufacturers think that there are considerable environmental and economic benefits to this technology. But if the public won't accept it, there's no point to all this increased investment: it won't be used; no one will buy the products. And there are real risks: scientists and campaigners want the public to be fully informed, in an open and transparent way.",
      "Prof Freemont admits that in their enthusiasm for the good that engineering biology can bring. \"We've taken our eye off the ball a little bit in engaging with the public.",
      "\"The sector needs to ensure that the general consumer and citizen can begin to understand this technology\".",

      "Last Tuesday and Wednesday were \"chaos\", said Jennie Nevin, a spokeswoman for the equestrian centre. The facility catalogued every horse that arrived, making sure they could be reunited. Sheltering the animals came at no cost for the owners, thanks to the support of public donations and frequent drop-offs of free hay, feed and other supplies.",
      "Sergio Marcial was one of dozens of people who brought animals here after their own facilities were destroyed or threatened.",
      "A week ago, he and his girlfriend Jenny Bacon raced to help rescue more than 70 animals from the Eaton Dam Stables while battling flames so intense that his face mask caught fire and his eyeglasses shattered and warped.",
      "His efforts landed him in the hospital, his lungs and throat burned after inhaling the torched air.",
      "One week later, Mr Marcial, 29, and Ms Bacon, 30, walked Arthur and Playboy - two miniature horses he helped save that night - around their new home. Here, they were safe from the fires, and they seemed calm and friendly despite everything they had endured.",
      "\"It still hurts to swallow,\" Mr Marcial said, pointing to a face mask he's required to wear to prevent infections. \"I'd do it all again - no question.\"",

      "Dozens of volunteers cared for the other animals staying at the centre. Some had become local celebrities.",
      "Two donkeys, Morris and Mika, frequently poked their heads out of their stables to demand attention. They had fled down the mountain with their owner as the Palisades fire drew near, and were reunited because he had spray-painted his number on to their sides.",
      "\"They love for you to sing to them,\" said volunteer Lucena Herrera. \"We've all just been adopting them and taking care of them.\"",
      "But a handful of animals still have not been claimed. A miniature horse named Izzy had still not found her owner a week after the fires. The volunteers had collectively adopted her until she could find a new, permanent home.",
      "So many volunteers showed up to help the animals that the staff had to turn some away, Ms Nevin said. Between 50-100 volunteers now raked stalls, fed the animals, fluffed hay and serenaded Morris and Mika when they grew antsy.",
      "Watching owners reunite with their horses was one of the most valuable experiences for volunteers, said London Scott, founder of the local Cali Cowboy Club.",
      "\"It's a really beautiful process to go through,\" Ms Scott said, \"To be able to see that at first hand, and know that you had a small part in someone having a little peace of mind in a tragic moment in time.\"",
      "Those here describe a deep bond to their animals and say the farms that burned down are a place of peace in this bustling metropolitan area.",

      "By contrast, in the UK electric cars made up only 20% of new car registrations in 2024. Although this was a record high, and up from 16.5% in 2023.",
      "In the US, the figure was just 8% last year, up from 7.6%.",
      "Norway is undoubtedly an EV pioneer, but this electric revolution has been three decades in the making.",
      "\"It started already in the early 1990s,\" says Christina Bu, the secretary general of the Norwegian EV Association, as she took me for a spin around Oslo in an electric minivan.",
      "\"Little by little taxing petrol and diesel engine cars more, so they have become a lot more expensive to purchase, whereas electric cars have been exempted from taxes.\"",
      "The support for electric vehicles was first introduced to help two Norwegian manufacturers of early EVs, the Buddy (previously Kewet) and TH!NK City. While they went out of business, the incentives for greener vehicles remained.",
      "\"It's our goal to see that it's always a good and viable choice, to choose zero emission,\" says Norway's Deputy Transport Minister, Cecilie Knibe Kroglund.",
      "Even though it's a major oil and gas producer, Norway aims for all new cars sold to be \"zero emission\", starting at some point in 2025. A non-binding goal was set back in 2017, and that milestone now lies within reach.",
      "\"We are closing up on the target, and I think that we will reach that goal,\" adds Kroglund. \"I think we have already made the transition for passengers cars.\"",
      "Key to Norway's success has been long-term and predictable policies, she explains.",
      "Rather than banning combustion engine vehicles, the government has steered consumer choices. In addition to penalising fuel fossil vehicles with higher taxes and registration fees, VAT and import duties were scrapped for low-emission cars.",
      "A string of perks, like free parking, discounted road tolls and access to bus lanes, then followed.",
      "By comparison, the European Union plans to ban sales of new fossil-fuel cars by 2035, and the UK's current government wants to prohibit their sale in 2030.",
      "Petrol and diesel car sales are still permitted in Norway. But few are choosing to buy them.",
      "For many locals, like St\u00e5le Fyen, who bought his first EV 15 months ago, going electric made economic sense.",
      "\"With all the incentives we have in Norway, with no taxes on EVs, that was quite important to us money wise,\" he says while plugging in his car at a charging station in the capital.",
      "\"In the cold, the range is maybe 20% shorter, but still, with the expansive charging network we have here in Norway, that isn't a big issue really,\" Mr Fyen adds. \"You just have to change your mindset and charge when you can, not when you need to.\"",
      "Another driver, Merete Eggesb\u00f8, says that back in 2014 she was one of the first people in Norway to own a Tesla. \"I really wanted a car that didn't pollute. It gave me a better conscience driving.\"",
      "At Norwegian petrol stations many fuel pumps have been replaced by fast-charging points, and across Norway there are now more than 27,000 public chargers.",
      "This compares with 73,699 in the UK - a country 12 times bigger in terms of population.",
      "That means that, per 100,000 people, Norway has 447 chargers while the UK has just 89, according to a recent report.",
      "Tesla, VW and Toyota, were Norway's top-selling EV brands last year. Meanwhile, Chinese-owned marques - such as MG, BYD, Polestar and XPeng - now make up a combined 10% of the market, according to the Norwegian Road Federation.",
      "Norway, unlike the US and EU, has not imposed tariffs on Chinese EV imports.",
      "Ms Bu says there's \"not really any reason why other countries can not copy Norway\". However, she adds that it is \"all about doing it in a way that can work in each country or market\".",
      "Norwegians aren't more environmentally-minded than people elsewhere, she reckons. \"I don't think a green mindset has much to do with it. It has to do with strong policies, and people gradually understanding that driving an electric car is possible.\"",
      "Yet Norway is also a very wealthy nation, which thanks to its huge oil and gas exports, has a sovereign wealth fund worth more than $1.7tn (\u00a31.3tn). This means it can more easily afford big infrastructure-build projects, and absorb the loss of tax revenue from the sale of petrol and diesel cars and their fuel.",
      "The country also has an abundance of renewable hydro electricity, which accounts for 88% of its production capacity.",
      "\"A third of cars are now electric, and it will pass 50% in a few years,\" says Kjell Werner Johansen from the Norwegian Centre for Transport Research. \"I think the government accepts that a few new petrol or hybrid cars will still be on the market, but I don't know anybody who wants to buy a diesel car these days.\"",

      "Lemon8, which is also owned by ByteDance, would have been an obvious place for people to go following a ban - but the law stipulates it also applies to other apps owned or operated by the firm. This means Lemon8 is probably also going to face being made inaccessible in the US.",

    "summary": "Should more AI be used to help GPs with consultations and administrative work?",
    "story": [
      "This is the fifth feature in a six-part series that is looking at how AI is changing medical research and treatments.",
      "The difficulty of getting an appointment with a GP is a familiar gripe in the UK.",
      "Even when an appointment is secured, the rising workload faced by doctors means those meetings can be shorter than either the doctor or patient would like.",
      "But Dr Deepali Misra-Sharp, a GP partner in Birmingham, has found that AI has alleviated a chunk of the administration from her job, meaning she can focus more on patients.",
      "Dr Mirsa-Sharp started using Heidi Health, a free AI-assisted medical transcription tool that listens and transcribes patient appointments, about four months ago and says it has made a big difference.",
      "\u201cUsually when I\u2019m with a patient, I am writing things down and it takes away from the consultation,\u201d she says. \u201cThis now means I can spend my entire time locking eyes with the patient and actively listening. It makes for a more quality consultation.\u201d",
      "She says the tech reduces her workflow, saving her \u201ctwo to three minutes per consultation, if not more\u201d. She reels off other benefits: \u201cIt reduces the risk of errors and omissions in my medical note taking.\"",
      "With a workforce in decline while the number of patients continues to grow, GPs face immense pressure.",
      "A single full-time GP is now responsible for 2,273 patients, up 17% since September 2015, according to the British Medical Association (BMA).",
      "Could AI be the solution to help GP\u2019s cut back on administrative tasks and alleviate burnout?",
      "Some research suggests it could. A 2019 report prepared by Health Education England estimated a minimal saving of one minute per patient from new technologies such as AI, equating to 5.7 million hours of GP time.",
      "Meanwhile, research by Oxford University in 2020, found that 44% of all administrative work in General Practice can now be either mostly or completely automated, freeing up time to spend with patients.",
      "One company working on that is Denmark's Corti, which has developed AI that can listen to healthcare consultations, either over the phone or in person, and suggest follow-up questions, prompts, treatment options, as well as automating note taking.",
      "Corti says its technology processes about 150,000 patient interactions per day across hospitals, GP surgeries and healthcare institutions across Europe and the US, totalling about 100 million encounters per year.",
      "\u201cThe idea is the physician can spend more time with a patient,\u201d says Lars Maal\u00f8e, co-founder and chief technology officer at Corti. He says the technology can suggest questions based on previous conversations it has heard in other healthcare situations.",
      "\u201cThe AI has access to related conversations and then it might think, well, in 10,000 similar conversations, most questions asked X and that has not been asked,\u201d says Mr Maal\u00f8e.",
      "\u201cI imagine GPs have one consultation after another and so have little time to consult with colleagues. It\u2019s giving that colleague advice.\u201d",
      "He also says it can look at the historical data of a patient. \u201cIt could ask, for example, did you remember to ask if the patient is still suffering from pain in the right knee?\u201d",
      "But do patients want technology listening to and recording their conversations?",
      "Mr Maal\u00f8e says \u201cthe data is not leaving system\u201d. He does say it is good practice to inform the patient, though.",
      "\u201cIf the patient contests it, the doctor cannot record. We see few examples of that as the patient can see better documentation.\u201d",
      "Dr Misra-Sharp says she lets patients know she has a listening device to help her take notes. \u201cI haven\u2019t had anyone have a problem with that yet, but if they did, I wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, currently, 1,400 GP practices across England are using the C the Signs, a platform which uses AI to analyse patients\u2019 medical records and check different signs, symptoms and risk factors of cancer, and recommend what action should be taken.",
      "\u201cIt can capture symptoms, such as cough, cold, bloating, and essentially in a minute it can see if there\u2019s any relevant information from their medical history,\u201d says C the Signs chief executive and co-founder Dr Bea Bakshi, who is also a GP.",
      "The AI is trained on published medical research papers.",
      "\u201cFor example, it might say the patient is at risk of pancreatic cancer and would benefit from a pancreatic scan, and then the doctor will decide to refer to those pathways,\u201d says Dr Bakshi. \u201cIt won\u2019t diagnose, but it can facilitate.\u201d",
      "She says they have conducted more than 400,000 cancer risk assessments in a real-world setting, detecting more than 30,000 patients with cancer across more than 50 different cancer types.",
      "An AI report published by the BMA this year found that \u201cAI should be expected to transform, rather than replace, healthcare jobs by automating routine tasks and improving efficiency\u201d.",
      "In a statement, Dr Katie Bramall-Stainer, chair of General Practice Committee UK at the BMA, said: \"We recognise that AI has the potential to transform NHS care completely - but if not enacted safely, it could also cause considerable harm. AI is subject to bias and error, can potentially compromise patient privacy and is still very much a work-in-progress.",
      "\"Whilst AI can be used to enhance and supplement what a GP can offer as another tool in their arsenal, it's not a silver bullet. We cannot wait on the promise of AI tomorrow, to deliver the much-needed productivity, consistency and safety improvements needed today.\u201d",

      "Could AI help prevent diabetes-related sight loss?",
      "Alison Dennis, partner and co-head of law firm Taylor Wessing's international life sciences team, warns that GPs need to tread carefully when using AI.",
      "\"There is the very high risk of generative AI tools not providing full and complete, or correct diagnoses or treatment pathways, and even giving wrong diagnoses or treatment pathways i.e. producing hallucinations or basing outputs on clinically incorrect training data,\u201d says Ms Dennis.",
      "\u201cAI tools that have been trained on reliable data sets and then fully validated for clinical use \u2013 which will almost certainly be a specific clinical use, are more suitable in clinical practice.\u201d",
      "She says specialist medical products must be regulated and receive some form of official accreditation.",
      "\u201cThe NHS would also want to ensure that all data that is inputted into the tool is retained securely within the NHS system infrastructure, and is not absorbed for further use by the provider of the tool as training data without the appropriate GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation] safeguards in place.\"",
      "For now, for GPs like Misra-Sharp, it has transformed their work. \u201cIt has made me go back to enjoying my consultations again instead of feeling time pressured.\u201d"

      "Residents in the city first heard two loud explosions and only then the wail of the air raid siren, around 06:00 (04:00 GMT). The missiles had already hit by the time the ballistic threat warning was issued, urging residents to head for shelter.",
      "The main destruction occurred in the central Shevchenkivskyi district, where there is now a deep crater in the road outside a business centre.",
      "A military factory in the neighbourhood has been targeted repeatedly by Russia, but the damage we saw was to civilian buildings. An official said a couple had been killed on the street inside their vehicle.",
      "Officials earlier reported four people had died in the attack.",
      "The metro station, nearby restaurants and businesses are also very badly damaged, and emergency workers are removing the burned wreckage of cars from the scene.",
      "Already damaged in previous attacks on this area, the business centre's tall glass tower and main building are now a shell after being hit by either a second missile or very large fragment. It was empty when the missile struck.",
      "Beside the main crater, a Ukrainian forensics expert examined fragments of missile collected into a heap of twisted grey metal on the pavement.",
      "Andriy Kulchytskyy, the head of the Military Research Laboratory of the Kyiv Institute of Scientific Expertise, told the BBC the crater was from a direct hit with an Iskander-M ballistic missile, based on markings on the missile fragments.",
      "\"This specific site shows one impact,\" he explained. \"There are additional strikes, and we have collected debris. Here, the missile directly hit the road.\"",
      "Mr Kulchytskyy said the projectile landed before the warning sirens sounded because ballistic missiles travel so quickly that the sirens cannot react in time.",

    "story": [
      "Serious. Ominous. A \"message picture\".",
      "Those are some of the descriptions of Donald Trump's newest official portrait, captured by his chief photographer, Daniel Torok. In the photo, the president-elect wears a stern expression, eyebrow cocked.",
      "\"The official portrait of the president is the most printed, most seen image of the president, ever,\" former White House photographer Eric Draper told the BBC.",
      "He worked for George W Bush throughout his eight-year presidency, taking both of his official portraits.",
      "Mr Draper's first impression of Trump's image was that it was \"heavily manipulated\" with both studio lighting and retouching after the shoot.",
      "The photo appeared to use \"monster\" lighting, he added, to dramatically illuminate the president-elect from below and make his eyes pop.",
      "The lighting setup gives the image an \"ominous\" look often seen in horror films, said Eliska Sky, a portrait photographer with the London Institute of Photography. She compared the portrayal of Trump to a boxer before a fight.",
      "The lighting \"suggests seriousness and intent\", according to Paul Duerinckx, a senior documentary photography lecturer at the Swansea College of Art.",
      "This image is striking, he added, because the light source in most photos comes from above, like the sun or ceiling lights, and flipping the source in this photo \"tends to really have an effect on us\".",
      "Many on social media compared the photo to Donald Trump's 'mug shot', taken in Fulton County Jail in Georgia after he was charged with attempting to overturn his 2020 election loss - a charge Trump denies.",
      "Photography YouTuber Jared Polin said that he discussed the portrait with Mr Torok and was told the mug shot did provide inspiration.",
      "\"The mug shot photo was one of the most searched images, maybe ever,\" Polin claims Mr Torok said. Mr Torok did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.",
      "The mug shot, taken in 2023, became part of US culture, adorning everything from coffee cups to T-shirts.",
      "The style of Trump's new portrait is a departure from the look of his 2017 image, and that of past presidents, including George W Bush.",
      "\"You definitely make photos to please the client, and in this case, I think this is the type of image they wanted to portray,\" Mr Draper told the BBC.",
      "He recalled sitting down with then-President Bush and first lady Laura Bush to pore over a selection of images before they picked their favourite.",
      "\"The idea was to have it look like nice, pleasant lighting, have it look like a professional portrait, with a nice expression because these photos are going to be welcoming people as they walk into their post office,\" he said.",
      "Andrew Parsons is a political photographer who worked for four British prime ministers from David Cameron to Liz Truss, as well as Boris Johnson for 13 years.",
      "\"It's a message picture, I'm delivering you a message,\" he said of Trump's photo. \"It's not like a candid laugh, it's a stern, hard, look straight down the barrel of the lens.\"",

      "They argued that Roy alone could not have committed the crime and stated they would be satisfied only when all those involved were brought to justice. The high court has said it will consider the plea only if the Supreme Court - which is monitoring the case - directs it to do so.",
      "The incident raised concerns about rising cases of violence against health workers in India - many of whom face physical abuse by angry patients or their relatives.",
      "A 2017 survey by the Indian Medical Association found that over 75% of doctors in India have experienced some form of violence. The survey also revealed that nearly 63% of doctors fear potential violence while treating patients.",

      "Many rape cases in India go unreported, mostly due to social stigma around sexual violence and a lack of trust in the police and judicial system. Activists say this often results in the victim being shamed instead of the perpetrator, especially in rural areas.",
      "In 2012, the rape and murder of a medical student by a group of men in India's capital Delhi drew global attention and triggered similar, wider protests.",
      "The public anger prompted authorities to amend rape laws in 2013. The changes  broadened the definition of the crime, set strict punishments for sexual assault and lowered the age at which a person can be tried from 18 to 16.",

    "story": [
      "The Israeli and Hamas negotiators never came face to face - but by the end, just one floor separated them.",
      "Ceasefire talks via middlemen from Qatar, Egypt and the US dragged on for several months, at times without hope. Now the key players were all inside one building in Doha and the pace was frantic.",
      "A deal was close but things had gone wrong before: one source described a last-minute push to stop the agreement breaking down while a podium was being set up so the Qatari prime minister could announce it.",
      "\"Literally, negotiations were up until 10 minutes before the press conference. So that's how things were stitched up at the last minute,\" the source familiar with the talks said.",
      "The BBC has spoken to a number of officials on all sides of the negotiations to piece together how the final fraught days of the secretive process unfolded.",
      "Shifting ground",
      "The deal did not come out of the blue.",
      "The overall framework of the agreement reached on 15 January was broadly the same as the proposal set out by President Joe Biden during a White House address last May. It uses the same three-phase approach and will see a ceasefire, Israeli hostages released in return for Palestinian prisoners, and the Israeli military's gradual withdrawal from Gaza.",
      "But sources familiar with the discussions agreed the dynamics of the talks shifted decisively in mid-December and the pace changed.",
      "Hamas, already reeling from Israel's killing of its leader Yahya Sinwar in Gaza two months earlier, had become increasingly isolated. Its Lebanon-based ally Hezbollah had been decimated and had agreed to a truce with Israel. Bashar al-Assad's Iran-backed government in Syria had also been swept away.",
      "The view in Washington is that Hamas was forced to abandon the idea that \"the cavalry was coming to save it\", as one US official put it.",
      "\"It is hard to overstate how fundamentally the equation changed and what that [did] for Hamas's calculus,\" says a senior Biden administration official familiar with the talks.",
      "An Israeli official who wished to remain anonymous said Hamas was \"not in a rush\" to strike a deal and had been \"dictating\" rather than negotiating. They said that changed after the death of Sinwar and Israeli operations against Hamas's allies in the region.",
      "On top of that, the official said, there was \"momentum created by both US administrations\" - the Biden White House and the incoming Trump team.",
      "\"We could not achieve a deal like this until conditions had changed,\" the official added.",
      "On 12 December, Biden's negotiating team visited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan, Middle East envoy Brett McGurk and CIA director Bill Burns were all in attendance.",

      "There was also another piece on the chessboard by this stage: Donald Trump.",
      "On 16 December, weeks after Trump's victory, the BBC spoke to a Hamas official who was unusually optimistic about the ceasefire efforts, suggesting they seemed to be more serious.",
      "The official - who had taken part in every set of talks since November 2023 - appeared reassured by the fact that an adviser to the incoming US president had sent a message to mediators indicating Trump wanted an agreement before his inauguration.",
      "Trump had also warned of \"all hell to pay\" if Hamas did not agree to release the hostages - but the Palestinian official was bullish.",
      "\"This time, the pressure will not be limited to Hamas, as was customary under the Biden administration,\" the official said. \"There will also be pressure on Netanyahu. He is the one obstructing the deal, and Trump seems to understand that very well.\"",
      "False dawns",
      "However, that same official's prediction that a deal could be done by Christmas proved to be optimistic.",
      "During December, the process remained beset by problems. Israel publicly ruled out releasing certain high-profile prisoners, while the White House accused Hamas of throwing up roadblocks over the hostage releases.",
      "A Biden administration official said: \"Hamas [was] refusing to agree - and this was a breakdown at that point - to the list of hostages that would be released in phase one of the deal.",
      "\"That's just so fundamental. This is a hostage release deal. Unless you agree to the list of hostages who will come out, there's not going to be a deal.\"",
      "The same official said Hamas made \"completely untrue\" claims about not knowing the location of the hostages, and added: \"We held the line and basically left the table until Hamas agreed to the hostage list.\"",
      "An anonymous Israeli official said Hamas had sought to conceal the number of living hostages and \"tried to dictate that they would send us only dead bodies\".",
      "For its part, Hamas claimed Israel unexpectedly added 11 names to the list of hostages it wanted to be released in the first phase. Hamas considered them reserve soldiers, and therefore not eligible to be released alongside the women, injured and elderly hostages due to be released in phase one.",
      "The door was left open to Qatari and Egyptian mediators to continue their efforts and on 3 January, there was an apparent breakthrough when Hamas proposed the release of 110 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences in return.",
      "There were by now well-established terms of reference for such trades. For each hostage Hamas was to release, Israel would have to provide what had become known in the nomenclature of the draft deal as a \"key\" - meaning an agreed number or even specific identities of Palestinian prisoners.",
      "A US official said: \"There's an equation for how many Palestinian prisoners come out. So for female soldiers, for example, there's a key. And for elderly males, there's a key. And for women civilians, there's a key. And this has all been worked out and the prisoners have been named, hundreds and hundreds of prisoners on the list.\"",
      "The exchange file in the negotiations - Palestinian prisoners for hostages held by Hamas - became known as \"the keys\".",
      "During this phase of the talks, Hamas also relented on two long-standing demands: the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza in the first phase and a formal Israeli commitment to a total ceasefire.",
      "Sensing a breakthrough, the Egyptian mediator urgently dispatched Major General Ahmed Abdel Khaleq - who oversees the Palestinian portfolio in Egyptian intelligence - to Doha. After meeting with Hamas representatives, he secured confirmation the group would make what a senior Hamas official described as \"painful concessions.\"",
      "But on 6 January, according to a Palestinian official, Israel rejected the offer put forward by Hamas on the 11 hostages. Hamas responded by sending the BBC and other media outlets a list featuring the names and ages of 34 Israeli hostages. Two days later, the body of one of those on that list - Yosef\u00a0AlZayadni - was found inside Gaza.",
      "The list included reserve soldiers, which indicated Hamas was willing to release them in the first phase.",
      "This appeared to be an attempt to embarrass Netanyahu and rally hostage families in Israel and around the world to pressure him into accepting the deal.",
      "It was also an indication Hamas had not walked away.",
      "Metres apart",
      "Meetings stretching into the small hours of Doha's hot evenings became common during the final stretch of the negotiations.",
      "In the last month, they had developed into so-called \"proximity talks\", with both sides in the same two-storey building, according to multiple accounts from officials familiar with the details.",
      "A senior US official said Hamas's delegation was on the first floor and Israel's on the floor above. Mediators ran pieces of paper between them. Maps of Israeli troop withdrawal proposals and details about hostages or prisoners drafted for release were shuttled back and forth.",
      "\"That takes an enormous amount of work and, I have to say, all of that was not fully nailed down, really, until just the [final] hours,\" said the official.",
      "Inside the building, the delegations met separately with senior figures from Qatar and Egypt. Among those closely involved in the details was Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani.",
      "Two crucial areas were worked on in the final phases of the talks: the lists for release of hostages held by Hamas and Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, and the positions for Israeli troop withdrawals from populated areas in Gaza during phase one.",
      "By 9 January, the pressure had escalated. Trump's envoy, Biden's envoy, and the Egyptian intelligence chief convened in Doha for a serious eight-hour negotiation session.",
      "A senior Egyptian official told the BBC: \"We are at the closest point to reaching an agreement.\"",
      "Agreement had been reached on 90% of the outstanding issues, but further talks were required.",
      "Steve Witkoff, Trump's recently appointed Middle East envoy, was dispatched to Tel Aviv to meet Netanyahu. Though not yet officially in post, the New York property tycoon had become more and more involved in the talks, which Trump was taking a keen interest in.",
      "He was about to be sent on an assignment that proved to be pivotal.",
      "End game",
      "When Trump's man in the Middle East arrived in Israel on 11 January, it was the sabbath.",
      "Witkoff was asked to wait until the sabbath had ended before he met Netanyahu but, in a breach of custom, the envoy refused and demanded to meet the prime minister immediately.",
      "Netanyahu appears to have come under serious strong-arming during the meeting and the intervention from the Trump camp to get the Israeli government to set aside its final reservations seems to have been critical.",
      "The meeting was reportedly fractious and the message to Netanyahu from the incoming president was clear: Trump wants a deal - now get it done.",
      "Commenting on those talks, an Israeli official who asked to remain anonymous said it was a \"very important meeting\".",
      "When Witkoff returned to Doha, he remained in the room with the talks, spending time with Biden's envoy Mr McGurk, in what two US officials called a \"near unprecedented\" transition effort in American diplomacy.",
      "This week, Hamas official Bassem Naim told Al Arabiya he \"couldn't imagine that [the deal] could be possible without the pressure of the incoming administration led by President Trump\" - and specifically cited Witkoff's presence at the talks.",
      "By now, the fact a deal could be imminent was out in the open and public expectation was building - not least among the families of those being held hostage and Palestinians displaced inside Gaza.",
      "The final 72 hours of talks involved a constant back and forth over the finer points of how the deal would be implemented, according to one account.",
      "One source close to the negotiations described the hammering out of \"arrangements and logistics\" for how the hostages would be released in Gaza and for the withdrawal movements of Israeli troops.",
      "On 12 January, a senior Palestinian official familiar with the negotiations said \"all the officials are here in the same building\", adding: \"Tonight is decisive. We are only a few steps away from an agreement.\"",
      "That meeting lasted six hours - but, like so many times before, an impasse was reached.",
      "This time the disagreement that arose was over the mechanism for the return of displaced individuals from southern Gaza to the north.",
      "Israel wanted to search returnees and their vehicles to ensure no militants or military equipment were being transported - which Hamas refused to accept.",
      "Mediators proposed that Qatari and Egyptian technical teams conduct the searches instead. Both sides agreed and one of the final remaining stalemates was resolved.",
      "On 15 January shortly after 18:00, a Hamas negotiator wrote in a message to the BBC: \"Everything is finished.\"",
      "The podium was being readied.",

      "Over the last month the hospital has recorded 28 deaths and more than 50 injuries among its staff and patients because of intense shelling. This is the highest number of casualties recorded in a month since the siege began.",
      "\"Recent continuous attacks targeting Saudi Hospital have intensified dramatically, it has become part of our daily lives,\" Dr Ibo, a Darfuri who has lived in el-Fasher since 2011, told the BBC.",
      "He said the most frightening day had been when a team of medics were performing an emergency caesarean as the shelling began - a near-death experience for them all.",
      "''The first one hit the hospital's perimeter wall\u2026 [then] another shell hit the maternity operating room, the debris damaged the electrical generator, cutting off the power and plunging us into complete darkness,'' he said.",
      "The surgical team had no option but to use the torches on their phones to finish the two-hour operation.",
      "Part of the building had collapsed and the room was full of dust with shrapnel scattered all over the place.",
      "Dr Khatab Mohammed, who had been leading the surgery, described the dangers.",
      "\"The situation was dire, the environment was no longer sterile,\" the 29-year-old medic told the BBC.",
      "\"After ensuring our safety and the patient's safety from shrapnel, we cleaned her and changed our surgical gowns since our clothes were full of dust and we continued the surgery,\" he said, adding that the patient could have died from complications.",
      "After successfully delivering the baby, the doctors moved mother and new-born to another room to recover and then gathered to take a group photo.",
      "It was a testament to their survival, but Dr Mohammed added: \"I thought it might be our last photo, believing that another shell would hit the same spot and we would all die.\"",
      "They went on to perform two more life-saving emergency operations that day.",
      "These doctors - most of whom are graduates of the University of el-Fasher - have stayed put since Sudan's civil war erupted in April 2023.",
      "The conflict has pitted the army against the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and has caused the world's biggest humanitarian crisis, forcing more than 12 million people from their homes.",
      "The two rivals had been allies - coming to power together in a coup - but fell out over an internationally backed plan to move towards civilian rule.",
      "A year into the conflict, the siege of el-Fasher began. It is the only city still under army control in Darfur, where the RSF has been accused of carrying out ethnic cleansing against non-Arab communities.",
      "The RSF began attacking el-Fasher from three sides and cut off supply routes. In a report issued last month, the UN Human Rights Office said the fighting had left more that 780 civilians dead and more than 1,140 injured - many of them casualties of crossfire.",
      "The fighting has forced all other hospitals in el-Fasher to shut.",

      "It was near the frontline and was stormed in June by RSF fighters, who also looted medicine and equipment and assaulted staff.",
      "Saudi Hospital, which is run by the Ministry of Health and funded by non-governmental organisations, the UN and MSF, specialises in obstetrics and gynaecology but is now providing all medical services - it is the only place in North Darfur state with surgical capacity.",
      "Amid shortages of medical supplies, equipment and personnel, Saudi Hospital is facing ''a heart-breaking situation that violates all humanitarian and international laws and values'', its medical director, 28-year-old Mudathir Ibrahim Suleiman, told the BBC.",
      "He recalled how terrifying it was during recent bombings: \"Pregnant women, children and staff were in shock and paralysis, some people were injured and had to be pulled out the rubble.",
      "\"All the current conditions push us to consider stopping our work, but women and children have no other place to save their lives except this hospital,\" he said.",
      "\"The staff at the hospital are doing the impossible to save lives.\"",
      "All normal aspects of life have completely disappeared from el-Fasher, especially in the northern and eastern parts. The university, for example, operates via online learning, with exam centres established in safer cities like Kassala in eastern Sudan.",
      "With widespread hunger and insecurity, the city has also emptied. About half the population have sought refuge in the nearby Zamzam camp, where an estimated 500,000 people now live in famine conditions.",
      "Saudi Hospital also serves the camp, with MSF running ambulances to bring in emergency cases.",
      "But these have also recently started coming under attack, including an incident earlier this month when a gunman shot at a \"clearly marked ambulance with the MSF logo and flag\".",
      "\"We are horrified by this deadly attack on a humanitarian crew carrying out life-saving medical work where it's desperately needed,\" MSF's Michel Olivier Lacharit\u00e9 said in a statement.",

    "title": "India's pioneering female anthropologist who challenged Nazi race theories",
    "published": "Sun, 19 Jan 2025 04:28:01 GMT",
    "summary": "Irawati Karve, India's first female anthropologist, led a fascinating life that challenged patriarchal norms.",
    "story": [
      "Irawati Karve led a life that stood apart from those around her.",
      "Born in British-ruled India, and at a time when women didn't have many rights or freedoms, Karve did the unthinkable: she pursued higher studies in a foreign country, became a college professor and India's first female anthropologist.",
      "She also married a man of her choosing, swam in a bathing suit, drove a scooter and even dared to defy a racist hypothesis of her doctorate supervisor - a famous German anthropologist named Eugen Fischer.",
      "Her writings about Indian culture and civilisation and its caste system are ground-breaking, and are a part of the curriculum in Indian colleges. Yet she remains an  obscure figure in history and a lot about her life remains unknown.",
      "A new book titled Iru: The Remarkable Life of Irawati Karve, written by her granddaughter Urmilla Deshpande and academic Thiago Pinto Barbosa, sheds light on her fascinating life, and the many odds she braved to blaze an inspiring trail for the women, and men, who came after her.",
      "Born in 1905 in Burma (now Myanmar), Irawati was named after the Irrawaddy river. The only girl among six siblings, she was doted on by her family and brought up in comfort.",
      "But the young girl's life took unexpected turns, resulting in experiences that would shape her as a person. Apart from strong women, Irawati's life also crossed paths with empathetic, progressive men who paved the way for her to break barriers and cheered her on as she did so.",
      "At seven, Irawati was sent to boarding school in Pune - a rare opportunity from her father when most girls were pushed into marriage. In Pune, she met RP Paranjpye, a prominent educationist whose family unofficially adopted Irawati and raised her as their own.",
      "In the Paranjpye household, Irawati was exposed to a way of life that celebrated critical thinking and righteous living, even if that meant going against the grain of Indian society. Paranjpye, who Irawati fondly called \"appa\" or her \"second father\", was a man far ahead of his times.",
      "A college principal and staunch supporter of women's education, he was also an atheist. Through him, Irawati discovered the fascinating world of social sciences and its impact on society.",
      "When Irawati decided to pursue a doctorate in anthropology in Berlin, despite her biological father's objections, she found support in Paranjpye and her husband, Dinkar Karve, a professor of science.",
      "She arrived in the German city in 1927, after a days-long journey by ship, and began pursuing her degree under the mentorship of Fischer, a celebrated professor of anthropology and eugenics.",
      "At the time, Germany was still reeling from the impact of World War One and Hitler had not yet risen to power. But the spectre of anti-Semitism had begun raising its ugly head. Irawati bore witness to this hate when she found out one day that a Jewish student in her building had been murdered.",
      "In the book, the authors describe the fear, shock and disgust Irawati felt when she saw the man's body lying on the footpath outside her building, blood oozing across the concrete.",
      "Irawati wrestled with these emotions while working on the thesis assigned by Fischer: to prove that white Europeans were more logical and reasonable - and therefore racially superior to non-white Europeans. This involved meticulously studying and measuring 149 human skulls.",
      "Fischer hypothesised that white Europeans had asymmetrical skulls to accommodate larger right frontal lobes, supposedly a marker of higher intelligence. However, Irawati's research found no correlation between race and skull asymmetry.",
      "\"She had contradicted Fischer's hypothesis, of course, but also the theories of that institute and the mainstream theories of the time,\" the authors write in the book.",
      "She boldly presented her findings, risking her mentor's ire and her degree. Fischer gave her the lowest grade, but her research critically and scientifically rejected the use of human differences to justify discrimination. (Later, the Nazis would use Fischer's theories of racial superiority to further their agenda and Fischer would join the Nazi party.)",
      "Throughout her life, Irawati would display this streak of gumption combined with endless empathy, especially for the women she encountered.",
      "At a time when it was unthinkable for a woman to travel too far away from home, Irawati went on field trips to remote villages in India after returning to the country, sometimes with her male colleagues, at other times with her students and even her children, to study the lives of various tribespeople.",
      "She joined archaeological expeditions to recover 15,000-year-old bones, bridging the past and present. These gruelling trips took her deep into forests and rugged terrain for weeks or months, with the book describing her sleeping in barns or truck beds and often going days with little food.",
      "Irawati also bravely confronted societal and personal prejudices as she interacted with people from all walks of life.",
      "The authors describe how Irawati, a Chitpavan Brahmin from a traditionally vegetarian upper-caste Hindu community, bravely ate partially raw meat offered by a tribal leader she wished to study. She recognised it as a gesture of friendship and a test of loyalty, responding with openness and curiosity.",
      "Her studies fostered deep empathy for humanity, leading her to later criticise fundamentalism across religions, including Hinduism. She believed India belonged to everyone who called it home.",
      "The book recounts a moment when, reflecting on the horrors inflicted by the Nazis on the Jews, Irawati's mind wandered to a startling realisation that would forever alter her view of humanity.",
      "\"In these reflections, Irawati learned the most difficult of lessons from Hindu philosophy: all that is you, too,\" the authors write.",
      "Irawati died in 1970, but her legacy endures through her work and the people it continues to inspire."

      "\"Let me tell you something,\" he tells the BBC, \"those bodies really smelled bad\".",
      "When he got home later that day, he told his wife he could not eat the meat she had cooked.",
      "\"It's because when I spoke to the miners, they told me some of them had to eat other [people] inside the mine because there was no way they could find food. And they were also eating cockroaches,\" he said on a phone call from his home.",
      "Allegations that the miners resorted to eating human flesh in order to survive were also made by other miners who were rescued in December, in statements submitted to the high court.",
      "Mkwayi, a former convict, known locally as Shasha, lives in the township of Khuma that was close to the disused mine in Stilfontein. The 36-year-old, who had served seven years in prison for robbery, volunteered to go down to help with the rescue effort.",
      "\"I'm being rehabilitated by the correctional services and I volunteered because people in our community were seeking help for their children and brothers.",
      "\"The rescue company said they didn't have anyone who wanted to go down. So my friend Mandla and I agreed to volunteer so we could help our brothers to resurface and bring up the dead bodies.\"",
      "But even though he wanted to help, the 25-minute journey down the 2km (1.2 mile)-deep shaft filled him with terror.",
      "The crane would occasionally stop and start, leaving him dangling in the darkness. Once he got down into the mine, he was shocked by what he saw.",
      "\"There were lots of bodies, over 70 bodies, and around 200 or so people that were dehydrated.",
      "\"I felt very weak when I saw them, it was a painful thing to see. But Mandla and I decided we needed to be strong and not show them how we felt so we could motivate them.\"",
      "The miners who had been waiting for help for months, gave them a hero's welcome.",
      "\"They were very, very happy,\" he says.",
      "The miners had been stuck there following a nationwide police operation to end illicit mining at disused sites that had closed, as the industry \u2013 once the backbone of the country's economy \u2013 was shrinking.",
      "It was no longer profitable for mining multinationals to operate in many places, but the promise of still finding gold deposits was a magnet for many desperate people \u2013 particularly undocumented migrants.",
      "Thousands of shafts were abandoned.",
      "In November, police stepped up efforts at the Buffelsfontein mine in Stilfontein, surrounding the entrance to the shaft and refusing to let food and water go down.",
      "Before the rescue operation began on Monday, the local community had tried to take matters into their own hands by lowering a rope down the shaft to try and pull out some of the men.",
      "They also sent down messages and told the miners that help was coming.",
      "\"So when we got there, they were already waiting for the crane. Now when they see us, they see us as their presidents, as their messiahs: the people that came from outside into the hole to help them to resurface.\"",
      "The police say the illegal miners were always able to come out on their own but were refusing to do so because they feared arrest. But Mkwayi disagrees: \"It's a lie that people didn't want to come out. Those people were desperate for help, they were dying.\"",
      "While at the mine site on Tuesday, the BBC saw dozens of the rescued men.",
      "They appeared emaciated, their bones visible through their clothes. Some could barely walk and had to be helped by medical staff.",
      "In statements submitted to the high court, the illegal miners describe in graphic details the slow and painful death of their peers. They say many died of starvation.",
      "\"From September through October 2024, the absence of even basic sustenance was absolute, and survival became a daily battle against starvation,\" one miner was recorded as saying.",
      "Mkwayi says the men he rescued were so frail that the rescue cage that is only meant to carry seven healthy adults could take 13 of them.",
      "\"They were very dehydrated and had lost weight so we managed to fit more into the cage, because they wouldn't have survived another two days down in the hole. They would be dead if we didn't get them out as soon as possible.\"",
      "The volunteers were also in charge of bringing up dead bodies.",
      "\"The rescue services gave us bags and told us to put the bodies in them and bring them up in the cage which we did with the help of some of the miners.\"",
      "The rescue operation was initially meant to last at least a week, but after just three days, the volunteers said no-one was left underground.",
      "The authorities sent a camera down the shaft to do a final sweep. They say the mine will now be permanently sealed.",
      "But the experience has deeply impacted Mkwayi.",
      "At one point during the call he asks for a question to be repeated, explaining that his hearing has been affected since going down into the mine, presumably by the pressure.",
      "But the hardest impact has been from what he witnessed.",
      "\"I have to tell you, I am traumatised. I will never forget the sight of these people for the rest of my life.\"",
      "For activists and trade unions helping the community, the death of the 87 people in the mine amounts to a \"massacre\" perpetrated by the authorities.",
      "The use of the emotive word has drawn comparisons with the shooting dead by police of 34 striking miners in Marikana, some 150km (93 miles) away from Stilfontein, in 2012.",
      "But this time no triggers were pulled. Instead it seems many of the men starved to death.",
      "The authorities reject the idea they were responsible.",
      "The government initiated the crackdown on illicit mining in December 2023 through Operation Vala Umgodi (meaning \"close the hole\" in isiZulu).",
      "The abandoned mines had been taken over by gangs, often led by former employees, which sold what was found on the black market.",
      "People were co-opted into this illicit trade, either by force or voluntarily, and made to spend months underground digging for minerals. The government says illegal mining cost South Africa's economy $3.2bn (\u00a32.6bn) in 2024 alone.",
      "As part of the police operation, entry points at various disused mines were blocked, along with food and water supplies, in a bid to flush out the illegal miners, known locally as zama zamas (which translates as \"take a chance\").",
      "While Vala Umgodi was largely successful in other provinces, the old Buffelsfontein gold mine presented a unique challenge.",
      "Prior to the police operation, most of the miners were only able to get underground through a makeshift pulley system operated by people at the surface.",
      "But they then abandoned the top of the mineshaft when security officials arrived in large numbers in August, leaving those in the mine stranded.",
      "Community members then stepped in to help, pulling a few people up using ropes, but this was a long, arduous process.",
      "Other difficult and dangerous exits were available and in all nearly 2,000 resurfaced - most were arrested and remain in police custody.",
      "Why others did not come out is not clear \u2013 they may have been too weak or were being threatened by gang members in the mine - but they were left in desperate circumstances.",
      "Out of the 87 who died, only two have been identified, police said on Thursday, explaining that the fact that many were undocumented migrants made the process harder.",
      "\"We hold the view that government has blood on its hands,\" Magnificent Mndebele from the Mining Affected Communities United in Action group (Macua), told the BBC.",
      "He argued that the miners were given no warning about what was about to happen before the police operation began.",
      "Over the past two months, Macua has been at the forefront of the various court battles initiated to compel the government to first allow supplies and then undertake a rescue operation.",
      "Its blaming of the government echoes earlier statements from families who had said that the authorities had killed their loved ones.",
      "They had taken a hard line since the operation intensified. In November, one minister, Khumbudzo Ntshavheni, made the now infamous statement during a press briefing that they were going to \"smoke them out\".",
      "The state refused to allow food to be sent down or anyone to help retrieve the miners, only caving in after several successful court applications.",
      "In November, small portions of instant maize and water made it down the shaft, but in a court statement, one of the miners said it was not enough for the hundreds of men down below, many of whom were too weak to even chew and swallow them.",
      "More food was delivered in December, but again it could not sustain the men.",
      "Given that the operation to bring up the men and bodies lasted just three days, what is hard for Mr Mndebele to understand is why this could not have been done sooner, when it was clear there was an issue.",

    "title": "How deep ocean oxygen could give clues about extraterrestrial life",
    "published": "Sat, 18 Jan 2025 01:05:32 GMT",
    "summary": "Gas from the seafloor has scientists wondering if oxygen could be found in the oceans of other planets.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists who recently discovered that metal lumps on the dark seabed make oxygen, have announced plans to study the deepest parts of Earth's oceans in order to understand the strange phenomenon.",
      "Their mission could \"change the way we look at the possibility of life on other planets too,\" the researchers say.",
      "The initial discovery confounded marine scientists. It was previously accepted that oxygen could only be produced in sunlight by plants - in a process called photosynthesis.",
      "If oxygen - a vital component of life - is made in the dark by metal lumps, the researchers believe that process could be happening on other planets, creating oxygen-rich environments where life could thrive.",
      "Lead researcher Prof Andrew Sweetman explained: \"We are already in conversation with experts at Nasa who believe dark oxygen could reshape our understanding of how life might be sustained on other planets without direct sunlight.",
      "\"We want to go out there and figure out what exactly is going on.\"",
      "A dark, controversial discovery",
      "The initial discovery triggered a global scientific row - there was criticism of the findings from some scientists and from deep sea mining companies that plan to harvest the precious metals in the seabed nodules.",
      "If oxygen is produced at these extreme depths, in total darkness, that calls into question what life could survive and thrive on the seafloor, and what impact mining activities could have on that marine life.",
      "That means that seabed mining companies and environmental organisations - some of which claimed that the findings provided evidence that seafloor mining plans should be halted - will be watching this new investigation closely.",
      "The plan is to work at sites where the seabed is more than 10km (6.2 miles) deep, using remotely operated submersible equipment.",
      "\"We have instruments that can go to the deepest parts of the ocean,\" explained Prof Sweetman. \"We're pretty confident we'll find it happening elsewhere, so we'll start probing what's causing it.\"",
      "Some of those experiments, in collaboration with scientists at Nasa, will aim to understand whether the same process could allow microscopic life to thrive beneath oceans that are on other planets and moons.",
      "\"If there's oxygen,\" said Prof Sweetman, \"there could be microbial life taking advantage of that.\"",
      "To mine or not to mine",
      "The initial, biologically baffling findings were published last year in the journal Nature Geoscience. They came from several expeditions to an area of the deep sea between Hawaii and Mexico, where Prof Sweetman and his colleagues sent sensors to the seabed - at about 5km (3.1 miles) depth.",
      "That area is part of a vast swathe of seafloor that is covered with the naturally occurring metal nodules, which form when dissolved metals in seawater collect on fragments of shell - or other debris. It's a process that takes millions of years.",
      "Sensors that the team deployed repeatedly showed oxygen levels going up.",
      "\"I just ignored it, Prof Sweetman told BBC News at the time, \"because I'd been taught that you only get oxygen through photosynthesis\".",
      "Eventually, he and his colleagues stopped ignoring their readings and set out instead to understand what was going on. Experiments in their lab - with nodules that the team collected submerged in beakers of seawater - led the scientists to conclude that the metallic lumps were making oxygen out of seawater. The nodules, they found, generated electric currents that could split (or electrolyse) molecules of seawater into hydrogen and oxygen.",
      "Then came the backlash, in the form of rebuttals - posted online - from scientists and from seabed mining companies.",
      "One of the critics, Michael Clarke from the Metals Company, a Canadian deep sea mining company, told BBC News that the criticism was focused on a \"lack of scientific rigour in the experimental design and data collection\". Basically, he and other critics claimed there was no oxygen production - just bubbles that the equipment produced during sample collection.",
      "\"We've ruled out that possibility,\" Prof Sweetman responded. \"But these [new] experiments will provide the proof.\"",
      "This might seem a niche, technical argument, but several multi-billion pound mining companies are already exploring the possibility of harvesting tonnes of these metals from the seafloor.",
      "The natural deposits they are targeting contain metals vital for making batteries, and demand for those metals is increasing rapidly as many economies move from fossil fuels to, for example, electric vehicles.",
      "The race to extract those resources has caused concern among environmental groups and researchers. More than 900 marine scientists from 44 countries have signed a petition\u00a0highlighting the environmental risks and calling for a pause on mining activity.",
      "Talking about his team's latest research mission at a press conference on Friday, Prof Sweetman said: \"Before we do anything, we need to - as best as possible - understand the [deep sea] ecosystem.",
      "\"I think the right decision is to hold off before we decide if this is the right thing to do as a a global society.\""

    "published": "Sat, 18 Jan 2025 02:51:08 GMT",
    "summary": "The Cholas were a powerful south Indian dynasty known for military conquests, grand temples and shaping global trade and culture.",
    "story": [
      "It's 1000 CE - the heart of the Middle Ages.",
      "Europe is in flux. The powerful nations we know today - like Norman-ruled England and the fragmented territories that will go on to become France - do not yet exist. Towering Gothic cathedrals have yet to rise. Aside from the distant and prosperous city of Constantinople, few great urban centres dominate the landscape.",
      "Yet that year, on the other side of the globe, an emperor from southern India was preparing to build the world's most colossal temple.",
      "Completed just 10 years later, it was 216ft (66m) tall, assembled from 130,000 tonnes of granite: second only to Egypt's pyramids in height. At its heart was a 12ft tall emblem of the Hindu god Shiva, sheathed in gold encrusted with rubies and pearls.",
      "In its lamplit hall were 60 bronze sculptures, adorned with thousands of pearls gathered from the conquered island of Lanka. In its treasuries were several tonnes of gold and silver coins, as well as necklaces, jewels, trumpets and drums torn from defeated kings across India's southern peninsula, making the emperor the richest man of the era.",
      "He was called Raja-Raja, King of Kings, and he belonged to one of the most astonishing dynasties of the medieval world: the Cholas.",
      "His family transformed how the medieval world worked - yet they are largely unknown outside India.",
      "Prior to the 11th Century, the Cholas had been one of the many squabbling powers that dotted the Kaveri floodplain, the great body of silt that flows through India's present-day state of Tamil Nadu.",
      "But what set the Cholas apart was their endless capacity for innovation. By the standards of the medieval world, Chola queens were also remarkably prominent, serving as the dynasty's public face.",
      "Travelling to Tamil villages and rebuilding small, old mud-brick shrines in gleaming stone, the Chola dowager Sembiyan Mahadevi \u2013 Rajaraja's great-aunt \u2013 effectively \"rebranded\" the family as the foremost devotees of Shiva, winning them a popular following.",
      "Sembiyan prayed to Nataraja, a hitherto little-known form of Hindu god Shiva as the King of Dance, and all her temples featured him prominently.",
      "The trend caught on. Today, Nataraja is one of the most recognisable symbols of Hinduism. But to the medieval Indian mind, Nataraja was really a symbol of the Cholas.",
      "The emperor, Rajaraja Chola, shared his great-aunt's taste for public relations and devotion - with one significant difference.",
      "Rajaraja was also a conqueror. In the 990s, he led his armies over the Western Ghats, the range of hills that shelter India's west coast, and burned the ships of his enemies while they were at port.",
      "Next, exploiting internal turmoil on the island of Lanka, he established a Chola outpost there, becoming the first mainland Indian king to set up a lasting presence on the island. At last, he broke into the rugged Deccan Plateau - the Germany to the Tamil coast's Italy - and seized a portion of it for himself.",
      "The loot of conquest was lavished on his great imperial temple, known today as the Brihadishvara.",
      "In addition to its precious treasures, the great temple received 5,000 tonnes of rice annually, from conquered territory across southern India (you'd need a fleet of twelve Airbus A380s to carry that much rice today).",
      "This allowed the Brihadishvara to function as a mega-ministry of public works and welfare, an instrument of the Chola state, intended to channel Rajaraja's vast fortunes into new irrigation systems, expanding cultivation, and vast new herds of sheep and buffalo. Few states in the world could have conceived of economic control at such scale and depth.",
      "The Cholas were as important to the Indian Ocean as the Mongols were to inner Eurasia.",
      "Rajaraja Chola's successor, Rajendra, built alliances with Tamil merchant corporations: a partnership between traders and government power that foreshadowed the East India Company - a powerful British trading corporation that later ruled large parts of India - that was to come more than 700 years later.",
      "In 1026, Rajendra put his troops on merchants' ships and sacked Kedah, a Malay city that dominated the global trade in precious woods and spices.",
      "While some Indian nationalists have proclaimed this to be a Chola \"conquest\" or \"colonisation\" in Southeast Asia, archaeology suggests a stranger picture: the Cholas didn't seem to have a navy of their own, but under them, a wave of Tamil diaspora merchants spread across the Bay of Bengal.",
      "By the late 11th Century, these merchants ran independent ports in northern Sumatra. A century later, they were deep in present-day Myanmar and Thailand, and worked as tax collectors in Java.",
      "In the 13th Century, in Mongol-ruled China under the descendants of Kublai Khan, Tamil merchants ran successful businesses in the port of Quanzhou, and even erected a temple to Shiva on the coast of the East China Sea. It was no coincidence that, under the British Raj in the 19th Century, Tamils made up the largest chunk of Indian administrators and workers in Southeast Asia.",
      "Conquests and global connections made Chola-ruled south India a cultural and economic behemoth, the nexus of planetary trade networks.",
      "Chola aristocrats invested war-loot into a wave of new temples, which sourced fine goods from a truly global economy linking the farthest shores of Europe and Asia. Copper and tin for their bronzes came from Egypt, perhaps even Spain. Camphor and sandalwood for the gods were sourced from Sumatra and Borneo.",
      "Tamil temples grew into vast complexes and public spaces, surrounded by markets and endowed with rice estates. In the Chola capital region on the Kaveri, corresponding to the present-day city of Kumbakonam, a constellation of a dozen temple-towns supported populations of tens of thousands, possibly outclassing most cities in Europe at the time.",
      "These Chola cities were astonishingly multicultural and multireligious: Chinese Buddhists rubbed shoulders with Tunisian Jews, Bengali tantric masters traded with Lankan Muslims.",
      "Today, the state of Tamil Nadu is one of India's most urbanised.  Many of the state's towns grew around Chola-period shrines and markets.",
      "These developments in urbanism and architecture were paralleled in art and literature.",
      "Medieval Tamil metalwork, produced for Chola-period temples, is perhaps the finest ever made by human hand, the artists rivalling Michelangelo or Donatello for their appreciation of the human figure. To praise Chola kings and adore the gods, Tamil poets developed notions of sainthood, history and even magical realism. The Chola period was what you'd get if the Renaissance had happened in south India 300 years before its time.",
      "It is not a coincidence that Chola bronzes - especially Nataraja bronzes - can be found in most major Western museum collections. Scattered across the world, they are the remnants of a period of brilliant political innovations, of maritime expeditions that connected the globe; of titanic shrines and fabulous wealth; of merchants, rulers and artists who shaped the planet we live in today.",

    "story": [
      "After lying hidden beneath metres of volcanic rock and ash for 2,000 years, a \"once-in-a-century\" find has been unearthed in the ancient Roman city of Pompeii in Italy.",
      "Archaeologists have discovered a sumptuous private bathhouse - potentially the largest ever found there - complete with hot, warm and cold rooms, exquisite artwork, and a huge plunge pool.",
      "The spa-like complex sits at the heart of a grand residence uncovered over the last two years during a major excavation.",
      "\"It's these spaces that really are part of the 'Pompeii effect' - it's almost as if the people had only left a minute ago,\" says Dr Gabriel Zuchtriegel, director of the Archaeological Park of Pompeii, who has revealed the new find exclusively to BBC News.",
      "Analysis of two skeletons discovered in the house also shows the horror faced by Pompeii's inhabitants when Mount Vesuvius erupted in AD79.",
      "The bodies belonged to a woman, aged between 35 and 50, who was clutching jewellery and coins, and a younger man in his teens or early 20s.",
      "They had barricaded themselves into a small room, but were killed as a tsunami of superheated volcanic gas and ash - known as a pyroclastic flow - ripped through the town.",
      "\"This is a dramatic place, and everything you find here tells you about the drama,\" says Pompeii conservator, Dr Ludovica Alesse.",
      "A third of the ancient city still lies hidden beneath volcanic debris from the disaster, but the new excavation - the most extensive in a generation - provides new insights into ancient Roman life.",
      "The archaeologists have been followed by a documentary team from the BBC and Lion TV, for a series called Pompeii: The New Dig.",
      "An entire block of Pompeii has now been uncovered, revealing a laundry and bakery, as well as the large private house. It's thought these were all owned by one wealthy individual, possibly Aulus Rustius Verus, an influential Pompeii politician.",
      "The discovery of the bathhouse is further confirmation of his elite status, says Dr Zuchtriegel.",
      "\"There are just a few houses that have a private bath complex, so it was something really for the wealthiest of the wealthy,\" he says. \"And this is so huge - it's probably the biggest bath complex in a Pompeiian private home.\"",
      "Those lucky enough to use the suite of bathing rooms would have undressed in a changing room with vibrant red walls and a mosaic floor dotted with geometric patterns inlaid with marble from across the Roman Empire.",
      "They would then head to the hot room, taking a dip in a bath and enjoying the sauna-like warmth, provided by a suspended floor that allowed hot air to flow underneath and walls with a cavity where the heat could circulate.",
      "Next they would move to the brightly-painted warm room, where oil would be rubbed into the skin, before being scraped off with a curved instrument called a strigil.",
      "Finally, they would enter the largest and most spectacular room of all - the frigidarium, or cold room. Surrounded by red columns and frescoes of athletes, a visitor could cool off in the plunge pool, which is so large 20-30 people could fit in it.",
      "\"In the hot summers, you could sit with your feet in the water, chatting with your friends, maybe enjoying a cup of wine,\" says Dr Zuchtriegel.",
      "The bathhouse is the latest find to emerge from this extraordinary house.",
      "A huge banqueting room with jet black walls and breathtaking artwork of classical scenes was found last year. A smaller, more intimate room - painted in pale blue - where residents of the house would go and pray to the gods was also unearthed.",
      "The residence was mid-renovation - tools and building materials have been found throughout. In the blue room a pile of oyster shells lie on the floor, ready to be ground up and applied to the walls to give them an iridescent shimmer.",
      "Next door to this beautiful space, in a cramped room with barely any decoration, a stark discovery was made - the remains of two Pompeiians who failed to escape from the eruption.",
      "The skeleton of a woman was found lying on top of a bed, curled up in a foetal position. The body of a man was in the corner of this small room.",
      "\"The pyroclastic flow from Vesuvius came along the street just outside this room, and caused a wall to collapse, and that had basically crushed him to death,\" explains Dr Sophie Hay, an archaeologist at Pompeii.",
      "\"The woman was still alive while he was dying - imagine the trauma - and then this room filled with the rest of the pyroclastic flow, and that's how she died.\"",
      "Analysis of the male skeleton showed that despite his young age, his bones had signs of wear and tear, suggesting he was of lower status, possibly even a slave.",
      "The woman was older, but her bones and teeth were in good condition.",
      "\"She was probably someone higher up in society,\" says Dr Hay. \"She could have been the wife of the owner of the house - or maybe an assistant looking after the wife, we just don't know.\"",
      "An assortment of items were found on a marble table top in the room - glassware, bronze jugs and pottery - perhaps brought into the room where the pair had tucked themselves away hoping to wait out the eruption.",
      "But it's the items clutched by the victims that are of particular interest. The younger man held some keys, while the older woman was found with gold and silver coins and jewellery.",
      "These are kept in Pompeii's vault, along with the city's other priceless finds, and we were given a chance to see them with archaeologist, Dr Alessandro Russo.",
      "The gold coins still gleam as if they were new, and he shows us delicate gold and natural pearl earrings, necklace pendants and intricately etched semi-precious stones.",
      "\"When we find this kind of object, the distance from ancient times and modern times disappears,\" Dr Russo says, \"and we can touch a small piece of the life of these people who died in the eruption.\"",
      "Dr Sophie Hay describes the private bathhouse complex as a once-in-a-century discovery, which also sheds more light on a darker side of Roman life.",
      "Just behind the hot room is a boiler room. A pipe brought water in from the street - with some syphoned off into the cold plunge pool - and the rest was heated in a lead boiler destined for the hot room. The valves that regulated the flow look so modern it's as if you could turn them on and off even today.",
      "With a furnace sitting beneath, the conditions in this room would have been unbearably hot for the slaves who had to keep the whole system going.",
      "\"The most powerful thing from these excavations is that stark contrast between the lives of the slaves and the very, very rich. And here we see it,\" says Dr Sophie Hay.",
      "\"The difference between the sumptuous life of the bathhouse, compared to the furnace room, where the slaves would be feeding the fire toiling all day.",
      "\"A wall is all that could divide you between two different worlds.\"",
      "The excavation is in its final weeks - but new discoveries continue to emerge from the ash. Limited numbers of visitors are allowed to visit the dig while it's ongoing, but eventually it will be fully opened to the public.",
      "\"Every day here is a surprise,\" says Dr Anna Onesti, director of the excavation.",
      "\"Sometimes in the morning I come to work thinking that it's a normal working day - and then I discover we found something exceptional.",

      "And the politicians \u2013 pressed to balance national concerns about China with TikTok's massive American user base - are taking note. This includes the incoming president, who is both a politician and a businessman.",
      "Shortly after the top court's ruling, President-elect Donald Trump posted on Truth Social saying he would review the situation, but everyone must respect the Supreme Court decision.",

      "\"President Trump alone possesses the consummate dealmaking expertise, the electoral mandate, and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform,\" the brief read.",

      "If the incoming president can ultimately find a way to satisfy national security concerns while keeping TikTok up and running in the US, it would provide him with an opportunity to post an early political win in his second term and be celebrated by TikTok's loyal users.",

As had been predicted, however, the outgoing Democratic president punted enforcement of the ban to Donald Trump, who will become president at noon on Monday.",
      "The Supreme Court, in its unsigned opinion with no dissents, avoided weighing in on these kind of political calculations. The justices sided with a lower court that upheld the constitutionality of the law that could ban the popular social media service if it is not sold by midnight on Sunday.",
      "While the court's opinion is narrow \u2013 the justices acknowledge the time pressure they were under to issue this decision \u2013 it firmly establishes that the constitutional protections of free speech contained in the First Amendment to the US Constitution do not save TikTok.",
      "In fact, the justices found that the TikTok ban, which Congress justified on the basis of protecting national security by preventing an adversary from collecting troves of data on tens of millions of American users, had a lower bar to clear than laws that directly regulate speech content.",
      "The court sidestepped other tricky issues \u2013 such as whether concerns about Chinese influence on TikTok's algorithm justified a ban. But expect that to come up in future policy debates in Congress.",
      "With the court's decision, TikTok has exhausted its last legal recourse to avoid the ban from going into effect. For Trump, however, the TikTok ban is his first presidential challenge \u2013 but also his first political opportunity."

      "Donald Trump has promised big changes for the world's largest economy.",
      "An \"end to the devastating inflation crisis\", tariffs and big cuts to taxes, regulation and the size of government are all on the agenda.",
      "This combination, he says, will ignite an economic boom and revive withering faith in the American dream.",
      "\"We're at the beginning of a great, beautiful golden age of business,\" he pledged from the podium at Mar-a-Lago earlier this month.",
      "But looming over the president-elect are warnings that many of his policies are more likely to hurt the economy than help it.",
      "And as he prepares to set his plans in motion, analysts say he is about to run into political and economic realities that will make it hard to deliver all his promises.",
      "\"There's no clear path forward at this time for how to meet all these goals because they're inherently contradictory,\" said Romina Boccia, director of budget and entitlement policy at the Cato Institute.",
      "Here's a closer look at his key promises.",
      "Tackling inflation",
      "What Trump promised:",
      "\"Prices will come down\", he said repeatedly.",
      "It was a risky pledge - prices rarely fall, unless there is an economic crisis.",
      "Inflation, which measures not price levels but the rate of price increases, has already come down significantly, while proving tough to stamp out completely.",
      "What complicates it:",
      "Trump pinned his claim to promises to expand already-record US oil and gas production, reducing energy costs. But the forces that affect inflation, and energy prices, are mostly outside presidential control.",
      "To the extent that White House policies make a difference, analysts have warned that many of Trump's ideas - including tax cuts, tariffs and migrant deportations - risk making the problem worse.",
      "Economist John Cochrane of the right-leaning Hoover Institution said the big question facing the economy is how Trump will juggle \"tension\" between the more traditional pro-business parts of his coalition and the \"nationalists\" who are focused on issues such as border control and rivalry with China.",
      "\"Clearly both camps can't get what they want,\" he said. \"That's going to be the fundamental story and that's why we don't know what's going to happen.\"",
      "What Trump voters want:",
      "Inflation promises were key to Trump's victory but by many measures, such as  growth and job creation, the economy overall was not in the dire straits he painted on the campaign trail.",
      "Since his win, he has tried to lower expectations, warning it would be \"very hard\" to bring down prices.",
      "Amanda Sue Mathis, 34, of Michigan, says she thinks Trump's promises are feasible but could take time.",
      "\"If anybody can make better deals to make things more affordable for Americans, it's Donald Trump,\" she said. \"He literally wrote the book on the art of deal making.\"",
      "Imposing blanket tariffs",
      "What Trump promised:",
      "Trump's most unorthodox economic promise was his vow to place tariffs - a border tax - of at least 10% on all goods coming into the US, which would rise to more than 60% for products from China.",
      "He has since ramped up the threats against specific countries, including allies such as Canada, Mexico and Denmark.",
      "Some of Trump's advisers have suggested the tariffs are negotiating tools for other issues, like border security, and he will ultimately settle for a more targeted, or gradual approach.",
      "What complicates it:",
      "The debate has raised speculation about how aggressive Trump will decide to be, given the potential economic risks.",
      "Analysts say tariffs are likely to lead to higher prices for Americans and pain for companies hit by foreign retaliation.",
      "And unlike Trump's first term, any measures will arrive at a delicate moment, as the long-running US economic expansion appears to be in its final stages.",
      "Even if the toughest tariffs never materialise, the policy debate alone is generating uncertainty that could depress investment and reduce growth in the US by as much as 0.6% by mid-2025, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "\"They've got a very limited margin for error,\" Michael Cembalest, the chairman of market and investment strategy for JP Morgan Asset Management said in a recent podcast. He warned the desire for a major overhaul was likely to \"break something\", though what remains to be seen.",

      "\"There's always tensions. There's never perfection in the policy world. And obviously one of the reasons that I think he was re-elected is concerns over inflation,\" he said.",

      "\"Not saying he won't put tariffs on anything - I think he will - but I think it's going to be more strategic of exactly what he puts tariffs on. I support that and I feel like his judgement is good enough to decide what to tariff.\"",

      "What Trump promised:",
      "He has put forward a growth plan - lower taxes, less regulation and a smaller government, which he says will unleash American business.",
      "What complicates it:",
      "But analysts say cutting regulation might take longer than expected. And Trump is widely expected to prioritise extending expiring tax cuts above cutting spending.",
      "Ms Boccia of the Cato Institute said she expected borrowing to surge under the Trump administration and the rise to add to inflation pressures.",

      "Civilians in Gaza are waiting anxiously for a pause in 15 relentless months of war, after Israel's cabinet approved a temporary ceasefire and hostage release deal with Hamas.",
      "Israel has pounded the strip with air strikes, killing at least 113 people since the deal was first agreed in principle on Wednesday night, according to the Hamas-run civil defence agency in Gaza.",
      "The deal, finalised on Friday afternoon, is due to come into effect on Sunday, leaving a little over 24 hours more for the people of Gaza to hang on for respite.",
      "\"Time is moving slower than ever,\" said Dr Abdallah Shabir, 27, an emergency doctor at the Baptist Hospital in Gaza City. \"Any moment you can lose your life,\" he said. \"Sitting at home, walking in the street - there is no warning.\"",
      "Dr Shabir was on shift at the hospital on Wednesday night when the news of the ceasefire agreement came through. There was a brief moment of joy, he said, but less than an hour separated the announcement from the beginning of a wave of air strikes that sent a flood of dead and wounded to the Baptist.",
      "Every member of staff was summoned. \"It was as bad as we have ever seen,\" Dr Shabir said, in a phone call from the hospital. \"Severe injuries, severe burns. Many dead, of course.\"",
      "Among the dead brought in on Thursday was a colleague, Hala Abu Ahmed, a 27-year-old specialist in internal medicine who two colleagues at the Baptist described as a devoted and promising young doctor and a kind person.",

They lack basic needs like warm clothes. I would not call these living conditions, they are not conditions fit for human beings.\"",
      "In Gaza on Friday, some were focused on Sunday, and whether they would make it to that respite without the deal falling apart.",

    "summary": "As the Palisades Fire exploded in his hometown, the actor was moving abandoned cars so emergency vehicles could get through. He spoke about the importance of making a difference; and about caring for his late father, Stanley, whom he calls his \"anchor.\"",
    "story": [
      "On January 7, as the Palisades Fire exploded, a man interrupted a reporter's live shot. It was Steve Guttenberg, one of the biggest movie stars of the 1980s and '90s. He had been moving cars \u2013 abandoned by people around Pacific Palisades trying to escape the encroaching fire \u2013 so that emergency vehicles could get through.",
      "\"What's happening is, people take their keys with them as if they're in a parking lot. This is not a parking lot,\" he told KTLA. \"If you leave your car behind, leave the key in there so a guy like me can move your car so that these fire trucks can get up there.\"",
      "He can't remember how he got to safety.",
      "Many days later, with much of his hometown reduced to ruins, he was still there to help protect his and his neighbors' homes. He showed me a part of Sunset that had been stacked with cars. \"Yeah, couldn't get through,\" he said. \"So, I was moving some of these cars over there. And then, a lotta these cars just didn't have keys in them. Locked.\"",
      "I asked, \"What is it in you that is compelling you to stay here?\"",
      "\"You know, it's not often in life that you feel like you can make a difference,\" he replied. \"And I really feel like I can make a difference. Like, I'm able bodied, I'm strong, I have a heart, and I care. And this is what I'm supposed to do today.\"",
      "If you know Guttenberg, you know he's a helper. Seven years ago, he put everything on hold to care for someone with whom he was deeply in love: his father.",
      "I noted, \"I'm gonna try to get through this interview without crying because I lost my dad.\"",
      "Guttenberg asked, \"What was your dad's name?\"",
      "\"Douglas.\"",
      "\"Hi, Douglas!\" Guttenberg said. \"You know, when you say a person's name who's passed, they come around. I believe they're not always with you, 'cause they've got other things to do. But Douglas is here, and so is Stanley, my dad.",
      "\"My dad was the greatest,\" he said. \"He was the first man who ever held me, first guy I ever looked in his eyes. And I fell in love with my dad.\"",
      "Guttenberg has written a book about his journey as a caregiver for the man he calls his hero. It's called \"Time to Thank.\" \"My dad and his dad weren't close,\" he said. \"My grandfather was cold. He wasn't a kissing, hugging type of dad to my father. So, my dad was the opposite.\"",
      "A \"kissing and hugging dad\" who worked jobs that weren't exactly touchy-feely. \"He was an Airborne Army Ranger. He was a New York City policeman. He was a power lifter and a weightlifter. And he did handstands for 20 minutes.\"",
      "Guttenberg's dad was a hands-on parent, so it was to Steve's surprise that when he wanted to move to L.A., at only 17, to try to become a movie star, he was allowed to do it. \"My parents gave me $300 and said, 'You got two weeks.' And I got a Kentucky Fried Chicken commercial. And my parents let me stay another two weeks. And I got a little movie [\"The Chicken Chronicles\"]. And I got more commercials. Then, I actually stayed a year, before I quit and went back to school.\"",
      "He wasn't in school for long when Hollywood beckoned him back. \"I was at a party in my suite at Albany State, and got this call from my agent. Everybody was a little \u2026 inebriated!\" he laughed. \"And my agent said, 'I got an audition for you. It was called \"Boys From Brazil.\" And it was gonna be starring Greg Peck and Larry Olivier and James Mason, Uta Hagen.'\"",
      "\"It's hard to turn that down, right?\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah! I asked my dad. My dad said, 'You know, just go down and do the audition. if you get it, you'll decide. And I got the job.\"",
      "Guttenberg says it was Laurence Olivier who taught him humility, but it was his dad who helped him get his big break in a little film about a bunch of misfits joining the police force. \"I told my dad that I had a screen test coming up for this movie, 'Police Academy.' And he said, 'Oh, you should wear my police academy shirt.' I remember going to the screen test, and I was up against another actor who was really talented,. And the director said, 'Hold on here: Did you make that shirt, boy?' And I said, 'No, that's my dad's real police academy shirt.' And half a day later my agent called me and said, 'You got it.' And maybe it was because of that cadet shirt that my dad gave me.\"",
      "Guttenberg would go on to become one of the busiest actors of his generation, with more than 100 films and TV shows under his belt, including \"Diner,\" \"Three Men and a Baby, \"Cocoon,\" and \"Short Circuit.\" All the while his dad was there ready to bring him back to reality, often calling before the rest of L.A. got out of bed. Guttenberg says he never missed that 6:00 a.m. call.\u00a0 \"No, I always had to be home at six o'clock. Even if I got home at 5 to 6:00! I had to answer that phone. He was my anchor.\"",
      "So when his dad was diagnosed with kidney failure while living in Phoenix, Guttenberg got in his car, driving 400 miles every week to care for his father. \"The drive really gave me time to think, and time to thank,\" he said.",
      "Steve and his siblings even become home dialysis techs, but only he couldn't accept the inevitable. \"I gave him a hug. And something didn't sound right. And we had a nurse with us, and the nurse put a stethoscope to him. And she said, 'He's gone.' And I said, 'No!' And I started doing CPR on him. I just couldn't accept it at that moment.\"",
      "Asked when he could finally let him go, Guttenberg replied, \"I probably let him go a year later. It's hard to believe that he's gone. I still think that he's here.\"",
      "\"He is,\" I said. \"Just say his name.\"",
      "\"Stanley!\"",
      "And right now, Guttenberg thinks his father is sending along some helpful advice. \"I feel my dad's around, yeah, I really do. I feel my dad is here with me. And I think he's also saying, 'Steven, enough. Get outta there.'\"",
      "So far, his own home is standing. But Steve Guttenberg says it's time to listen to his dad. \"You know, the truth is, no matter how big your house is, no matter how much money you have, how expensive your car, at the end of it, you're walking down the street with a little suitcase of a few things that you saved, and you're looking for someone to tell you where to go.\"",

      "And I was ready. Because I'd been collecting. I had enough fireworks to last the whole summer. I took every penny I made from my Newsday delivery route and poured them into \"belts,\" these macho configurations of 144 firecrackers. These particular belts came straight from China, with Chinese calligraphy on the wrapper, and to my young perspective, they were the ultimate asset. Better than gold.",
      "I bought belt after belt from Andy Mahoney, who was notorious in my neighborhood for lighting my neighbor's garage on fire with a chlorine bomb. He was an anti-hero, a rebel with a cause, five years older than I was. The only reason he talked with me was because I was buying from him.",
      "Initially I kept all that gunpowder in the ingenious hideaway I'd devised: the side drawer of my desk. By some miracle, my mother never found them. But they couldn't just sit in that drawer forever; I had to see if they would work.",
      "So I decided to get a pack of matches, lock myself in the family bathroom, and throw lit firecrackers out the only window. My father was down in the den, my mother in the kitchen. How could I possibly get caught? I proceeded to create my own personal preview of the Fourth of July.",

      "\"Steven? What the hell are you doing in there?\"",
      "\"Nothing,\" I said, my voice extremely calm.",
      "I dropped another lit belt out the window.",
      "\"Open this door, now!\"",
      "I looked around the family bathroom: Where could I hide these suckers? Where could I hide myself? Nowhere seemed promising. So, after a moment, I opened the door.",
      "A plume of smoke billowed out into the rest of the house. I was covered in soot. My father looked me over, and as he stood there for what felt like a very long time, I was sure he was going to hand me my head. And not on a platter.",
      "\"I'll tell you what I'm going to do,\" he said. I started to sweat. \"How many firecrackers do you have?\"",

      "\"That's a lot of gunpowder. How did you get all these firecrackers?\"",

      "We stood on the patio, and as the sun started to set, we handed each other single cylinders of gunpowder. My father had his Zippo lighter\u2014he lit each one carefully and then threw it onto the lawn. Pow! Bang! My dad was lighting firecrackers, and it made me delirious. I carefully twisted a cracker off the belt, handed it to my dad, barrel first, and within seconds it had exploded into a green cloud of smithereens.",
      "Then my father started to get creative\u2014he'd light the firecrackers and then throw them high so they'd explode in mid-air, nipping the edge of the mimosa tree. After a time, he turned to me.",
      "\"Here, you light some,\" he said. \"I've got an extra Zippo.\"",
      "I started slow, lighting the wick and then running as I dropped them on the ground. But I saw my father's confidence and started to throw them onto the lawn too. Dad threw one. I threw one. Our explosions echoing one another: call and response, question and answer.",
      "\"What the hell are you two doing?\" my mother said, her head halfway out the bedroom window.",
      "\"We're lighting firecrackers, Ann. My partner and me.\"",
      "His partner. Dad called me his partner. It was like I'd joined the Yankees and the Mets all at once.",
      "There we stood, for hours, as the sun set over the mimosa tree. I looked up at my dad: my hero, my partner. We lit every last one. Of course, one blew up between my fingers; the pain was spectacular, but I didn't dare tell. This was too good.",
      "It was dark as we lit the last few. They unwrapped and exploded in the air, illuminating the backyard with blasts of light.",
      "\"That's it, Steven. We're done. Good job.\"",
      "I walked back into the house a little changed. A little more trust from my dad. A little bit more like a man.",

    "published": "Sun, 19 Jan 2025 09:26:12 -0500",
    "summary": "A giant of early 20th century art, whose glamorous figurative paintings of women played an important role in defining Art Deco, is now the subject of her first-ever U.S. retrospective, currently at the de Young Museum of San Francisco.",
    "story": [
      "When you see a painting by Tamara de Lempicka, it's hard to resist leaning in for a closer look. \"It's just exquisite,\" said Furio Rinaldi, one of the curators of the first-ever Lempicka retrospective in the United States. \"You don't see the brush strokes. They are just polished and incredibly deliberate. It's such a clean way of painting.\"",
      "These glamorous Art Deco works are now on display at the de Young Museum in San Francisco. [The exhibit travels to Houston this spring.]",
      "So, what makes a painting so characteristically Lempicka?",
      "\"Geometrical shapes,\" said Rinaldi. \"Everything is reduced to essential forms. And the other aspect of Lempicka is that she sourced directly from examples provided by the European Old Masters. So, all these things blended together create a language that not only is entirely unique, but entirely modern.\"",
      "Born in 1894 in Poland as Tamara Rosa Hurwitz, Tamara eventually moved to St. Petersburg, marrying an aristocratic lawyer, Tadeusz \u0141empicki Junosza. In 1917, the Russian Revolution forced the couple and their young daughter to flee to Paris. \"Paris was just recovering from the end of the first war,\" said Rinaldi. \"And there was a sense of hope for the future, and kind of a great faith for what was to come.\"",
      "In Paris, she began to paint, first out of financial necessity, using the name Lempicka.",
      "Rinaldi said, \"She captured that very exciting moment of empowerment and emancipation for the queer community in Paris.\"",
      "Some of the women she painted were her lovers. \"The female body is not concealed or corseted as it was before in the previous decade,\" said Rinaldi. \"It's celebrated in its shape.\"",
      "He described a painting of her lover, the poet Ira Perrot: \"Eroticism with a sitter who's not even looking at us. She's just living in her own world. She has this gaze that is detached and completely cool.\"",
      "Each time Lempicka sold a painting, she made a purchase of her own: a diamond bracelet. According to Marisa de Lempicka, the artist's great-granddaughter, it was for protection: \"If she ever had to flee again, she could carry the bracelets with her. She could survive again.\"",
      "\"She always had to think about saving herself?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, herself and her family.\"",
      "Indeed, her fears were well-founded. In 1939, before the outbreak of World War II, Lempicka and her second husband, a Jewish baron, fled Europe for the United States. She continued painting another four decades, until her death in 1980.",
      "Asked if her great-grandmother had a sense of her legacy at the end of her life, Marisa de Lempicka replied, \"She was the toast of the town in the Twenties and Thirties in Paris. She was extremely well-known. And then, she moved to the United States and, you know, the tastes changed. Abstract expressionism is in fashion, so she kind of falls out of favor.\"",
      "\"Why do you think we haven't known her name and her story?\"",
      "\"I think the fact she's a woman artist,\" Marisa said. \"How many women artists can we name? You go to the general public? Very, very few.\"",
      "But Lempicka is now back in the public eye. Last year, she was the subject of a Broadway show, and her works continue to sell for millions of dollars. Collectors include Barbra Streisand and Madonna, who's even featured Lempicka's paintings in music videos.",
      "Asked what she wants the public to know about Tamara de Lempicka, Marisa replied, \"I hope people see her art, learn about her life, and feel empowered and inspired to live their own life and their own dreams. I know this is what Tamara would have wanted.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump struggled to land big-name musical talent during his first inauguration in 2017.",
      "But this time, he'll have one of the biggest names in country music \u2014 Carrie Underwood \u2014 performing at his 2025 swearing-in ceremony, which begins at noon on Monday.

    "title": "If TikTok goes, so will livelihoods: \"We'd have to completely rebuild\"",
    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 21:09:47 -0500",
    "summary": "Experts say no other app offers the same financial opportunities as TikTok, while creators fear loss of income if it disappears.",
    "story": [
      "Small businesses and content creators are bracing for impact if TikTok goes dark this weekend after the Supreme Court on Friday upheld a\u00a0law banning the app unless it is sold by its China-based parent company.",
      "Jessica Simon, the founder of Mississippi Candle Company, on Friday said she was \"grieving\" over what she expects to be a steep decline in sales if TikTok is banned from app stores in the U.S. as early as Sunday. She said that between 90% and 98% of her company's sales come either directly or indirectly from TikTok.",
      "\"That much of our business comes from people seeing our products on TikTok and buying it through our TikTok shop, or coming to our website,\" Simon told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I am still processing the news.\"",
      "Simon, who first started making candles on her stovetop, said the TikTok shop she launched in 2023 \"changed our lives.\"",
      "Despite such concerns, the nation's highest court declined to block or delay the potential ban if TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance, fails to divest the platform. The Justice Department, which had supported the law, applauded the ruling.",
      "\"The Court's decision enables the Justice Department to prevent the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok to undermine America's national security,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a\u00a0statement. \"Authoritarian regimes should not have unfettered access to millions of Americans' sensitive data.\"",
      "Jeffrey Fisher, a lawyer who represented TikTok content creators in the app's case before the Supreme Court, also urged President Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland in a letter on Friday to delay implementation of the law.",
      "\"The law is scheduled to go into effect literally on the eve of the inauguration of President-elect Trump, who recently asked the Supreme Court for the same relief because he wants to work on this issue directly,\" Fisher wrote. \"He should be given that chance. Otherwise, the Act would significantly burden the speech rights of over 170 million Americans and would cause substantial and avoidable disruption to the third-party providers that may be subject to severe penalties if they continue to provide TikTok to its millions of users.\"",
      "In a statement late Friday, TikTok said the White House and Justice Department have failed to provide the necessary clarity and assurance to the service providers that are integral to maintaining TikTok's availability to over 170 million Americans.\"",
      "\"Unless the Biden administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19,\" the company added.",
      "The power of TikTok",
      "With 170 million monthly active users, TikTok is a significant moneymaker for millions of small businesses. For Simon, her company's reach on the platform generated enough sales to allow her to build a 2,100 square foot warehouse and to hire a team of employees to help make the company's products. Mississippi Candle surpassed six figures in sales for the first time in November, and again in December, she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I am heartbroken for my staff,\" she said. \"I won't be able to make up for that traffic or sales anywhere else,\" she said. Simon's company has 50,000 followers on TikTok, compared with 7,700 on Facebook and 3,100 on Instagram.",
      "\"So we won't be able to make up that income. We'll have to completely rebuild our community somewhere else, and it will take a lot longer than it did on TikTok,\" Simon added.",
      "Who wins if TikTok exits the U.S.?",
      "Morgan Stanley analysts say that Facebook and Instagram owner Meta stands to benefit from TikTok users migrating to other platforms, writing that the roughly 32 billion hours of annual U.S. consumer time spent on TikTok could soon be up for grabs.",
      "\"Meta remains the largest fundamental winner of any TikTok ban given its already leading user base, data set and distribution,\" the analysts said in a research note. Alphabet-owned YouTube also could benefit as it also lets users create short-form videos.",
      "Still, experts say that none of those apps come close to TikTok in its ability to generate income for brands, advertisers and creators.",
      "\"A ton of people are already flocking to other apps, but there is going to be a ton of damage and loss of revenue,\" Edward Klaris, managing partner at Klaris law, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"There are going to have to find alternative means of speaking, and this ban reduces their presence on a platform where they are already well-established.\"",
      "The parties that stand to lose from TikTok's U.S. operations shutting down range from independent content creators to businesses and advertisers. In the case of companies, TikTok allows them to establish accounts that reach users organically, as well with paid-ads. And popular influencers can make a lucrative living, with brands paying them to hawk their products.",
      "\"Advertisers are engaging in commercial speech to send out messages, influencers are doing commercial speech and businesses are also sharing information. Therefore there is a lot of spend going on,\" Klaris explained.",
      "He agreed that a ban could be good news for competitors like RedNote, another Chinese-owned app.",
      "The ramifications of shutting down TikTok in the U.S. would be wide-reaching for diverse users, according to Jessica Rauchberg, assistant professor of communication technologies at Seton Hall University.",
      "\"It really concerns me for everyday creators, particularly marginalized ones, who might have a disability and not be able to work in person,\" she said. \"TikTok is a great space for users to supplement their incomes with content creation, and when you lose that, where do you go? You can't just rebuild on another platform.\"",
      "\"It's a great way to reach customers, because a lot of younger people use it as a search engine and place to find a great local restaurant or craftsperson who is making special items you can't find at a Target or Walmart,\" Rauchberg added. \"It'll hurt consumers, and for small businesses it's a big tool for outreach. That's why they are scared.\"",

    "summary": "Justin Baldoni's lawsuit comes after \"It Ends With Us\" co-star Blake Lively accused him of sexual harassment.",
    "story": [
      "Justin Baldoni filed a counter lawsuit against \"It Ends With Us\" co-star Blake Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, on Thursday, alleging the couple hijacked his film and sought to destroy his livelihood and career.",
      "In the lawsuit's 179-page complaint filed in the Southern District of New York, Baldoni accuses Lively and Reynolds of civil extortion, defamation and invasion of privacy.",
      "The lawsuit, which also named Lively's publicist, Leslie Sloane, and her firm Vision PR Inc., comes shortly after Baldoni filed a separate defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, which first reported Lively's allegations of sexual harassment against Baldoni during the film's production.",
      "Baldoni's production company Wayfarer Studios, his business partner Jamey Heath and two others are also named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit against Lively and Reynolds. They're seeking at least $400 million in damages.",
      "A spokesperson from Lively's legal team said Baldoni's counterclaim is a typical tactic abusers use to discredit victims by turning the tables on them. The spokesperson said the DARVO claim \u2014 deny, attack, reverse victim offender \u2014 is a well-documented method often discussed during the Johnny Depp vs. Amber Heard trials.",
      "\"They are trying to shift the narrative to Ms. Lively by falsely claiming that she seized creative control and alienated the cast from Mr. Baldoni,\" the spokesperson said in a statement. \"The evidence will show that the cast and others had their own negative experiences with Mr. Baldoni and Wayfarer. The evidence will also show that Sony asked Ms. Lively to oversee Sony's cut of the film, which they then selected for distribution and was a resounding success.\"",
      "Bryan Freedman, an attorney representing Baldoni, told CBS News in a statement the lawsuit details alleged evidence that Lively disseminated \"grossly edited, unsubstantiated, new and doctored information to the media.\"",
      "\"It is clear based on our own all out willingness to provide all complete text messages, emails, video footage and other documentary evidence that was shared between the parties in real time, that this is a battle she will not win and will certainly regret,\" Freedman said.",
      "Lively in December came forward with allegations of sexual harassment against Baldoni, who also directed and co-financed the film adaption of the 2016\u00a0Colleen Hoover\u00a0novel that explores domestic violence and emotional abuse.",
      "Lively's complaint against Baldoni, Heath and Wayfarer Studios, originally reported by The New York Times, included accusations that, after a meeting in which she and Reynolds addressed alleged \"repeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behavior\" by Baldoni and a producer on the movie, he and the studio \"embarked on a 'multi-tiered plan' to damage her reputation following the meeting.\"",
      "\"The allegations against The New York Times in this new lawsuit are meritless and recycled from the equally baseless claims in the suit that was filed against The Times in California,\" a spokesperson for The New York Times said in a statement.",
      "According to The New York Times, Lively's lawsuit also included texts allegedly sent by Baldoni's publicist, Jennifer Abel, to crisis PR specialist Melissa Nathan, both of whom are named as plaintiffs in Baldoni's lawsuit, which say the actor \"wants to feel like she can be buried,\" and, \"We can't write we will destroy her.\"",
      "In Baldoni's countersuit, he claimed that his former publicist, Stephanie Jones, was \"filled with impotent rage\" at him and Abel, who left Jones' company Jonesworks to form her own firm and work for Baldoni.",
      "In turn, Baldoni's lawsuit alleges, Jones colluded with Lively, Reynolds and Sloane to seize Abel's phone and \"mine it for messages that, stripped of context, could be used to concoct a false narrative\" to make it appear that Baldoni was behind negative press coverage and public reactions to Lively.",
      "The new lawsuit says the plaintiffs did not want to file the suit, but that Lively \"has unequivocally left them with no choice, not only to set the record straight in response to Lively's accusations, but also to put the spotlight on the parts of Hollywood that they have dedicated their careers to being the antithesis of.\"",
      "An email seeking comment from Sloane, whose PR company represents both Lively and Reynolds, was not immediately answered.",

    "summary": "Part of an astonishing generation of British actors, including Judi Dench,\u200b Vanessa Redgrave, Eileen Atkins and Maggie Smith\u200b, Joan Plowright won a Tony Award, two Golden Globes and nominations for an Oscar and an Emmy.",
    "story": [
      "Award-winning British actor Joan Plowright, who with her late husband Laurence Olivier did much to revitalize the U.K.'s theatrical scene in the decades after World War II, has died. She was 95.",
      "In a statement Friday, her family said Plowright died the previous day at Denville Hall, a retirement home for actors in southern England, surrounded by her loved ones.",
      "\"She enjoyed a long and illustrious career across theatre, film and TV over seven decades until blindness made her retire,\" the family said. \"We are so proud of all Joan did and who she was as a loving and deeply inclusive human being.\"",
      "Part of an astonishing generation of British actors, including Judi Dench, Vanessa Redgrave, Eileen Atkins and Maggie Smith, Plowright won a Tony Award, two Golden Globes and nominations for an Oscar and an Emmy. She was made a dame by Queen Elizabeth II in 2004.",
      "From the 1950s to the 1980s, Plowright racked up dozens of stage roles in everything from Anton Chekhov's \"The Seagull\" to William Shakespeare's \"The Merchant of Venice.\" She stunned in Eugene Ionesco's \"The Chairs,\" and George Bernard Shaw's totemic two female roles \"Major Barbara\" and \"Saint Joan.\"",
      "\"I've been very privileged to have such a life,\" Plowright said in a 2010 interview with\u00a0The Actor's Work. \"I mean it's magic and I still feel, when a curtain goes up or the lights come on if there's no curtain, the magic of a beginning of what is going to unfold in front of me.\"",
      "The esteem in which Plowright was held in London was evident with the news that theaters across the West End will dim their lights for two minutes at 7 p.m. on Tuesday in her honor.",
      "Born Joan Ann Plowright in Brigg, Lincolnshire, England, her mother ran an amateur drama group and Plowright was involved in the theater from age 3. She was soon spending school vacations at summer sessions of university drama schools. After high school, she studied at the Laban Art of Movement Studio in Manchester, then won a two-year scholarship to the drama school at the Old Vic Theatre in London.",
      "Following her London stage debut in 1954, Plowright became a member of the Royal Court Theatre in 1956 and gained recognition in dramas written by the so-called Angry Young Men, such as John Osborne, who were giving British theater a thorough airing-out. The new, rough-hewn, working-class actors like Albert Finney, Alan Bates and Anthony Hopkins were her peers.",
      "Plowright made her feature film debut with an uncredited turn in American director John Huston's epic adaptation of Herman Melville's \"Moby Dick\" in 1956, starring Gregory Peck as the obsessed Captain Ahab.",
      "A year later, she co-starred with her future husband Olivier in the original London production of Osborne's \"The Entertainer.\" She played Olivier's daughter in the work and the two reunited for the 1960 film adaptation.",
      "By then, Plowright's marriage to British actor Roger Cage had ended, as had Olivier's 20-year union with Vivien Leigh. Plowright and Olivier were married in Connecticut in 1961, while both were starring on Broadway, he in \"Becket\" and she in \"A Taste of Honey,\" for which she won a Tony.",
      "One love letter Olivier sent summed up his love: \"I sometimes feel such a peacefulness come over me when I think of you, or write to you \u2014 a gentle tenderness and serenity. A feeling devoid of all violence, passion or shattering longing... it makes me go out into the street with a smile on my face and in my heart for everybody.\"",
      "Olivier died in 1989 at the age of 82. After that, Plowright enjoyed a career resurgence at the age of 60, satisfying both upmarket tastes and more commercial fare.",
      "She was in Franco Zeffirelli's version of Charlotte Bront\u00eb's \"Jane Eyre\" in 1996 and the Merchant-Ivory production of \"Surviving Picasso,\" as well as starring as the stalwart nanny in Disney's live-action remake of \"101 Dalmatians\" in 1996 with Glenn Close.",
      "She starred opposite Walter Matthau in the big screen adaptation of the classic comic strip \"Dennis the Menace,\" and made a brief appearance in the Arnold Schwarzenegger self-referencing satire \"Last Action Hero\" in 1993.",
      "Plowright became one of only a handful of actors to win two Golden Globes in the same year, in 1993, when she won the supporting actress TV award for \"Stalin\" and the supporting actress movie award for \"Enchanted April.\" For the latter, which told the story of a group of Britons finding their lives transformed on a vacation to Italy, she received her sole nomination for an Academy Award.",
      "Not all her works were career roses, as with the disastrous \"The Scarlet Letter\" starring Demi Moore and a pilot that went nowhere for a TV series based on \"Driving Miss Daisy.\" An appearance alongside Chevy Chase in the 2011 holiday family comedy \"Goose on the Loose\" didn't rouse critics.",
      "A prominent role in later life was keeper of the Olivier flame \u2014 bestowing awards, defending her husband in the press and curating his letters.",
      "\"That is my choice because I was privileged to live with him,\" she told The Daily Telegraph in 2003. \"When someone who has had such fame and idolatry and worship goes, then there's bound to be a backlash which comes the other way and you get a bit sick of that. Mine was really trying to put things straight.\"",
      "Plowright is survived by her three children \u2014 Tamsin, Richard and Julie-Kate, all actors, and several grandchildren.",

      "David Lynch, the groundbreaking director of films and shows including \"Twin Peaks\" and \"Blue Velvet,\" has died at the age of 78, his family announced Thursday.",
      "\"It is with deep regret that we, his family, announce the passing of the man and the artist, David Lynch,\" a statement posted to Lynch's social media reads. \"We would appreciate some privacy at this time. There's a big hole in the world now that he's no longer with us. But, as he would say, 'Keep your eye on the donut and not on the hole.' It's a beautiful day with golden sunshine and blue skies all the way.\"",
      "Lynch, who would have turned 79 on Monday, revealed in August 2024 that he was diagnosed with emphysema, a chronic lung disease, after years of smoking.",
      "Lynch, who was born in Montana in 1946, was a writer, director and painter who studied at the American Film Institute. He first broke into the movie scene in 1977 when he turned his thesis project into his first feature film \"Eraserhead,\" a black-and-white surrealist indie film that quickly gained notoriety as a midnight movie.",
      "\"Eraserhead\" attracted the attention of producer Mel Brooks, who brought Lynch aboard to direct \"The Elephant Man,\" an adaptation of the life and times of the severely deformed Joseph Merrick, telling the younger director, \"You're a crazy man. You're hired.\"",
      "\"The Elephant Man\" earned Lynch his first of three Academy Award nominations for best director, followed by \"Blue Velvet\" in 1986 and \"Mulholland Drive\" in 2001, the latter also earning Lynch a best director prize at the Cannes Film Festival, where he previously earned the festival's top prize \u2014 the Palme d'Or \u2014 for 1990's \"Wild at Heart.\"",
      "Lynch also directed the ill-fated 1984 movie adaptation of Frank Herbert's sci-fi novel \"Dune.\"",
      "But for many, Lynch's most famous contribution to pop culture was his collaboration with Mark Frost on ABC's primetime drama \"Twin Peaks,\"\u00a0 which hooked viewers immediately with its sui generis combination of mystery and quirk, spurring legions to tune in weekly to find out who murdered Laura Palmer, who was played by Sheryl Lee.",
      "The show initially lasted only two seasons in the early '90s and took home three Golden Globe honors in 1991, including Best TV Series and Best Actor for Kyle MacLachlan. In 2017, the show was revisited to widespread critical acclaim in the Showtime limited series \"Twin Peaks: The Return.\"",
      "The style of his films coined the term \"Lynchian,\" referring to the juxtaposition of \"surreal or sinister elements with mundane, everyday environments.\"",
      "In 2019, Lynch received an honorary Academy Award at the Motion Picture Academy's Governors Awards, and in 2012, he received honorary degrees from the American Film Institute.",

    "summary": "Bob Uecker was the voice of his hometown Milwaukee Brewers who after a short playing career earned the moniker \"Mr. Baseball\" and honors from the Hall of Fame.",
    "story": [
      "Bob Uecker, the voice of his hometown Milwaukee Brewers who after a short playing career earned the moniker \"Mr. Baseball\" and honors from the Hall of Fame, has died, the baseball commissioner's office confirmed to CBS News. He was 90.",
      "The Brewers announced Uecker died Thursday morning, calling it \"one of the most difficult days in Milwaukee Brewers history.\" In a statement released by the club, Uecker's family said he had battled small cell lung cancer since early 2023.",
      "\"Even in the face of this challenge, his enthusiasm for life was always present, never allowing his spirit to falter,\" the family said.",
      "Uecker was best known as a colorful comedian and broadcaster who earned his nickname during one of his numerous appearances on Johnny Carson's late night show.",
      "Born and raised in Milwaukee, Uecker was a beloved member of the baseball community and a pillar of the sport in Wisconsin.",
      "When the Brewers clinched the NL Central title in 2024, manager Pat Murphy threw an arm around Uecker in the locker room, pulling him in tight as players white-knuckled their corks, ready to shower \"Mr. Baseball\" in Champagne.",
      "\"There is no one \u2014   there is no one \u2014   who epitomizes a champion the way this man does right here,\" Murphy proclaimed as the players chanted \"UUUUUECK.\"",
      "\"What an example for us to be with every single day \u2014   Bob Uecker.\"",
      "Uecker signed his first professional contract with the Milwaukee Braves in 1956 and reached the majors in 1962. He'd last six seasons in the big leagues as a backup catcher, finishing with a .200 average and 14 homers.",
      "He won a World Series ring with St. Louis in 1964 and also played for Atlanta and Philadelphia.",
      "\"Career highlights? I had two,\" he often joked. \"I got an intentional walk from Sandy Koufax and I got out of a rundown against the Mets.\"",
      "Uecker also befriended former Brewers owner and MLB commissioner Bud Selig, who initially hired him as a scout. Selig liked to joke about how Uecker's initial scouting report was stained with mashed potatoes and gravy.",
      "Selig eventually brought Uecker to the broadcast booth. Uecker became the voice of the Brewers in 1971, in the second year after the team moved from Seattle.",
      "Uecker remained with the club from that point on and became one of the Brewers' most indelible figures. Brewers manager Craig Counsell grew up in the Milwaukee area and remembered spending summer days throwing a baseball against the roof and catching it while listening to Uecker's broadcasts.",
      "\"There's no single person in this franchise's history who has been as iconic and as important as Bob Uecker,\" said Jeff Levering, a member of the Brewers' broadcast team since 2015.",
      "Even as his celebrity status grew nationwide, Uecker savored the opportunity to continue calling games to fans in his hometown.",
      "\"To be able to do a game each and every day throughout the summer and talk to people every day at 6:30 for a night game, you become part of people's families,\" Uecker once said. \"I know that because I get mail from people that tell me that. That's part of the reward for being here, just to be recognized by the way you talk, the way you describe a game, whatever.\"",
      "Uecker was honored by the Hall of Fame with the Ford C. Frick award in 2003 and spent nearly 20 minutes keeping the Cooperstown, New York, crowd of about 18,000 in stitches.",
      "\"I still \u2014 and this is not sour grapes by any means \u2014   still think I should have gone in as a player,\" he quipped.",
      "\"Ueck\" got his big break off the field after opening for Don Rickles at Al Hirt's nightclub in Atlanta in 1969. That performance caught Hirt's attention, and the musician set him up to appear on \"The Tonight Show\" with Johnny Carson. He became one of Carson's favorite guests, making more than 100 appearances.",
      "Carson was the one who dubbed Uecker \"Mr. Baseball.\" And the name stuck.",
      "But Uecker's comedy was just a part of his abilities. His warm storytelling and delivery made Uecker a natural to become one of the first color commentators on network TV broadcasts in the 1970s with ABC. In the '90s, he teamed up with Bob Costas and Joe Morgan for the World Series.",
      "From there, Uecker reached most households as one of the Miller Lite All-Stars in popular commercials for the beer brand based out of Milwaukee and Uecker later launched his TV acting career in 1985 on the ABC sitcom \"Mr. Belvedere.\"",
      "Uecker played George Owens during the successful 122-episode run of the series that lasted six years, as the head of the family and sports writer in a home that brings in a butler who struggles to adapt to an American household.",
      "In a bit of casting that kept things pretty close to home, Uecker also played a prominent role in the movies Major League (1989) and Major League II (1994) as crass announcer Harry Doyle for a down-and-out Cleveland Indians franchise that finds a way to become playoff contenders.",
      "\"I'm part of American folklore, I guess,\" Uecker told The Associated Press in 2003. \"But I'm not a Hollywood guy. Baseball and broadcasting are in my blood.\"",
      "His wry description of a badly wayward pitch \u2014   \"Juuuust a bit outside!\" \u2014   in the movie is still often-repeated by announcers and fans at ballparks all over.",
      "Uecker's acting left some to believe he was more about being funny than a serious baseball announcer, but his tenure and observations with the Brewers were spot on, especially when games were tight. Equally enjoyable were games that weren't, when Uecker would tell stories about other major leaguers, his own career and his hobbies as an avid fisherman and golfer.",
      "\"I don't think anyone wants to hear somebody screwing around when you got a good game going,\" Uecker said. \"I think people see 'Major League' and they think Harry Doyle and figure that's what Bob Uecker does. I do that sometimes, I do. But when we've got a good game going, I don't mess around.\"",
      "In his later years, he took a serious approach to his health, swimming daily leading up to heart surgery in April 2010. Very soon after the procedures, doctors said Uecker returned to walking several miles and was ahead in recovery.",
      "Uecker pushed to return to the booth and began calling games again in July, saying he bribed the doctors by allowing them to throw out the first pitch.",
      "\"You talk about all the things Bob has done, he never wanted to leave Milwaukee,\" Selig said. \"Above all, he made himself into a great play-by-play announcer. That's what he did. He's everything to this franchise and loves every minute of it.\"",
      "Uecker's own career provided him most of his material. His former teammates said Uecker would do impressions of other broadcasters on the bus, but Uecker turned the spotlight on himself after his playing career was over.",
      "\"I signed with the Milwaukee Braves for $3,000. That bothered my dad at the time because he didn't have that kind of dough,\" he said. \"But he eventually scraped it up.\"",
      "Another classic: \"When I came up to bat with three men on and two outs in the ninth, I looked in the other team's dugout and they were already in street clothes.\"",
      "Uecker also presided over the stirring ceremony that closed Milwaukee County Stadium in 2000. When the Brewers' new stadium opened as Miller Park in 2001, the team began selling \"Uecker Seats\" high in the upper deck and obstructed for a $1.",
      "The stadium, now known as American Family Field, has two statues in Uecker's honor. There's a statue outside the stadium and another one in the back of Section 422, a nod to the Miller Lite commercial in which he famously said \"I must be in the front row!\" while getting taken to one of the worst seats in the ballpark.",

      "Catherine, the Princess of Wales, said Tuesday her cancer is in remission, about 10 months after announcing her diagnosis. Princess Kate made the announcement on social media after visiting the London hospital where she received treatment.",
      "\"It is a relief to now be in remission and I remain focussed on recovery,\" she said in her post on Instagram after visiting the Royal Marsden Hospital in London. \"As anyone who has experienced a cancer diagnosis will know, it takes time to adjust to a new normal.\"",
      "The princess had announced last March that cancer was discovered following an\u00a0abdominal surgery\u00a0and she was undergoing preventative chemotherapy.",
      "In September, she said she had finished chemotherapy. She spoke about receiving the cancer treatment during her visit Tuesday. \"It's really tough,'' she said, according to the Associated Press. \"It's such a shock.\"",

      "On social media Tuesday, Kate said she visited the hospital to thank the staff \"for looking after me so well during the past year.\"",
      "\"My heartfelt thanks goes to all those who have quietly walked alongside William and me as we have navigated everything,\" she said, referring to her husband, the Prince of Wales. \"We couldn't have asked for more. The care and advice we have received throughout my time as a patient has been exceptional.\"",
      "Kensington Palace also announced that she and William have become patrons of the hospital.",

      "\"The body is amazing at telling us 'you need to take time out,'\" she said after learning about a man's diagnosis.",
      "She also talked about receiving her cancer diagnosis, according to the news agency.",

      "Attorneys for the Biden administration said Friday they would seek to challenge a court loss last year that could pave the way for the Trump administration to ban the use of fluoride in water.",
      "The Biden administration's notice, filed Friday with the federal district court in San Francisco, comes just days ahead of a Jan. 21 deadline for the appeal.",
      "While last year's ruling did not order the Environmental Protection Agency to ban water fluoridation, opponents say it carved out a \"clear legal pathway\" giving the federal government authority to force local governments to stop adding the chemical to the water supply.",
      "Public health experts have long defended fluoridation as one of the greatest public health achievements of the 20th century. The American Dental Association said last year that research shows it is a \"safe, beneficial and cost-effective public health measure\" for preventing cavities.",
      "District Court Judge Edward Chen ruled last year that evidence showed fluoride was \"hazardous at dosages that are far too close to fluoride levels in the drinking water of the United States,\" but stopped short of ordering the EPA to ban the practice.",
      "The judge said he only had the authority under the Toxic Substances Control Act, or TSCA, to direct the EPA to take action against the risk, but not to prescribe the specifics of its response, which could range from a national warning to an outright ban.",
      "\"I'm hopeful that the new administration will use the authority that it has under TSCA to follow the lead of Europe and to implement a nationwide ban on water fluoridation,\" Michael Connett, an attorney for the groups Fluoride Action Network and Food & Water Watch that had sued the EPA, told CBS News.",
      "Attorneys for the federal government did not say what they plan to argue in its appeal. A spokesperson for the Department of Justice declined to comment on the filing.",
      "It will be up to the incoming Trump administration to decide whether to continue the appeal.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump's pick to head the Department of Health and Human Services, has advocated for removing fluoride from public water supplies and said last year that Trump intends to call for an end to fluoridation.",
      "Trump has said he was open to the idea but has not yet detailed plans. A spokesperson for the president-elect did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "\"If the new administration did want to take a different course with respect to fluoridation policies, it has unquestionably the authority to stand down on this appeal, and to initiate rulemaking proceeding to address the risk of fluoridation,\" said Connett.",
      "The court ruling in September stemmed in large part from a review published by the National Institutes of Health's National Toxicology Program, which concluded that \"higher levels of fluoride exposure\" are associated with lower IQ in children.",
      "While those concerning levels are higher than what is typically added to the U.S. water supply, some opponents worry that the varied ways children consume drinks and food made with fluoridated water could add up to exposure that is too high for many kids.",

      "Companies say they are working to update their products to comply with the Food and Drug Administration's decision Wednesday to ban the artificial food dye Red 3, after the agency said it was revoking the additive's authorization over concerns it was causing cancer in rats.",
      "While the agency says that studies show the way Red 3 causes cancer in rats does not occur in humans, the law still requires additives that cause cancer in animals to be pulled from the market even if they are not proven to pose a risk to humans as well.",

    "story": [
      "A year after the American Academy of Pediatrics flagged what it described as \"questionable marketing practices\" by makers of formulas for older infants and toddlers, Abbott Laboratories is being sued over how it pitches such products.",
      "Abbott, a health care products conglomerate based in Illinois, is misleading parents and other caregivers about the nutritional value of its sugar-laden toddler milks, according to a lawsuit filed Tuesday by the Public Health Advocacy Institute (PHAI) against the maker of Similac formulas.",
      "Marketed for consumption by children ages 12 to 36 months, toddler milk is portrayed as the next step for little ones after they have outgrown infant formulas approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Yet unlike baby formula, the toddler milk products are not regulated by the FDA and are potentially harmful, according to\u00a0PHAI, a nonprofit legal research center located at Northeastern University School of Law.",
      "Abbott dismissed the allegations as \"without merit.\"",
      "\"Abbott's representations of its toddler nutrition products are accurate, and our claims are well-supported,\" the company said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Sales of toddler milk nationwide have averaged more than $500 million a year, according to PHAI's suit, filed in U.S. district court for the Northern District of Illinois.",
      "\"More than just unnecessary, toddler milk products can actually be harmful to a child's nutritional health,\" said George Fuchs, a medical doctor and professor of pediatric gastroenterology at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine Department of Pediatrics. \"The added sugars can increase a toddler's preference for sweetened foods, contributing to obesity and other health risks throughout their lives,\" noted Fuchs, who led the AAP report on toddler milks.",
      "Labeled similarly to FDA-regulated infant formulas and sold on the same store shelves, Abbott's \"Go & Grow Toddler Drink by Similac\" and \"Pure Bliss Toddler Drink by Similac\" are labeled \"Stage 3,\" implying they are the next nutritionally recommended product after \"Stage 1\" infant formula and \"Stage 2\" transitional formula, the suit alleges.",
      "\"Common toddler milk marketing practices, including unsubstantiated nutrition-related claims and packages that look like infant formulas, mislead parents and other caregivers to believe that toddler milks provide nutritional benefits for their young children,\" said Dr. Jennifer Harris, senior research adviser, marketing initiatives at the UConn Rudd Center for Food Policy and Health.",

    "title": "FDA to cut nicotine from cigarettes, in plan first floated under Trump",
    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 12:14:24 -0500",
    "summary": "It will be up to the returning Trump administration to decide whether to finalize the rule.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration is moving to cut out addictive nicotine from cigarettes, according to a long-awaited proposed regulation released Wednesday.",
      "The rule aims to force the nearly 12% of Americans still using combustible tobacco products to switch to less dangerous alternatives, like vaping electronic cigarettes or using nicotine lozenges, or quit altogether while ending rates of youth starting to smoke traditional cigarettes.",
      "\"The proposed product standard would limit the addictiveness of the most toxic and widely used tobacco products, which would have significant public health benefits for all age groups,\" the agency wrote in the\u00a0proposed rule.",
      "Though vaping rates have climbed in recent years, fewer adults vape than smoke traditional cigarettes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 6% of adults use e-cigarettes.",
      "It will now be up to the returning Trump administration to decide if and how to finalize this measure, which was first floated during President-elect Donald Trump's first term. At the time, the head of the FDA called it \"one of the most important actions I could take to advance public health.\"",
      "\"If there is a goal to Make America Healthy Again, I can't imagine anything more important to get done than this,\" FDA Commissioner Robert Califf told reporters on Wednesday.",
      "A related effort to ban menthol-flavored cigarettes stalled out last year under the Biden administration, amid political blowback over the measure.",
      "The FDA says the proposed rule will apply to traditional cigarettes, roll-your-own tobacco, cigars and pipe tobacco. Cigarette manufacturers will have two years to come into compliance with the rule, after it is finalized.",
      "Agency officials stressed that they were not seeking to ban cigarettes or other tobacco products outright. They acknowledged the rule may result in some illegal imports of high nicotine cigarettes, but not enough to outweigh those switching or quitting. Half of smokers are expected to switch within the first years, they estimate.",
      "\"Even if some amount of illicit trade develops, we will still have a significantly greater magnitude of benefits that would outweigh any impacts of potential illicit markets,\" said Brian King, head of FDA's Center for Tobacco Products.",
      "Tobacco companies will need to cut nicotine levels to 0.7 milligrams per gram of tobacco, a fraction of the 17.2 milligrams per gram that most cigarette brands have on average.",
      "Why didn't the FDA ban nicotine earlier?",
      "Progress during the Trump administration halted after then-FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb stepped down from the agency, according to a former top-ranking official.",
      "\"We had no champion. And the day came when I was told by political appointees at FDA to stop talking about menthol and nicotine in my speeches. And we were basically told to stop working on them,\" said Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products from 2013 to 2022.",
      "The FDA's tobacco arm turned to other priorities in those years, Zeller said. The agency was facing a surge in youth e-cigarette use that began around 2018.",
      "Zeller credited Gottlieb for advocating for the nicotine regulation within the Trump White House, after the Obama administration had fallen short. Obama officials had promised Zeller they would back rules to curb nicotine and menthol.",
      "\"If you look back on the record, you'll see that the Obama administration did absolutely nothing. It was a very frustrating four years,\" Zeller said.",
      "Under President Biden, Zeller said the White House asked him to lay out a timeline for how a nicotine rule could be finalized by the end of 2024. Zeller said he delivered the plan in one of his last acts before retiring, and was not sure why the Biden administration failed to finalize the rule.",
      "\"I would not be forwarding this timeline to you, if I didn't believe in good conscience that it could be met, as long as clearance times could be sped up,\" Zeller recalled telling White House officials.",
      "Califf defended the agency's delay in comments to media Wednesday, saying that the FDA needed to lay the groundwork for steep legal fights over the rule. He pointed to ongoing court battles \"fighting us tooth and nail\" over graphic warnings on cigarettes, saying \"we will be sued, on anything that comes into action.\"",
      "\"The research has to be airtight to survive the challenges that we know we'll get in court,\" he said.",
      "How can nicotine be removed from cigarettes?",
      "Zeller said agency officials carefully studied whether it was possible to require the industry to make cigarettes without addictive levels of nicotine.",
      "\"In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Philip Morris sold a very low-nicotine cigarette called Next. Now, it was not commercially successful. But I believe that Philip Morris more than 30 years ago answered the technical feasibility question for themselves and for the rest of us,\" he said.",
      "The Philip Morris cigarette had been produced with a similar process to decaffeinating coffee. At the time, the company had owned Kraft Foods and its decaf coffee production lines.",
      "A major study from the National Institutes of Health in 2015\u00a0that used reduced-nicotine cigarettes that the NIH contracted to manufacture showed reducing nicotine in cigarettes could substantially curb addiction, proving an idea first outlined in the 1990s.",
      "\"That study and a number of confirmatory studies that followed I think provide a very compelling scientific basis for this could be done,\" Zeller said.",
      "Other companies have found different ways to cut nicotine levels. Cigarette company 22nd Century Group earned the FDA's authorization in 2021 using tobacco that is genetically engineered to have 96% lower nicotine.",
      "While feasible to implement, Zeller predicted that finalizing the rule could face steep opposition from the industry.",
      "If successful, the rule would be an \"existential threat,\" he said, eliminating the main reason that smokers continue to use their products.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 11:31:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The red food dye is used in products ranging from candies to vegetarian meats.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday it had decided to revoke Red 3's authorization to be added to foods, over concerns about how the food coloring dye has been linked to cancer in laboratory animals.",
      "FDA officials have telegraphed the decision for months. While the agency has long said that it did not think evidence of Red 3 causing cancer applied to humans, officials said their hand was forced by a law requiring the agency to pull additives that are cancerous in animals.",
      "\"The Delaney Clause is clear; the FDA cannot authorize a food additive or color additive if it has been found to cause cancer in humans or animals. Evidence shows cancer in laboratory male rats exposed to high levels of FD&C Red No. 3,\" said Jim Jones, the FDA's deputy commissioner for human foods, referring to the law.",
      "A post on the FDA's website states that Red 3's use in food or drugs \"puts people at risk are not supported by the available scientific information.\"",
      "Hundreds of food brands, including products ranging from candy and fruit cups to snack chips and tomato sauce, have contained Red 3 at some point, according to databases maintained by the\u00a0U.S. Department of Agriculture\u00a0and the nonprofit\u00a0Environmental Working Group, as well as nutrition labels disclosed by food companies.",
      "Wednesday's decision stems from a petition filed by the Center for Science in the Public Interest and a number of other groups in 2022, calling for the additive to be pulled from the market. Food brands will have until January 2027 to stop using the dye.",
      "The group has also championed a move by California in 2023 to ban the food dye, which is already banned from use in cosmetics.",
      "\"The primary purpose of food dyes is to make candy, drinks, and other processed foods more attractive. When the function is purely aesthetic, why accept any cancer risk?\" said Dr. Peter Lurie, president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, in a statement.",
      "While the group has highlighted Red 3's link to cancer in pushes to ban the additive, it is concerned over a different health concern \u2014 the possibility that artificial food dyes could be causing hyperactivity in children \u2014 that has fueled opposition to this and another dye called Red 40 used in many U.S. food products.",
      "An influential review by California''s Environmental Protection Agency of studies on synthetic food dyes, including Red 3, concluded in 2021 that colorants \"can impact neurobehavior in some children.\"",
      "What foods and drinks contain Red 3?",
      "Red 3 has been authorized for use in at least some foods by countries around the world, according to the International Association of Color Manufacturers, under other names like erythrosine or E 127. In Europe, Red 3 is only permitted for use in cocktail cherries and candied cherries.",
      "In the U.S., Red 3 is used in some candies, including Jelly Belly's Candy Corn, Tootsie's Dubble Bubble ball gum and Ring Pop's strawberry and berry blast flavors. Other foods also use Red 3, like Del Monte cherry mixed fruit cups, MorningStar Farms vegetarian Bacon Strips and Pillsbury's birthday cake cookie dough.",
      "Several drinks rely on Red 3 as well, among them Ensure's creamy peach nutrition shake and Nesquik's strawberry lowfat milk.",
      "In a statement Wednesday, the candy industry pledged to comply with the FDA's guidance and safety standards. Industry groups have been calling on the agency to step up its regulation of food additives, citing concerns that a vacuum left by FDA inaction could lead to a frustrating patchwork of state laws for national food brands.",
      "\"Our consumers and everyone in the food industry want and expect a strong FDA, and a consistent, science-based national regulatory framework. We have been saying for years that FDA is the rightful national regulatory decision maker and leader in food safety,\" said the National Confections Association's statement.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump's pick to head the federal department that will oversee the FDA, has been critical of the agency for not moving to curb use of certain food additives.",
      "Kennedy and his allies have\u00a0also called for\u00a0tightening the FDA's approach to regulating food additives, which critics have derided as a \"loophole\" allowing in concerning ingredients. That process is separate from artificial colors like Red 3 and Red 40, which must jump through steep hurdles to gain the FDA's authorization and are carefully tested for purity before being used in the market.",

    "summary": "The death risk goes up to 1 in 100 for those who drink alcohol nine times per week, the report found.",
    "story": [
      "Consuming more than one drink a day results in a steep increase of the risk of premature death, a new federal review has concluded. The draft report was published Tuesday ahead of a major update to influential federal guidelines on how much alcohol Americans should drink.",
      "\"In the United States, males and females have a 1 in 1000 risk of dying from alcohol use if they consume more than 7 drinks per week. This risk increases to 1 in 100 if they consume more than 9 drinks per week,\" the report's authors concluded, in a final draft published by the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "The review is one of two written by committees of outside experts to inform this year's update to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The other was published last month by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.",
      "The upcoming guidelines are important because the Food and Drug Administration and other agencies often rely on the recommendations to justify new rules, like on how to label food and drinks. Men are currently recommended to limit intake to no more than two drinks per day and women are recommended to limit to one drink per day.",
      "\"Once you're over a drink a day, your risk of dying from alcohol is already above one percent. Some people may think that doesn't sound like a lot, but in terms of a public health guideline, that would be really, really high,\" said Dr. Timothy Naimi, director of the Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research and one of the authors of the report.",
      "Naimi was careful to say that the report was \"not endorsing any level of risk\" caused by drinking, but pointed to other countries and health regulations that have used 1 in 100 and 1 in 1,000 death risks as thresholds to set rules.",
      "It is unclear whether the incoming Trump administration will incorporate the findings of the latest report into any updated guidelines. In 2020, the Trump administration rejected a call by its outside expert panel to recommend limiting drinking for all Americans to no more than once per day, saying the \"emerging evidence\" did not support the move.",
      "The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, a trade coalition that represents spirits producers, called in a statement co-signed by other industry groups on the federal government to reject the findings of the panel.",
      "\"Today's report is the product of a flawed, opaque and unprecedented process, rife with bias and conflicts of interest,\" the statement said,\" accusing some of the experts on the federal panel of having ties to international anti-alcohol advocacy organizations.",
      "\"Congress never authorized or appropriated money for the panel or its work, and numerous letters from Congress and industry have voiced serious concerns over the process,\" the statement said.",
      "Alcohol linked to deaths from cancer, injuries, other causes",
      "The report was designed to weigh all of the data on a range of diseases and injuries, and boiled down a complex web of studies that have looked at alcohol's health risks and benefits into \"alcohol-attributable death\" estimates.",
      "This modeling is likely underestimating the true health risks of alcohol, Naimi said, given limits in how researchers can study its health impacts.",
      "Risks can also vary widely from person to person, the report cautions, meaning some harms can be very small for some even if they add up to substantial risks at the public health level.",
      "\"The overall effect of alcohol consumption on all-cause mortality is dependent upon the risk of diseases and injuries that are causally related to alcohol. These risks are affected by numerous factors, including smoking, diet, physical activity, obesity, hepatitis infection, and genetics,\" the report states.",
      "At one drink a day, the report estimated that injuries and cancer added up to the biggest contributors of the risk for a premature death.",
      "For men, injuries made up a substantial portion of the risk of dying. This includes a variety of accidents, road injuries and intentional harm, like suicide and violence linked to drinking.",
      "Cancer, which was next largest factor, made up a third of the additional risk of death for men.",
      "For women consuming one drink a day, the risk of death from cancer was statistically similar or larger compared to the increased risk of fatal injuries.",
      "Increased risk of a number of cancers \u2014 colorectal, female breast cancer, and cancers of the liver, mouth, throat and esophagus \u2014 \"begins with any alcohol use and increases with higher levels of use,\" the report states.",
      "U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy issued an advisory earlier this month calling for a warning about the risk of cancer to be included on alcoholic beverages.",
      "Liver disease poses the next highest risk, and can be especially risky for people with other underlying conditions like hepatitis C that make people vulnerable.",
      "One risk that was lower in people drinking once per day, compared with never drinking, was for ischemic stroke. But that apparent benefit virtually disappears at two drinks per day.",

    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration released on Tuesday its long-awaited proposal to require food manufacturers to put some nutrition facts on the front of packages, in a bid to nudge Americans and food companies towards healthier diets in line with similar pushes in other countries.",
      "FDA's new \"nutrition info box\" focuses on telling people whether levels of saturated fat, sodium and added sugar are \"high\" or \"medium\" or \"low\" as well as the percentage for each serving.",
      "The proposal will be open for public comment for 120 days. It will be up to the incoming Trump administration to decide if and how to finalize the rule.",
      "After that, the FDA says that large food companies earning more than $10 million annually will have three years to comply with the rule. Smaller food brands will have an additional year.",
      "Up to $154 million will be spent by the food industry over the next decade to relabel their products with the new box, the FDA estimates.",
      "The agency also estimates many food brands may also spend millions more dollars to try to rework their products, changing their recipes to avoid being called out as having too much of an unhealthy nutrient.",
      "\"We assume there may be manufacturers who would want to reformulate to maybe move from the high category into the medium category, or the medium category into the low category,\" Rebecca Buckner, the associate deputy director for human food policy at the FDA, told reporters on Tuesday.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Trump's pick to head the federal department that oversees the FDA, has been sharply critical of federal nutrition officials for not doing enough to help Americans eat healthier diets and crack down on the food industry.",
      "Kennedy has not specifically addressed the proposal. A spokesperson for Kennedy did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Why only saturated fat, sodium and added sugars?",
      "The FDA said it will require the box to only call out saturated fat, sodium and added sugars. Food manufacturers would not be able to put other nutrients inside the FDA's information box.",
      "They cited research showing that \"simpler schemes are easier for consumers to understand\" for narrowing the box down to just these three worrying unhealthy nutrients.",
      "Designs they tested with focus groups that included nutrients Americans need more of, like fiber and calcium, confused participants.",
      "The FDA said it is still weighing whether calories should be incorporated into the label and acknowledged that some food brands are already voluntarily listing the information on the front.",
      "What determines \"high,\" \"medium\" and \"low\" levels?",
      "FDA officials said Tuesday that levels of saturated fat, sodium or added sugars will be deemed as \"high\" if they are above 20% in the daily value, a measurement of how much Americans eat each day in the \"reference\" diet. Medium was set at between 6% and 19% of the daily value. And low is 5% and below.",
      "Agency officials have used these benchmarks for \"high\" and \"low\" for decades, dating back to the formulation of the nutrition facts label back in the 1990s.",
      "At the time, officials decided against including the \"interpretive descriptions\" in the nutrition facts label. But the agency said recent data shows many Americans do not understand the percentages.",
      "\"It's really based on longstanding usage,\" McKinnon said.",
      "What will it look like?",
      "The FDA says food makers will be required to put the labels \"somewhere in the top third\" of the front of the box.",
      "The box also uses the same Helvetica font used in the nutrition facts on the back of the package and must comply with a range of more detailed rules to avoid it from being too small or obscured by other designs on the package.",
      "Some other design decisions were also abandoned during the focus group testing process, the FDA said.",
      "For example, previous mockups using the colors red, yellow and green to call out different levels did not make a statistically significant difference in helping people interpret the box.",

    "title": "Norovirus wave now more than double last year's peak, in CDC's data",
    "published": "Tue, 14 Jan 2025 09:50:37 -0500",
    "summary": "Officials have blamed a new strain for this winter's surge in norovirus cases.",
    "story": [
      "This winter's wave of norovirus infections has reached levels that are now more than double last season's peak, in figures published Monday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tracking the notorious stomach bug.",
      "Nearly 28% of norovirus tests run over the week of the New Year's holiday came back positive for the highly contagious virus, which is the leading cause of foodborne illness like vomiting and diarrhea in the U.S.",
      "That is more than double the 13.52% of tests coming back positive reached during the peak of last season's wave in March, according to data from public health laboratories around the country tallied by the CDC.",
      "Labs usually test samples of sick people's stool for the virus, which can be diagnosed up to 10 days after symptoms begin. The virus can also be found in other samples, including contaminated food or drinks that can spread the virus.",
      "Rates of norovirus in that CDC system have reached levels at or above last season's peak in all regions of the country. Norovirus test positivity rates look to be the worst in the Midwest, in a grouping of states spanning Kansas through Michigan.",
      "Since most people sick with norovirus get better without needing to go to the doctor, a majority of cases go unreported in the U.S. Instead, health authorities and experts use other measurements, such as the rate of positive tests, to track trends of the virus.",
      "Data from WastewaterSCAN's sewer sampling also suggests norovirus rates in recent weeks have been highest in the Midwest as well as the Northeast. Figures published by private testing company BioFire Diagnostics are also above previous seasonal peaks for norovirus.",
      "Why are norovirus cases so high in 2025?",
      "While norovirus rates always worsen during the colder months, in recent years most trends tracking norovirus did not reach their peak until March or April.",
      "That's different from seasons leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic, which scrambled many usual seasonal patterns of germs. During that time, norovirus outbreaks often reached peak levels as early as December and January.",
      "Experts say this year's early and steep surge of cases is being driven by a new strain of norovirus called GII.17[P17], which has displaced a previous strain that had dominated previous waves of the virus in the U.S. for a decade.",
      "That new strain has been spotted everywhere around the country, including in many cruise ship outbreaks, a CDC official told CBS News. Lower population immunity to GII.17[P17] could explain this year's unusual wave of the virus.",
      "More than 7 in 10 outbreaks have been linked to this new norovirus strain this season, according to the latest CDC figures.",

    "summary": "More than 20 million egg-laying chickens in the U.S. died last quarter, federal data shows.",
    "story": [
      "More than 20 million egg-laying chickens in the U.S. died last quarter because of bird flu, data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture shows, marking the worst toll inflicted on America's egg supply since the outbreak began.",
      "The record number of chicken deaths, which includes those birds culled when infection is discovered in a flock, come as figures show egg prices have soared to the highest they have been in years, driven in large part by the virus.",
      "\"Unlike in past years, in 2024, all major production systems experienced significant losses including conventional caged, cage-free, and certified organic types,\" a USDA report said this month.",
      "Taxpayers will pick up the tab for the lost birds. To incentivize farmers to quickly report and stomp out the virus, a USDA program pays producers for the eggs and poultry they cull.",
      "Last year, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said it had spent $1.25 billion on payments to farmers since the outbreak started in 2022.",
      "Why are bird flu cases high right now in poultry?",
      "U.S. officials brace every winter for upticks in bird flu because migrating wild birds that spread the virus fly south during the colder months.",
      "It's also easier for the virus to spread in the winter. Heat and sunlight degrade the virus on surfaces, the USDA says.",
      "This winter has been different because a strain of the bird flu virus has spilled over into dairy herds too, leading to hundreds of infected herds.",
      "Authorities suspect the virus has been hitching a ride in droplets of contaminated raw milk. Those are ferried between farms by workers' clothing, equipment and animals shared between farms.",
      "California has been hit especially hard in recent months, forcing the state to declare a state of emergency to try to respond to the bird flu outbreak.",
      "This winter's surge of bird flu is from a different virus than the uptick of seasonal flu infections that also drives humans to emergency rooms every winter.",
      "While bird flu led to millions of dead poultry over the past year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has tallied only 66 confirmed human cases in the U.S. from bird flu viruses.",
      "Most American cases of bird flu have been mild. A majority were farm workers who were infected after close contact with animals infected by a bird flu strain that spilled over into dairy cows in late 2023.",
      "Researchers think\u00a0this bird flu strain mutated to be milder to humans than other variants spreading in the wild. Those other strains usually cause more severe disease when they jump into humans.",
      "Can animals be vaccinated for bird flu?",
      "The USDA announced this week it is drawing up a new stockpile of poultry vaccines. That vaccine will target the D1.1 strain of the virus, which has been spreading in wild birds and was recently to blame for a fatal human case in Louisiana.",
      "But officials said it's unlikely the vaccine will be used. The Biden administration has been weighing the possibility of vaccinating poultry for bird flu for years.",
      "That is different from plans to potentially vaccinate cows for bird flu, which the USDA says appears \"more feasible and more likely to be successful\" in battling the virus. Seven potential vaccines are now being tested in field safety trials, the department said.",
      "One major hurdle has been the fear that vaccines will only hide the symptoms of the otherwise highly lethal disease in birds. That could result in export restrictions from countries afraid the virus could spread to them through poultry products.",
      "In 2023, the USDA banned imports of some products from Europe after authorities announced they would start vaccinating some poultry for bird flu.",
      "Spread of the virus through contaminated meat in the U.S. has already happened during this year's outbreak at least twice: raw pet food made from sick animals was linked to an outbreak that killed cats in California and Oregon.",
      "A Food and Drug Administration spokesperson told CBS News that the agency is now urging the animal food supply chain to take steps to curb the threat of the virus spreading, including heat treatment to kill off the virus and avoiding using infected animals.",
      "\"All recent detections of H5N1 in cats had these things in common: the infected cats ate wild birds, unpasteurized milk, raw poultry, and/or raw poultry pet food,\" the spokesperson said.",

    "published": "Sun, 19 Jan 2025 00:06:30 -0500",
    "summary": "U.S. officials have long feared that the widely popular short-form video app could be used as a vehicle for espionage.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The 170 million TikTok users in the U.S. were in for a rude awakening late Saturday night when the enormously popular video-sharing app became inaccessible because of a law passed by a bipartisan majority in Congress last year.",
      "TikTok voluntarily shut down service to its users ahead of Sunday's ban. Users in the U.S. who opened the app were greeted with a message with the headline, \"Sorry, TikTok isn't available right now.\"",
      "\"A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S.,\" the message reads. \"Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned!\"",
      "TikTok was also no longer available in the Apple or Google Play stores. CBS News has reached out to TikTok for comment.",
      "Lawmakers and U.S. officials have sounded the alarm for years about the supposed risks that TikTok's ties to China pose to national security, and Congress moved last year to force TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell its stake in the app or be cut off from the U.S. market. The law gave the company a deadline of Jan. 19 \u2014 one day before a new president would take office.",
      "With no sign of a sale in sight, TikTok's last-ditch legal challenge failed on Friday\u00a0when the Supreme Court said the law does not violate the First Amendment.",
      "The Biden White House said it will leave enforcement of the law to the incoming Trump administration, and President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to \"save\" the app. On Saturday, Trump told NBC News he was considering an option to extend the deadline for the law to go into effect.",
      "\"The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it's appropriate,\" he said in the phone interview, adding, \"if I decide to do that, I'll probably announce it on Monday.\"",
      "The law allows the president, under some circumstances, to grant a one-time extension of up to 90 days regarding the date when the law goes into effect.",
      "TikTok had hinted it would take itself offline, a move that leaves content creators and users in the lurch as the company seeks a way to get back on firm legal footing.",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News Friday evening, TikTok said that the Biden administration had \"failed to provide the necessary clarity and assurance to the service providers that are integral to maintaining TikTok's availability to over 170 million Americans. Unless the Biden Administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre had earlier Saturday called TikTok's latest statement \"a stunt.\"",
      "\"We have seen the most recent statement from TikTok,\" Jean-Pierre said. \"It is a stunt, and we see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump Administration takes office on Monday. We have laid out our position clearly and straightforwardly: actions to implement this law will fall to the next administration. So TikTok and other companies should take up any concerns with them.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the TikTok ban and how we got here:",
      "Why did Congress want to ban TikTok?",
      "U.S. officials have repeatedly warned that TikTok threatens national security because the Chinese government could use it as a vehicle to spy on Americans or covertly influence the U.S. public by amplifying or suppressing certain content.",
      "The concern is warranted, they said, because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering. FBI Director Christopher Wray told House Intelligence Committee members last year that the Chinese government could compromise Americans' devices through the software.",
      "As the House took up the divest-or-ban law in April 2024, Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, compared it to a \"spy balloon in Americans' phones.\" Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, said that lawmakers learned in classified briefings \"how rivers of data are being collected and shared in ways that are not well-aligned with American security interests.\"",
      "\"Why is it a security threat?\" Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said Friday. \"If you have TikTok on your phone currently, it can track your whereabouts, it can read your text messages, it can track your keystrokes. It has access to your phone records.\"",
      "If the Chinese government gets its hands on that information, \"it's not just a national security threat, it's a personal security threat,\" Hawley said.",
      "In 2022, TikTok began an initiative known as \"Project Texas\" to safeguard American users' data on servers in the U.S. and ease lawmakers' fears. The Justice Department said the plan was insufficient because it still allowed some U.S. data to flow to China.",
      "Though the divest-or-ban law passed with bipartisan support, some lawmakers have been critical of the measure, agreeing with TikTok that it infringes on Americans' free speech rights.",
      "\"Most of the reasons the government banned it were based on accusations, not proof,\" Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said Friday. \"[TikTok has] never been tried and found guilty of sharing information with the communist government.\"",
      "Others have changed their tune as the deadline for a ban neared, including Trump, who tried to ban the app with an executive order during his first term that was struck down in the courts.",
      "\"The irony in all of this is that Donald Trump was the first one to point out there's a problem,\" Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Thursday. Warner said the Trump administration \"did a great job of convincing me and overwhelming members of Congress\" about the risks.",
      "TikTok has its day at the Supreme Court",
      "During arguments before the Supreme Court on Jan. 10, TikTok's lawyer did not deny the potential national security risks as the justices appeared critical of the company's legal challenge.",
      "\"I think Congress and the president were concerned that China was accessing information about millions of Americans, tens of millions of Americans, including teenagers, people in their 20s, that they would use that information over time to develop spies, to turn people, to blackmail people, people who a generation from now will be working in the FBI or the CIA or in the State Department,\" Justice Brett Kavanaugh said. \"Is that not a realistic assessment by Congress and the president of the risks here?\"",
      "Noel Francisco, who represented TikTok, responded, \"I'm not disputing the risks. I'm disputing the means that they have chosen.\"",
      "Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar asserted that TikTok collects \"unprecedented amounts\" of personal data that would be \"incredibly valuable\" to the Chinese government by giving it \"a powerful tool for harassment, recruitment and espionage.\"",
      "\"For years, the Chinese government has sought to build detailed profiles about Americans, where we live and work, who our friends and coworkers are what our interests are and what our vices are,\" she said, citing major data breaches that the U.S. has attributed to China over the last decade, including the hack of the Office of Personnel Management that compromised the personal information of millions of federal employees.",
      "The Supreme Court's TikTok decision",
      "In defending the law before the Supreme Court, the Justice Department pointed to two main national security justifications: countering China's collection of data from TikTok's 170 million U.S. users and its purported ability to manipulate content on the app to further its geopolitical interests.",
      "The Supreme Court's unanimous ruling hinged on the first justification: that China, through the app and its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, can amass vast amounts of information from American users. The justices found that Congress did not violate the First Amendment by taking action to address that threat. Congress, it said, \"had good reason to single out TikTok for special treatment.\"",
      "The court refrained from backing the government's interest in stopping China's purported covert manipulation of content, which the Biden administration had cited as a national security justification for the law.",
      "\"One man's 'covert content manipulation' is another's 'editorial discretion,'\" Gorsuch wrote in an opinion concurring in judgment. \"Journalists, publishers, and speakers of all kinds routinely make less-than-transparent judgments about what stories to tell and how to tell them. Without question, the First Amendment has much to say about the right to make those choices.\"",

    "summary": "Experts say no other app offers the same financial opportunities as TikTok, while creators fear loss of income if it disappears.",
    "story": [
      "Small businesses and content creators are bracing for impact if TikTok goes dark this weekend after the Supreme Court on Friday upheld a\u00a0law banning the app unless it is sold by its China-based parent company.",
      "Jessica Simon, the founder of Mississippi Candle Company, on Friday said she was \"grieving\" over what she expects to be a steep decline in sales if TikTok is banned from app stores in the U.S. as early as Sunday. She said that between 90% and 98% of her company's sales come either directly or indirectly from TikTok.",
      "\"That much of our business comes from people seeing our products on TikTok and buying it through our TikTok shop, or coming to our website,\" Simon told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I am still processing the news.\"",
      "Simon, who first started making candles on her stovetop, said the TikTok shop she launched in 2023 \"changed our lives.\"",
      "Despite such concerns, the nation's highest court declined to block or delay the potential ban if TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance, fails to divest the platform. The Justice Department, which had supported the law, applauded the ruling.",
      "\"The Court's decision enables the Justice Department to prevent the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok to undermine America's national security,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a\u00a0statement. \"Authoritarian regimes should not have unfettered access to millions of Americans' sensitive data.\"",
      "Jeffrey Fisher, a lawyer who represented TikTok content creators in the app's case before the Supreme Court, also urged President Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland in a letter on Friday to delay implementation of the law.",
      "\"The law is scheduled to go into effect literally on the eve of the inauguration of President-elect Trump, who recently asked the Supreme Court for the same relief because he wants to work on this issue directly,\" Fisher wrote. \"He should be given that chance. Otherwise, the Act would significantly burden the speech rights of over 170 million Americans and would cause substantial and avoidable disruption to the third-party providers that may be subject to severe penalties if they continue to provide TikTok to its millions of users.\"",
      "In a statement late Friday, TikTok said the White House and Justice Department have failed to provide the necessary clarity and assurance to the service providers that are integral to maintaining TikTok's availability to over 170 million Americans.\"",
      "\"Unless the Biden administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19,\" the company added.",
      "The power of TikTok",
      "With 170 million monthly active users, TikTok is a significant moneymaker for millions of small businesses. For Simon, her company's reach on the platform generated enough sales to allow her to build a 2,100 square foot warehouse and to hire a team of employees to help make the company's products. Mississippi Candle surpassed six figures in sales for the first time in November, and again in December, she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I am heartbroken for my staff,\" she said. \"I won't be able to make up for that traffic or sales anywhere else,\" she said. Simon's company has 50,000 followers on TikTok, compared with 7,700 on Facebook and 3,100 on Instagram.",
      "\"So we won't be able to make up that income. We'll have to completely rebuild our community somewhere else, and it will take a lot longer than it did on TikTok,\" Simon added.",
      "Who wins if TikTok exits the U.S.?",
      "Morgan Stanley analysts say that Facebook and Instagram owner Meta stands to benefit from TikTok users migrating to other platforms, writing that the roughly 32 billion hours of annual U.S. consumer time spent on TikTok could soon be up for grabs.",
      "\"Meta remains the largest fundamental winner of any TikTok ban given its already leading user base, data set and distribution,\" the analysts said in a research note. Alphabet-owned YouTube also could benefit as it also lets users create short-form videos.",
      "Still, experts say that none of those apps come close to TikTok in its ability to generate income for brands, advertisers and creators.",
      "\"A ton of people are already flocking to other apps, but there is going to be a ton of damage and loss of revenue,\" Edward Klaris, managing partner at Klaris law, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"There are going to have to find alternative means of speaking, and this ban reduces their presence on a platform where they are already well-established.\"",
      "The parties that stand to lose from TikTok's U.S. operations shutting down range from independent content creators to businesses and advertisers. In the case of companies, TikTok allows them to establish accounts that reach users organically, as well with paid-ads. And popular influencers can make a lucrative living, with brands paying them to hawk their products.",
      "\"Advertisers are engaging in commercial speech to send out messages, influencers are doing commercial speech and businesses are also sharing information. Therefore there is a lot of spend going on,\" Klaris explained.",
      "He agreed that a ban could be good news for competitors like RedNote, another Chinese-owned app.",
      "The ramifications of shutting down TikTok in the U.S. would be wide-reaching for diverse users, according to Jessica Rauchberg, assistant professor of communication technologies at Seton Hall University.",
      "\"It really concerns me for everyday creators, particularly marginalized ones, who might have a disability and not be able to work in person,\" she said. \"TikTok is a great space for users to supplement their incomes with content creation, and when you lose that, where do you go? You can't just rebuild on another platform.\"",
      "\"It's a great way to reach customers, because a lot of younger people use it as a search engine and place to find a great local restaurant or craftsperson who is making special items you can't find at a Target or Walmart,\" Rauchberg added. \"It'll hurt consumers, and for small businesses it's a big tool for outreach. That's why they are scared.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 21:04:49 -0500",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court unanimously found the new law that could lead to a ban of TikTok does not violate the First Amendment rights of the platform or its users.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday rejected a challenge to a new law requiring TikTok to either sever ties with its China-based parent company or be banned in the United States, finding it did not violate the First Amendment rights of the platform or its users.",
      "The high court's unsigned decision clears the way for the law, passed last April, to take effect at midnight Sunday, and follows years of concerns raised by the federal government \u2014 during both the Trump and Biden administrations \u2014 about the risks TikTok poses to national security.",
      "In defending the law before the Supreme Court, the Justice Department pointed to two main national security justifications: countering China's collection of data from TikTok's 170 million U.S. users and its purported ability to manipulate content on the app to further its geopolitical interests.",
      "The Supreme Court's unanimous ruling hinged on the first justification: that China, through the app and its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, can amass vast amounts of information from American users. The justices found that Congress did not violate the First Amendment by taking action to address that threat.",
      "What the Supreme Court said in its ruling on the TikTok ban",
      "\"The act's prohibitions and divestiture requirement are designed to prevent China \u2014 a designated foreign adversary \u2014 from leveraging its control over ByteDance Ltd. to capture the personal data of U.S. TikTok users. This objective qualifies as an important government interest under intermediate scrutiny,\" the court said, referencing the middle standard applied by courts to assess the constitutionality of a law.",
      "Under intermediate scrutiny, a challenged law must further an important government interest and be substantially related to that interest to be upheld. It is a less demanding standard than strict scrutiny, the highest level of judicial review, and more stringent than rational-basis review, the lowest, most lenient tier.",
      "The court noted that TikTok \"collects extensive personal information from and about its users,\" including location data and contact lists. The justices reiterated the government's concerns that such information may allow China to track the locations of federal employees, craft dossiers of information for blackmail and conduct corporate espionage.",
      "The court's opinion also cited Congress' finding that under Chinese law, companies can be required to turn over data to the Chinese government.",
      "\"The government had good reason to single out TikTok,\" it said.",
      "The court went on to say that the law, called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, is \"sufficiently tailored to address the government's interest in preventing a foreign adversary from collecting vast swaths of sensitive data about the 170 million U.S. persons who use TikTok.\"",
      "Its provisions \"clearly serve the government's data collection interest,\" the court said, and are not broader than needed to address concerns about China's access to Americans' personal information.",
      "The court noted the government's interest in preventing China from having control over TikTok's powerful recommendation algorithm and its ability to covertly alter the content appearing on the app for users in the U.S. But it said the record in the case \"adequately supports the conclusion that Congress would have passed the challenged provisions based on the data collection justification alone.\"",
      "According to Congress and the Biden administration, the court said, ByteDance uses data collected from TikTok to train the app's recommendation algorithm and would not agree to stop collecting U.S. users' data or sending it to China. The government also noted the challenges with monitoring data-sharing between TikTok and its parent company.",
      "\"Under these circumstances, we find the government's data collection justification sufficient to sustain the challenged provisions,\" the court said.",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch issued a separate opinion agreeing with the outcome of the case, but splitting with the court's legal reasoning. He wrote that the court was right to refrain from endorsing the government's goal of preventing the purported covert manipulation of content by China.",
      "\"One man's 'covert content manipulation' is another's 'editorial discretion,'\" he wrote. \"Journalists, publishers, and speakers of all kinds routinely make less-than-transparent judgments about what stories to tell and how to tell them. Without question, the First Amendment has much to say about the right to make those choices.\"",
      "Gorsuch concluded his opinion by noting that \"speaking with and in favor of a foreign adversary is one thing. Allowing a foreign adversary to spy on Americans is another.\"",
      "The law at issue in the case requires TikTok to either divest from ByteDance or be cut off from U.S. app stores and hosting services beginning Jan. 19. President-elect Donald Trump, who will be sworn in for a second term on Jan. 20, had\u00a0urged the court\u00a0to pause implementation of the law to allow him to pursue a \"political resolution\" once he takes office, but said following the ruling that he \"must have time to review the situation.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the Biden administration will not begin enforcing the law beginning on Sunday, leaving it to the incoming Trump administration.",
      "\"President Biden's position on TikTok has been clear for months, including since Congress sent a bill in overwhelming, bipartisan fashion to the president's desk: TikTok should remain available to Americans, but simply under American ownership or other ownership that addresses the national security concerns identified by Congress in developing this law,\" she said. \"Given the sheer fact of timing, this administration recognizes that actions to implement the law simply must fall to the next administration, which takes office on Monday.\"",
      "What happens to TikTok when the Sunday deadline arrives is still unclear.",

      "The court's ruling comes days before the law, which was passed with bipartisan majorities of Congress last April, is set to take effect. TikTok and a group of content creators who use the app argued the law infringes on their free speech rights, and the Supreme Court heard arguments in their bid to block it one week ago.",
      "\"There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community. But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok's data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary,\" the court's opinion said.",
      "\"The challenged provisions further an important government interest unrelated to the suppression of free expression and do not burden substantially more speech than necessary to further that interest,\" the court said, adding that the law's requirements that TikTok either divest or face a ban are designed to prevent China from gaining access to the personal data from the app's U.S. users.",
      "Called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, the law requires TikTok to either divest from ByteDance, its parent company, or be cut off from U.S. app stores and hosting services beginning Jan. 19.

      "In response to the ruling, Trump wrote on Truth Social\u00a0that it was \"expected, and everyone must respect it. My decision on TikTok will be made in the not too distant future, but I must have time to review the situation. Stay tuned!\"",
      "With the Supreme Court declining to throw TikTok a lifeline, the immediate effects on access to the app as of Sunday's deadline aren't clear. Reuters reported Wednesday that the company planned to shut down for U.S. users once the ban takes effect. Those trying to open the app would be greeted with a pop-up message directing them to a website with information about the new law, according to the report.",
      "Many users have begun downloading their videos and data from TikTok in anticipation of a ban and migrating to other platforms, including the Chinese-owned RedNote.",
      "White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the Biden administration will not begin enforcing the law beginning on Sunday, leaving it to the incoming Trump administration.",

      "Trump could decline to enforce the ban, but companies like Apple and Google could still potentially face steep fines if they host the app in violation of the law. During arguments last week, the government noted there is a five-year statute of limitations for violations of the law, meaning a future administration could punish offenders.",
      "TikTok CEO Shou Chew said in a video that the company \"will do everything in its power to ensure our platform thrives\" for users. He also explicitly thanked Trump for \"his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States.\"",
      "\"We are grateful and pleased to have the support of a president who truly understands our platform, one who has used TikTok to express his own thoughts and perspectives, connecting with the world and generating more than 60 billion views of his content in the process,\" Chew said.",
      "TikTok and the Supreme Court",
      "Congress and the Biden administration have raised national security concerns about TikTok for years. Federal employees cannot have the app on their government-issued phones, and a majority of states have barred the platform on state government devices.",
      "The law aims to prevent China from collecting substantial amounts of data from the platform's 170 million U.S. users and covertly manipulate the content on TikTok to harm the U.S. by sowing discord and division, federal officials have said.",
      "But TikTok, which curates short videos for users through a powerful recommendation algorithm, said it is a U.S. company that is protected by the First Amendment from Congress' attempt to ban the platform.",
      "During arguments, the justices appeared poised to uphold the law, though several expressed concerns that it could conflict with the First Amendment. Still, many of the court's members seemed to agree that the law targeted TikTok's ownership by a foreign company, ByteDance, instead of the speech shared on the platform.",
      "Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who argued for the U.S. government, said the \"unprecedented amounts\" of personal data collected by TikTok would give the Chinese government \"a powerful tool for harassment, recruitment and espionage.\" She cited several data breaches that the U.S. has attributed to China over the last decade, including the hack of the Office of Personnel Management that compromised the personal information of millions of federal employees.",
      "\"For years, the Chinese government has sought to build detailed profiles about Americans, where we live and work, who our friends and coworkers are, what our interests are and what our vices are,\" Pregolar said.",
      "Noel Francisco, who argued on behalf of TikTok and ByteDance, said the Supreme Court's decision would be \"enormously consequential.\" If the companies are forced to cut ties, he said, TikTok \"would be a fundamentally different platform\" because the new owner would have to rebuild the algorithm, which would take years. Other social media platforms have tried to replicate the algorithm, but have been unable to match TikTok's, according to Jeffrey Fisher, who represented the creators. China has said it is opposed to the sale of TikTok's algorithm.",
      "If the law is not paused or overturned by Jan. 19, \"we go dark,\" Francisco said. \"The platform shuts down,\" he said, later clarifying that TikTok would no longer be available in U.S. app stores. If TikTok doesn't shut down voluntarily, experts told CBS News that the experience for users who already have it on their phones would likely suffer with time because they would no longer receive software updates.",
      "Several of the justices on the liberal and conservative wings of the bench repeatedly raised concerns about TikTok's collection of data from its American users and the Chinese government's access to that personal information.",
      "\"Are we supposed to ignore the fact that the ultimate parent is, in fact, subject to doing intelligence work for the Chinese government?\" Chief Justice John Roberts asked Francisco, referring to ByteDance.",
      "Congress found that ByteDance is subject to Chinese laws that require it to cooperate with the Chinese government's intelligence work and ensure it has the power to access private data the company holds, Roberts said.",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh, too, warned of the future implications of the Chinese government having access to data from the tens of millions of Americans who use TikTok every month.",
      "Congress and the president, he said, were worried that China \"would use that information over time to develop spies, to turn people, to blackmail people, people who a generation from now will be working in the FBI or the CIA or the State Department. Is that not a realistic assessment by Congress and the president of the risks here?\"",
      "Francisco claimed that TikTok would \"have to go mute\" unless it severs ties from ByteDance, but Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson pushed back on that characterization of the law.",
      "\"If TikTok were to, post-divestiture or whatever, pre-divestiture, come up with its own algorithm, then when the divestiture happened, it could still operate. It doesn't say, 'TikTok, you can't speak,'\" she said, adding that TikTok can remain in the U.S. as long as it's not associated with ByteDance.",
      "In its opinion, the high court focused primarily on the data collection concerns raised by Congress and the Justice Department, finding that the law is sufficiently tailored to address the U.S. government's interest in preventing a foreign adversary, China, from collecting \"vast swaths\" of sensitive information from TikTok's 170 million U.S. users.",
      "Congress, it said, \"had good reason to single out TikTok for special treatment.\"",
      "The court refrained from backing the government's interest in stopping China's purported covert manipulation of content, which the Biden administration had cited as a national security justification for the law.",
      "\"One man's 'covert content manipulation' is another's 'editorial discretion,'\" Gorsuch wrote in an opinion concurring in judgment. \"Journalists, publishers, and speakers of all kinds routinely make less-than-transparent judgments about what stories to tell and how to tell them. Without question, the First Amendment has much to say about the right to make those choices.\"",
      "For Americans who rely on TikTok to exchange ideas about all manner of topics, from politics to entertainment to the news, the stakes of the case are high. Creators who challenged the law said they use it to sell products, reach thousands of people and create a nationwide community.",
      "\"That's our editor and publisher of choice that we think best disseminates our speech,\" Fisher said.",
      "Trump attempted to effectively ban TikTok during his first term in office because of national security concerns, though his executive order targeting the app was blocked by a federal court and then rescinded by Mr. Biden. But the president-elect has reversed course on his view of the platform.",
      "Trump told Newsmax in an interview this week that he's \"not opposed\" to TikTok and said his campaign's use of the app helped him win over young voters in the November presidential election.",

Walgreens allegedly filled prescriptions for dangerous and excessive quantities of opioids, the lawsuit said, including early refills among other prescriptions.",
      "\"Our complaint alleges that Walgreens pharmacists filled millions of controlled substance prescriptions with clear red flags that indicated the prescriptions were highly likely to be unlawful, and that Walgreens systematically pressured its pharmacists to fill prescriptions, including controlled substance prescriptions, without taking the time needed to confirm their validity,\" Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M.

By several key measures, the economy is stronger than it was four years ago: The jobless rate is near a 50-year low, wages are growing and the U.S. managed to sidestep a recession widely expected by many on Wall Street as the Federal Reserve moved to curb inflation by ratcheting up interest rates.",

      "Zandi added, \"How much he can take credit for that, it's a reasonable debate, but I think he deserves a lot of credit.\"",
      "Zandi pointed to several pieces of landmark legislation passed under Biden, including the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act, or ARPA, as helping to stabilize the nation and produce growth that has surpassed most other major economies around the world.",
      "Biden also score some wins on health care, such as a new $2,000 out-of-pocket\u00a0spending cap on prescriptions for Medicare enrollees and a $35 cap on insulin prices.",
      "Yet in retrospect, he added, additional trillions in federal stimulus may have played a part in the soaring inflation of the last few years, which Zandi said was also fueled by the economic impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "ARPA \"was very controversial, but at the end of the day it got the economy back to full employment,\" Zandi said.",
      "Deep structural problems",
      "Although Biden's policies were key in helping the economy recover from the pandemic, millions of Americans continue to struggle with a cost-of-living crisis worsened by the hottest inflation in four decades. Long-term challenges in housing affordability only deepened during the Biden administration, while U.S. wealth inequality today remains near record levels.",
      "To be sure, health care, child care and education costs have outpaced inflation\u00a0for years, weighing on millions households and making many families vulnerable to even minor downturns. But the inflation spike in 2022 intensified these existing financial pains, said Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive economic think tank.",
      "\"The American economy for a long time has been characterized by a lack of affordability for the biggest ticket items,\" Owens said. \"Housing has been out of reach, health care has been expensive, child care is expensive \u2014 that was all true before Biden.\"",
      "Meanwhile, a Biden plan to sweep away student loan debt was largely\u00a0shot down by the courts, although the Department of Education used other means to offer relief to millions of borrowers. Housing costs continued to soar under Biden due to rising home values as well as soaring mortgage rates after the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates to battle inflation.",
      "The upshot: Under Biden, many households remained dogged by the same long-term pocketbook issues that have prevailed for decades under previous presidential administrations. During the pandemic, the soaring cost of essentials like food, fuel and rent only deepened the country's widespread precarity \u2014 a gnawing sense of financial insecurity that has left tens of millions of Americans vulnerable to job losses, medical problems and even modest economic dips.",
      "Ballooning debt",
      "Biden's legislative wins \u2014 ARPA and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in 2021, and the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act in 2022 \u2014 added trillions in additional federal spending. The idea underlying these efforts was to rejuvenate the U.S. economy by investing in key sectors, such as by building semiconductor chip plants, rebuilding U.S. roads or accelerating the shift toward green energy.",
      "But those efforts will likely take years to pay off, economists note. In the meantime, the nation's debt has ballooned to a record $36.2 trillion as of mid-January due to a combination of fiscal stimulus authorized by both Biden and Trump, as well as Trump's 2017 tax cuts.",
      "With federal spending outpacing revenues, the nation will face tough choices, such as whether to raise taxes, cut federal programs or both. Asked to describe Biden's economic legacy, Cato Institute vice president of general economics Scott Lincicome summarized it in one word: \"Frustrating.\"",
      "\"If you could look at the basic fundamentals \u2014 economic growth, jobs \u2014 things have been pretty good,\" Lincicome, who describes himself as a \"libertarian free marketer,\" added. \"But if you look beneath the hood, there are some rather significant problems.\"",
      "Chief among them are the nation's spiraling debt, Lincicome said. Treasury yields have been rising ahead of Trump's inauguration on Monday, partly due to concerns that the U.S. could struggle in coming years to service its debt.",
      "\"In terms of what Trump inherits \u2014 and it's not just Biden's fault, Trump did a lot of COVID spending, too \u2014 but we're now at a point where you can see bond markets are chirping, and you can see inflation has remained stubbornly higher than we would have hoped,\" Lincicome noted. \"The [Congressional Budget Office] and a lot of other folks agree that the debt is a pretty pressing issue.\"",
      "Trump's economy on Jan. 20",
      "Despite such concerns, the economists interviewed by CBS MoneyWatch say that Trump will inherit a strong economy when he's inaugurated. The nation's unemployment rate is 4.1%, down from 6.4% when Biden took office in January of 2021. In another plus for workers, average hourly earnings through December rose\u00a03.9%, keeping pay growth\u00a0ahead of consumer prices, which are up 2.9% over the last year.",
      "Not surprising, then, that Zandi and Lincicome had the same advice for the Trump administration in how it handles the U.S. economy: \"Do no harm.\"",
      "\"The best thing Trump could do is do nothing,\" Zandi said. \"Biden got a basket case economy and he's bequeathing an economy that is operating at full tilt.\"",
      "For his part, Trump has signaled his intent to reshape the economy through a combination of steeper tariffs, deeper tax cuts, fewer federal regulations and mass deportations of undocumented immigrants.",
      "\"Joe Biden's legacy is marred by crippling inflation, a migrant crime invasion and American weakness on the world stage,\" Trump-Vance Transition Spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Thankfully, in just five days, President Trump will usher in a new Golden Age of American success and carry out his mandate to make America wealthy, safe, strong and great again.\"",
      "Economists view some of Trump's stated plans as potentially inflationary, although some question whether the president-elect will follow through with all of them, such as a broad-based tariff on all imports.",
      "\"We expect tariffs on imports from China and autos, but not a universal tariff, which would carry economic and political risks that we think the White House will prefer to avoid,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a December research note.",
      "At the same time, the Trump administration wants to extend his 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (TCJA), an effort the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has projected could add $4.6 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade. Trump has vowed that his tariffs would raise enough money to cover the tax cuts, a proposition that economists assess as unlikely.",
      "Tariffs could raise \"a few hundred billion, maybe, but that's total, and you're still in a massive hole,\" Lincicome noted.",
      "American oligarchs",
      "Extending the tax cuts would also likely favor the nation's wealthiest households, given that the TCJA cut taxes for top earners far more than for low- or middle-income Americans. During the past four years, America's richest people have seen their wealth soar, with Elon Musk \u2014 the world's richest person and a close adviser and backer of Trump \u2014 now worth $450 billion, more than double his $175 billion net worth when Biden was inaugurated in 2021, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "In his farewell message on Wednesday, Biden warned that the growing concentration of wealth in the U.S. poses a serious risk to the nation.",
      "\"Today, an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy, our basic rights and freedoms and a fair shot for everyone to get ahead,\" Biden said.",
      "That's unlikely to change under Trump, economists predicted \"The big story of American inequality is a simple one: It's the takeoff in top incomes,\" Owens noted.",
      "She believes that \"Until we tax the top, we will have runaway income inequality.\"",

    "summary": "JSB and Perdue Farms agreed to settlements of $4 million each, while QSA, which employed 54 children, will pay $400,000.",
    "story": [
      "The problem of kids working in dangerous slaughterhouses continues to be a concern as the Labor Department announced its third agreement this week with a company in the industry agreeing to pay a penalty and reform its practices to help ensure it won't hire underage workers again.",
      "On Thursday, the Department said investigators found that another slaughterhouse cleaning company called QSI had employed 54 children at 13 meatpacking plants in eight states on overnight shifts sanitizing the industrial carving and slicing machines companies use to produce beef and chicken between 2021 and 2024. This is at least the fourth example of one of these cleaning contractors being caught employing kids in the last two-and-a-half years. QSI will pay a $400,000 penalty.",
      "QSI disputes the way the Department describes the problem and points out that investigators weren't able to find any current juvenile workers and didn't require a formal court agreement with ongoing monitoring like they did a couple years ago with the most egregious offender: the PSSI cleaning company that ultimately paid more than $1.5 million and agreed to changes.",
      "Earlier this week, Perdue Farms agreed to pay $4 million after children were found working at one of its chicken processing plants in Virginia. One day earlier, meatpacking giant JBS Foods also agreed to pay $4 million and make changes to try to keep kids from getting jobs at its plants.",
      "All three of these announcements come just days before President elect Donald Trump takes office, but they follow a number of other child labor investigations in the meatpacking industry in the past few years. To Debbie Berkowitz, who was a top OSHA official in the Obama administration, the flurry of announcements this week helps solidify the Biden administration's legacy of trying to \"stamp out child labor in this very dangerous meat and poultry industry\" while putting the new administration on notice.",

      "It's against the law for anyone under the age of 18 to work at a dangerous job like a meatpacking plant, but ever since the PSSI investigation was announced in the fall of 2022 investigators keep finding more examples of it.

      "That prompted additional investigations and a broad call for the meatpacking industry to tighten up its hiring practices to make sure kids don't get hired. Sometimes the major meat companies, like JBS, Tyson Foods, Cargill and Smithfield Foods, have pointed to contractors as the ones with hiring problems, but officials maintain that the big companies are responsible for all their contractors taking appropriate precautions.",

In May 2023, a Tennessee-based sanitation company, Fayette Janitorial Service, agreed to pay nearly $650,000 in civil penalties after a federal investigation found it illegally hired at least two dozen children to clean dangerous meat processing facilities in Iowa and Virginia.",
      "In addition to the federal investigations some states got involved. Last fall, Smithfield Foods, one of the nation's largest meat processors, agreed to pay $2 million to resolve allegations of child labor violations at a plant in Minnesota.",
      "The Labor Department said that QSI, which is based in Chattanooga, Tennessee, as part of a company called the Vincit Group, employed children on overnight shifts at 13 meat processing plants in Collinsville, Alabama; Livingston, California; Harbeson and Georgetown, Delaware; Milford, Indiana; Ottumwa, Iowa; Canton and Winesburg, Ohio; Shelbyville and Morristown, Tennessee; and Temperanceville, Virginia. The Department didn't name the companies that own those plants",
      "QSI spokesman Dan Scorpio said he doesn't believe that's accurate because investigators didn't provide details of the violations the company could verify. \"QSI has a zero-tolerance policy for any employment of underage workers,\" he said. \"We have taken extensive steps over the last two and a half years to strengthen our hiring and compliance practices as we continue to serve our customers with integrity and excellence.\"",

      "Hundreds of ongoing investigations",

      "\"There is so much technical information that is passed back and forth during that negotiation and that is largely done by people who will stay here,\" said Brooks-Lasure.",
      "\"We have got to get a handle on prescription drug costs in this country, and it's crucial that Medicare, the CMS staff are negotiating lower prices. It's important for the people taking the drugs. It's also important for the entire Medicare program. We want to make sure this program is here for us and our children,\" she said.",
      "Which drugs were selected for the first round?",
      "The Biden administration announced the 10 drugs selected for the first round of the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program in August 2023, and reached an agreement in August 2024.",

    "story": [
      "Block, the parent company of popular online payment service Cash App, has been ordered by a federal agency to pay as much as $175 million because of repeated failures by the financial services provider to protect customers from fraud.",
      "Block has agreed to pay up to $120 million to consumers harmed by fraudulent transactions and unfair business practices detailed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) in a consent order filed on Thursday. The company must also pay a fine of $55 million into the CFPB's victims relief fund.",
      "\"Cash App created the conditions for fraud to proliferate on its popular payment platform,\" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a statement. \"When things went wrong, Cash App flouted its responsibilities and even burdened local banks with problems that the company caused.\"",
      "Block disputes the CFPB's findings.",
      "\"While we strongly disagree with the CFPB's mischaracterizations, we made the decision to settle this matter in the interest of putting it behind us and focusing on what's best for our customers and our business,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "The company also said it uses a number of means to support customers and ensure they are protected while using Cash App. Those include providing multiple ways for customers to contact Block, such as a dispute submission tool within Cash App; using AI to spot and stop fraud; and using advanced technology to warn customers about potential scams involving their transactions.",
      "Failure to investigate potential fraud",
      "Peer-to-peer platforms such as Cash App are generally required by law, under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, to investigate disputes of unauthorized transactions. But Cash App customers, many of whom have their bank account linked to the app, were misled by the terms of service to believe that disputes over transactions were the responsibility of their bank, the CFPB said.",
      "In one instance cited in the agency's consent order, Cash App instructed a customer who reported an unauthorized debit card to contact the person's bank, shirking its statutory duty to investigate possible incidents of fraud.",
      "\"In numerous instances, respondent failed to conduct investigations promptly or in some cases at all upon Notices of Error from consumers that provided the required information,\" the CFPB said.",
      "When Block did investigate disputes, it \"used intentionally shoddy investigation practices to close reports of unauthorized transactions in the company's favor,\" the consumer agency added.",
      "Unreachable customer service",
      "Block also made it difficult for Cash App clients to obtain helpful customer service, according to the CFPB. For many years, a telephone number listed on the back of the app's Cash Card and in the terms of service connected users to a pre-recorded redirecting them to contact customer support through the app. Those who contacted Cash App customer service through the app, or in some cases by mail, frequently received \"delayed, inadequate, confusing or inaccurate responses,\" the agency said.",
      "In addition to the $175 million in refunds and fine, the consent order requires Block to provide 24-hour, live-person customer service. It also requires that Block investigate unauthorized transactions promptly and thoroughly as well as \"to provide timely refunds, where appropriate.\"",
      "How do I get my refund?",
      "Block is required to pay a minimum amount of $75 million and up to $120 million in refunds to consumers victimized by fraudulent transactions who did not receive refunds they were entitled to, as well as to those whose unauthorized transfers were not adequately investigated by Cash App. Consumers whose accounts were locked or who were not provided provisional credits during a delayed investigation are also entitled to a refund.",
      "Consumers will not need to take action to obtain a refund, according to the CFPB's latest guidance. The agency said it will enforce the order's requirement to ensure that affected Cash App users receive refunds and other redress.",
      "With more than 56 million accounts, Cash App is one of the largest peer-to-peer payment platforms in the country. The service allows consumers to send and receive electronic money transfers to accept direct deposits and use a prepaid Cash Card to make purchases and ATM withdrawals.",

    "story": [
      "Dozens of shareholders representing $266 billion in assets are calling on Walmart to spell out the business reasons for backpedaling on the retailer's\u00a0diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.",
      "Investors including Amalgamated Bank and Dominican Sisters of Grand Rapids said Tuesday in a letter to Walmart CEO Doug McMillon that they are \"concerned to see our company give into bullying and pressure from anti-DEI groups.\"",
      "The world's largest retailer in November joined a growing list of corporations ditching their DEI programs after coming under attack by conservative activists. The sweeping changes included a decision by Walmart not to renew a five-year commitment for an equity racial center set up in 2020 after\u00a0the police killing of George Floyd. Walmart also said it would no long consider race or gender in its treatment of suppliers.",
      "Organized by the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, a coalition that seeks to influence corporate behavior, the investors requested a meeting with Walmart leaders about the change in policy, noting they had for decades supplied data illustrating the business hazards linked to discrimination and inequity.",
      "\"Seeing the company retreat from its stated values and the business opportunities associated with a diverse and inclusive workforce is very disheartening. Additionally, Walmart has not offered a financial or business case for this change in policy,\" the investors wrote.",

      "Other companies have also moved to unwind their DEI efforts in recent weeks. Meta last week said it would pull the plug on its DEI programs, joining other corporate giants to make the move, including\u00a0Ford\u00a0and\u00a0McDonald's.

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's pick to be treasury secretary, Scott Bessent fielded sharp questions Thursday at his confirmation hearing from Democrats and Republicans on tax policy, tariffs, China, Russia sanctions and the IRS tax filing system.",
      "Bessent told the Senate Finance Committee that the U.S. faces economic calamity if Congress doesn't renew provisions of Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. He also argued the Federal Reserve should remain independent from the president's influence and U.S. sanctions on Russian oil should be more aggressive.",
      "He was introduced by a fellow South Carolinian, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, who said the U.S. needs a treasury secretary \"who knows what he's doing, has the trust of the president and loves his country.\" Graham added, \"Your ship came in with this guy.\"",
      "But Democrats, including Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Michael Bennet of Colorado, expressed frustration that Trump's promise to extend provisions of his 2017 tax cuts would benefit the wealthiest taxpayers and add to the growing national debt that has surpassed $36 trillion.",
      "Bennet accused Bessent of shedding \"crocodile tears\" over the debt and spending, while the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act drove up the debt. \"There's so many things I think you owe the American people after we have seen the catastrophe\" from the tax cuts.",
      "Bessent is a billionaire who, before becoming a Trump donor and adviser, donated to various Democratic causes in the early 2000s, including Al Gore's presidential run. He also worked for George Soros, a major supporter of Democrats.",
      "GOP Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin also asked Bessent a series of questions about reducing national spending to pre-pandemic levels.",
      "In his testimony, Bessent committed to maintaining the IRS' Direct File program \u2014 which allows taxpayers to file their returns directly to the IRS for free \u2014 at least for the 2025 tax season, which begins Jan. 27. Republican lawmakers call the program a waste of money because free filing programs already exist, although they are not popular.",
      "He also called for stronger sanctions on Russia, criticizing the Biden administration for a sanctions regime he said isn't \"muscular\" enough. \"I believe the previous administration was worried about raising U.S. energy prices during an election season,\" Bessent said.",
      "Bessent was one of several people Trump considered for the position. Trump took his time before settling on Bessent as his nominee, also mulling over billionaire investor John Paulson and Howard Lutnick, whom Trump tapped as his nominee for commerce secretary.",
      "The treasury secretary is responsible for serving as the president's fiscal policy adviser and managing the public debt. He would also be a member of the president's National Economic Council.",
      "If confirmed, Bessent would oversee massive agencies within the Treasury Department, including the Internal Revenue Service. The IRS received a massive boost in funding from Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act, though that money has been in constant threat of being cut.",
      "Trump expects him to help reset the global trade order, enable trillions of dollars in tax cuts, ensure inflation stays in check, manage a ballooning national debt and still keep the financial markets confident.",
      "\"Productive investment that grows the economy must be prioritized over wasteful spending that drives inflation,\" Bessent testified.",
      "Senators were expected to question the money manager for hours on his views on cryptocurrency, the Trump-era tax cuts and potential conflicts of interest.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a member of the finance committee, sent Bessent more than 100 written questions in advance, interrogating him on such topics as agency independence, housing, treasury workforce issues and financial stability oversight.",
      "In addition, Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee are circulating a document that alleges Bessent has avoided paying roughly $1 million in taxes related to his hedge fund. During the hearing, Bessent said he and his husband are up to date on their taxes, and he is in litigation over the portion of his taxes in controversy. He also committed to shuttering his firm if confirmed to be treasury secretary.",
      "Bessent has backed extending provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which Trump signed into law in his first year in office. Estimates from various economic analyses of the costs of the various tax cuts range from nearly $6 trillion to $10 trillion over 10 years.",
      "He calls for spending cuts and shifts in existing taxes to offset the costs that extending the tax cuts would add to the federal deficit.",

The units earned will be paid out to the schools starting in 2026 on a rolling three-year basis.",
      "The longer a school stays in the tournament, the more units the school's conference receives. With a Final Four appearance, a team could bring its conference $1.26 million over the next three years. The revenue distribution plan for the women's tournament is similar to the men's.",

I can't wait to see all the incredible things they do.\"",

      "Bueckers, who is expected to be a top pick in the 2025 WNBA draft if she decides not to return to the Huskies for another year, said revenue sharing is a step in the right direction. \"I think that's huge, just for women's hoop, continuing to capitalize on what we've brought to the sport and what we do for just sport in general and entertainment,\" Bueckers told reporters.",

      "Trump, who was named 2024 Person of the Year by Time Magazine, acknowledged in an interview with the publication that bringing down food costs will be a difficult challenge.",
      "\"I'd like to bring them down. It's hard to bring things down once they're up. You know, it's very hard. But I think that they will,\" he said.",
      "Faith in Trump's ability to create jobs is a little higher \u2014 about 3 in 10 are extremely or very confident the Republican will make progress on this in 2025 \u2014 but the poll indicates that despite his sweeping promises about lowering prices, a substantial chunk of his own supporters don't have high confidence in his ability to quickly alleviate the economic pressures that continue to frustrate many households.",

      "Trump's proposed tariffs could raise U.S. grocery prices",
      "Those tempered expectations haven't dampened Republicans' hopes for Trump's second presidential term, though. And Democrats' pessimism about his return to office is more muted than it was when he\u00a0exited\u00a0the White House in 2020. About 8 in 10 Republicans say Trump will be a \"great\" or \"good\" president in his second term, according to the poll.",

      "Confidence in Trump's ability to handle the broader economic situation is also fairly low. Only about one-third of Americans are \"extremely\" or \"very\" confident in his ability to handle the economy and jobs. Nearly 2 in 10 are \"moderately\" confident, and about half are \"slightly confident\" or \"not at all confident.\"",

      "Americans are especially skeptical of Trump's ability to bring down health care costs or handle the issue of health care at all, the poll found. Only about 2 in 10 Americans are extremely or very confident in his ability to tackle health care issues, and 16% are confident in his ability to make progress on lowering health care costs.",
      "During the presidential campaign, Trump said he would look at alternatives to the Affordable Care Act. He has not offered a concrete plan of what his changes to the health care law would be, but he spent a lot of energy during his first term on efforts to dismantle it that were ultimately unsuccessful.",
      "Only about half of Republicans are extremely or very confident in Trump's ability to handle health care, and about one-third are at least very confident he'll make progress on lowering the cost of heath care.",
      "Trump's favorability remains steady",
      "Trump's favorability rating has remained steady through four indictments, a criminal conviction and two attempted assassinations, and the new survey shows that Americans' expectations for his second term match their assessment of his first four years in office. Slightly fewer than half of U.S. adults expect Trump will be a \"terrible\" or \"poor\" president in his second term, essentially unchanged from when he left the White House in 2021.",
      "But Republicans are expecting even bigger things from Trump this time, while Democrats' fears appear to be a little more muted. About half of Republicans say they think Trump will be a \"great\" president in his second term, while about 4 in 10 Republicans described him as a great president at the end of his first term. Democrats still overwhelmingly expect that Trump will be a \"terrible\" president, but that concern has lessened.",

    "summary": "With the U.S. ban on TikTok looming, many Americans are opting for another Chinese app known as RedNote. It could be short-lived.",
    "story": [
      "With the U.S. government's TikTok ban\u00a0set to kick in on Sunday, Americans have been flocking to an alternative social media platform, but it's another Chinese app, and experts say it could present the same, if not even more issues. There's been a surge in U.S. downloads of the Chinese-owned application Xiaohongshu, or \"RedNote\" as many users call it.",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News on Thursday that RedNote, just like TikTok, could face an ultimatum to divest, or be banned.",
      "\"This appears to be the kind of app that the statute would apply to and could face the same restrictions as TikTok if it's not divested,\" a U.S. official told CBS News.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Xiaohongshu for comment as to whether the company would agree with that assessment.",
      "What is RedNote?",
      "Xiaohongshu has been the most downloaded free app on Apple's app store in the U.S. since Tuesday. Analysis by Sensor Tower, a market intelligence firm, showed the platform's downloads in the U.S. had increased 200% year-on-year and seen a 194% uptick since last week.",
      "QR Code Generator, a firm that provides statistics on trends online, said there had been a 4,900% increase in searches on Google for Xiaohongshu in the U.S. on Monday alone.",
      "Xiaohongshu was founded in 2013 and is a lifestyle platform \"where over 300 million users every month share their life experiences,\" according to a description on Apple's app store.",
      "The Chinese photo and video-sharing platform has often been compared to Instagram. It operates as a platform for e-commerce, a manual for tips on travel and fine dining, as well as a vehicle for users to share content from their everyday lives.",
      "Xiaohongshu literally translates from Mandarin to \"little red book,\" likely a reference to the famed little red book of quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong, the founding father of Communist China.",
      "That reference has not put off the many American users who've turned to the app to share their experiences as so-called \"TikTok refugees\" ahead of the U.S. ban. Videos including a use of the \"TikTok refugee\" term on RedNote have racked up millions of views and impressions this week.",
      "\"This is for my fellow TikTok refugees and Americans, behave on this app! You better behave because everyone in China is being so kind to us as we colonize their cutesy tootsy app just because our government sucks,\" one American user account using the name \"Savannah\" posted on Wednesday. The post had gained almost 128,000 impressions by Thursday.",
      "TikTok, in its international form, is not available to users in mainland China, meaning the U.S. exodus to Xiaohongshu has put Americans in closer contact with Chinese users than they ever had been before. It's led to some amusing cultural exchanges.",
      "One American \"TikTok refugee\" with the username \"anieladiaz\" posted a video asking Chinese users if they had any questions. A Chinese user commented under the post with a screenshot of what appeared to be their English homework. Anieladiaz was happy to provide the answers to the test questions, which they shared in their own screenshot. Other Chinese users have been posting videos in which they teach Americans to use Mandarin slang words.",
      "Is RedNote safe?",
      "The rapid rise in U.S. downloads may be cause for concern for the same U.S. lawmakers who ushered in the ban on TikTok. One cybersecurity expert told CBS News that RedNote may actually represent an even greater threat.",
      "\"RedNote was never meant for outside of the China market. All of the data sharing and all the servers to which the data is being shared is in China,\" Adrianus Warmenhoven, a cybersecurity expert at Nord VPN, told CBS News on Wednesday. \"It means they are exempt from all of these data protections and outside of the view of the American government.\"",
      "Warmenhoven said TikTok and its parent company ByteDance had at least stored data in U.S.-based servers, which gave the U.S. government \"some modicum of moderation or limitations on data that can be sent to China and how much and in what way.\"",
      "He also said RedNote's terms and conditions lack transparency, which he said presents a huge cybersecurity risk for Americans.",
      "\"Its terms and conditions are in Mandarin, leaving non-Chinese-speaking users unclear about what data is collected and how it's used,\" Warmenhoven said. \"I'm pretty sure those millions who are moving over are not using Google Translate to read [the terms and conditions] so they don't know what they are agreeing to.\"",
      "The specific U.S. legislation\u00a0used to ban TikTok \u2014 the \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\" which President Biden signed into law last April, grants the federal government broad scope to crack down on foreign social media platforms.",
      "Under the law, Congress can compel a platform to divest its U.S. operations from foreign ownership, and it can be shut down if it qualifies as a threat. The law can apply to any platform that allows users to share content with each other and has more than 1 million monthly active users, is owned by a company located in a foreign adversary-controlled country, and has been determined by the president to present a significant national security threat.",
      "The legislation is currently subject to a legal challenge by ByteDance, which has argued that it's unconstitutional and violates the first amendment protecting free speech. A ruling from the Supreme Court is pending\u00a0in that case.",
      "CBS News has asked President-elect Donald Trump's transition team whether the incoming administration might deem RedNote a national security threat that should be subject to the law. The transition team had not responded by the time of the publication of this article.",
      "Trump has spoken out recently against the TikTok ban. Last month, he said he had a \"warm spot in my heart\" for TikTok \u2013 a reversal from his stance when he last occupied the Oval Office.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission, the agency tasked with enforcing the ban and ensuring that internet service providers in the U.S. and app store companies such as Apple and Google comply with the law, declined to comment.",
      "RedNote is heavily censored",
      "Content on RedNote appears to be much more heavily censored than posts on TikTok. A CBS News analysis found that any search for \"Xi Jinping,\" China's autocratic president, on RedNote yielded no results whatsoever.",
      "The term \"Free Hong Kong\" also brought back no results. A search for \"Taiwan\" will turn up several memes welcoming Americans to the platform, but noting that users must recognize the Beijing-imposed narrative that the democratically governed island just off China's coast, which the U.S. is legally bound to help defend from invasion, is an inseparable part of China.",
      "A similar search for those terms on TikTok turns up a wide range of political opinions from users, including posts heavily critical of Chinese censorship.",
      "RedNote even appears to be scaling up operations to monitor content given the vast number of Americans signing onto the app. CBS News found local job listings posted by the company online in mainland China advertising jobs to review English content and promising a monthly salary of between $950 and $1,200.",
      "\"Users are not going to a place with more freedom. RedNote is moderated differently, and the algorithm is different from TikTok,\" Warmenhoven told CBS News. \"You will not get traction or it will not spread politically sensitive issues, or maybe social sensitive issues \u2014 especially issues that are socially sensitive in China.\"",

    "summary": "Insurance companies are canceling homeowner policies across the U.S. \u2014 even in regions that aren't considered climate hot spots.",
    "story": [
      "As disasters linked to climate change become more frequent in the U.S., homeowners across the country are paying the price through skyrocketing insurance costs \u2014 and not only in states like Florida and California that are considered most vulnerable to global warming.",
      "The Los Angeles wildfires, which have decimated neighborhoods such as Pacific Palisades and Altadena, are focusing attention on a mounting insurance crisis that is particularly acute in states at greatest risk of wildfires, such as California, Colorado, Texas and Oregon. But the problem is reaching into almost every region of the U.S., including the Midwest, the Northeast and the Mountain states, according to analyses of insurance data.",
      "Research shows that climate change is heightening the conditions that lead to fire-conducive weather, including drying out vegetation and constraining water supplies. Such conditions are in turn prolonging wildfire season as well magnifying the size and intensity of blazes.",
      "In 2024, there were 27 weather and climate disasters causing at least $1 billion in damages, ranging from hurricanes, floods and tornadoes to wildfires, drought and hail, according to\u00a0data\u00a0from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Between 2020 and 2024, the average annual cost of those events topped $149 billion \u2014 more than double the annual average cost of roughly $65 billion between 1980 and 2024.",
      "\"Serious pocketbook issue\"",
      "The average homeowners insurance premium jumped 33% from 2020 to 2023, rising from $1,902 per year to $2,530, according to 2024\u00a0research\u00a0from economists at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School and the University of Wisconsin. By comparison, inflation rose about 18% during that same time period.",
      "Such costs have surged even more in parts of the U.S. prone to the kind of natural disasters that experts link to climate change. Homeowners in these states have seen their insurance premiums soar by about 50% over that three-year period, according to Benjamin Keys, a professor real estate and finance at Wharton and a co-author of the 2024 study.",
      "Yet even property owners in states considered less vulnerable to climate disasters are now grappling with increased insurance costs and dropped policies \u2014 issues that threaten to undermine property values.",
      "\"We're seeing it now for five years in a row \u2014 the increases in insurance costs \u2014 and they are correlated with increased severity of climate events,\" Jeremy Porter, head of climate implications research at First Street, a non-profit research firm that models climate risks, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"One thing that is surprising is that Kansas and Nebraska and these places in the middle of the country are also seeing these huge increases in insurance.\"",
      "While the average U.S. homeowners insurance cost is now about $2,300 per year, Nebraskans pay an average of $5,700, while Oklahomans are shelling out about $4,800 annually \u2014 not far from Florida's $5,500 average annual rate, Bankrate data shows.",
      "Insurers are responding to the increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires, hurricanes and flooding by hiking premiums to recoup their payouts, researchers have found. In 2000, homeowners' insurance costs represented about 7.5% of the typical mortgage; that figure had soared to 22% as of 2023, according to First Street's research.",
      "\"That is a serious pocketbook issue,\" said Wharton's Keys in a Jan. 10 webcast to discuss the Los Angeles wildfires and insurance, about the rise in policy premiums. \"That is the kind of thing that gets you around the kitchen table and say, do we need to move?\"",
      "Dropped policies from coast to coast",
      "In some cases, homeowners aren't only facing higher insurance costs, but also difficulties in even securing coverage.",
      "Non-renewal rates have climbed sharply in California and Florida, where the so-called insurer of last resort \u2014 the states' Fair Access to Insurance Requirements, or FAIR, plans \u2014 has seen a jump in enrollment. Thousands of homeowners in Los Angeles were dropped by their insurers last year, just months before the wildfires hit.",
      "\"It's the fire hazard. It's a fire danger, you know? We were in an area that they couldn't provide insurance to any longer,\" Jeff Cohen, whose Altadena, California, home was burned in this month's fires, told CBS News about being dropped by his insurer prior to the disaster. He and his wife eventually found pricier coverage through the state's FAIR Plan.",
      "But it's not only homeowners in states like California, Florida and Louisiana who are getting dropped by their insurers, according to a Senate Budget Committee report published last month. While most of the top 10 states for non-renewals by insurers were either coastal states or those prone to wildfire, Oklahoma also ranked high, likely due to \"increasing winds and hail from severe convective storms,\" the report found.",
      "The next 15 states with rates of home coverage non-renewal include Midwestern states such as Nebraska and Ohio, as well as Mountain states including South Dakota and Montana, the analysis found. While non-renewal rates have more than tripled in Florida between 2018 to 203, Oklahoma isn't far behind, with the rate of dropped policies nearly doubling over that time, the data shows.",
      "\"With a more volatile atmosphere, there is more latent energy in the climate, and we end up with more intense thunderstorms that produce heavy precipitation,\" First Street's Porter noted. \"They are tied back to climate change, and the fact that the air temperatures are warmer and the sea is warmer, winds are impacted in a way that's more volatile.\"",
      "Heavy rains in Vermont that led to damaging\u00a0flooding in July 2024, as well as Hurricane Helene's devastation in parts of North Carolina last year, are illustrative of these more damaging weather events, Porter noted.",
      "\"Notably, the data make clear that insurance non-renewals are not only a problem for communities typically seen as being on the front lines of climate change,\" the Senate report said. \"Florida, California, and Louisiana have been seen as the canaries in the coal mine.\"",
      "The ressearchers added, \"[P]laces such as southern New England, parts of Montana, New Mexico, coastal and inland North Carolina, and South Carolina, among others, are not far behind.\"",
      "Property values at risk?",
      "Most Americans in the U.S. who own a home also have property insurance because such coverage is required by mortgage lenders, which mandate the policies to secure their investments against damage from theft or accidents like storms or falling trees.",
      "But as climate-related disasters proliferate, insurers are readjusting their risk models and boosting premiums to cover their need for increased capital reserves as well as to buy more reinsurance \u2014 basically, insurance provided to insurers by other carriers,\u00a0according to the Brookings Institution.",
      "As wildfires, hurricanes and other weather events become more intense due to human-caused climate change, it's likely that insurance access and affordability will also worsen, the Senate report predicted. In some extreme examples, property values could plummet if those areas become uninsurable, an issue that's already hit some communities vulnerable to wildfires and other weather disasters.",
      "U.S. homeowners burdened by heavy insurance costs are unlikely to see any relief anytime soon, according to experts.",
      "\"We're in the middle of insurance price corrections \u2014 they will continue until insurance companies are able to be profitable,\" Porter said. \"Really no matter where you are across the country, there is some climate hazard that you are exposed to.\"",

      "Marketed for consumption by children ages 12 to 36 months, toddler milk is portrayed as the next step for little ones after they have outgrown infant formulas approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Yet unlike baby formula, the toddler milk products are not regulated by the FDA and are potentially harmful, according to\u00a0PHAI, a nonprofit legal research center located at Northeastern University School of Law.",

      "Filed in Los Angeles Superior Court on behalf of residents and a pizzeria owner in the stricken area, the complaint filed against the LADWP contends the country's biggest municipal utility should have kept water in the Santa Ynez Reservoir, which it contended had stood empty for nearly a year.",
      "\"The water supply system servicing Pacific Palisades failed miserably, leaving residents and firefighters with little to no water to fight the blaze,\" Roger Behle, one of the plaintiffs' attorneys, said on Tuesday in a statement.",
      "In defending the water system, LADWP cited \"unprecedented and extreme water demand to fight the wildfire without aerial support\" for the dearth of water pressure. Some hydrants in high elevations were affected, but the utility \"immediately deployed water tankers\" to back the firefighting efforts.",
      "LADWP is initiating its own investigation \"about water resiliency and how we can enhance our posture to respond to the impacts of climate change,\" the utility said in a statement.",
      "As of Wednesday afternoon, the fires across the LA area had killed at least\u00a025 people, destroyed more than 12,000 structures and charred more than 60 square miles. The largest by far \u2014 the\u00a0Palisades\u00a0and Eaton\u00a0wildfires\u00a0\u2014 continue to burn out of control, officials said.",

    "summary": "Inflation is proving stickier than expected, which could cause Fed to hit pause button on more interest rate cuts.",
    "story": [
      "Inflation rose 2.9% on an annual basis in December, with the latest Consumer Price Index illustrating the Federal Reserve's challenge in battling stickier-than-expected price increases.",
      "Last month's CPI was forecast to come in at 2.8%, according to economists surveyed by financial data firm FactSet. The Consumer Price Index, a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, tracks the change in those prices over time.",
      "Still, there are some signs of progress in the Fed's inflation battle. Core CPI, or prices excluding the volatile energy and food costs, rose 3.2% on an annual basis, lower than the 3.3% rate expected by economists. It also marked the smallest increase in core CPI since July 2024, according to PNC Financial Services Group.",
      "The Federal Reserve began cutting rates in September following a flurry of hikes that helped tame inflation after it hit a four-decade high of 9.1% in June 2022. Yet the Fed has struggled with the last leg of its inflation battle in pushing the CPI to a 2% annual rate, and December's reading could convince the central bank to hold off on another rate cut at its next meeting, scheduled for Jan. 29.",
      "Good signs on inflation",
      "The cooler-than-expected core CPI data reassured Wall Street that inflation isn't on a renewed upward trend, according to economists at High Frequency Economics in a research note. Stock gained on Wednesday morning, with the S&P 500 rising 95 points, or 1.6%, to 5,937 in early trading.",
      "\"There surely is no evidence of either a crash in prices \u2014 as one might expect to see in a crashing economy \u2014 or a renewal of upward pressure on prices,\" they wrote.",
      "Signs that underlying inflation pressures are easing sent stocks rocketing higher on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 703 points, or 1.7%, to close at 43,221, while the S&P 500 gained 1.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite soared 2.5%.",
      "Given the mixed inflation data, some economists predicted the Fed is likely to hold off on a rate hike at its Jan. 29 meeting, although they added that the improvement in the core CPI bolsters the possibility of cuts later in 2025.",
      "\"After recent red-hot data, today's softer-than-expected core CPI reading should help cool fears of a reacceleration in inflation,\" said Tina Adatia, head of fixed income client portfolio management at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, in an email. \"While today's release is likely insufficient to put a January rate cut back on the table, it strengthens the case that the Fed's cutting cycle has not yet run its course.\"",
      "At the same time, economists are expressing concern about the incoming Trump administration's economic plans \u2014 a mix of new tariffs, tax cuts and mass deportations \u2014 which they say could reignite inflation.",
      "That could come as consumers are continuing to feel the pinch of higher costs. Prices in December accelerated due to higher gasoline prices, which rose 4.4% from the prior month, as well as food and housing, according to the report released Wednesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "While Wall Street is interpreting the December report favorably, the CPI report signals \"little relief to most consumers,\" noted David Royal, chief financial and investment officer at financial services company Thrivent, in an email. \"Food prices, which had been tame in the first half of 2024, continued their acceleration, increasing 0.3% in December.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday filed a lawsuit against Elon Musk, alleging the X owner misled shareholders about his Twitter stock purchases in 2022.",
      "The suit alleges Musk violated federal securities laws, enabling him to purchase shares of Twitter at artificially low prices before his $44 billion takeover of the social media site. Musk has called the SEC \"just another weaponized institution doing political dirty work.\"",
      "Musk started buying shares of Twitter, which he later renamed X, in early 2022. By mid-March, he'd acquired ownership of more than 5% of the company's outstanding stock, according to the SEC filing. He was required to file a report with the SEC disclosing his purchases, but the lawsuit alleges he failed to do so in a \"timely\" manner, allowing him to underpay other investors by at least $150 million for shares they bought during that period.",
      "Musk waited until April 4, 2022, 11 days after the report was due, to publicly disclose his beneficial ownership in an SEC report, the commission says.",
      "\"Investors who sold Twitter common stock during this period did so at artificially low prices and thus suffered substantial economic harm,\" the SEC alleges in its suit.",

      "Musk responded to news of the suit on X on Tuesday night, calling the SEC a \"totally broken organization.\"",
      "\"They spend their time on s--- like this when there are so many actual crimes that go unpunished,\" Musk wrote.",

    "summary": "The CFPB is suing Capital One for allegedly misleading consumers about its offerings for high-interest savings accounts.",
    "story": [
      "Capital One was sued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for allegedly misleading consumers about its offerings for high-interest savings accounts. As a result, customers lost more than $2 billion in potential interest payments, the lawsuit claims.",
      "In a complaint filed Tuesday, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau took aim at Capital One's promises and handling of its \"360 Savings\" accounts, which were promoted as accounts providing one of the highest interest rates in the nation. But instead, the CFPB alleges, Capital One froze its rate at a low level for at least several years, even as rates rose nationally.",
      "At the same time, the CFPB adds, the bank created \"360 Performance Savings,\" which had a much higher rate \u2014 at one point, more than 14 times higher than the original \"360 Savings\" accounts. The lawsuit comes at a time when savers have benefitted from the Federal Reserve's decision to ratchet interest rates, part of its effort to fight soaring inflation. As a result, some banks have rolled out high-interest savings accounts to attract savers.",
      "But at the same time, some banks haven't boosted rates on their savings accounts, creating a gap between low-and top-paying accounts, similar to that of Capital One's two offerings. According to the CFPB, Capital One marketed the products similarly to obscure their distinction and forbade employees \"from proactively telling\" those with 360 Savings accounts about the higher-paying 360 Performance Savings, the agency said.",
      "\"Capital One did not specifically notify 360 Savings account holders about the new product, and instead worked to keep them in the dark about these better-paying accounts,\" the CFPB said in a statement. The lawsuit comes at a time when savers have benefitted from the Federal Reserve's decision to ratchet interest rates to fight soaring inflation, which allowed banks to roll out high-interest savings accounts after years of meager rates.",
      "In response, Capital One said that it strongly disagreed with the CFPB's allegations and plans to \"vigorously defend\" itself in court. The banking giant added that it was \"deeply disappointed to see the CFPB continue its recent pattern of filing eleventh-hour lawsuits ahead of a change in administration.\"",
      "Capital One also maintained that all of its 360 banking products \"offer great rates\" \u2014 and have \"always been available in just minutes to all new and existing customers without any of the usual industry restrictions.\"",
      "Billions in lost interest",
      "These actions mean Capital One \"illegally avoided paying billions in interest to millions of consumers,\" the CFPB wrote in its Tuesday complaint. The agency says it's seeking to impose civil penalties and provide financial relief to those impacted.",
      "\"Banks should not be baiting people with promises they can't live up to,\" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a prepared statement.",
      "According to disclosures on the Capital One's website, 360 Savings accounts currently carry an interest rate of just under 0.50%. 360 Performance Savings accounts have an interest rate of about 3.74%.",
      "That means the rate for 360 Performance Savings is nearly 7.5 times higher than that of 360 Savings today. But the CFPB says they've been farther apart in the past. In July 2024, the agency notes in Tuesday's complaint, the 360 Performance Savings rate was more than 14 times that of 360 Savings.",
      "The CFPB alleges that Capital One kept the rate for its 360 Savings accounts at 0.30% between December 2020 through at least August 2024. The rate for 360 Performance Savings, by contrast, climbed from 0.40% in April 2022 to as high as 4.35% at the start of 2024 \u2014 falling slightly to 4.25% by August, the agency noted Tuesday.",
      "The CFPB's complaint against Capital One comes less than one week before the Jan. 20 inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. Despite the change in administration, some say this litigation could still survive.",
      "Analyst commentary from TD Cowen on Tuesday noted that the CFPB still brought enforcement actions under Trump's first term, for example, although such litigation may also be easier to settle under the incoming administration.",

      "Joe Biden's inauguration four years ago took place just two weeks after rioters stormed the Capitol to disrupt the certification of his victory. When Biden's presidency began with his exhortation that \"democracy has prevailed,\" few imagined it would end like this: being succeeded by a man who, Biden warned, \"will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation.\"",
      "\"When Joe Biden came into office, he said that he was going to defend democracy against autocracy,\" said Atlantic staff writer Franklin Foer. \"That was Job #1 for him. And everybody knew what he meant.\"",
      "Foer wrote a book about President Biden's first two years in office, titled \"The Last Politician.\" What did he mean by that? \"I was thinking about the way in which our politics is this war of attrition between these two sides that despise one another,\" said Foer.",

      "In many ways, President Biden did deliver. His administration oversaw the successful rollout of the COVID vaccine. The stock market steadily rose to record highs, while unemployment fell to a near-record low.",

So, moving people and things is more important to us probably than any other state, and President Biden did just what he said he would do. I would almost call it a renaissance in American infrastructure. There's all sorts of projects around our state.",
      "Most notably, the $16 billion Gateway Tunnel Project, which will expand the century-old tunnels under the Hudson River, and double train capacity between New York and New Jersey. It's the largest project of its kind in U.S. history.",
      "In his farewell address to the nation Wednesday, Mr. Biden remarked, \"It will take time to feel the full impact of all we've done together. But the seeds are planted, and they'll grow, and they'll bloom for decades to come.\"",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We are joined now by Congressman Mike Waltz. He's the incoming National Security Advisor to President-elect Donald Trump. Good to have you here.",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: Good to be with you. Thanks",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand just yesterday, you were meeting with the families of some of the hostages being held in Gaza. At least three Americans assessed to still be alive and in captivity. One of them might not be released until phase two, when male soldiers are released and Israeli troops withdraw. Will the Trump team see this through to completion?",
      "REP. WALTZ: Well, remember the terms of the deal that we finally have come to was inherited in many ways, from the Biden administration. So it was actually the Biden negotiators that were at the table, and the- the other side was dealing with them, but kind of looking to us, particularly Steve Witkoff, President Trump's Middle East envoy. And one of the things that we inherited was this framework of women, the elderly and the sick coming out first. The- one of the Americans is an Israeli soldier. He- that means he'll come out in the second phase, but we will get him out period--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Edan Alexander.",
      "REP. WALTZ: Edan Alexander. And I am convinced, Margaret, that this deal would have never happened had President Trump not been elected.The Trump effect, so to speak, the families believe that they were effusive and their thanks for him and the- in the truth that he put out that put Hamas on notice, that there will be consequences if they don't let our people go.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There is also obviously the party Israel here\u2013",
      "REP. WALTZ: --Yep--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --that feels some pressure to get this done. One far right member of the Netanyahu government resigned. Another this morning said he will bring down the Netanyahu government if it does not return to fighting in a way that leads Israel to taking over the entire Gaza Strip. Does Mr. Trump support annexation of the West Bank and Gaza?",
      "REP. WALTZ: Well, excuse me, very different things. What we're talking about here is making sure that Hamas is destroyed as a terrorist organization. Hamas is no different than ISIS or Al Qaeda or any of the worst of the worst that has so brutalized the Middle East over the years. And what we have made clear to Bibi Netanyahu, to his government- and I want the Israeli people to hear me loud and clear. If Hamas reneges on this deal, if Hamas backs out, moves the goal post, what have you we will support Israel in doing what it has to do, number one, and number two, Hamas will never govern Gaza. That is completely unacceptable, because they've made their intention clear, which is to destroy Israel and to have future October 7s. So I understand the concern, but at the end of the day, Prime Minister Netanyahu supported this deal. He agreed we needed to get those hostages out, and within the next 24 hours, we will see- we will see three women coming out alive and hugging their families. And had we not entered this, these people would have died, Margaret. I mean these conditions that they were in- by the way, they've been held now longer than the hostages in 1979 in the Iranian hostage crisis. They were being brutalized, raped, tortured. It was horrific, but now we're going to have a Reagan moment. We are going to have President Trump being sworn in as hostages are coming out alive, and that's something we should all celebrate.",

      "REP. WALTZ: Well, President Trump's plan and his first term, his plan for the Middle East and his plan for Israel and Palestine had a pathway to a two-state with all kinds of very important qualifiers that had to be in place beforehand. Stop radicalizing the next generation of Palestinian youth. Very specifics- components of that plan in terms of how things would be divided up, but I do think we can get to the next round of the Abraham accords. We- I do think we can expand it, and that will be between Israel and Saudi Arabia, which will be tremendous. That has been a main goal of the Netanyahu government now for years. And Margaret, I can tell you, for President Trump, if in a short amount of time, if we're talking about infrastructure projects, ports, rails, fiber, data center, if we're talking about all of those things, these historic animosities will become smaller and smaller and smaller, and that is the piece that he seeks, and that only he can lead.",

We brought Israel and the Arab states together because of their mutual concern about Iran and its hegemonic aggression, and what the ayatollahs intend- intended to do. We sat the Palestinian issue aside for a bit--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Yeah.",

      "REP. WALTZ: Oh, well, look, we're going to have his campaign promises that he promised to the American people right out there on the table, in terms of border, in terms of energy, in terms of taking on this kind of DEI woke culture that has infected so many parts of our federal government, including our military. Returning us to a meritocracy. He's got a lot in front of them. I'm excited to be a part of it. I can't emphasize enough though, Margaret, on the border, the American people gave him a clear mandate. Lock down our border, deport the worst of the worst, take on the cartels. We cannot have a situation where we have paramilitary gangs that are shooting down aircraft with heavy weapons, controlling 30% of our neighbor, Mexico, and controlling whole swaths of our border.",

WALTZ: These are- these are paramilitary organizations with billions at their disposal, with armored vehicles, heavy machine guns, that are fighting the Mexican army. \u00a0Not police, army, to a standstill. President Trump was clear on the campaign trail that we're going to take them on and then we're going to use every resource that we need to defend the American people.",

      "REP. WALTZ: Well, I think they're going to be- they're going to be quite aggressive. Number one. Number two, they're going to go after these criminal gangs that are terrorizing our cities, particularly MS-13, and particularly Tren De Aragua, our communities are asking for it. Our neighbors are asking for it--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- One of those Tren De Aragua-, excuse me- Tren De Aragua is Venezuelan. You can't deport to Venezuela. So where are you going to send those?",

That's highly unusual, not just because of protocol, but because of protocol, but because of the moment in time we are in. Why launch a charm offensive with China at the same time we know that they are embedded in our infrastructure? As you have said, they've planted cyber time bombs.",
      "REP. WALTZ: Yeah, yeah. Xi is sending his Vice President. and President Trump does not believe you can get into the types of deals that he wants to get into, whether it is pushing the Chinese to take on fentanyl, to put a death penalty in place for the producers of fentanyl that know that they are killing hundreds of thousands of Americans, whether it's on trade negotiations, restoring some sense of stability in the Western Pacific and particularly in the South China Sea, unless he has a relationship with the head of state where all the decisions are made--",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN : Tiktok took itself offline at midnight because of this national security law that you signed on to as- as a congressman which recognizes that TikTok, owned by a Chinese firm, Bytedance, is a national security threat. But on this notice, it says Donald Trump has promised to work with them. If Mr. Trump issues an executive order that bypasses a national security law. Isn't this a risk? How are you going to prevent China from doing what you say they're doing already, which is siphoning up and spying on Americans?",
      "REP. WALTZ: Well look, I would- I would even point to the author of the law, former representative, Mike Gallagher, who has put out, you know, his goal was never to eliminate TikTok. It was to allow Americans to use it, but then to make it safe from Chinese communists.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It was to have an American owner.",

And if it goes dark, that's going to be, obviously, extremely problematic. So both can be true. We can have an app that Americans can- Americans can enjoy, but at the same time that protects their data and protects them from outside influence and undue influence. And that's the time and space that the President is seeking. And as a deal maker, I think we all should be confident that he can craft that kind of a deal.",

And I could tell you, I wouldn't want the FBI or the US government monitoring every keystroke or seeing every password, nor would we want the Chinese Communist Party. But we also want an app that 170 million Americans clearly really enjoy and that we were able to get our message out during the Trump campaign in a very powerful way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you believe that an American owner will emerge and a deal will be done within 90 days?",
      "REP. WALTZ: I don't want your head of President Trump on the deal, but he is definitely wanting to have the time right now, which would mean an extension to evaluate the deals that are on the table.",

My job is to pull the interagency together, tee up options for the President, help him make a decision and then execute. I can just tell you, from my own perspective, as a broader framework, we cannot play perfect defense. We are under a tsunami of cyber attacks, and we just keep trying to defend better. Let's take a hard look at unleashing our private sector and those capabilities. Let's take a hard look at trying to change behaviors in the first place, and that will mean a better, stronger, more capable offensive capability. So that any adversary, if they believe they can destroy our grid, destroy our water supply, destroy our pipelines, if they know we can do the same, then hopefully that prevents it from ever happening in the first place.",

      "REP. WALTZ: \u00a0I'm not going to get ahead of all of those things, but I'll tell you the key- the key pieces of it. Number one, who do we get to the table? Number two, how do we drive them to the table? And then three, what are the frameworks of a deal? President Trump is clear, this war has to stop. Everyone, I think, should be on board with that. And in fact, Zelenskyy even is walking into the room now saying, we're ready to work with you, President Trump, to stop this war. It is a killing field, Margaret. This is World War One trench warfare with literally a meat grinder of people running across these open fields in eastern Ukraine. But with World War Three escalation consequences. And it's expanding, with North Korea now sending in tens of thousands, South Korea very upset and talking about getting involved in some way. We- you know, this conflict needs to end, and President Trump has been very clear about that and is determined to do it.",

As the first junior officer, and I think this is really important, he wasn't in the headquarters when our policies drifted in the Middle East leading to decades of war. He was on the front lines. You know, the kind of dust on the boots, dirt under the fingernails type of junior officer that was saying, \"What the heck are we doing here? Where is this going? How does this end? What does victory look like?\" So I shared that experience with him, was proud to introduce him. And the point I made to the Senate was they have hearing after hearing- I do, too, in the House as a member of the Armed Services Committee, complaining about retention, readiness, industrial based problems, things that cost too much, take too long, deliver half as much as- as promised. And yet, some people are opposed to a disrupter, to a change agent. I'm glad he doesn't have a defense contractor background. I'm glad he wasn't a former general, because that hasn't worked.

You know what? They did it. And that has now led to a real moment of opportunity in Lebanon. It's led to the fall of Assad and his brutal dictatorship. It's led to Hamas being completely isolated. They always thought the cavalry was going to come from the north with Hezbollah. That's no longer the case, and I think a key reason they've now entered into a deal. And Iran's air defenses are destroyed. So this is a moment to make those key decisions, and we'll be doing that over the next month.",

      "Looking ahead: Democrats and opposition",
      "Still, most Americans say they are concerned about the state of U.S. politics right now, and that concern is highest among Democrats, whose ranks don't look especially activated right now.",
      "Many Democrats describe themselves as \"demoralized,\" along with being \"exhausted\" and \"concerned\" about U.S. politics when asked to choose descriptors. Few say they're even \"interested.\" Even fewer say they're \"motivated.\"",
      "They're roughly split over whether they want congressional Democrats to find common ground or oppose Trump at every turn now; the most liberal are the most opposed. And then they have some \u2014 though not a lot \u2014 of confidence that their congressional leadership can effectively oppose Trump when they disagree.",
      "There's also some sense among them of missed opportunity as Mr. Biden departs: just over half think Harris could have won if Mr. Biden had stepped aside sooner.",
      "Biden, meanwhile, exits with Americans evaluating his presidency as low as they ever have during his term.",
      "Looking ahead along other demographic lines, some of Americans' outlook for the Trump administration follows some of the contours of what happened in November.",

(They're also just generally more likely to voice optimism whenever asked to look ahead.) Trump did better with men and made gains with women, and today both are optimistic, men especially so.",
      "Today, almost a quarter of the voters who backed Kamala Harris are optimistic now about the next four years with Trump, reflecting perhaps some willingness for them to reevaluate him once he takes office, something we often see with a losing candidate's supporters, at least early on.",
      "In all, more Americans are pulling for the new administration to succeed, compared to very few for it to fail. The ratio is far higher for desired success. This is similar to how it was for Joe Biden four years ago, too. And then for many, they say it simply depends on what Trump tries to do.",

His overall approval rating was in the 60s, lifted, in part, by optimism about getting the COVID pandemic under some control. But this was short-lived. After the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan that summer, Mr.\u00a0Biden's approval rating declined\u00a0and dropped even further that fall amid public concerns about inflation.

      "As he embarked on his reelection campaign, voters repeatedly expressed doubts over whether Mr. Biden had the cognitive health to serve as president. Those doubts grew after a poor presidential debate performance. After that, most didn't think he should be running for president, including many in his own party.",
      "In July, President Biden stepped aside as the Democratic nominee, but that may have been too late for some. Today, more than half of Democrats think Kamala Harris would have won the presidential election if Mr. Biden had stepped aside sooner, but the public overall doesn't think the timing of his withdrawal from the race would have mattered.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Approximately 270,000 migrants are estimated to be waiting on the Mexican side of the U.S.-Mexico border, hoping to get an appointment to enter the U.S. through a system that President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to end, according to government figures obtained by CBS News.",
      "U.S. Customs and Border Protection estimates that around 270,000 migrants in Mexico are trying to get an appointment distributed by a government app known as CBP One, which the Biden administration has converted into the main gateway to the American asylum system.",
      "Now, those migrants, many of whom are from countries outside of Mexico like crisis-stricken Haiti and Venezuela, are at risk of abruptly losing their ability to enter the U.S. Both Trump and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, his nominee to lead the Department of Homeland Security, have vowed to shut down CBP One.",
      "The app allows migrants in certain parts of Mexico to request a time to be processed by American immigration officials at legal border entry points, also known as ports of entry. The Biden administration set up the process as part of a broader effort to discourage illegal immigration by offering migrants legal channels to come to the U.S. Those admitted into the U.S. under the system are allowed to apply for work permits, as well as asylum in immigration courts near their respective destinations.",
      "As of Jan. 16, nearly 919,000 migrants had been allowed into the U.S. through the CBP One app process, which was established in January 2023, according to an internal government report obtained by CBS News. It's unclear what the incoming administration's plans are for those already admitted through the app, though those with pending asylum requests won't be deportable unless they lose their cases.",
      "Demand for CBP One appointments has been extraordinarily high, far exceeding the daily cap of 1,450 the Biden administration placed on appointments. Over the past two years, migrants have attempted to secure an appointment over 166 million times, logging into the app again and again to try their luck, the internal report shows.\u00a0 Wait times typically extend for months due to the high demand.",
      "Because appointments are distributed 21 days in advance of entry dates, roughly 30,000 migrants are currently scheduled to enter the U.S. under the CBP One system in the next three weeks. Appointments have been scheduled through early February, well into the incoming administration.",
      "It's unclear if the Trump administration will honor those appointments. Even if CBP One is terminated, any effort to stop processing migrants at ports of entry would face legal challenges as federal courts have ruled that U.S. refugee law requires officials to process some asylum claimants at these entry points.",
      "Outgoing Biden administration officials warned that terminating CBP One could prompt some of those waiting for an appointment to cross into the U.S. illegally, potentially upending the current four-year-low in illegal border crossings.",
      "During its first three years, the Biden administration struggled to contain an unprecedented wave of illegal immigration, with CBP processing record numbers of migrants. But unlawful border entries plunged in 2024, mainly due to enhanced efforts by Mexico to prevent migrants from reaching the U.S. and a move by President Biden in June to severely restrict asylum.",
      "A spike in illegal crossings that some experts predicted before Trump's inauguration never materialized. In fact, Border Patrol is on track to record fewer than 35,000 apprehensions of migrants in January, the lowest level since June 2020, when the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic led to a dramatic drop in migration.",
      "Internal Border Patrol figures show the agency has averaged just over 1,000 daily apprehensions in January, a nearly 90% drop from the record-setting month of December 2023, when an average of more than 8,000 migrants crossed in the U.S. illegally each day.",
      "Illegal border crossings have decreased so sharply that the deactivation trigger for Mr. Biden's asylum restrictions is set to be reached next week, two U.S. officials told CBS News. By its own terms, the policy would be gradually deactivated when the average of daily illegal crossings stays below 1,500 for 28 days. The rule, however, could be scrapped or modified by Trump's administration.",
      "Andrea Flores, who worked on immigration policy at the White House during Mr. Biden's first year in office, said migrants \"will likely have no choice but to make an unauthorized crossing\" if the CBP One process is halted.",
      "\"Numbers may be low at the border, but it is a completely unsustainable situation that remains completely reliant on Mexico to maintain,\" said Flores, who is now vice president for policy at FWD.US, a group that supports liberal immigration policies.",
      "Trump's transition team did not respond to questions about CBP One, including whether officials are concerned that ending the system could fuel an increase in unlawful border crossings.",
      "Trump has vowed to move quickly and aggressively on reshaping federal immigration policy once he's sworn in on Monday, pledging to launch mass deportations and undo Biden administration policies.",
      "Other Biden-era immigration programs in Trump's crosshairs include an initiative that allows citizens of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela to fly to the U.S. if they have American sponsors. The policy, known as CHNV, was also designed to reduce illegal immigration from these countries.",
      "Officials have admitted roughly 532,000 migrants under the CHNV program, but their fate is unclear as the Biden administration declined to extend their two-year permits to be in the U.S., and Trump officials have talked about ending the policy.",
      "Mexico's government agreed to accept some non-Mexican deportees, including Venezuelans, from American authorities on the condition that the U.S. would accept migrants under the CHNV initiative. Mexico has not yet said how the program's potential end would affect that arrangement.",
      "The incoming administration will also need Mexico's cooperation to fulfill one of its campaign promises: reinstating the so-called Remain-in-Mexico policy that required migrants to await their asylum cases outside of the U.S.",
      "Matthew Hudak, a longtime senior Border Patrol official who retired last year, said he was not \"necessarily a fan\" of CBP One when it was created, but noted the policy has had some \"value\" in the form of dissuading people from entering the U.S. illegally through the Rio Grande or other parts of the border.",
      "But Hudak said the incoming administration should make the criteria for being allowed into the country through CBP One \"more stringent.\" He said Trump officials should assemble their own policy scheme at the border before the spring, when migration has historically increased.",
      "\"Now is the window of time,\" Hudak said, \" in which (the Trump) administration has the opportunity to establish consequences, to put things into place that can send the message that then, ultimately, becomes a deterrent factor in people deciding to make that illegal entry.\"",

      "CHICAGO (CBS) -- With President-elect Donald Trump having pledged to stage a sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration immediately after he takes the oath of office on Monday, local leaders and immigrant rights groups in Chicago met Saturday morning in the Pilsen neighborhood to make sure the community is prepared.",
      "The incoming Trump administration is planning to ramp up operations\u00a0to arrest unauthorized immigrants across major U.S. cities next week after President-elect Donald Trump takes office, targeting \"sanctuary\" jurisdictions that limit cooperation with federal immigration officials, two sources familiar with the plans tell CBS News.",
      "Sources tell CBS news sanctuary cities like Chicago will be targeted as early as Tuesday.",
      "ICE officials in the Chicago area recently put out a request for agents to participate in the post-inauguration arrest operations, unbeknownst to top agency leaders in Washington, a U.S. official familiar with the developments told CBS News.",
      "Many immigrant rights groups in the Chicago area have been reaching out to undocumented immigrants ahead of Trump's inauguration, in an effort to get ready for what might be coming.",
      "Mari Rodriguez said \"there are good days and there are bad days,\" but she's grateful for every day she works selling tamales to the Pilsen community.",
      "\"We came to work. We came to work,\" she said.",
      "She migrated from Venezuela, and has been in Chicago just a year.",
      "\"Yes, I live here in Chicago,\" she said.",
      "Rodriguez said she's fearful about what might happen on Tuesday if U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers arrive in Chicago as promised by President-elect Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, who has said Chicago will be \"ground zero\" for their mass deportation efforts.",
      "\"We're going to start right here in Chicago, Illinois,\" Homan said during a visit to Chicago last month.",
      "U.S. Rep. Chuy Garcia (D-IL) said such threats are nothing new to the migrant community.",
      "\"This community has been the subject of attacks and immigration raids going back to the 1960s,\" he said. \"That they want to intimidate a city that would stand up for justice and protection for everyone is to be expected.\".",
      "Garcia and other local elected leaders joined immigrant advocates on Saturday to reassure and remind the undocumented community of their rights.",
      "\"You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to not open the door. You have the right to ask to speak to an attorney,\" said Ere Rendon, vice president of immigrant justice for The Resurrection Project, a local nonprofit.",
      "The reminder comes a day after a Wall Street Journal report cited sources claiming up to 200 ICE agents are coming to Chicago as early as Tuesday to carry out large-scale deportation efforts.",
      "\"Right now, there is no official statement or order that raids are going to be taking place. Do we expect additional agents to be sent here? Of course. Starting perhaps on Tuesday? We don't know,\" Garcia said. \"It's going to take time. The important thing is to remain calm, as Chicago has done when tested in other times as well.\"",
      "ICE raids happened in Chicago in 2018, but in 2022 the American Civil Liberties Union settled a lawsuit with the Department of Homeland Security, requiring changes in how ICE can operate in Illinois.",
      "\"ICE should not be going up to random people on the streets and asking to see their documentation, and that's why it's important that people that they have the right to remain silent if ICE does do that,\" Rendon said.",
      "The message migrant advocates wanted to send is not to be afraid, but to be prepared.",
      "\"Regardless of your legal status, you have rights,\" U.S. Rep. Delia Ramirez (D-IL) said.",

      "His plane landed at Dulles Airport in the evening before he headed to Trump Sterling Golf Club for planned evening celebrations and fireworks. Trump got off the plane around 7:20 p.m., he did not take questions, reporters said, but stopped briefly to wave at the press and pumped his fist twice in the air.",

The three of them turned around at the top of the stairs, and Trump waved before heading inside the plane.",
      "The ritualistic changing of power will get underway as Washington's solemn pomp is paired with Trump's brand of party: a fireworks showcase at one of his luxury golf properties, guests including tech industry titans, friends from the business world and conservative media stars, and thousands of his supporters streaming in from around the country.",

      "On Inauguration Day, Trump will start with the traditional prayer service at St. John's Episcopal Church before heading to the White House for a customary tea with the outgoing president and first lady.",
      "Trump then heads to the Capitol, where his ceremony has been moved indoors as temperatures are set to plummet and make it the coldest Inauguration Day in 40 years. It's not quite clear how the ceremony will be adapted to the Capitol Rotunda, which holds only 600 people. More than 250,000 guests were ticketed to view the inauguration from around the Capitol grounds.",
      "The Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, which is responsible for planning the event, said in a statement that \"the vast majority of ticketed guests will not be able to attend the ceremonies in person.\"",
      "Eight years ago, Trump's critics were wrestling with whether to attend his inauguration, contemplating whether to buck long-standing practice and send a signal to the divisive new president. This year, much outspoken resistance to Trump has faded away, though there will be two notable absences: former first lady Michelle Obama and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Neither gave an explanation as to why she was skipping the ceremony.",
      "After Trump takes the oath of office and delivers his inaugural address, there will be a ceremonial farewell to Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. As the new Republican government takes power, Trump will head to a signing ceremony at the Capitol to approve some of his first official acts, followed by a congressional luncheon and review of U.S. troops.",
      "The planned traditional parade down Pennsylvania Avenue has morphed into an indoor event because of the cold, with Trump again planning to speak to his gathered supporters before he heads to the White House for a signing ceremony in the Oval Office.

      "Trump's arrival in Washington will once again be accompanied by protests and vigils on issues such as abortion, immigration rights and, this time, the Israel-Hamas war, but the feel and the force of those demonstrations were different from the outset of his first term.",

      "What will pilot Jeff Hertel be looking for?",
      "\"The different crowd parameters and crowd control,\" Hertel told CBS News. \"And suspicious vehicles, maybe, outside the perimeter area, larger trucks and stuff, make sure there's people with them.\"",
      "Hertel says being in the skies gives law enforcement \"the ability to see distances.\"",
      "\"You can see a car running fast, you can see, like, a rooftop at night to see if there's a burglar on top, or if he has a weapon,\" he said.",
      "Although the inauguration ceremony for President-elect Donald Trump was moved into the highly fortified and secured U.S. Capitol because of forecasts calling for extreme cold, helicopters will still be a key tool as the inaugural parade also moves indoors, to Capitol One Arena in the heart of D.C. that will host about 20,000 people.",
      "D.C. Police will also be watching for crowds, as many of those who would have gone to the National Mall are expected to still gather across the city.",
      "The helicopter's on-board cameras can read a license plate from 1,000 feet up, sending back live video to the department's real time crime center.",
      "\"It gives us the opportunity to really see what's happening across the city, especially in large crowds,\" D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith told CBS News.",
      "Smith said that the New Orleans truck attack which killed 14 people, and the Tesla Cybertruck bombing outside a Trump hotel in Las Vegas \u2014 both of which occurred on New Year's Day \u2014 has kept law enforcement on high alert.",

      "While official inauguration events are indoors, D.C. Police remain on high alert for violent protests outside the secured area, similar to those in 2017 where hundreds were arrested around Trump's first inauguration.

      "\"Hello?\" Donald Trump said into his cellphone one day last month. \"Who is this?\"",
      "Music echoed through 1100 S. Ocean Boulevard, where he spent much of the 70-plus days of the presidential transition.",
      "\"Wait, let me turn it down,\" said Trump, who was at the center of it all at his private club in Palm Beach, Florida, fielding calls on multiple phones while managing the playlist.",
      "Trump has been euphoric since his election, reflecting on his U-turn from embattled criminal defendant to leader on top of the world, according to people close to him.",
      "\"He's a man at his zenith,\" one person said.",
      "The parade at Mar-a-Lago was a steady stream of corporate executives, wealthy elites and hangers-on, some vying for plum appointments and favors from the president-elect. On some nights, hundreds of guests visited for multiple simultaneous events.",
      "\"It's like going to the zoo \u2014 there are all these exotic creatures,\" one Trump aide said on a day when the previous evening's club guests had included a tattooed crocodile trainer in a red feathered ensemble and trade adviser Peter Navarro in a quiet suit, not long after his release from prison.",
      "Elon Musk and fellow businessman Vivek Ramaswamy on the day the Department of Government Efficiency became public were at one of the club's bars, scratching out thoughts on a napkin.",
      "Friday marked the end of unprecedented access to Trump, who heard bits and pieces about dramas that unfolded around him \u2014 those who drank too much or had romantic entanglements or got into arguments at his club. After gatherings that seemed like a melange of Business Roundtable mixer, U.N. General Assembly and the congressional gym, the seat of his new government moves north.",
      "A portion of the transition work was carried out 20 minutes away from Mar-a-Lago at a nondescript high-rise in West Palm Beach, with job interviews in conference rooms on key-card-controlled floors, security personnel in the lobby and a police squad car parked outside.",
      "Already, some people close to the transition harbor misgivings that they're off on the wrong foot \u2014 too slow to hire, too much infighting, too many loyalty tests, too many shenanigans. Just a handful of Trump's Cabinet members are poised to be confirmed next week.",
      "But at Mar-a-Lago, where white orchids blossom on trees, a men's room is adorned with real and fake Time magazine covers featuring Trump as person of the year, and a gift shop sells Trump-branded merch, those who made it through the gates seemed happy to be there.",
      "\"The thing you notice is the absolute adoration of him,\" one outside adviser said. \"This guy can do no wrong there. Like he's infallible.\"",
      "Trump's incoming chief of staff Susie Wiles made it clear early in the transition that she didn't want big egos jockeying for positions, but there was plenty of that.",
      "\"It's 'Real Housewives' meets 'The Bachelor' meets 'The Apprentice,'\" one person close to the Trump team said. \"Viper pit.\"",
      "Alina Habba, a lawyer who has represented Trump, was initially offered the position of State Department spokesperson. But Habba, who sought a role that combined media and policy, declined. She spoke directly with Trump, and eventually secured the role of counselor to the president.",
      "Financier Duke Buchan, who raised tens of millions as the Republican National Committee's national finance chair, made no secret of his frustration about not receiving an appointment. He pestered the fundraising and personnel staff so much that they asked him to back off, according to people familiar with the matter. Buchan did not reply to a request for comment.",

      "Fewer West Wing badges will be issued than in previous administrations. (The so-called blue badges, a highly-coveted status symbol, are being issued in a new color: platinum. The less exclusive ones for access to neighboring offices on the 18-acre campus will now be gold, instead of green.)",
      "\"They've done a great job of triaging thought and siloing power and decision-making in this White House,\" said one former Trump aide. \"This White House will be more inefficient and log-jammed than the first go-around.\"",
      "The chess game for offices closest to the Oval Office began during the transition. One proposal would have put Musk across a driveway from the White House in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. But more recently, conversations have moved toward a Musk office in the West Wing. Some of the special advisers, such as Ric Grenell and retired Gen. Keith Kellogg, will likely have offices both at the State Department and in the EEOB.",
      "Juggling phone calls and visitors",
      "Early in the transition, Trump returned to golfing after choosing to forgo the sport for months to focus on winning the election. He grumbled that his stroke was rusty.",
      "Business leaders tried to finagle tee times. But Trump, who is choosy about golf partners, preferred players like the head of the PGA tour, Jay Monahan; pro golfer Dustin Johnson; hockey great Wayne Gretzky, who is Johnson's father-in-law; real estate developer and incoming Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff; South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and Missouri Sen. Eric Schmitt.",
      "One executive got in to play a round with the president-elect but Trump complained that the man was poor at golf, grousing, \"This guy sucks.\"",
      "The pace of phone calls from heads of state was so heavy that incoming national security adviser Mike Waltz flew to Mar-a-Lago to establish order and to track conversations, knowing foreign leaders would have their intelligence agencies on the line. Trump's staff tried to limit some calls to just a minute and asked that they be congratulatory in nature, not substantive.",
      "For a period, all head-of-state calls ceased. \"He got burned out,\" one aide said of the president-elect. Staffers took phone numbers and said they'd reach out when they could.",
      "Trump could be found some nights past 11 p.m. in the club's living room, using trusted allies as a sounding board on the world of politics, while staff dashed to and fro to bring in guests or to grab \"TRUMP\" hats for him to sign. He'd juggle various phones \u2014 on one occasion swiveling between a conversation with a CEO and a call with House Speaker Mike Johnson, before turning back to his top fundraising aide, Meredith O'Rourke, to continue hashing over ambassador assignments. When his daughter Ivanka rang, he picked up.",
      "Trump cracked jokes \u2014 \"everyone calls me chaotic, but look at South Korea,\" he said one day. He said he'd meet with Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol \"if they ever stop impeaching him.\"",
      "During dinner with Akie Abe, the widow of the assassinated Japanese prime minister, Trump, who fondly remembers that Shinzo Abe had written a letter nominating him for easing tensions with North Korea, talked about how he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. The Nobel, one adviser said, has been \"a hyper fixation\" for Trump, and it re-emerged as he strategized a Middle East deal.",
      "Who gets special access?",
      "A few regulars \u2014 Witkoff, Michael Whatley, Corey Lewandowski, Boris Epshteyn, Waltz \u2014 have Secret Service lapel pins for special access to the president-elect. One visitor didn't need a hard pin: Musk, whose security detail coordinates his arrival.",
      "The rear lawn, nearest the waterway, is usually off limits. But one night in November, it was covered with people, including Trump and Musk, for an opera performance. Starstruck guests took photos from a few paces away, held back by Secret Service. \"There's definitely a lot of buzz for Elon,\" one partygoer observed. \"There's President Trump!' and 'Oh my God, there's Elon.'\"",
      "And Musk, who donated a quarter of a billion dollars to back Trump and other GOP candidates, was everywhere.",
      "It quickly became an irritant for some of the president-elect's aides that Musk \"shows up at every meeting,\" as one adviser put it. They debated assigning a Trump person to wrangle Musk. \"He's not wrangleable,\" another aide said.",
      "VIPs with face-to-face appointments with Trump were told to come early, and that they could wait in the living room \u2014 a formal reception area just inside Mar-a-Lago's front doors. Some thought they'd be dining alone with Trump only to find a big show at a crowded table.",
      "\"A lot of clown cars had access, and there was an incredible amount of activity,\" one adviser said. \"It won't be like that in the White House.\"",
      "If someone got to Trump in person or by phone and presented an argument for an administration post, and Trump was in a \"yes\" mood, snap decisions were made, according to seven sources familiar with such moves.",
      "After eventual attorney general pick Pam Bondi said something nice about a Florida sheriff, he ended up named to lead the Drug Enforcement Administration \u2014- before withdrawing days later. A private equity executive and GOP donor who didn't serve in the Navy has been tapped to be secretary of the Navy.",
      "When Wiles left for Las Vegas for a couple days \u2014 along with inner circle dwellers Chris LaCivita, Taylor Budowich, Tony Fabrizio and James Blair \u2014 people nudged Trump into selecting several hires. Wiles undid some of that over subsequent weeks.",
      "Candidates for Cabinet and upper-level posts were brought in to pitch to Trump at Mar-a-Lago. Some interviews had a reality TV show quality. Doors opened dramatically. A candidate might be ushered in to a big reveal: with their image on a large screen behind a seated Trump. A top adviser \u2014 at times Wiles or Miller or Lutnick \u2014 was at Trump's side. Staffers ran the video screens. Clips of the candidates' past remarks were at the ready.",
      "In December, Trump aides fretted about the pace of hiring. \"When loyalty is the most important metric, it is going to be difficult to fill a government,\" one adviser noted.",
      "Trump transition spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told CBS News in early January, \"President Trump picked a brilliant Cabinet in record and historic time and the Trump-Vance Transition is working non-stop to fill the Administration with hard workers who believe fully in the America First Agenda.\"",
      "Almost immediately after the election, prospects for rank-and-file jobs were asked to name four preferences for administration roles and to fill out an application in a Google Docs link. There was no way to upload a resume, and the process came across as \"one step above Survey Monkey,\" one applicant said. \"My reaction was: 'That's it? That's all? I must have missed a secret page.' Went back. Nope.\"",
      "Stallone and \"Shark Tank\" star part of \"just another night at Mar-a-Lago\"",
      "Mar-a-Lago was so packed some nights during the transition that the restaurant did a buffet. The food at Mar-a-Lago can be mediocre, several frequent guests said, but the seafood buffet catches praise. No one hands Trump a menu \u2014 a waiter just asks what he'd like to eat. Often it's a burger or a steak.",
      "Actor Sylvester Stallone waited in the line one night to fill a buffet plate like everyone else, not far from Waltz, the incoming national security chief. \"Shark Tank\" star Kevin O'Leary posed for photos with guests. The music was cranked up \u2014 \"Don't Cry for Me Argentina,\" followed by a Sinatra tune. Out in a parking area, a multimillion-dollar Bugatti Veyron was parked by Rolls Royce SUVs and a Ferrari.",
      "\"And no one blinks,\" one diner said. \"It's just another night at Mar-a-Lago.\"",
      "Mar-a-Lago, Spanish for \"sea to lake,\" is situated on a wisp of a barrier island between the Atlantic Ocean and an intracoastal waterway. Its manicured lawns, beach club, event spaces, spa and Trump's private quarters cover 20 acres.",
      "One slice of palace intrigue was when Donald Trump Jr., who shares a home with Kimberly Guilfoyle near a Trump golf property 25 minutes north of Mar-a-Lago, started introducing someone else around the club as his girlfriend. Weeks later, Trump announced that Guilfoyle would be moving overseas as his U.S. ambassador to Greece. Three sources said the breakup was unrelated to the appointment.",
      "Some in the Mar-a-Lago orbit were obsessed with details, but, as one outside adviser put it, were more obsessed about booking a lunch or dinner, hoping to bump into the president-elect to lobby for jobs. Reservations are exclusively for members and their guests.",
      "A topic of conversation one December night was about how Scott Bessent and Howard Lutnick, after some tense moments, were speaking to each other again. \"Not friends, but cordial,\" one adviser said. The two had been rivals for Treasury secretary. Trump ultimately chose the more reserved Bessent, but gave Lutnick, the gregarious co-chair of his transition, the top Commerce Department job.",
      "\"That competition was driven by DJT,\" one adviser said, adding that he likes billionaire advisers fighting over him. \"He let that drag out.\"",
      "Second-term agenda",
      "More to Trump's liking was the work on his inauguration speech and executive orders, which were the closely guarded realm of two scribes, speechwriter Vince Haley and Stephen Miller, deputy chief of staff for policy.",
      "Despite Democrats' predictions Trump would support a national abortion ban, that wasn't a topic under discussion. \"He's done with that,\" one adviser said. The executive actions will mostly relate to energy, immigration and a third category aides refer to as \"weaponization of government,\" plus some \"anti-woke\" actions, such as on transgender participation in women's sports.",
      "Trump aides are also strategizing for next year's 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. Expect some wear and tear on Pennsylvania Avenue's pavement \u2013 advisers have discussed tanks in a parade. And while Trump might not hold a rally in every state during the Semiquincentennial, if he drops in on districts where GOP candidates need a lift, \"it wouldn't be a bad thing,\" one aide said.",
      "A haven for Trumpworld",
      "At the back of a lavender-scented courtyard, just beyond the whirlpool with club guests in swimwear, a gift shop sells Trump-branded souvenirs: Trump chocolates, Trump playing cards, Trump coffee mugs, a gold lapel pin with Trump's face in profile. Guests' bills can tally in the hundreds for collections of bottle openers, sequined \"MAGA\" purses and Bibles.

    "story": [
      "How will history assess President Biden?",
      "Mired with low approval ratings, the president said this week he believes history will be kinder: \"You know, it will take time to feel the full impact of all we've done together,\" he said in his Oval Office farewell address this week. \"But the seeds are planted, and they'll grow, and they'll bloom for decades to come.\"",
      "Over the course of his four years, Mr. Biden has invited comparisons to the policies and ambition of Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson. He has said John F. Kennedy partially inspired his life of public service. Roosevelt's portrait hangs over the Oval Office fireplace with paintings of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln. Their achievements, triumphs and public words are the kind most commanders-in-chief would emulate.",
      "There's no doubt Mr. Biden did big things to reshape the country and the world. History may show he saved American democracy from grave threats \u2014 or maybe, time will show us he merely slowed them. History will also record that he failed to stop Russian President Vladimir Putin from invading Ukraine, but united western democracies against the unprovoked invasion and expanded key military alliances.",
      "He began an overdue and more pronounced shift in American attention to the Indo-Pacific, fortifying and expanding agreements with China's neighbors, kept lines of communication open with Chinese President Xi Jinping, but failed to stop China's aggressive spy craft and an unprecedented infiltration of American telecommunications systems.",
      "As president, Mr. Biden immediately pushed for what became a $1.9 trillion economic stimulus bill, including direct aid to lower-income Americans, record sums of unemployment benefits, hundreds of billions for states and cities to reopen and rebuild and tens of billions of dollars sent to small businesses, like barber shops and bars, to stay open and keep workers paid.",
      "Later, the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill authorized hundreds of billions of dollars to rebuild airports, bridges and highways, billions more to build a network of electric vehicle chargers and more broadband Internet. Finally, the Inflation Reduction Act launched record spending to fight climate change and tax reform \u2014 even if its namesake goal, to reduce inflation, remains unfulfilled.",
      "So, does that work put Biden on par with FDR and LBJ? Progressive Democrats think so, and his Republican critics certainly revile the kind of expansive legislative work Mr. Biden achieved \u2014 and are vowing to undo much of it.",
      "But history might also compare him to two other presidents.",
      "First, George H.W. Bush, another exceptionally experienced public servant and political operative who rose to the presidency after a two-term stint as vice president. He was a president who worked to reshape the global order in the wake of the end of the Cold War, yet struggled to explain and defend them once it came time for reelection. Coming off sky-high approval ratings, his 1992 reelection sputtered amid an economic downturn. Bush also suffered from the perception that he was out of touch with everyday Americans, particularly after an encounter with a supermarket scanner. He was no match for the skillful campaigning of\u00a0 opponent Bill Clinton, who better understood a candidate needed to spend time on late-night and daytime television talk shows and be comfortable fielding questions about his underwear choices on MTV in order to win.",
      "History has been kinder to the elder Bush, and he's placed among the most qualified ever to serve.",
      "Voters may also place Mr. Biden in a two-man league alongside a lesser-known predecessor: Benjamin Harrison.",
      "In office from 1889 to 1893, he served between the terms of Grover Cleveland, making Harrison\u00a0the answer to the weekly pub trivia question, \"Who is the other president who served in between two non-consecutive terms of another?\"",
      "But Mr. Biden might not mind the comparison, because Harrison is known for reshaping U.S. foreign policy with new global alliances. He worked with Congress to approve what was then the largest amount of money ever spent on domestic infrastructure. And he used the levers of the federal government to restrain corporate monopolies.",
      "Harrison was also the first president to mount a \"front porch campaign,\" where he'd deliver short speeches to delegations of voters who came to his Indianapolis home.",
      "Now, he's really sounding like Mr. Biden \u2014 once the COVID-19 pandemic set in, the president retreated to his Wilmington, Delaware, residence and delivered short speeches over Zoom as he shored up his party's nomination, and later even conducted live television interviews from a basement studio. When he ventured out, it was mostly to campaign at a safe distance while battleground state voters watched \u2014 and honked \u2014 from their vehicles, as if attending a live-action drive-in movie.",
      "Then-President Donald Trump griped that Mr. Biden was getting away with his more passive campaign strategy, but it worked.",
      "But four years later, coming off healthy approval ratings at the start, Mr. Biden's reelection sputtered amid an economic downturn and the skillful campaigning of his opponent, Trump, who better understood a candidate needed to spend time on podcasts, and TikTok and be seen at large public events to win.",
      "It led to a remarkably candid self-assessment from Mr. Biden during an interview that aired Thursday night on MSNBC. Asked about how he sold his early legislative wins to the country, and the decision to keep his name off COVID-era relief checks sent to low-income Americans, the president said, \"I'm not a very good huckster. \u2026 I almost spent too much time on the policy, not enough time on the politics.\"",
      "That self-reflection invites perhaps the most painful comparisons for Biden, in a class with predecessors like James A. Garfield and Kennedy. The \"What if?\" Class: What if they'd had more time, survived, been healthier to serve longer?",
      "Garfield died roughly two months after an assassin's bullet couldn't be removed from his body and infected him. And of course, Kennedy's assassination 1,036 days into his term cut short a generational hope for a new kind of leadership.",
      "Mr. Biden vowed during his 2020 campaign to be a bridge to the next generation \u2013 a subtle, but not explicit signal he'd bow out after one term. His ultimate decision has been well documented and will be vigorously debated for decades to come: What if he'd bowed out? What if there'd be an open Democratic Party primary \u2013 would Vice President Harris have won?",

      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court on Friday declared the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals immigration policy unlawful, casting a cloud of uncertainty over more than half a million unauthorized immigrants brought to the U.S. as children ahead of President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration.",
      "A panel of judges before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld a lower court ruling that found that a Biden administration rule to codify DACA violated U.S. immigration law. The 2012 Obama administration memo that originally created the policy has also been found to be unlawful by federal courts.",
      "Friday's ruling, however, will not immediately change the status quo. By suspending its order, the panel of judges kept DACA alive for current recipients and closed to new applicants, as the program has been operating for the past few years.",
      "For more than 12 years, DACA has allowed hundreds of thousands of immigrants who crossed into the U.S. illegally or overstayed their visas as minors to live and work in the U.S., without fear of deportation. They are colloquially known as \"Dreamers,\" a moniker stemming from the Dream Act, a bipartisan effort to legalize them that Congress has considered, but failed to pass, for over two decades.",
      "While it affirmed the lower court order that voided the Biden administration's DACA regulation, the 5th Circuit panel narrowed the ruling's impact, making it applicable only in Texas, the state spearheading the Republican-led lawsuit against the program. The panel paused its ruling as it relates to current DACA beneficiaries, pending another ruling by the 5th Circuit or the Supreme Court, allowing renewals to continue.",
      "The panel also ruled that the deportation deferrals offered by DACA could be legally separated from the work permits that beneficiaries receive, giving the Biden administration a partial victory on its argument that the deportation protections should be left intact if the work authorization provision is struck down.",
      "As of the end of September 2024, there were roughly 538,000 immigrants enrolled in DACA, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency that oversees the initiative. To qualify for the policy, applicants had to establish they arrived in the U.S. by their 16th birthday and before June 2007; graduated from an American high school or enrolled in the military; and lacked any serious criminal records.",
      "Friday's ruling could pave the way for the U.S. Supreme Court to finally settle the years-long legal battle over DACA. But it's unclear how the incoming Trump administration will handle the case and whether it will try to terminate the program. While President Biden's Justice Department has vigorously defended DACA in court, the first Trump administration tried phasing out the policy, arguing it was unlawful. The Supreme Court in 2020 prevented DACA's termination on technical grounds.",
      "The Justice Department declined to comment on Friday's court order.",
      "The Trump transition team did not immediately say how the incoming administration would approach DACA. Trump and his advisers have pledged to launch a sweeping crackdown on illegal and legal immigration, vowing to oversee mass deportations of those living in the U.S. illegally, enact tougher border controls and cut legal admissions of immigrants and refugees.",
      "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton called the 5th Circuit's ruling \"a win for Texas.\"",
      "\"I look forward to working with President-elect Donald Trump to ensure that the rule of law is restored, and the illegal immigration crisis is finally stopped,\" Paxton said in a statement.",

      "CBS News filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, the civilian law enforcement agency responsible for criminal investigations within the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps. On Friday, NCIS released its closed investigation to CBS News.",
      "The investigation details how a low-ranking U.S. Navy corpsman attempted to access the president's medical records and the penalty he received for doing so \u2014 a nonjudicial punishment for dereliction of duty under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the laws and regulations governing the U.S. military.",
      "The corpsman, whose name the Navy will not disclose, was demoted in rank to E-2 from E-3, given 20 days of extra duty and only received half pay for the next six months. Base pay for an E-2 with two to three years of service is roughly $2,260 per month.",
      "On the afternoon of Feb. 22, according to the NCIS documents, the Navy corpsman sat at his desk, surrounded by the steady hum of computers and the murmurs of his coworkers at the Naval Medical Readiness and Training Center at Fort Belvoir in Virginia. A civilian described as a licensed nurse and a U.S. Army soldier worked nearby.",
      "The scene was standard bureaucratic fare until a nearby colleague left her workstation, leaving her Common Access Card, or CAC, behind \u2014 which was still logged into her account. This small, unassuming piece of plastic, roughly the size of a credit card, is described by the Defense Department as a \"smart\" key, granting access to everything from locked doors to military computer networks.",

      "One of the unnamed individuals pointed out the glaring vulnerability: \"Someone could maliciously use your CAC when you walk away,\" they said, according to the narrative of the group discussion within the NCIS investigation.",
      "Another voice in the group floated the idea that someone could use an unattended CAC account to snoop on the president's medical records. The notion hung in the air. The Navy corpsman responded with apparent disbelief \u2014 could he actually pull up the medical records for the president of the United States? He decided to test it, according to the NCIS investigation.",
      "The Navy corpsman told NCIS investigators he was driven by curiosity, so he pulled up the patient search database in the Genesis Medical Health System \u2014 the database for the military medical system \u2014 and typed in the name \"Joseph Biden.\"",
      "A single record with the name \"Joseph Biden\" appeared, with a birthdate attached. The NCIS investigation stated that when the file popped up, the Navy corpsman and his coworkers were \"freaked out,\" with one of his colleagues walking away from the computer.",
      "The Navy corpsman then turned to Google to look up Mr. Biden's birthdate, and saw that it matched the birthdate on the medical file. He clicked into the record to see what information was inside.",
      "The corpsman would later tell NCIS investigators that \"there was not a lot of information in the record, except two instances,\" and \"[he] did not remember the specifics of the instances, but remembered a doctor's name was listed.\" The corpsman turned to Google again and searched for the name of Mr. Biden's doctor, which did not match the name listed on the Genesis record, according to the investigation.",
      "The corpsman told NCIS agents that he realized at this point he should stop looking at the record and closed out the file. A forensic analysis showed that the \"Joseph Biden\" file was accessed for about 20 seconds, between 1:22 p.m. and 1:23 p.m.",
      "A female colleague, who was aware the corpsman searched the system for the president, advised him to report himself to his supervisor. The corpsman stated he knew he was going to be reported for violating the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, the federal law designed to protect patients' health information.",
      "He didn't immediately report himself, but told investigators he felt guilty so he reported himself the next morning. By then, however, another colleague had already reported the violation up the chain of command. The corpsman waived his rights and confessed to accessing the record out of curiosity.",
      "The corpsman said he did not \"print, save, email, download, photograph, or otherwise document the record.\" Another colleague told investigators they had never heard the corpsman express \"anything about his political beliefs or background,\" and that he was \"nonchalant\" until the file popped up, describing him as \"freaked out.\"",
      "The Naval Criminal Investigative Service launched its investigation on Feb. 26. On Feb. 27, the deputy director of the White House medical unit \u2014 identified as a U.S. Army officer in the NCIS report \u2014 told investigators that the record accessed by the corpsman was not a legitimate electronic health record of the president.",
      "The president was informed about the sailor's attempts to access his medical records within hours of White House staff being notified about the attempted breach by the Defense Department, a White House official told CBS News in July.",

Agents found that his profile picture on Instagram, when run though a reverse image search, \"revealed imagery potentially associated with the online 'hactivist' group Anonymous.\" It's not clear from the investigation if any actual link was confirmed by NCIS agents between the corpsman and Anonymous.",

    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 16:33:40 -0500",
    "summary": "The case involves whether parents' religious rights were violated when a Maryland school district declined to allow them to opt their children out of gender and sexuality instruction.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to take up a dispute over whether a Maryland school district violated parents' religious rights when it declined to allow them to opt their elementary school children out of instruction involving storybooks about gender and sexuality.",
      "The dispute centers around a decision by the Montgomery County School Board to end opt-out requests and notice requirements for the reading and discussion of storybooks that feature LGBTQ characters. The case sets up another clash involving LGBTQ rights and religious rights. It's unclear whether the Supreme Court will hear arguments in its current term, which ends this summer, or its next term that will begin in October.",
      "The books were approved for the Montgomery County Public Schools language-arts curriculum for the 2022-2023 school year as part of an effort to include new material that better represents the school district's students and families, it said. Montgomery County is Maryland's largest county and its school system serves more than 160,000 students.",
      "Books introduced for students include titles like \"Pride Puppy,\" a picture book about a dog that gets lost at a Pride parade, and \"Jacob's Room to Choose,\" about two transgender school-aged children.",
      "Lawyers for the school district said in court filings that the books \"impart critical reading skills through engaging, age-appropriate stories,\" and the district follows a \"careful, public, participatory selection process\" to ensure they meet that criteria. The books are made available for individual reading, classroom read-alouds and other educational activities, according to the school district.",
      "After the books were introduced, some parents sought to have their children excused when they were read or discussed. Some of these so-called out-out requests were religious-based and others were not, according to court filings. Lawyers for the board said that while teachers and principals attempted to accommodate the requests, the number grew and raised concerns about student absenteeism, the feasibility of administering opt-outs throughout the district and the \"risk of exposing students who believe the storybooks represent them and their families to social stigma and isolation.\"",
      "The district then announced in March 2023 that it wouldn't allow opt-outs from language-arts instruction that involved the storybooks \"for any reason.\"",
      "The decision sparked backlash from the community, and more than 1,000 parents signed a petition urging the board to reinstate their notice and opt-out requests. Hundreds also attended school board meetings and said they had religious obligations not to subject their children to gender and sexuality instruction that conflicted with their religious beliefs.",
      "Following the school district's announcement, in May 2023, three sets of parents sued the Montgomery County Board of Education, alleging their First Amendment and due process rights were violated. The lead challengers are Tamer Mahmoud and Enas Barakat, who are Muslim and have a son in elementary school. Also challenging the board's move are Chris and Melissa Persak, who are Roman Catholic and have two elementary-age children, and Jeff and Svitlana Roman, who are Roman Catholic and Ukrainian Orthodox and have a son in elementary school.",
      "They sought a court order that would require notice and opt outs when the books were read or discussed. The parents argued their children's exposure to the books \"necessarily establishes the existence of a burden\" on their right to freely exercise their religion.",
      "A federal district court denied the request, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit upheld the decision.",
      "The divided three-judge panel found that there was no evidence at that time that the families were compelled to change their religious beliefs or conduct, or what they taught their children.",
      "The parents then appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the 4th Circuit's decision effectively requires parents to \"surrender their right to direct the religious upbringing of their children by sending them to public schools.\"",
      "\"Under the Fourth Circuit's reasoning, parents cannot be heard until after the damage has been done to their children. But there is no unringing that bell \u2014 by then, innocence will be lost and beliefs undermined,\" they wrote in a filing.",
      "But the school board urged the Supreme Court to turn away the case.",
      "They said the parents \"seek to unsettle a decades-old consensus that parents who choose to send their children to public school are not deprived of their right to freely exercise their religion simply because their children are exposed to curricular materials the parents find offensive.\"",

      "The monster that roared through L.A. County last week is still alive \u2013 but firefighters seem to have it cornered. People have started returning to their homes, or what's left of them. Insurance, if they had it, is a whole other battle.",

      "Vaillant says climate change is making disasters like the wind-driven L.A. fires even fiercer. \"We can expect fires of this intensity, and worse, in the future,\" he said. \"The types of fires we've seen over the past ten years are qualitatively different from the previous hundred years.\"",
      "\"The types of fires are different?\" I asked. \"How has fire changed?\"",
      "\"In a number of ways. The most potent and frightening way, the most obvious to the layperson, people like us, is it moves faster and with greater intensity. When you talk to any firefighter with any sense of history, they are seeing different [fire] behavior that is, in many cases, un-fightable.\"",
      "And Vaillant says the cause is something science has been telling us for decades: the CO2 that our combustion engines keep pumping into the atmosphere. \"We don't feel it; we don't smell it; we don't notice it,\" he said. \"But if you were to take the car engine that brought me here and set it up on the floor here and fired it up, we would go deaf, and then we would die from its emissions.\u00a0 And that's under the hood of every internal combustion engine car. And there are hundreds of millions of them. So, the emissions from fire, these trillions of fires that we make every day, has created this artificially warm climate.\"",

And the California fires were a disaster for him as well; his old house in Altadena, and his friends' homes, all burned to the ground.

      "Scientists like Kalmus have been warning the world about impending climate disaster for years now. But on January 6, as the fire closed in on Altadena, perhaps the most effective warning came from an amateur meteorologist.",
      "Edgar McGregor has been picking up trash in Altadena every day for more than five years. He's also into meteorology, and runs a Facebook page about weather. Days before the fires even started, he warned his Facebook followers about dangerous conditions, and on January 6, he posted a video telling them to drop everything and get out of town.",
      "\"I said, 'Get out,'\" McGregor explained. \"I stood in the middle of my street at home, filmed myself with the mountains on fire behind me and told people, 'This is serious. Get your Social Security cards. Get the deed to your home. Get out. Like, this is the Big One. I'm not joking around. This is not gonna blow over.'\"",
      "Jenn Siebert, an Altadena mother of two, didn't need to hear that twice. \"I think he, well, he definitely saved my family's lives,\" she said. \"We all listened to him. We were like, 'This kid knows what he's talking about!'\"",
      "Her own house somehow survived; her neighbors weren't so lucky. \"My best friends, like, they've lost everything,\" Siebert said. \"They're alive, because, probably because of Edgar, I would imagine. Everybody in the Beautiful Altadena group is alive because of Edgar, right now.\"",
      "Siebert, who had never met McGregor in person, embraced him when she was introduced. \"I'm so appreciative of you,\" she said. \"You saved my family and you saved so many people. So, thank you.\"",
      "The fires, experts say, are a warning on a much bigger scale, that the Earth will continue to get drier and more volatile unless we do something about climate change. But of course, warnings only work when people listen.",

      "\"The upside to all of this is, Nature is inviting us, sternly, to reengage,\" he replied. \"It's only going to get hotter. And so, Nature is saying, 'Wake up! We are in this together.' It behooves all of us to focus on the real causes, and to understand that this really can happen to us, to us, to you and to me, not just to people we know, or people on TV.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 07:21:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Scientists analyzing 2,000-year-old DNA have revealed that a Celtic society in the southern U.K. during the Iron Age was centered around women, a study said.",
    "story": [
      "Female family ties were at the heart of social networks in Celtic society in Britain before the Roman invasion, a new analysis suggests.",
      "Genetic evidence from a late Iron Age cemetery shows that women were closely related while unrelated men tended to come into the community from elsewhere, likely after marriage.",
      "An examination of ancient DNA recovered from 57 graves in Dorset in southwest England shows that two-thirds of the individuals were descended from a single maternal lineage. The cemetery was used from around 100 B.C. to 200 A.D.",
      "\"That was really jaw-dropping \u2014 it's never been observed before in European prehistory,\" said study co-author Lara Cassidy, a geneticist at Trinity College Dublin.",
      "The findings, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, suggest that women stayed in the same circles throughout life \u2014 maintaining social networks and likely inheriting or managing land and property.",
      "Meanwhile \"it's your husband who is coming in as a relative stranger, dependent on a wife's family for land and livelihood,\" said Cassidy.",
      "This pattern \u2014 called matrilocality \u2014 is historically rare.",
      "\"Such a matrilocal pattern is undescribed in European prehistory, but when we compare mitochondrial haplotype variation among European archaeological sites spanning six millennia, British Iron Age cemeteries stand out as having marked reductions in diversity driven by the presence of dominant matrilines,\" the authors write in an article accompanying the study.",
      "Archaeologists studying grave sites in Britain and Europe have previously only detected the opposite pattern \u2014 women leaving their homes to join their husband's family group \u2014 in other ancient time periods, from the neolithic to the early Medieval period, said Guido Gnecchi-Ruscone at the Max Planck Institute in Germany, who was not part of the study.",
      "In studies of pre-industrial societies from around 1800 to the present, anthropologists found that men join their wives' extended family households only 8% of the time, said Cassidy.",
      "But archaeologists already knew there was something special about the role of women in Iron Age Britain. A patchwork of tribes with closely related languages and art styles \u2014 sometimes referred to as Celtic \u2014 lived in England before the Roman invasion in 43 A.D. Valuable items have been found buried with Celtic women, and Roman writers, including Julius Caesar, wrote with disdain about their relative independence and fighting prowess.",
      "The pattern of strong female kinship connections that the researchers found does not necessarily imply that women also held formal positions of political power, called matriarchy.",
      "But it does suggest that women had some control of land and property, as well as strong social support, making Britain's Celtic society \"more egalitarian than the Roman world,\" said study co-author and Bournemouth University archaeologist Miles Russell.",
      "\"When the Romans arrived, they were astonished to find women occupying positions of power,\"\u00a0 Russell said.",
      "Some had doubted these accounts, suggesting \"that the Romans exaggerated the liberties of British women to paint a picture of an untamed society,\" he told AFP.",
      "\"But archaeology, and now genetics, implies women were influential in many spheres of Iron Age life,\" he said.",
      "\"Indeed, it is possible that maternal ancestry was the primary shaper of group identities.\"",

    "summary": "If the weather cooperates, the Starship launch will follow the maiden flight of Jeff Bezos' already weather-delayed New Glenn rocket.",
    "story": [
      "After launching more than 100 small payloads from California on Tuesday and two commercial moon landers from Florida early Wednesday, both atop Falcon 9 rockets, SpaceX readied a huge Super Heavy-Starship for a ground-shaking launch from the Texas Gulf Coast to kick off the program's seventh test flight.",
      "But bad weather prompted the California rocket builder to delay the high-profile flight to Thursday, when it will follow a NASA spacewalk outside the International Space Station and the launch of Jeff Bezos' New Glenn rocket on its maiden flight.",
      "The New Glenn is scheduled for its own weather-delayed liftoff from pad 36 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida at 1 a.m. EST, the opening of a three-hour launch window.",
      "Six hours later, space station astronauts Nick Hague and Starliner pilot Sunita Williams plan to venture outside the NASA lab complex for a six-and-a-half-hour spacewalk starting around 8 a.m. to carry out a variety of maintenance and upgrade tasks.",
      "That will set the stage for the Super Heavy-Starship launch from SpaceX's Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and flight test facility at 5 p.m. EST, weather permitting.",
      "The Super Heavy-Starship is the most powerful rocket ever built, generating a staggering 16 million pounds of thrust at liftoff using 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines. The New Glenn rocket, built by Bezos' space company Blue Origin, is not nearly as powerful, but it will compete head-to-head with SpaceX's industry-dominating Falcon 9-family rockets.",
      "Like the Falcon 9's first stage, the New Glenn booster is reusable, and Blue Origin will attempt to recover its first stage with touchdown on an offshore landing ship. The rocket's upper stage will continue into orbit where flight controllers will carry out a series of tests. Additional flights are planned later this year.",
      "The Super Heavy-Starship has a more ambitious agenda befitting its gargantuan size.",
      "As with the two most recent test flights, the first stage will boost the Starship upper stage out of the dense lower atmosphere before falling away and heading back to the launch site for recovery. The Starship, meanwhile, will continue to space on the power of six Raptor engines of its own.",
      "For these initial test flights, the Starships do not attempt to reach orbit. Instead, they loop halfway around the planet and descend belly first through a hellish blaze of atmospheric friction before flipping nose up for a tail-first, rocket-powered splashdown in the Indian Ocean.",
      "For the third flight in a row, SpaceX planned an attempt to \"catch\" the Super Heavy first stage after it propelled the Starship out of the lower atmosphere, snagging it on the way down using giant mechanical arms known as chopsticks mounted on the launch tower.",
      "The first such catch  last October was successful, a spectacular sight to thousands of  cheering residents and tourists. But the Super Heavy used for the next such flight a month later  was diverted to a Gulf of Mexico splashdown because of launch damage to  sensors on the tower that were needed to help guide the descending  booster into position.",
      "New sensors now have more robust shielding to eliminate such damage and SpaceX engineers are optimistic they'll soon be recovering Super Heavy boosters with the same regularity they've demonstrated with the company's workhorse Falcon 9 rockets.",
      "But the bulk of the upgrades being tested Thursday are built into what SpaceX calls a \"new generation\" Starship. Multiple systems have been modified to improve performance and to test systems needed for eventual stage recovery.",
      "\"This new year will be transformational for Starship,\" SpaceX said on its website, \"with the goal of bringing reuse of the entire system online and flying increasingly ambitious missions as we iterate towards being able to send humans and cargo to Earth orbit, the moon, and Mars.\"",

      "Aircraft battling fires raging through the Los Angeles area are dousing the area with more than water: Hundreds of thousands of gallons of hot-pink fire suppressant have been dropped ahead of the flames in a desperate effort to stop them before they destroy more neighborhoods.",
      "The deadly fires have displaced thousands of residents and destroyed more than 12,000 structures since they began last Tuesday, Jan. 7. Four major fires driven by strong Santa Ana winds have charred about 62 square miles, according to Cal Fire.",
      "Fire agencies say the suppressants \u2014 most often used to fight forest fires \u2014 are an invaluable tool. But what is in them and are they safe?",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "When are fire suppressants used?",
      "The fires are burning quickly through canyons and other rugged areas that are difficult for firefighters on the ground to reach, Cal Fire said.",
      "While fire suppressants can be very effective, they do have limitations, the agency said. Strong winds can make it too dangerous to fly at the low altitudes needed for drops and can dissipate the retardant before it hits the ground.",
      "Besides Cal Fire, multiple agencies have dropped fire retardant and water, including the U.S. Forest Service, the Los Angeles and Ventura county fire departments, the city and the National Guard.",
      "What is in aerial fire suppressants?",
      "Aerial fire suppressants are generally a mixture of water, ammonium phosphate \u2014 essentially fertilizer \u2014 and iron oxide, which is added to make the retardant visible, said Daniel McCurry, a civil and environmental engineering professor at the University of Southern California.",
      "The Forest Service, which has used 13 aircraft to dump suppressants on the Los Angeles fires, says they help starve a fire of oxygen and slow the rate of burn by cooling and coating vegetation and other surfaces.",
      "Perimeter, the company that supplies fire retardant to the Forest Service and other agencies, says the phosphate changes the way cellulose in plants decomposes and makes them non-flammable.",
      "The fire suppressants are generally considered safe for people, but many worry about their potential effects on wildlife.",
      "The Forest Service bans use of aerial suppressants over waterways and endangered species habitats, \"except when human life or public safety are threatened,\" due to potential health effects on fish and other wildlife.",
      "McCurry, from USC, said he and other researchers tested several suppressants and found heavy metals, including chromium and cadmium, in one commonly used by the U.S. Forest Service.",
      "McCurry said the study's findings suggest that it's \"plausible\" that fire suppressants could contribute to spikes of chromium and other heavy metals in waterways downstream of wildfires.",
      "\"We don't quite have a smoking gun yet because it's difficult, although not impossible, to prove where a heavy metal came from,\" McCurry said. \"We're working on that.\"",
      "Perimeter, the manufacturer of the Forest Service's fire retardant, said McCurry's research was on a formulation that wasn't used in California and is no longer used by the Forest Service. The company also says it doesn't add metals, which it says are naturally present in all ammonium phosphate fertilizers, and that its aerial suppressants \"are exhaustively tested by the USDA Forest Service and meet or exceed all health and safety standards.\"",
      "Using flame retardants to protect the power grid",
      "Several Los Angeles area power companies are also using flame retardants to try to help protect power poles and lines, CBS Los Angeles reported.",
      "Crews have been working for days, stopping at as many power poles as possible along the edges of the wildfires \u2014the Palisades Fire along the Los Angeles coast and the Eaton Fire in the mountains above Pasadena and Altadena.",
      "First, they clear dry shrubbery from the area surrounding the poles, then they use their trucks to douse each power pole with fire retardant \u2014 the same substance that's dropped by firefighting aircraft from above. They try to spray it as far up the pole as possible and into all the cracks, so embers can't get a foothold.",
      "\"That way, if or when the fire does make it this way, we don't have to worry about embers catching it,\" said Connor Norton, one of the PG&E employees working in North Hollywood on Sunday.",
      "\"The best way to save lives\"",
      "The use of fire retardants is imperative to putting out wildfires that expose millions of people to health risks, including from a toxic mix of microscopic particles that can cause breathing and heart problems by penetrating deep into the lungs and bloodstream.",
      "Studies have shown that wildfire smoke accounted for up to half of all health-damaging particle air pollution in the western U.S. in recent years as warming temperatures fueled more destructive blazes.",
      "And research released last year by the Alzheimer's Association found that wildfire smoke may be worse for brain health than other types of air pollution, raising the risk of dementia.",

    "story": [
      "Cicadas are set to return this year in the U.S., but their numbers are not expected to be as overwhelming as they were in the\u00a0spring of 2024, when multiple broods emerged simultaneously.",
      "Brood XIV, the second-largest group of periodical cicadas, known for their noisy mass emergence from the ground, is the only group of 17-year cicada that will emerge this spring, according to University of Connecticut researchers.",
      "Here's what we know about the cicadas in 2025:",
      "When will cicadas come back?",
      "For most of their lives, cicadas live underground, and then they emerge after a specific number of years once the soil reaches 64 degrees. Brood XIV emerges every 17 years.",
      "Though it's not known exactly when they will show up in 2025, they typically appear in May and last through June. During those weeks, the cicadas mature, mate and lay eggs before dying off, and then their offspring begin the cycle anew.",
      "Climate change is also affecting the timing of the insects' arrival. Last year, the cicadas' return started in Georgia nearly two weeks ahead of schedule.",
      "Where will Brood XIV cicadas emerge?",
      "Known as the \"Great(er) Eastern Brood,\" this group is historically found in areas of north Georgia, Kentucky, Tennessee, southern Indiana and Ohio, North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, and parts of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and Massachusetts.",
      "However, UConn researchers note that Brood XIV cicadas population are declining on Long Island and their distributions are shifting in southwestern Ohio and southeastern Indiana. The researchers said they will map and study the cicadas' 2025 emergence to address gaps in knowledge about the patterns.",
      "How many cicadas will there be in 2025?",
      "It's difficult to estimate the population of any insects, and cicadas are no exception.",
      "Hundreds of trillions, or even quadrillions, of cicadas were expected in 2024 when two massive broods emerged at the same time, UConn cicada expert John Cooley said.",
      "There will be fewer cicadas this spring, but more than a trillion of the insects could emerge. The number may sound extreme, but the cicadas won't all be at the same place at the same time.",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Aviation Administration has ordered SpaceX to carry out a formal investigation into the breakup of its Starship rocket during a test flight Thursday that sent a spectacular shower of flaming debris plummeting back to Earth, the agency announced Friday.",
      "\"The FAA is requiring SpaceX to perform a mishap investigation into the loss of the Starship vehicle during launch operations on Jan. 16,\" the FAA said in a statement. \"There are no reports of public injury, and the FAA is working with SpaceX and appropriate authorities to confirm reports of public property damage on Turks and Caicos.\"",
      "Within minutes of the Starship's breakup, along with videos posted on social media showing a shower of debris from a sudden fireball \u2014 possibly propellants igniting in the wake of the failure \u2014 the FAA activated a \"Debris Response Area\" and \"briefly slowed aircraft outside the area where space vehicle debris was falling.\"",
      "Other aircraft were briefly held up at South Florida airports and several \"requested to divert due to low fuel levels while holding outside impacted areas,\" the agency said.",
      "SpaceX, meanwhile, said initial data indicated a fire broke out in the rear part of the Starship, triggering the vehicle's destruction.",
      "\"The Starship upper stage successfully lit all six Raptor engines and performed its ascent burn to space,\" the company said on its web page. \"Prior to the burn's completion, telemetry was lost with the vehicle after approximately eight and a half minutes of flight. Initial data indicates a fire developed in the aft section of the ship, leading to a rapid unscheduled disassembly.\"",
      "A \"rapid unscheduled disassembly,\" or RUD, is a description favored by SpaceX founder Elon Musk when referring to catastrophic rocket failures. SpaceX set up a \"debris hotline\" at 1-866-623-0234 and urged anyone who finds Starship wreckage to call or notify the company at recovery@spacex.com.",
      "Mishap occurred during test flight",
      "The mishap occurred during the seventh test flight of a giant Super Heavy-Starship rocket from SpaceX's Gulf Coast manufacturing and flight test center at Boca Chica, Texas.",
      "The Super Heavy first stage chalked up a successful mission, boosting the Starship upper stage out of the lower atmosphere, then flipping around and flying back to seaside firing stand where it was plucked out of mid air by giant mechanical arms on the launch tower.",
      "The Starship, meanwhile, continued toward space on the power of its six engines. But about eight-and-a-half minutes after liftoff, telemetry shared on SpaceX's webcast showed the engines shutting down in a staggered fashion before data suddenly froze and stopped updating.",
      "Numerous photos and videos posted on social media showed smoking debris trails fanning out from a fireball in the late afternoon sky in a scene reminiscent of the shuttle Columbia's breakup in 2003 and the Russian Mir space station's intentional re-entry and disintegration in 2001.",
      "The mishap Thursday is not expected to impact SpaceX's commercial operations. The company dominates the commercial launch industry with its partially reusable Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets launched from Florida and California and those boosters do not share any common elements with the Starship.",
      "But Musk views the Super Heavy-Starship, the most powerful rocket ever built, as the future of the company, with both stages designed to fly themselves to rocket-powered landings for rapid refurbishment and re-launch, a key element in the company's drive to lower launch costs.",
      "SpaceX is in the process of ramping up test flights to quickly verify performance, test new ideas, identify problem areas and implement fixes in downstream flights.",
      "How the FAA-mandated investigation might affect the test schedule is not yet known.",
      "\"A mishap investigation is designed to enhance public safety, determine the root cause of the event and identify corrective actions to avoid it from happening again,\" the FAA said.",
      "\"The FAA will be involved in every step of the SpaceX-led mishap investigation process and must approve SpaceX's final report, including any corrective actions. A return to flight is based on the FAA determining that any system, process  or procedure related to the mishap does not affect public safety.\"",
      "How long the investigation might take -- and when the Super Heavy-Starship might fly again -- is not yet known. But it almost certainly will stretch out SpaceX's test program.",

      "SpaceX's billionaire owner Elon Musk later hinted at a possible cause, posting to his X platform: \"Preliminary indication is that we had an oxygen/fuel leak in the cavity above the ship engine firewall that was large enough to build pressure in excess of the vent capacity. Apart from obviously double-checking for leaks, we will add fire suppression to that volume and probably increase vent area.\"",

      "SpaceX said that anyone who finds what they think is debris should call local authorities or the company's debris hotline at 1-866-623-0234.",
      "The gargantuan rocket blasted off from SpaceX's Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and flight test facility on the Gulf Coast at 5:37 p.m. Eastern Time, firing up 33 methane-burning Raptor engines generating up to 16 million pounds of thrust.",
      "Gulping 40,000 pounds of propellant per second, the booster climbed away from its launch stand and gracefully arced over to the east atop a long jet of flaming exhaust visible for dozens of miles around.",
      "Two minutes and 40 seconds after liftoff, the Super Heavy fell away and the Starship continued the climb to space on the power of its six Raptor engines.",
      "The booster, meanwhile, flipped around, re-ignited several engines to reverse course and headed back toward Boca Chica where the unique mechanical arms on the rocket's launch gantry were open and waiting.",
      "Plummeting tail first back to Earth, the Super Heavy re-ignited its engines, tilting as they steered it to the pad, and then settled straight down between the chopsticks, which smoothly closed to capture their quarry in mid air.",
      "The first such catch last October was successful, a jaw-dropping sight to thousands of cheering residents and tourists. But the Super Heavy used for the next such flight a month later was diverted to a Gulf of Mexico splashdown because of launch damage to sensors on the tower that were needed to help guide the descending booster into position.",
      "New sensors with have more robust shielding were put in place to eliminate such damage and SpaceX engineers are optimistic they'll soon be recovering Super Heavy boosters with the same regularity they've demonstrated with the company's workhorse Falcon 9 rockets, a key element in SpaceX's drive to lower launch costs.",
      "In keeping with the reusability theme, the Super Heavy's 33 Raptor engines included one that flew on a previous test flight to demonstrate its ability to fly multiple missions.",
      "The bulk of the upgrades tested Thursday were built into what SpaceX called a \"new generation\" Starship. Two minutes after the booster \"landed,\" the upper stage reached space.",
      "But the loss of telemetry left flight controllers in the dark about what might have happened in the final stages of the ascent.",
      "For these initial test flights, the Starships do not attempt to reach orbit. Instead, they loop halfway around the planet and descend belly-first through a hellish blaze of atmospheric friction before flipping nose up for a tail-first, rocket-powered splashdown in the Indian Ocean.",
      "For Thursday's flight, major test objectives included restarting a Raptor engine in space and the deployment of 10 dummy Starlink mockups to test a new satellite delivery system that works a bit like a Pez candy dispenser. Starships are expected to launch thousands of Starlinks after the rocket is operational.",
      "Among the other upgrades were smaller stabilizing fins, repositioned to reduce their exposure to re-entry heating, an improved propulsion avionics system, redesigned fuel feed lines and a 25% increase in propellant volume to improve performance.",
      "The redesigned avionics system includes a more powerful flight computer, new antennas that combine signals from Starlink and GPS navigation satellites, \"smart batteries\" and power units to drive two dozen high-voltage actuators and redesigned navigation sensors.",

    "summary": "Despite losing its booster during a landing attempt, the upper stage reached orbit as planned.",
    "story": [
      "Shrugging off bad weather, Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin launched its powerful New Glenn rocket on its maiden flight early Thursday, lighting up a cloudy overnight sky as it climbed away from Cape Canaveral in a high-stakes bid to compete with Elon Musk's industry-leading SpaceX.",
      "Like SpaceX's workhorse Falcon 9, the New Glenn's first stage was designed to fly itself to a landing on a Blue Origin recovery ship after boosting the upper stage out of the lower atmosphere. Reusability is a key element in Bezos' drive to compete with Musk on the high frontier.",
      "The booster did it's job propelling the upper stage into the lower reaches of space. But during its descent to a planned landing on the recovery ship Jacklyn, named after Bezos' mother, telemetry and video from the rocket froze.",
      "\"We may very well have lost the booster,\" a company commentator said.",
      "The company later confirmed that. But recovering the first stage was always a secondary objective. The New Glenn's upper stage reached orbit without any apparent problems, achieving the primary goal of the flight.",
      "\"We did it! Orbital,\" company CEO Dave Limp said on X. \"Great night for Team Blue. On to spring and trying again on the landing.\"",
      "As for the booster, Limp said \"we knew landing our booster ... on the first try was an ambitious goal. We'll learn a lot from today and try again at our next launch this spring. Thank you to all of Team Blue for this incredible milestone.\"",
      "The mission got underway at 2:03 a.m. EST when the New Glenn's seven methane-burning BE-4 engines at the base of the first stage roared to life with a rush of brilliant flame and a ground-shaking roar.",
      "Smoothly accelerating as it consumed propellants and lost weight, the  New Glenn streaked away from pad 36 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force  Station atop a brilliant blue-white plume, putting on a spectacular show for  cheering Blue Origin employees, area residents and tourists.",
      "The launch came a week later than originally planned because of rough weather in the booster landing zone and, once, because of a minor technical problem. But it appeared to be clear sailing Thursday as the rocket climbed away and disappeared from view.",
      "Three minutes and 10 seconds after liftoff, the rocket's first stage engines shut down, triggering stage separation and ignition of the two hydrogen-burning BE-3U engines powering the rocket's second stage.",
      "As the upper stage continued the climb to orbit, the first stage briefly coasted upward before arcing over and falling back to Earth, homing in on the Jacklyn, which was standing by several hundred miles downrange in the Atlantic Ocean. NASA's WB-57 photo-reconnaissance jet was flying nearby, documenting the flight with high-resolution cameras.",
      "Three engines re-ignited as planned to slow the booster for re-entry but during the burn, video showing one of the engines froze and on-screen telemetry stopped while showing an altitude of 84,226 feet and a velocity of 4,285 mph. Whether the rocket exploded or suffered some other malfunction and crashed into the sea was not immediately known.",
      "But company officials said before launch that they would learn from any anomalies and press ahead with another flight in the next few months.",
      "\"We have another one (in production), and it'll be coming off the line here shortly,\" Limp told CBS News earlier this week. \"So we'll fly (again) either way in the spring.\"",
      "While SpaceX tested its Falcon 9 landing system with ocean splashdowns before attempting an actual landing, Blue Origin opted to make the attempt on the rocket's maiden flight. That was based in part on the company's experience launching and landing its sub-orbital New Shepard rocket, used to carry space tourists, researchers and payloads on brief up-and-down flights out of the lower atmosphere.",
      "Even so, company officials acknowledged the challenge, naming the New Glenn first stage \"So You're Telling Me There's A Chance.\"",
      "\"There's no question that it's a bit audacious to try to land it the first time,\" Limp said before launch.",
      "But the first stage landing was just one of several major objectives. The primary goal of the flight was to put the upper stage into orbit, along with a Blue Origin-designed spacecraft known as the Blue Ring Pathfinder. A sort of space tug, the Blue Ring can host or deploy multiple satellites in different orbits while providing on-board computer support and even servicing.",
      "For its initial flight, the Blue Ring was to remain attached to the New Glenn's upper stage throughout the planned five-hour 50-minute mission.",
      "The flight plan called for two firings of the upper stage engines, with the second coming about an hour after liftoff, to put the vehicle and the attached Blue Ring Pathfinder in an elliptical orbit with a high point of about 12,000 miles and a low point of around 1,500 miles.",
      "Blue Ring is equipped with roll-out solar arrays stretching 144 feet. It features 13 ports for hosted and deployable payloads and can accommodate satellites or other instruments weighing up to 2.5 tons on its upper deck.",
      "There are no such payloads on the initial flight, but the spacecraft's systems will undergo a series of tests to learn more about how the craft performs in space.",
      "Regardless of the results of Thursday's mission, Blue Origin will face an uphill battle with SpaceX, which currently dominates the commercial launch market.",
      "Musk had kind words about the launch in a post on his X platform, saying, \"Congratulations on reaching orbit on the first attempt!\"",
      "SpaceX began launching its Falcon 9 rockets in 2010 and since then has fired off 436 Falcon 9-family missions with only two in-flight failures.",
      "Complicating the picture for Blue Origin, SpaceX is in the process of testing a gargantuan, fully reusable rocket known as the Super Heavy-Starship. It is the most powerful rocket ever built, and once operational is expected to play a major role in launching payloads to low-Earth orbit, the moon and beyond.",
      "SpaceX plans to launch a Super Heavy-Starship from the company's Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and test center on Thursday at 5 p.m. EST.",
      "After boosting the Starship out of the lower atmosphere, the Super Heavy booster is designed to fly back to its launch pad, where giant mechanical arms would attempt to pluck it out of mid-air. The Starship upper stage, meanwhile, would loop around the planet, launching 10 mockup Starlink satellites before a simulated landing in the Indian Ocean.",
      "Some 225 Falcon 9 flights have launched 7,700 Starlink internet satellites since 2019, with thousands more planned. The company already has millions of customers around the world, giving it a formidable head start over potential competitors.",
      "How Blue Origin and other rocket builders will complete with SpaceX, it's Falcon-family rockets and the Super Heavy-Starship remains to be seen.",
      "But Blue Origin already has a backlog of satellites awaiting launch on its New Glenn and is awaiting certification to launch high-priority national security payloads, NASA probes and other civilian satellites.",
      "Amazon plans to launch more than 3,232 broadband relay stations known as Project Kuiper to provide space-based internet services in direct competition with SpaceX's Starlink.",
      "Blue Origin says it has booked 80 launches using New Glenn rockets and boosters provided by the European consortium Arianespace, United Launch Alliance and even SpaceX to get the data relay stations into orbit.",
      "\"I'm very bullish about space in general,\" Limp said. \"I think there's going to be lots of winners in this segment. It might be SpaceX; I think Blue will be there. But I also believe there's going to be new companies that we've never even heard of yet. There's some entrepreneur out there that hasn't started a space company that's going to be at the table.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 09:31:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Firefly's \"Blue Moon\" and ispace's \"Resilience\" are the latest in an ongoing push to gain private-sector experience exploring the moon.",
    "story": [
      "With the nearly full moon shining overhead, two companies, one American and the other headquartered in Japan, launched privately developed robotic lunar landers early Wednesday, sharing a sky-lighting ride to space atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.",
      "The U.S. lander, built by Austin, Texas-based Firefly Aerospace and known as \"Blue Ghost,\" is carrying 10 sophisticated instruments for NASA while the Japanese spacecraft, built by Tokyo-based ispace and known as \"Resilience,\" is carrying four instruments of its own and a small microrover known as \"Tenacious.\"",
      "Mounted one atop the other in the nose cone of the Falcon 9, liftoff from historic pad 39A came on time at 1:11 a.m. EST Wednesday. Blue Ghost, weighing 1,033 pounds without propellant, was released to fly on its own one hour and five minutes after liftoff.",
      "Resilience, which weighs about 750 pounds, was deployed 21 minutes later, after the Falcon 9 carried out a final second stage engine firing to put the craft on a different trajectory.",
      "\"Our customers have different strategies for arriving to the moon, and Falcon 9's abilities enable us to deliver each lander to their respective injection orbits to complete their missions,\" said Julianna Scheiman, a senior SpaceX manager.",
      "The landers are taking very different routes to the moon. Blue Ghost is expected to spend about 25 days in Earth orbit, giving Firefly engineers time to thoroughly check out the craft's instruments, propulsion and other subsystems. The craft then will fire its engines for a four-day trip to the moon, followed by 16 days in lunar orbit.",
      "If no major problems develop, Blue Ghost, 6.6 feet tall and 11.5 feet wide, then will descend to the surface near the center of Mare Crisium \u2014 the Sea of Crisis \u2014 touching down on four shock-absorbing legs. Its 10 science instruments will have two full weeks, or a lunar \"day,\" to collect data.",
      "\"The research we gather will help unlock future space exploration, while also benefiting life on Earth, with new insights into how space weather and other cosmic forces affect our planet,\" said Firefly CEO Jason Kim.",
      "\"Each milestone we complete will provide valuable data for future missions and ultimately keep the United States and our international partners at the forefront of space exploration.\"",
      "Unlike Blue Ghost, ispace's Resilience, also known as Hakuto-R, will head for the moon about two days after launch, using a low-energy fuel-saving trajectory. One month later, the craft will fly past the moon, using its gravity to adjust the flight path before entering orbit about four months after launch. Two weeks after that, Resilience will attempt its own landing at Mare Frigoris, the Sea of Cold.",
      "ispace launched its first Hakuto lander in late 2022, but flight controllers lost contact the following March as the spacecraft was nearing the moon's surface.",
      "Investigators later determined the onboard software misinterpreted the lander's altitude after flying over the rim of a crater. The vehicle subsequently ran out of propellant and crashed to the surface.",
      "That problem has been corrected, ispace says, prompting the company to name its second Hakuto lander \"Resilience.\" ispace officials are optimistic about its chances the second time around.",
      "\"We've got experiments that I think are going to help with the establishment of lunar infrastructure that will eventually, hopefully lead to a permanent, significant human presence on the moon,\" said Ron Garan, a former space shuttle astronaut and CEO of ispace USA.",
      "\"We're doing an electrolysis experiment. We're doing a food production experiment. We also have some art installations.\"",
      "A model of a Swedish house will be carried away from the lander on the rover, which will \"set it down on the lunar surface,\" Garan said. \"We're going to photograph it, and it's a really exciting artistic endeavor as well.\"",
      "Garan called the microrover, built by ispace's Luxembourg-based unit and measuring just 10.2 inches tall and 21.6 inches long, \"really critical to the future of our company.\"",
      "\"The data that's going to come off the rover is going to be really valuable to us as we continue to hone our design on the surface mobility aspect of the business,\" he said. \"And so, that's really exciting, too.\"",
      "The Resilience mission is privately funded, without any financing from NASA. The instruments aboard Blue Ghost, in contrast, cost NASA $44 million to develop. The agency agreed to pay Firefly $101 million to carry them to the moon as part of its\u00a0Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative.",
      "The CLPS program is aimed at encouraging private industry to launch agency payloads to the moon to collect needed science and engineering data before Artemis astronauts begin work on the surface near the lunar south pole later this decade.",
      "\"NASA is investing in commercial delivery services to the moon to enable industry growth and to support long-term lunar exploration, helping the United States stay ahead in space innovation,\" said Nicola Fox, head of NASA's science mission directorate.",
      "\"To date, five vendors have been awarded 11 lunar deliveries under CLPS and are sending more than 50 instruments to various locations on the moon, including the lunar South Pole. Existing CLPS contracts (have) a cumulative maximum contract value of $2.6 billion through 2028. No other nation has done this.\"",
      "The Blue Ghost instruments will collect data on the lunar dust environment, drill into the soil below the lander, monitor background X-ray emissions, test whether Earth-orbiting navigation satellites can be used near the moon and the effectiveness of computer radiation shielding, among other topics of interest.",
      "\"Before we can send our humans back to the moon, we are sending a lot of science and a lot of technology ahead of time to prepare for that,\" said Fox.",
      "\"The technological and science demonstrations on board Firefly's Blue Ghost mission will be critical in our ability to not only discover more science, but also to ensure the safety of our spacecraft instruments and most importantly, the safety of our astronauts.\"",
      "Kim said the Blue Ghost mission will span about two months.",
      "\"After Blue Ghost lands on the moon, we'll be collecting critical payload science data throughout the entire mission,\" he said. \"We'll then wrap up the mission by capturing a solar eclipse and a lunar sunset in high definition video before operating several hours into the lunar night.\"",
      "Toward the end of the mission, the company hopes to capture a phenomenon first seen by NASA's Surveyor moon landers and at least two Apollo crews, a so-called \"horizon glow\" caused by sunlight interacting with small dust particles kicked up by solar radiation and micrometeoroid impacts.",
      "\"Knowing that Firefly's Blue Ghost mission is a culmination of what the last Apollo astronaut to walk on the moon observed is a fitting tribute to their legacy,\" Kim said.",

    "published": "Sun, 19 Jan 2025 11:03:17 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump vowed to issue an executive order on Monday to postpone the ban on TikTok from going into effect.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump vowed Sunday to issue an executive order to restore TikTok after app owner ByteDance voluntarily shut down service in the U.S. just hours before a Sunday deadline, cutting off access to tens of millions of users after the Supreme Court this week\u00a0upheld a law that effectively banned it over concerns about its ties to China.",
      "The law passed by Congress last year gave TikTok's Chinese parent company ByteDance until Jan. 19 to divest from TikTok or be cut off from U.S. app stores and hosting services. TikTok said a sale wasn't possible and challenged the law in court, but it was rejected by a unanimous Supreme Court on Friday.",
      "Trump on Sunday posted on social media that he would restore TikTok, first writing \"SAVE TIKTOK\" and then vowing to issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before the law takes effect. Further, he said there would be no liability for companies that helped keep TikTok from going dark before the order went into effect.",
      "\"Americans deserve to see our exciting Inauguration on Monday, as well as other events and conversations,\" he wrote.\u00a0 \"I would like the United States to have a 50% ownership position in a joint venture.\u00a0 By doing this, we save TikTok, keep it in good hands and allow it to say up.\u00a0 Without U.S. approval, there is no Tik Tok.\u00a0 With our approval, it is worth hundreds of billions of dollars - maybe trillions.\"",
      "The court's decision said the\u00a0divest-or-ban law\u00a0does not violate the free speech rights of TikTok or its 170 million users in the U.S., agreeing with the government's position that the platform could be used by China to collect a vast amount of sensitive information on Americans.",
      "While the Biden administration said enforcement of the law would be left to the incoming Trump administration, the company itself took itself offline shortly before Sunday's midnight deadline.",
      "Users in the U.S. who opened the app late Saturday night were greeted with a message with the headline, \"Sorry, TikTok isn't available right now.\"",
      "\"A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S.,\" the message reads. \"Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned!\"",
      "The app was also no longer available in the Apple or Google Play stores. CBS News has reached out to TikTok for comment.",
      "Trump's incoming national security adviser, Mike Waltz, told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that the president-elect had spoken to Chinese President Xi Jinping and \"they agreed to work together on this.\"",
      "\"We can have an app that protects Americans,\" Waltz said. \"And I could tell you, I wouldn't want the FBI or the U.S. government monitoring every keystroke or seeing every password, nor would we want the Chinese Communist Party. But we also want an app that 170 million Americans clearly really enjoy and that we were able to get our message out during the Trump campaign in a very powerful way.\"",
      "TikTok had said Friday it would \"be forced to go dark\" beginning Sunday unless the Biden administration assured service providers that the law would not be enforced. The White House called the appeal \"a stunt\" and said the company should bring up its concerns with the Trump administration.",
      "\"We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump Administration takes office on Monday,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said.",
      "Internationally on Sunday, the TikTok app remained accessible, and there was no indication for international users that it had gone dark in the U.S. It was still possible to view and interact with American accounts, and there was no obvious official signposting that U.S. users' access had been restricted.",
      "Even if President-elect Trump declines to enforce the ban, the law would still be on the books, and companies like Apple and Google could be penalized down the road for violations. Trump previously vowed to \"save\" TikTok, and said Saturday that he was considering an option to extend the deadline for the law to go into effect.",
      "\"The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it's appropriate,\" he said in the phone interview, adding, \"if I decide to do that, I'll probably announce it on Monday.\"",
      "The law includes a provision that allows for a short-term extension if there is a sale in progress.",
      "During Supreme Court arguments on Jan. 10, Noel Francisco, a lawyer for TikTok, warned that the platform would shut down when the law went into effect, explaining that it would be \"extraordinarily difficult\" for a divestiture to occur under any timeline because the Chinese government opposes a sale of the algorithm that powers the platform by tailoring video recommendations to each user.",
      "\"As I understand it, we go dark,\" Francisco said.",
      "But even if there is an eventual sale that did not include TikTok's algorithm, it would take \"many years\" for a new team of engineers to rebuild it and it would be a \"fundamentally different platform,\" according to Francisco. He said the company's inability to share any user data with ByteDance under the law would cut off American users from viewing content from other parts of the world and vice versa.",
      "The bipartisan law was tucked into a foreign assistance package that swiftly passed Congress and was signed by President Biden last April. TikTok and ByteDance challenged the law the next month, calling it \"an extraordinary and unconstitutional assertion of power\" based on \"speculative and analytically flawed concerns about data security and content manipulation\" that would suppress the speech of millions of Americans.",
      "In a December ruling, a federal appeals court upheld the statute, saying the U.S. government \"acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary's ability to gather data on people in the United States.\" The appeals court later denied TikTok's bid to delay the law from taking effect, pending a Supreme Court review.",
      "The Supreme Court moved with extraordinary speed to take up the case after TikTok requested the justices order a temporary pause. The court issued its opinion a week after hearing arguments and two days before the law took effect.",
      "\"There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community. But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok's data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary,\" the court's opinion said.",
      "The justices cited Congress' finding that companies can be required to turn over data to the Chinese government under Chinese law.",
      "\"The government had good reason to single out TikTok,\" the court said.",
      "Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar noted during arguments that there's \"nothing permanent or irrevocable that happens\" on Sunday. The law provides the authority for the restrictions to be lifted on TikTok if there is a sale after the date.",
      "\"Congress expected we might see something like a game of chicken. ByteDance saying, we can't do it, China will never let us do it. But when push comes to shove and these restrictions take effect, I think it will fundamentally change the landscape with respect to what ByteDance is willing to consider,\" Prelogar said.",
      "In a video statement after the Supreme Court issued its decision, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew appeared confident that the app would have a future under Trump. He thanked the incoming president for his commitment to finding a solution that would allow TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. \"for years to come.\"",
      "Trump, who tried to ban TikTok during his first term over national security concerns, said Friday that he spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok. A Chinese summary of the call did not mention that it was a topic of discussion.",
      "Barring a sale or Congress overturning the law, there's no long-term certainty about TikTok's future in the U.S. If Trump or a future president declines to enforce the law, companies like Apple and Google could still face steep fines in the future.",
      "\"On the 19th, if it doesn't shut down, there is a violation of law, correct?\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked Prelogar, who said, \"Yes.\"",
      "\"And whatever the new president does, doesn't change that reality for these companies,\" Sotomayor continued, referring to the penalties facing app stores and web hosting services.",
      "\"That's right,\" Prelogar said, adding that a five-year statute of limitations exists.",

The law gave the company a deadline of Jan. 19 \u2014 one day before a new president would take office.",

We have laid out our position clearly and straightforwardly: actions to implement this law will fall to the next administration. So TikTok and other companies should take up any concerns with them.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the TikTok ban and how we got here:",
      "Why did Congress want to ban TikTok?",
      "U.S. officials have repeatedly warned that TikTok threatens national security because the Chinese government could use it as a vehicle to spy on Americans or covertly influence the U.S. public by amplifying or suppressing certain content.",
      "The concern is warranted, they said, because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering. FBI Director Christopher Wray told House Intelligence Committee members last year that the Chinese government could compromise Americans' devices through the software.",
      "As the House took up the divest-or-ban law in April 2024, Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, compared it to a \"spy balloon in Americans' phones.\" Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, said that lawmakers learned in classified briefings \"how rivers of data are being collected and shared in ways that are not well-aligned with American security interests.\"",
      "\"Why is it a security threat?\" Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said Friday. \"If you have TikTok on your phone currently, it can track your whereabouts, it can read your text messages, it can track your keystrokes. It has access to your phone records.\"",
      "If the Chinese government gets its hands on that information, \"it's not just a national security threat, it's a personal security threat,\" Hawley said.",
      "In 2022, TikTok began an initiative known as \"Project Texas\" to safeguard American users' data on servers in the U.S. and ease lawmakers' fears. The Justice Department said the plan was insufficient because it still allowed some U.S. data to flow to China.",
      "Though the divest-or-ban law passed with bipartisan support, some lawmakers have been critical of the measure, agreeing with TikTok that it infringes on Americans' free speech rights.",
      "\"Most of the reasons the government banned it were based on accusations, not proof,\" Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said Friday. \"[TikTok has] never been tried and found guilty of sharing information with the communist government.\"",
      "Others have changed their tune as the deadline for a ban neared, including Trump, who tried to ban the app with an executive order during his first term that was struck down in the courts.",
      "\"The irony in all of this is that Donald Trump was the first one to point out there's a problem,\" Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Thursday. Warner said the Trump administration \"did a great job of convincing me and overwhelming members of Congress\" about the risks.",
      "TikTok has its day at the Supreme Court",
      "During arguments before the Supreme Court on Jan. 10, TikTok's lawyer did not deny the potential national security risks as the justices appeared critical of the company's legal challenge.",
      "\"I think Congress and the president were concerned that China was accessing information about millions of Americans, tens of millions of Americans, including teenagers, people in their 20s, that they would use that information over time to develop spies, to turn people, to blackmail people, people who a generation from now will be working in the FBI or the CIA or in the State Department,\" Justice Brett Kavanaugh said. \"Is that not a realistic assessment by Congress and the president of the risks here?\"",
      "Noel Francisco, who represented TikTok, responded, \"I'm not disputing the risks. I'm disputing the means that they have chosen.\"",
      "Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar asserted that TikTok collects \"unprecedented amounts\" of personal data that would be \"incredibly valuable\" to the Chinese government by giving it \"a powerful tool for harassment, recruitment and espionage.\"",
      "\"For years, the Chinese government has sought to build detailed profiles about Americans, where we live and work, who our friends and coworkers are what our interests are and what our vices are,\" she said, citing major data breaches that the U.S. has attributed to China over the last decade, including the hack of the Office of Personnel Management that compromised the personal information of millions of federal employees.",
      "The Supreme Court's TikTok decision",
      "In defending the law before the Supreme Court, the Justice Department pointed to two main national security justifications: countering China's collection of data from TikTok's 170 million U.S. users and its purported ability to manipulate content on the app to further its geopolitical interests.",
      "The Supreme Court's unanimous ruling hinged on the first justification: that China, through the app and its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, can amass vast amounts of information from American users. The justices found that Congress did not violate the First Amendment by taking action to address that threat. Congress, it said, \"had good reason to single out TikTok for special treatment.\"",
      "The court refrained from backing the government's interest in stopping China's purported covert manipulation of content, which the Biden administration had cited as a national security justification for the law.",
      "\"One man's 'covert content manipulation' is another's 'editorial discretion,'\" Gorsuch wrote in an opinion concurring in judgment. \"Journalists, publishers, and speakers of all kinds routinely make less-than-transparent judgments about what stories to tell and how to tell them. Without question, the First Amendment has much to say about the right to make those choices.\"",

      "Jeffrey Fisher, a lawyer who represented TikTok content creators in the app's case before the Supreme Court, also urged President Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland in a letter on Friday to delay implementation of the law.",
      "\"The law is scheduled to go into effect literally on the eve of the inauguration of President-elect Trump, who recently asked the Supreme Court for the same relief because he wants to work on this issue directly,\" Fisher wrote. \"He should be given that chance. Otherwise, the Act would significantly burden the speech rights of over 170 million Americans and would cause substantial and avoidable disruption to the third-party providers that may be subject to severe penalties if they continue to provide TikTok to its millions of users.\"",
      "In a statement late Friday, TikTok said the White House and Justice Department have failed to provide the necessary clarity and assurance to the service providers that are integral to maintaining TikTok's availability to over 170 million Americans.\"",
      "\"Unless the Biden administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19,\" the company added.",
      "The power of TikTok",
      "With 170 million monthly active users, TikTok is a significant moneymaker for millions of small businesses. For Simon, her company's reach on the platform generated enough sales to allow her to build a 2,100 square foot warehouse and to hire a team of employees to help make the company's products. Mississippi Candle surpassed six figures in sales for the first time in November, and again in December, she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I am heartbroken for my staff,\" she said. \"I won't be able to make up for that traffic or sales anywhere else,\" she said. Simon's company has 50,000 followers on TikTok, compared with 7,700 on Facebook and 3,100 on Instagram.",
      "\"So we won't be able to make up that income. We'll have to completely rebuild our community somewhere else, and it will take a lot longer than it did on TikTok,\" Simon added.",
      "Who wins if TikTok exits the U.S.?",
      "Morgan Stanley analysts say that Facebook and Instagram owner Meta stands to benefit from TikTok users migrating to other platforms, writing that the roughly 32 billion hours of annual U.S. consumer time spent on TikTok could soon be up for grabs.",
      "\"Meta remains the largest fundamental winner of any TikTok ban given its already leading user base, data set and distribution,\" the analysts said in a research note. Alphabet-owned YouTube also could benefit as it also lets users create short-form videos.",
      "Still, experts say that none of those apps come close to TikTok in its ability to generate income for brands, advertisers and creators.",
      "\"A ton of people are already flocking to other apps, but there is going to be a ton of damage and loss of revenue,\" Edward Klaris, managing partner at Klaris law, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"There are going to have to find alternative means of speaking, and this ban reduces their presence on a platform where they are already well-established.\"",
      "The parties that stand to lose from TikTok's U.S. operations shutting down range from independent content creators to businesses and advertisers. In the case of companies, TikTok allows them to establish accounts that reach users organically, as well with paid-ads. And popular influencers can make a lucrative living, with brands paying them to hawk their products.",
      "\"Advertisers are engaging in commercial speech to send out messages, influencers are doing commercial speech and businesses are also sharing information. Therefore there is a lot of spend going on,\" Klaris explained.",
      "He agreed that a ban could be good news for competitors like RedNote, another Chinese-owned app.",
      "The ramifications of shutting down TikTok in the U.S. would be wide-reaching for diverse users, according to Jessica Rauchberg, assistant professor of communication technologies at Seton Hall University.",
      "\"It really concerns me for everyday creators, particularly marginalized ones, who might have a disability and not be able to work in person,\" she said. \"TikTok is a great space for users to supplement their incomes with content creation, and when you lose that, where do you go? You can't just rebuild on another platform.\"",
      "\"It's a great way to reach customers, because a lot of younger people use it as a search engine and place to find a great local restaurant or craftsperson who is making special items you can't find at a Target or Walmart,\" Rauchberg added. \"It'll hurt consumers, and for small businesses it's a big tool for outreach. That's why they are scared.\"",

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is\u00a0scheduled to attend, sources told CBS News this week; the online retailer was among the companies that donated $1 million to the fund.",

      "Not surprisingly, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, whom Trump has tapped along with businessman Vivek Ramaswamy to explore ways to cut federal spending, will also appear at the inauguration, CBS News has confirmed.

    "summary": "A law that could ban TikTok in the U.S. is set to take effect on Jan. 19. Here's what that would mean for users of the social media platform.",
    "story": [
      "TikTok faces a\u00a0possible ban in the U.S.\u00a0as soon as Sunday if a law that could require the social media app's Chinese owner, ByteDance, to part ways with the platform takes effect as scheduled on Jan. 19.",
      "The\u00a0Supreme Court on Friday upheld the law, the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, that would\u00a0make it illegal\u00a0for app stores from Google or Apple, as well as web-hosting services, to distribute or service TikTok.",
      "The Biden administration and lawmakers\u00a0say TikTok poses a threat\u00a0to U.S. national security, warning that the Chinese government can use the app to collect information and otherwise snoop on American users of the app. For its part, TikTok and some content creators on the platform argued the law violates their First Amendment rights to free speech.",
      "TikTok could evade a ban if ByteDance agreed to sell its American operations to a U.S. entity. Bloomberg reported\u00a0Tuesday that Elon Musk could have interest in such a deal. Still, Wedbush technology analyst Dan Ives said that he doesn't expect ByteDance to sell TikTok with its algorithm, which is widely considered to be the platform's most valuable feature.",
      "Musk did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "Asked for comment on the possibility of a sale of its U.S. operations to Musk, a spokesperson for TikTok told CBS MoneyWatch, \"We can't be expected to comment on pure fiction.\"",
      "Could I use TikTok after the ban?",
      "TikTok has said it could go dark in the U.S. on Jan. 19.\u00a0But it remains unclear if President-elect Donald Trump, who had\u00a0urged the Supreme Court\u00a0to pause implementation of the law, will intervene and seek a solution once he takes office.",
      "If the law goes into force on Jan. 19, people in the U.S. who have not already downloaded the TikTok app would no longer be able to access it. It will no longer be available for download in app stores, including Apple's and Google's.",
      "For TikTok users who already have the short-form video app on their devices, it remains to be seen what will happen to the app. In one scenario, it will go dark, and users will receive a notice indicating that it's not functional or available to them.",
      "\"They will get a notice that says, 'This service is not available in your country. That's most likely what will happen based on what we've seen in other countries that have banned certain platforms,\" Timothy Edgar, a professor of cybersecurity at Brown University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This generation may be in for a very rude awakening if the law goes into effect and they find a major social media platform that they came to rely on as creators, or just users, is suddenly not available.\"",
      "While such an action would be unprecedented in the U.S., that's been the experience of users of banned apps in other countries, added Edgar, who thinks this is most likely outcome in the U.S.",
      "Other cybersecurity experts say TikTok might not become inaccessible overnight, but rather that the user experience in the U.S. will degrade over time.",
      "\"If you already have TikTok on your phone you can still use it, but over time you will not receive any updates, so the app will become obsolete,\" said Qi Liao, a professor of computer and network security at Central Michigan University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Various issues could arise because TikTok may introduce new features or security patches, and the app in the U.S. will have a sluggish performance as well as security issues. So eventually TikTok users will probably stop using the vulnerable version.\"",
      "Could I access TikTok through a VPN?",
      "Edgar notes that the new law doesn't target users, meaning that even if the ban takes effect it wouldn't be illegal for people to have TikTok on their phones or to try to access the platform.",
      "Indeed, U.S.-based users would likely be able to work around the ban by using a virtual private network to access TikTok. VPNs offer privacy and can make U.S.-based computers appear to internet service providers to be based outside of the country.",
      "Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit focused on digital rights, told CBS MoneyWatch that U.S. TikTok users would likely be able to circumvent the ban via VPN, though that approach does carry risks.",
      "\"Presumably, it would work just fine,\" she said, while warning that \"a lot of free VPNs make money by selling user data.\"",
      "Galperin added that some providers of free VPN services have been known to install malware on users' devices. \"So I would advise people to be very careful about the VPN they choose,\" she said.",
      "Meanwhile, Edgar cautioned that more sophisticated VPNs require time, money and effort to set up.",
      "\"It's not something Americans are used to doing because we haven't experienced our government filtering the internet,\" he said.",
      "What are some TikTok alternatives?",
      "Users looking for a TikTok replacement app do have alternatives, such as YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels.",
      "\"Short-form video content is something people want and they'll continue to find ways to get it,\" Edgar said.",
      "Another substitute is Lemon8, a social media app owned by ByteDance that launched in 2020, although experts note it could be subject to the same law that threatens to ban TikTok in the U.S.",
      "RedNote, a Shanghai-based Chinese language social media app also bears many similarities to TikTok. Called \"Xiaohongshu\" in China, meaning \"little red book\" in Mandarin, it's available for download in app stores in the U.S., and is currently the top social app in Apple's store.",

      "Failure to investigate potential fraud",
      "Peer-to-peer platforms such as Cash App are generally required by law, under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, to investigate disputes of unauthorized transactions. But Cash App customers, many of whom have their bank account linked to the app, were misled by the terms of service to believe that disputes over transactions were the responsibility of their bank, the CFPB said.",
      "In one instance cited in the agency's consent order, Cash App instructed a customer who reported an unauthorized debit card to contact the person's bank, shirking its statutory duty to investigate possible incidents of fraud.",
      "\"In numerous instances, respondent failed to conduct investigations promptly or in some cases at all upon Notices of Error from consumers that provided the required information,\" the CFPB said.",
      "When Block did investigate disputes, it \"used intentionally shoddy investigation practices to close reports of unauthorized transactions in the company's favor,\" the consumer agency added.",
      "Unreachable customer service",
      "Block also made it difficult for Cash App clients to obtain helpful customer service, according to the CFPB.

      "In addition to the $175 million in refunds and fine, the consent order requires Block to provide 24-hour, live-person customer service. It also requires that Block investigate unauthorized transactions promptly and thoroughly as well as \"to provide timely refunds, where appropriate.\"",
      "How do I get my refund?",
      "Block is required to pay a minimum amount of $75 million and up to $120 million in refunds to consumers victimized by fraudulent transactions who did not receive refunds they were entitled to, as well as to those whose unauthorized transfers were not adequately investigated by Cash App. Consumers whose accounts were locked or who were not provided provisional credits during a delayed investigation are also entitled to a refund.",
      "Consumers will not need to take action to obtain a refund, according to the CFPB's latest guidance. The agency said it will enforce the order's requirement to ensure that affected Cash App users receive refunds and other redress.",

    "story": [
      "With the U.S. government's TikTok ban\u00a0set to kick in on Sunday, Americans have been flocking to an alternative social media platform, but it's another Chinese app, and experts say it could present the same, if not even more issues. There's been a surge in U.S. downloads of the Chinese-owned application Xiaohongshu, or \"RedNote\" as many users call it.",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News on Thursday that RedNote, just like TikTok, could face an ultimatum to divest, or be banned.",
      "\"This appears to be the kind of app that the statute would apply to and could face the same restrictions as TikTok if it's not divested,\" a U.S. official told CBS News.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Xiaohongshu for comment as to whether the company would agree with that assessment.",
      "What is RedNote?",
      "Xiaohongshu has been the most downloaded free app on Apple's app store in the U.S. since Tuesday. Analysis by Sensor Tower, a market intelligence firm, showed the platform's downloads in the U.S. had increased 200% year-on-year and seen a 194% uptick since last week.",
      "QR Code Generator, a firm that provides statistics on trends online, said there had been a 4,900% increase in searches on Google for Xiaohongshu in the U.S. on Monday alone.",
      "Xiaohongshu was founded in 2013 and is a lifestyle platform \"where over 300 million users every month share their life experiences,\" according to a description on Apple's app store.",
      "The Chinese photo and video-sharing platform has often been compared to Instagram. It operates as a platform for e-commerce, a manual for tips on travel and fine dining, as well as a vehicle for users to share content from their everyday lives.",
      "Xiaohongshu literally translates from Mandarin to \"little red book,\" likely a reference to the famed little red book of quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong, the founding father of Communist China.",
      "That reference has not put off the many American users who've turned to the app to share their experiences as so-called \"TikTok refugees\" ahead of the U.S. ban. Videos including a use of the \"TikTok refugee\" term on RedNote have racked up millions of views and impressions this week.",
      "\"This is for my fellow TikTok refugees and Americans, behave on this app! You better behave because everyone in China is being so kind to us as we colonize their cutesy tootsy app just because our government sucks,\" one American user account using the name \"Savannah\" posted on Wednesday. The post had gained almost 128,000 impressions by Thursday.",
      "TikTok, in its international form, is not available to users in mainland China, meaning the U.S. exodus to Xiaohongshu has put Americans in closer contact with Chinese users than they ever had been before. It's led to some amusing cultural exchanges.",
      "One American \"TikTok refugee\" with the username \"anieladiaz\" posted a video asking Chinese users if they had any questions. A Chinese user commented under the post with a screenshot of what appeared to be their English homework. Anieladiaz was happy to provide the answers to the test questions, which they shared in their own screenshot. Other Chinese users have been posting videos in which they teach Americans to use Mandarin slang words.",
      "Is RedNote safe?",
      "The rapid rise in U.S. downloads may be cause for concern for the same U.S. lawmakers who ushered in the ban on TikTok. One cybersecurity expert told CBS News that RedNote may actually represent an even greater threat.",
      "\"RedNote was never meant for outside of the China market. All of the data sharing and all the servers to which the data is being shared is in China,\" Adrianus Warmenhoven, a cybersecurity expert at Nord VPN, told CBS News on Wednesday. \"It means they are exempt from all of these data protections and outside of the view of the American government.\"",
      "Warmenhoven said TikTok and its parent company ByteDance had at least stored data in U.S.-based servers, which gave the U.S. government \"some modicum of moderation or limitations on data that can be sent to China and how much and in what way.\"",
      "He also said RedNote's terms and conditions lack transparency, which he said presents a huge cybersecurity risk for Americans.",
      "\"Its terms and conditions are in Mandarin, leaving non-Chinese-speaking users unclear about what data is collected and how it's used,\" Warmenhoven said. \"I'm pretty sure those millions who are moving over are not using Google Translate to read [the terms and conditions] so they don't know what they are agreeing to.\"",
      "The specific U.S. legislation\u00a0used to ban TikTok \u2014 the \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\" which President Biden signed into law last April, grants the federal government broad scope to crack down on foreign social media platforms.",
      "Under the law, Congress can compel a platform to divest its U.S. operations from foreign ownership, and it can be shut down if it qualifies as a threat. The law can apply to any platform that allows users to share content with each other and has more than 1 million monthly active users, is owned by a company located in a foreign adversary-controlled country, and has been determined by the president to present a significant national security threat.",
      "The legislation is currently subject to a legal challenge by ByteDance, which has argued that it's unconstitutional and violates the first amendment protecting free speech. A ruling from the Supreme Court is pending\u00a0in that case.",
      "CBS News has asked President-elect Donald Trump's transition team whether the incoming administration might deem RedNote a national security threat that should be subject to the law. The transition team had not responded by the time of the publication of this article.",
      "Trump has spoken out recently against the TikTok ban. Last month, he said he had a \"warm spot in my heart\" for TikTok \u2013 a reversal from his stance when he last occupied the Oval Office.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission, the agency tasked with enforcing the ban and ensuring that internet service providers in the U.S. and app store companies such as Apple and Google comply with the law, declined to comment.",
      "RedNote is heavily censored",

    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 17:00:24 -0500",
    "summary": "Elon Musk claims the U.S. needs a pipeline of foreign employees working on H-1B visas because the country lacks skilled engineers. Here's what the data shows.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk sparked fierce online debate recently when the billionaire said on social media that the U.S. lacks enough top engineers, pointing to immigration as the solution to what he characterized as a dearth of technical expertise.",
      "\"There is a dire shortage of extremely talented and motivated engineers in America,\" Musk posted on his social media platform, X, comparing tech companies to a pro sports team scouting players. \"If you force the world's best talent to play for the other side, America will LOSE.\"",
      "The claims are at the center of a divide between supporters of President-elect Donald Trump, who tend to take a hard line against immigration, and technology entrepreneurs like Musk, who along with X runs exploration company SpaceX and electric vehicle maker Tesla, both of which employ many foreign workers hired with H-1B visas.",
      "Yet labor market data suggests that American tech workers aren't in short supply, and critics of the H-1B program say it displaces Americans in favor of foreign-born employees hired at lower salaries. Proponents of recruiting skilled workers from abroad say tech jobs aren't zero-sum, while hiring foreigners with specialized skills can spur innovation and ultimately create more jobs for U.S.-born workers.",
      "Data from the National Center for Education Statistics shows that the number of bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in computer science and in engineering conferred in the U.S. reached their highest levels in the 2020-21 and 2021-22 academic years since 1970-71.",
      "Meanwhile, tech and engineering jobs in the U.S. are expected to grow by 7% by 2033, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The share of the science and engineering workforce that is foreign-born has grown over the past three decades, according to the National Science Foundation, while STEM workers have experienced some of the highest employment rates of any occupation over the past five years.",
      "Companies with the most H-1B workers",
      "Tech companies are some of the biggest beneficiaries of the H-1B program, which is intended to allow highly skilled foreigners to work in the U.S. Amazon received the most H1-B visas of any company in 2024, Department of Labor data shows. Microsoft, Google and Meta were also in the top 10, while Tesla now ranks No. 16, according to the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan think tank focused on trade and immigration issues.",
      "More H-1Bs visas were granted to software developers last year than for any other position.",
      "\"The H-1B visa is like the Swiss Army knife of visas. It's used for a lot of different purposes,\" said John Skrentny, a sociology professor at U.C. San Diego who wrote a book on why STEM graduates choose careers outside of the fields they studied. \"If you hear people say that the H-1B visa is very important for attracting the best and brightest to the United States, they are correct. At the same time, the H-1B visa is used for cheap labor.\"",
      "Investigations including by 60 Minutes and The New York Times have found that some companies have laid off American workers and then replaced them with H-1B hires, sometimes even requiring displaced employees to train their replacements in order to receive their severance packages.",
      "Some of the roles H-1B workers are hired to fill also involve less complicated jobs, like product testing, said Ronil Hira, an associate political science professor at Howard University and a research associate with the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. These roles don't necessarily meet the visa program's intended goal of outsourcing roles that require unique skills.",
      "In addition to Big Tech companies, consulting firms like Cognizant, Tata and Infosys are also among the largest recipients of H-1B visas, providing tech companies with a steady pipeline of highly educated, well-trained employees willing to work on contract.",
      "These companies are incentivized to find employees that will accept lower pay, Hira said.",
      "\"Their business model is to resell labor. If you're reselling labor, the way you become competitive is by having lower labor costs.\"",
      "A boost to innovation?",
      "Still, evidence of the H-1B program's broader impact on employment in the U.S. is mixed. One\u00a0study from the IZA Institute of Labor Economics found that the average employer that receives H-1B visas isn't displacing American workers. The research firm found that while companies that received the visas initially did hire more foreign-born workers in response, they also typically experienced growing revenue and were eventually able to hire additional workers.",
      "The effects were greater for smaller employers that only applied for a few visas, the study showed.",
      "\"Most of our results are driven by smaller firms because they're the ones for whom the lottery really matters,\" said Parag Mahajan, one of the study's authors and an assistant economics professor at the University of Delaware. For those companies, he said, \"There is a lot of value to looking elsewhere for talent.\"",
      "Mahajan's study also found that for some companies, hiring a foreign worker on an H-1B visa eventually created jobs for American-born workers because the person's skills can help the company grow.",
      "But some economists, including Hira, take issue with the claim that foreign workers are needed to fill a nationwide shortage in talented engineers.",
      "When there's a shortage of workers for a particular role, wages in that sector rise, Hira said, the same way gas prices go up when oil supplies drop. But labor market data shows that wages in the tech industry have remained relatively stable.",
      "Median weekly earnings in computer and mathematics roles have grown by 0.27% from 2019 to 2023, after being adjusted for inflation, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows. In engineering and architecture roles, wages have declined by 3.53% over the same timeframe.",
      "More firing than hiring",
      "Tech companies have also laid off hundreds of employees in recent years while continuing to sponsor new H-1B visas. An analysis by the Economic Policy Institute found that the top 30 companies hiring the most H-1B workers hired 34,000 new H-1B employees in 2022 but laid off at least 85,000 workers that year and in early 2023.",
      "The layoffs mirror a decline in available jobs in the industry. Job postings in software development on Indeed.com are 67% of what they were in February 2020, according to the job board platform.",
      "How the debate around H-1Bs will translate to policy after Trump takes office is unclear. In his first term, he issued an executive order, dubbed \"Buy American and Hire American,\" aimed at supporting U.S. manufacturing. The order also directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to the H-1B program to restrict it only to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants.",
      "But in an interview with The New York Post last month, Trump called H-1B visas a \"great program.\" Musk, who has become a close adviser to the president-elect, said he would \"go to war on this issue\" in one X post.",
      "\"I've always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas,\" Trump said. \"That's why we have them.\"",

    "title": "Biden administration proposes new restrictions on AI chip exports",
    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 08:13:05 -0500",
    "summary": "The proposal is raising concerns with the chip industry, with artificial intelligence leader Nvidia calling it \"misguided.\"",
    "story": [
      "The Biden administration is proposing new restrictions that would limit the export of advanced computer chips used to develop artificial intelligence, part of an effort to preserve America's six- to 18-month advantage on AI over rivals such as China.",
      "Proposed Monday, the framework is raising concerns of chip industry executives who say the rules would limit access to existing chips used for video games and restrict in 120 countries the chips used for data centers and AI products. Mexico, Portugal, Israel and Switzerland are among the nations that could have limited access.",
      "Chip giant Nvidia on Monday called\u00a0the proposal \"misguided,\" and said that it \"threatens to derail innovation and economic growth worldwide.\"",
      "On a call with reporters previewing the framework, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said that it's \"critical\" to preserve America's leadership in AI and the development of AI-related computer chips. The fast-evolving AI technology enables computers to produce novels, make scientific research breakthroughs, automate driving and foster a range of other transformations that could reshape economies and warfare.",
      "\"As AI becomes more powerful, the risks to our national security become even more intense,\" Raimondo said. The framework \"is designed to safeguard the most advanced AI technology and ensure that it stays out of the hands of our foreign adversaries but also enabling the broad diffusion and sharing of the benefits with partner countries.\"",
      "White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan stressed that the framework would ensure that the most cutting-edge aspects of AI would be developed within the United States and with its closest allies, instead of possibly getting offshored such as the battery and renewable energy sectors.",
      "Government officials said they felt they needed to act quickly to preserve U.S. companies' advantage over China and other nations, an edge that could be easily eroded if competitors could stockpile chips and make further gains.",
      "AI-enhanced technology is forecast to help fuel growth and boost corporate productivity, with Wedbush analyst Dan Ives calling the tech developments a \"once in a generation 4th Industrial Revolution\" in a recent research note.",
      "Risks to AI leadership?",
      "A tech industry group, the Information Technology Industry Council, warned Raimondo in a letter last week that a hastily implemented new rule from the Democratic administration could fragment global supply chains and put U.S. companies at a disadvantage.",
      "\"While we share the U.S. government's commitment to national and economic security, the rule's potential risks to U.S. global leadership in AI cannot be emphasized enough,\" said a statement from Naomi Wilson, the group's senior vice president for Asia and global trade policy. She called for a more extensive consultation with the tech industry.",
      "One industry executive, who is familiar with the framework and insisted on anonymity to discuss it, said the proposed restrictions would limit access to chips already used for video games, despite claims made otherwise by the government. The executive said it would also limit which companies could build data centers abroad.",
      "Nvidia bashes proposal",
      "Because the framework includes a 120-day comment period, the incoming Republican administration of President-elect Donald Trump could ultimately determine the rules for the sales abroad of advanced computer chips. This sets up a scenario in which Trump will have to balance economic interests with the need to keep the United States and its allies safe.",
      "Ned Finkle, vice president of external affairs at Nvidia, said in a statement that the prior Trump administration had helped create the foundation for AI's development and that the proposed framework would hurt innovation without achieving the stated national security goals.",
      "\"While cloaked in the guise of an 'anti-China' measure, these rules would do nothing to enhance U.S. security,\" he said. \"The new rules would control technology worldwide, including technology that is already widely available in mainstream gaming PCs and consumer hardware.\"",
      "Under the framework, roughly 20 key allies and partners would face no restrictions on accessing chips, but other countries would face caps on the chips they could import, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House.",
      "Nations without restrictions",
      "The allies without restrictions include Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Republic of Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.",
      "Users outside of these close allies could purchase up to 50,000 graphics processing units per country. There would also be government-to-government deals which could bump up the cap to 100,000 if their renewable energy and technological security goals are aligned with the U.S.",
      "Institutions in certain countries could also apply for a legal status that would let them purchase up to 320,000 advanced graphics processing units over two years. Still, there would be limits as to how much AI computational capacity could be placed abroad by companies and other institutions.",
      "Also, computer chip orders equivalent to 1,700 advanced graphics processing units would not need a license to import or count against the national chip cap, among the other standards set by the framework. The exception for the 1,700 graphics processing units would likely help to meet the orders for universities and medical institutions, as opposed to data centers.",

Biden got more federal judges confirmed than any president in a single term (save Jimmy Carter). His steadfast support for Ukraine and NATO expansion, at a time of creeping autocracy in Europe, was heroic.",

He appointed an attorney general, Merrick Garland, whose painstaking scrupulousness delayed, and ultimately doomed, the DOJ's prosecution of Donald Trump. Furthermore, Biden undermined his own credibility by pardoning his son after repeatedly vowing not to.",

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump vowed to issue an executive order on Monday to postpone the ban on TikTok from going into effect.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump vowed Sunday to issue an executive order to restore TikTok after app owner ByteDance voluntarily shut down service in the U.S. just hours before a Sunday deadline, cutting off access to tens of millions of users after the Supreme Court this week\u00a0upheld a law that effectively banned it over concerns about its ties to China.",
      "The law passed by Congress last year gave TikTok's Chinese parent company ByteDance until Jan. 19 to divest from TikTok or be cut off from U.S. app stores and hosting services. TikTok said a sale wasn't possible and challenged the law in court, but it was rejected by a unanimous Supreme Court on Friday.",
      "Trump on Sunday posted on social media that he would restore TikTok, first writing \"SAVE TIKTOK\" and then vowing to issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before the law takes effect. Further, he said there would be no liability for companies that helped keep TikTok from going dark before the order went into effect.",
      "\"Americans deserve to see our exciting Inauguration on Monday, as well as other events and conversations,\" he wrote.\u00a0 \"I would like the United States to have a 50% ownership position in a joint venture.\u00a0 By doing this, we save TikTok, keep it in good hands and allow it to say up.\u00a0 Without U.S. approval, there is no Tik Tok.\u00a0 With our approval, it is worth hundreds of billions of dollars - maybe trillions.\"",
      "The court's decision said the\u00a0divest-or-ban law\u00a0does not violate the free speech rights of TikTok or its 170 million users in the U.S., agreeing with the government's position that the platform could be used by China to collect a vast amount of sensitive information on Americans.",
      "While the Biden administration said enforcement of the law would be left to the incoming Trump administration, the company itself took itself offline shortly before Sunday's midnight deadline.",
      "Users in the U.S. who opened the app late Saturday night were greeted with a message with the headline, \"Sorry, TikTok isn't available right now.\"",
      "\"A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S.,\" the message reads. \"Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned!\"",
      "The app was also no longer available in the Apple or Google Play stores. CBS News has reached out to TikTok for comment.",
      "Trump's incoming national security adviser, Mike Waltz, told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that the president-elect had spoken to Chinese President Xi Jinping and \"they agreed to work together on this.\"",
      "\"We can have an app that protects Americans,\" Waltz said. \"And I could tell you, I wouldn't want the FBI or the U.S. government monitoring every keystroke or seeing every password, nor would we want the Chinese Communist Party. But we also want an app that 170 million Americans clearly really enjoy and that we were able to get our message out during the Trump campaign in a very powerful way.\"",
      "TikTok had said Friday it would \"be forced to go dark\" beginning Sunday unless the Biden administration assured service providers that the law would not be enforced. The White House called the appeal \"a stunt\" and said the company should bring up its concerns with the Trump administration.",
      "\"We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump Administration takes office on Monday,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said.",
      "Internationally on Sunday, the TikTok app remained accessible, and there was no indication for international users that it had gone dark in the U.S. It was still possible to view and interact with American accounts, and there was no obvious official signposting that U.S. users' access had been restricted.",
      "Even if President-elect Trump declines to enforce the ban, the law would still be on the books, and companies like Apple and Google could be penalized down the road for violations. Trump previously vowed to \"save\" TikTok, and said Saturday that he was considering an option to extend the deadline for the law to go into effect.",
      "\"The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it's appropriate,\" he said in the phone interview, adding, \"if I decide to do that, I'll probably announce it on Monday.\"",
      "The law includes a provision that allows for a short-term extension if there is a sale in progress.",
      "During Supreme Court arguments on Jan. 10, Noel Francisco, a lawyer for TikTok, warned that the platform would shut down when the law went into effect, explaining that it would be \"extraordinarily difficult\" for a divestiture to occur under any timeline because the Chinese government opposes a sale of the algorithm that powers the platform by tailoring video recommendations to each user.",
      "\"As I understand it, we go dark,\" Francisco said.",
      "But even if there is an eventual sale that did not include TikTok's algorithm, it would take \"many years\" for a new team of engineers to rebuild it and it would be a \"fundamentally different platform,\" according to Francisco. He said the company's inability to share any user data with ByteDance under the law would cut off American users from viewing content from other parts of the world and vice versa.",
      "The bipartisan law was tucked into a foreign assistance package that swiftly passed Congress and was signed by President Biden last April. TikTok and ByteDance challenged the law the next month, calling it \"an extraordinary and unconstitutional assertion of power\" based on \"speculative and analytically flawed concerns about data security and content manipulation\" that would suppress the speech of millions of Americans.",
      "In a December ruling, a federal appeals court upheld the statute, saying the U.S. government \"acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary's ability to gather data on people in the United States.\" The appeals court later denied TikTok's bid to delay the law from taking effect, pending a Supreme Court review.",
      "The Supreme Court moved with extraordinary speed to take up the case after TikTok requested the justices order a temporary pause. The court issued its opinion a week after hearing arguments and two days before the law took effect.",
      "\"There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community. But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok's data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary,\" the court's opinion said.",
      "The justices cited Congress' finding that companies can be required to turn over data to the Chinese government under Chinese law.",
      "\"The government had good reason to single out TikTok,\" the court said.",
      "Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar noted during arguments that there's \"nothing permanent or irrevocable that happens\" on Sunday. The law provides the authority for the restrictions to be lifted on TikTok if there is a sale after the date.",
      "\"Congress expected we might see something like a game of chicken. ByteDance saying, we can't do it, China will never let us do it. But when push comes to shove and these restrictions take effect, I think it will fundamentally change the landscape with respect to what ByteDance is willing to consider,\" Prelogar said.",
      "In a video statement after the Supreme Court issued its decision, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew appeared confident that the app would have a future under Trump. He thanked the incoming president for his commitment to finding a solution that would allow TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. \"for years to come.\"",
      "Trump, who tried to ban TikTok during his first term over national security concerns, said Friday that he spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok. A Chinese summary of the call did not mention that it was a topic of discussion.",
      "Barring a sale or Congress overturning the law, there's no long-term certainty about TikTok's future in the U.S. If Trump or a future president declines to enforce the law, companies like Apple and Google could still face steep fines in the future.",
      "\"On the 19th, if it doesn't shut down, there is a violation of law, correct?\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked Prelogar, who said, \"Yes.\"",
      "\"And whatever the new president does, doesn't change that reality for these companies,\" Sotomayor continued, referring to the penalties facing app stores and web hosting services.",

      "The monster that roared through L.A. County last week is still alive \u2013 but firefighters seem to have it cornered. People have started returning to their homes, or what's left of them. Insurance, if they had it, is a whole other battle.",
      "The focus now is turning from what happened to why it happened, and what in the world is next? \u00a0 This disaster is as bad as just about anybody here can remember \u2026 but is it really just the new normal?",
      "John Vaillant, author of \"Fire Weather: On the Front Lines of a Burning World,\" said, \"Nature is telling us, 'I can't take this anymore. I cannot support you if you keep treating me this way.'\"",
      "Vaillant says climate change is making disasters like the wind-driven L.A. fires even fiercer. \"We can expect fires of this intensity, and worse, in the future,\" he said. \"The types of fires we've seen over the past ten years are qualitatively different from the previous hundred years.\"",
      "\"The types of fires are different?\" I asked. \"How has fire changed?\"",
      "\"In a number of ways. The most potent and frightening way, the most obvious to the layperson, people like us, is it moves faster and with greater intensity. When you talk to any firefighter with any sense of history, they are seeing different [fire] behavior that is, in many cases, un-fightable.\"",
      "And Vaillant says the cause is something science has been telling us for decades: the CO2 that our combustion engines keep pumping into the atmosphere. \"We don't feel it; we don't smell it; we don't notice it,\" he said. \"But if you were to take the car engine that brought me here and set it up on the floor here and fired it up, we would go deaf, and then we would die from its emissions.\u00a0 And that's under the hood of every internal combustion engine car. And there are hundreds of millions of them. So, the emissions from fire, these trillions of fires that we make every day, has created this artificially warm climate.\"",
      "And so, he says, we get more intense fires \u2026 stronger hurricanes \u2026 and hotter heatwaves.",

And the California fires were a disaster for him as well; his old house in Altadena, and his friends' homes, all burned to the ground. He said, \"I am hopeful that, if there's a silver lining to this tragedy, it's that, you know, the public will wake up and get angry and say, 'We need to do something about this.

      "Scientists like Kalmus have been warning the world about impending climate disaster for years now. But on January 6, as the fire closed in on Altadena, perhaps the most effective warning came from an amateur meteorologist.",
      "Edgar McGregor has been picking up trash in Altadena every day for more than five years. He's also into meteorology, and runs a Facebook page about weather. Days before the fires even started, he warned his Facebook followers about dangerous conditions, and on January 6, he posted a video telling them to drop everything and get out of town.",
      "\"I said, 'Get out,'\" McGregor explained. \"I stood in the middle of my street at home, filmed myself with the mountains on fire behind me and told people, 'This is serious. Get your Social Security cards. Get the deed to your home. Get out. Like, this is the Big One. I'm not joking around. This is not gonna blow over.'\"",
      "Jenn Siebert, an Altadena mother of two, didn't need to hear that twice. \"I think he, well, he definitely saved my family's lives,\" she said. \"We all listened to him. We were like, 'This kid knows what he's talking about!'\"",
      "Her own house somehow survived; her neighbors weren't so lucky. \"My best friends, like, they've lost everything,\" Siebert said. \"They're alive, because, probably because of Edgar, I would imagine. Everybody in the Beautiful Altadena group is alive because of Edgar, right now.\"",
      "Siebert, who had never met McGregor in person, embraced him when she was introduced. \"I'm so appreciative of you,\" she said. \"You saved my family and you saved so many people. So, thank you.\"",
      "The fires, experts say, are a warning on a much bigger scale, that the Earth will continue to get drier and more volatile unless we do something about climate change. But of course, warnings only work when people listen.",
      "I asked Vaillant, \"Have we just pushed Nature too far?\"",
      "\"The upside to all of this is, Nature is inviting us, sternly, to reengage,\" he replied. \"It's only going to get hotter. And so, Nature is saying, 'Wake up! We are in this together.' It behooves all of us to focus on the real causes, and to understand that this really can happen to us, to us, to you and to me, not just to people we know, or people on TV.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 19 Jan 2025 09:46:24 -0500",
    "summary": "Socialite Perle Mesta used her fortune to host inclusive dinner parties in Washington, D.C., becoming one of the most famous women in the world \u2013 \"The Hostess with the Mostes' on the Ball.\"",
    "story": [
      "In \"Call Me Madam,\" the 1953 movie version of Irving Berlin's hit musical, it was no secret that Ethel Merman was channeling a real person \u2013 a wealthy widow by the name of Perle Mesta, who, in the 1940s and '50s, was one of the best-known women in America.",
      "\"I was astonished,\" said biographer Meryl Gordon. \"There were four or five thousand newspaper stories about her a year.\"",
      "Astonishing, says Gordon, because Mesta was known mainly as a hostess who gave dazzling parties in the nation's capital, mixing power brokers from both sides of the political aisle, with Hollywood and Broadway stars, and even members of the Supreme Court.",
      "As Merman sang:",
      "I'm the chosen party giver for the White House clienteleAnd they know that I deliver what it takes to make 'em jellAnd in Washington I'm known by one and allAs the hostess with the mostes' on the ball",
      "Gordon says, in the 1940s and '50s, Perle Mesta was \"the woman who knew everyone\" (the title of her new book). She said Mesta bought her way into society in Washington: \"But she was also smart about it. Perle figured out how to make friends with the right people. 'I'm having a couple senators over, maybe you'd like to join us?'",
      "\"She made herself very popular.\"",
      "She was born Pearl Skirvan. Her father, an oil man and real estate developer, made and lost several fortunes in Oklahoma. Perle moved to Pittsburgh after marrying George Mesta, a steel magnate, and when he died in 1925, he left Perle (then in her mid-thirties) a fortune that today would be worth more than $260 million.",
      "She spent that fortune to Washington, D.C., making herself famous, says Marie Ridder, a conservationist and retired journalist. \"She was known as the social queen of Washington.\"",
      "Ridder was 20 years old when she attended her first Perle Mesta party. \"She invited me to a party because she wanted press coverage,\" Ridder said. \"No other reason, not 'cause she thought I was charming or anything. No, it was the press badge she cared about.\"",
      "I asked, \"Why did she want reporters there?\"",
      "\"She wanted to be known. Come on!\" laughed Ridder.",
      "Sally Quinn, who covered events like Mesta's as a style section reporter for the Washington Post, called her a phenomenon. \"I've never met anybody like Perle Mesta, and I've never heard of anybody like her,\" she said.",
      "Quinn says Mesta instinctively knew that work in Washington wasn't just conducted in the halls of Congress: \"You sit next to somebody at dinner, you know that, if you've been trying to get them on the phone \u2013 if they're at the White House, or the journalist trying to get them on the phone \u2013 [and] you can't, the next day, you'll be able to call and get them on the phone.\"",
      "By the late '40s, Mesta had become as famous as many of her guests. She inspired a \"Playhouse 90\" production, \"The Hostess with the Mostes',\" with Shirley Booth in the lead role. Mesta was even featured on the cover of Time Magazine.",
      "The coverage, however, wasn't always kind, describing her in ways (such as her \"more than ample bulk\") that would never be used for a male. \"It was surprisingly cruel, and I'm not really sure why,\" said Gordon. \"It was almost like people were trying to take her down a notch.\"",
      "But what made Mesta such a power in Washington was her uncanny ability to recognize political talent before others did: Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower and Lyndon Johnson were all early guests at her home. \"She had a real nose for who was going to be powerful,\" said Quinn. \"She was all over them long before they were who they were.\"",
      "In 1949, after Harry Truman was elected president, he rewarded Mesta by naming her envoy to Luxembourg. That's how \"Madame Mesta\" inspired the hit musical. But the appointment didn't go down as well at the State Department. \"She was belittled; she was cut out of meetings,\" said Gordon.",
      "Mesta described the difficulties she faced on an interview program that aired on CBS at the time. Asked \"Have you found being a woman a handicap in performing your ministerial duties?,\" Mesta replied, \"To a certain extent it's a handicap, because we have to prove ourselves. And we have to prove that we can do a job. I think maybe we have to work just a little bit harder than the men do.\"",
      "Still, Mesta thrived in the post, continuing to give parties, including a monthly event for American GIs based in Europe. \"This went on for four years,\" said Gordon. \"She estimated that 25,000 people, soldiers came to her parties.\"",
      "Gordon says that, only when researching her new biography, did she realize what the hostess managed to accomplish behind the scenes. Perle Mesta, a staunch feminist and believer in civil rights, broke barriers in 1949 by insisting that Truman's inaugural balls be integrated. \"She made an enormous effort to be inclusive at her parties, at parties she organized for Democrats, at a period which many people weren't comfortable having Black folks to their homes,\" Gordon said. \"And she did that. And it was leading by example. She wasn't a civil rights crusader. It's just that these were her friends, and she wanted them to be part of her life.\"",
      "Mesta's star began to fade during the Kennedy years. Ridder said, \"I guess many people took her seriously. I think my age group didn't.\"",
      "She died in 1975 at 92 years old. No one since, says Quinn, has taken her place. \"I don't think Washington could handle a Perle Mesta today,\" she said.",
      "Quinn doubts that, in the current environment, anyone could pull off what Mesta once did so brilliantly: getting Democrats and Republicans to sit down at a dinner table and see eye-to-eye. Are we missing out on something, not having that? \"Oh, terribly,\" said Quinn. \"It's just awful. It's awful that people can't get together and talk.\"",

      "Joe Biden's inauguration four years ago took place just two weeks after rioters stormed the Capitol to disrupt the certification of his victory. When Biden's presidency began with his exhortation that \"democracy has prevailed,\" few imagined it would end like this: being succeeded by a man who, Biden warned, \"will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation.\"",
      "\"When Joe Biden came into office, he said that he was going to defend democracy against autocracy,\" said Atlantic staff writer Franklin Foer. \"That was Job #1 for him. And everybody knew what he meant.\"",
      "Foer wrote a book about President Biden's first two years in office, titled \"The Last Politician.\" What did he mean by that? \"I was thinking about the way in which our politics is this war of attrition between these two sides that despise one another,\" said Foer.",

    "summary": "As Trump returns to White House, many expect lower prices, good economy. Fewer would buy Greenland. Democrats are concerned, exhausted by politics.",
    "story": [
      "A majority of Americans are optimistic about the next four years with Donald Trump, even more so than they were in 2017 before his first term. And most are hopeful about the coming year.",
      "That's bolstered by Americans' expectations for a good economy in 2025 \u2014 higher than they currently rate it \u2014 along with wide belief among his voters that Trump will bring down grocery prices, make them financially better off and bring more peace and stability to the world.",
      "It all echoes many of the reasons Trump won in the first place.",
      "In this hyper-partisan era, though, optimism for incoming presidents isn't quite as high as it once was. For Carter and Reagan, both Bushes, Clinton and Obama, CBS News polling at the time showed higher optimism than either Joe Biden in 2021 or Donald Trump today enjoys. That's largely because these days, opposing partisans are less likely to express positivity.",
      "Just as economic views and inflation propelled Trump to a win, today many Americans \u2014 especially Trump's voters \u2014 expect to be financially better off.",
      "And just as inflation and the economy were top issues in the election, they are far and away the top things they want Trump to prioritize now.",
      "Americans are more hopeful about the coming year generally than they were at the start of 2021, when the pandemic was still going on.",
      "Looking overseas, more think Trump will increase peace and stability in the world than decrease it, and specifically, decrease conflict between Israel and its neighbors in the Middle East.",
      "(In contrast, just over half look back now and say Mr. Biden's policies created more conflict there.)",
      "Other potential policy ideas",
      "Most Americans are in favor of deportations of immigrants who are in the country illegally, as voters were during the campaign, though not of using the military to carry out deportations.",
      "On a number of other potential policy ideas, things are more split. Ending birthright citizenship is not widely popular, and it only divides Trump voters.",
      "People are not sold on the idea of buying Greenland. Most Trump voters would approve of it, but not universally, and it's not a popular idea beyond that.",
      "It does shed an important light on how Americans think Trump thinks, though: many of them feel he's just leveraging for a larger negotiation.",
      "On imposing tariffs on imported goods, Trump's voters overwhelmingly favor the idea (even though they don't necessarily think this will bring down prices), while a slight majority of Americans overall are opposed.",
      "The idea of ending or reducing DEI programs is strongly supported by his voters; the rest of the country is more split.",
      "Looking ahead: Democrats and opposition",
      "Still, most Americans say they are concerned about the state of U.S. politics right now, and that concern is highest among Democrats, whose ranks don't look especially activated right now.",
      "Many Democrats describe themselves as \"demoralized,\" along with being \"exhausted\" and \"concerned\" about U.S. politics when asked to choose descriptors. Few say they're even \"interested.\" Even fewer say they're \"motivated.\"",
      "They're roughly split over whether they want congressional Democrats to find common ground or oppose Trump at every turn now; the most liberal are the most opposed. And then they have some \u2014 though not a lot \u2014 of confidence that their congressional leadership can effectively oppose Trump when they disagree.",
      "There's also some sense among them of missed opportunity as Mr. Biden departs: just over half think Harris could have won if Mr. Biden had stepped aside sooner.",
      "Biden, meanwhile, exits with Americans evaluating his presidency as low as they ever have during his term.",
      "Looking ahead along other demographic lines, some of Americans' outlook for the Trump administration follows some of the contours of what happened in November.",
      "Trump made gains over 2020 with younger voters, and today, young Americans are more likely to voice optimism about him than are older Americans. (They're also just generally more likely to voice optimism whenever asked to look ahead.) Trump did better with men and made gains with women, and today both are optimistic, men especially so.",
      "Today, almost a quarter of the voters who backed Kamala Harris are optimistic now about the next four years with Trump, reflecting perhaps some willingness for them to reevaluate him once he takes office, something we often see with a losing candidate's supporters, at least early on.",
      "In all, more Americans are pulling for the new administration to succeed, compared to very few for it to fail. The ratio is far higher for desired success. This is similar to how it was for Joe Biden four years ago, too. And then for many, they say it simply depends on what Trump tries to do.",

    "summary": "The CBP One app allows migrants in certain parts of Mexico to request a time to be processed by American immigration officials at legal border entry points, also known as ports of entry.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Approximately 270,000 migrants are estimated to be waiting on the Mexican side of the U.S.-Mexico border, hoping to get an appointment to enter the U.S. through a system that President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to end, according to government figures obtained by CBS News.",
      "U.S. Customs and Border Protection estimates that around 270,000 migrants in Mexico are trying to get an appointment distributed by a government app known as CBP One, which the Biden administration has converted into the main gateway to the American asylum system.",
      "Now, those migrants, many of whom are from countries outside of Mexico like crisis-stricken Haiti and Venezuela, are at risk of abruptly losing their ability to enter the U.S. Both Trump and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, his nominee to lead the Department of Homeland Security, have vowed to shut down CBP One.",
      "The app allows migrants in certain parts of Mexico to request a time to be processed by American immigration officials at legal border entry points, also known as ports of entry. The Biden administration set up the process as part of a broader effort to discourage illegal immigration by offering migrants legal channels to come to the U.S. Those admitted into the U.S. under the system are allowed to apply for work permits, as well as asylum in immigration courts near their respective destinations.",
      "As of Jan. 16, nearly 919,000 migrants had been allowed into the U.S. through the CBP One app process, which was established in January 2023, according to an internal government report obtained by CBS News. It's unclear what the incoming administration's plans are for those already admitted through the app, though those with pending asylum requests won't be deportable unless they lose their cases.",
      "Demand for CBP One appointments has been extraordinarily high, far exceeding the daily cap of 1,450 the Biden administration placed on appointments. Over the past two years, migrants have attempted to secure an appointment over 166 million times, logging into the app again and again to try their luck, the internal report shows.\u00a0 Wait times typically extend for months due to the high demand.",
      "Because appointments are distributed 21 days in advance of entry dates, roughly 30,000 migrants are currently scheduled to enter the U.S. under the CBP One system in the next three weeks. Appointments have been scheduled through early February, well into the incoming administration.",
      "It's unclear if the Trump administration will honor those appointments. Even if CBP One is terminated, any effort to stop processing migrants at ports of entry would face legal challenges as federal courts have ruled that U.S. refugee law requires officials to process some asylum claimants at these entry points.",
      "Outgoing Biden administration officials warned that terminating CBP One could prompt some of those waiting for an appointment to cross into the U.S. illegally, potentially upending the current four-year-low in illegal border crossings.",
      "During its first three years, the Biden administration struggled to contain an unprecedented wave of illegal immigration, with CBP processing record numbers of migrants. But unlawful border entries plunged in 2024, mainly due to enhanced efforts by Mexico to prevent migrants from reaching the U.S. and a move by President Biden in June to severely restrict asylum.",
      "A spike in illegal crossings that some experts predicted before Trump's inauguration never materialized. In fact, Border Patrol is on track to record fewer than 35,000 apprehensions of migrants in January, the lowest level since June 2020, when the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic led to a dramatic drop in migration.",
      "Internal Border Patrol figures show the agency has averaged just over 1,000 daily apprehensions in January, a nearly 90% drop from the record-setting month of December 2023, when an average of more than 8,000 migrants crossed in the U.S. illegally each day.",
      "Illegal border crossings have decreased so sharply that the deactivation trigger for Mr. Biden's asylum restrictions is set to be reached next week, two U.S. officials told CBS News. By its own terms, the policy would be gradually deactivated when the average of daily illegal crossings stays below 1,500 for 28 days. The rule, however, could be scrapped or modified by Trump's administration.",
      "Andrea Flores, who worked on immigration policy at the White House during Mr. Biden's first year in office, said migrants \"will likely have no choice but to make an unauthorized crossing\" if the CBP One process is halted.",
      "\"Numbers may be low at the border, but it is a completely unsustainable situation that remains completely reliant on Mexico to maintain,\" said Flores, who is now vice president for policy at FWD.US, a group that supports liberal immigration policies.",
      "Trump's transition team did not respond to questions about CBP One, including whether officials are concerned that ending the system could fuel an increase in unlawful border crossings.",
      "Trump has vowed to move quickly and aggressively on reshaping federal immigration policy once he's sworn in on Monday, pledging to launch mass deportations and undo Biden administration policies.",
      "Other Biden-era immigration programs in Trump's crosshairs include an initiative that allows citizens of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela to fly to the U.S. if they have American sponsors. The policy, known as CHNV, was also designed to reduce illegal immigration from these countries.",
      "Officials have admitted roughly 532,000 migrants under the CHNV program, but their fate is unclear as the Biden administration declined to extend their two-year permits to be in the U.S., and Trump officials have talked about ending the policy.",
      "Mexico's government agreed to accept some non-Mexican deportees, including Venezuelans, from American authorities on the condition that the U.S. would accept migrants under the CHNV initiative. Mexico has not yet said how the program's potential end would affect that arrangement.",
      "The incoming administration will also need Mexico's cooperation to fulfill one of its campaign promises: reinstating the so-called Remain-in-Mexico policy that required migrants to await their asylum cases outside of the U.S.",
      "Matthew Hudak, a longtime senior Border Patrol official who retired last year, said he was not \"necessarily a fan\" of CBP One when it was created, but noted the policy has had some \"value\" in the form of dissuading people from entering the U.S. illegally through the Rio Grande or other parts of the border.",
      "But Hudak said the incoming administration should make the criteria for being allowed into the country through CBP One \"more stringent.\" He said Trump officials should assemble their own policy scheme at the border before the spring, when migration has historically increased.",
      "\"Now is the window of time,\" Hudak said, \" in which (the Trump) administration has the opportunity to establish consequences, to put things into place that can send the message that then, ultimately, becomes a deterrent factor in people deciding to make that illegal entry.\"",

      "The story began on Jan. 14, 2009. Melissa, then 22, was working as a teacher's assistant at the Minee Subee day care in Lincolnshire, an affluent suburb of Chicago. Ben Kingan attended day care there along with his twin sister and their two older siblings.",
      "Melissa Calusinski (2014): I came to work \u2026 And I saw Ben. He was fine, normal, happy, playful.",
      "Late that afternoon, after the kids were fed a snack and cleaned up, Melissa says she put Ben down on the carpet and he crawled into his bouncy seat on the floor.",
      "Melissa Calusinski (2014): He's sittin' in his bouncy chair, playing with his blanket. \u2026 And he was \u2014 startin' to kinda fall asleep, which was normal.",
      "The teacher working with Melissa stepped out of the room briefly, leaving Melissa alone with the children. That's when Melissa says she noticed something wrong with Ben.",
      "Melissa Calusinski (2014): He didn't look right. \u2026 I took his little hand, and I touched his hand and I'm like, \"Ben, Ben.\" He did not wake up at all. \u2026 I saw orange foam \u2026 coming out of his nose, and\u2014um I'm sorry (cries).",

      "An investigation was launched. According to the police report, during an autopsy, the pathologist, Dr. Eupil Choi, told a detective that he observed a skull fracture, extensive bleeding inside Ben's head, and that the injury \"was caused by another person,\" using \"strong force,\" \"within hours prior to\" Ben's death. And yet, Ben had no cuts or obvious wounds on the outside of his body, no serious bruises. The pathologist listed the autopsy as \"pending further studies.\" Police brought in the day care workers who had been with the toddler on the day of his death determined to find out what happened to Ben.",

      "In November 2011, nearly three years after the death of Ben Kingan, Melissa Calusinski went on trial for murder. The State argued that Ben was a perfectly healthy toddler leading up to his death. Matthew DeMartini and Stephen Scheller prosecuted the case.",
      "Erin Moriarty (2014): How would you describe what the parents have gone through?",
      "Matthew DeMartini (2014): When somebody takes your child from you, I don't think there's any words to describe what they've gone through.",
      "Dr. Choi, \u00a0the pathologist who conducted the autopsy, testified about that skull fracture he said he had seen, and how he believed the child's injury was recent \u2014 and consistent with having been thrown to the floor by someone. But Melissa's trial attorney, Paul De Luca, told the jury about a head injury Ben had previously received. It was noticed at the day care three months earlier.",
      "Paul De Luca: Melissa was not even working there at the day care center.",
      "After Ben's death, multiple people \u2014 including day care teacher Nancy Kallinger \u2014 told investigators about it.",
      "NANCY KALLINGER (police questioning): He got a bump on the back of his head \u2026\u00a0 I mean, we called the mom, the mom called the doctor.",
      "But prosecutor Scheller argued that the earlier injury was insignificant.",
      "Stephen Scheller (2014): The pediatrician actually examined Benjamin's head, had felt around, um, said there was no issues \u2026 that mom should just keep an eye on him. \u2026 Ben never had an issue after that.",
      "That's not what defense experts said. They noted that after the injury, there were possible signs of head trauma. Medical records showed that in the days after the injury, Ben was lethargic and had a persistent fever. And another day care employee, Holly, who asked that we identify her by her first name only, testified for the defense about the last time she saw Ben two days before his death.",
      "Holly: Melissa walked into the room \u2026 and she was holding Ben \u2026 And she said, like, he's not feeling well. And it was almost immediately after she said that, that he threw up, like, everywhere.",
      "The next day, one day before he died, Ben was kept home from day care. Prosecutor Matthew DeMartini argued it was a stomach bug or a winter cold.",
      "Matthew DeMartini (2014): He was given Pedialyte and put to bed. He woke up the next day and he was fine.",
      "But the defense maintained that Ben's prior injury was so serious that any new impact could have had major consequences, and Ben did have a habit of throwing his head back.",
      "Holly: He would be sitting on the ground, and he would just kind of lunge his body backwards and hit his head \u2026 You know, I guess you'd call it like he was a head banger.",
      "Nancy Kallinger recalled that Ben had done that twice on the day of his death.",
      "NANCY KALLINGER (police questioning): I put him on the floor, and he immediately threw himself on the floor. \u2026 And then I walked towards the sink, and he threw himself again.",
      "Prosecutors insisted that Melissa had hurt Ben.",
      "Stephen Scheller (2014): This child did not explode or implode on his own.",
      "And they pointed to her confession.",
      "Stephen Scheller (2014): She became frustrated holding Ben. She threw him to the floor.",
      "Prosecutors told the jury that the fall was so severe it caused that skull fracture. At trial, they mentioned a \"skull fracture\" more than 30 times. But was there one? While most of the experts who testified from both sides agreed there appeared to be a fracture in autopsy photos \u2014 one defense expert said she couldn't say for sure. And according to Melissa's attorney, Paul De Luca, the X-rays the prosecution had provided before the trial were unreadable.",
      "Paul De Luca: Before trial, I said, do we have any better images? And it was no.",
      "The State's final witness, pathologist Dr. Manny Montez, gave the most vivid and damaging testimony at trial. He said he examined the body and felt the fracture with his bare hands.",
      "Paul De Luca: Dr. Montez said he put his finger \u2026 in the skull and through the fracture. \u2026 I mean, it was devastating.",
      "The jury deliberated for seven hours before convicting Melissa Calusinski of aggravated battery of a child\u2014and first-degree murder.",
      "Melissa Calusinski: My heart sunk. \u2026 I know I didn't do this.",
      "Melissa's family remained determined to prove her innocence.",
      "Paul Calusinski: I didn't accept the verdict. I knew it was wrong.",
      "In 2012, a year after the conviction, Dr. Thomas Rudd \u2014 the then-newly elected Lake County Coroner \u2014 agreed to review the autopsy evidence at the urging of Melissa's trial attorney.",
      "Rudd spoke with \"48 Hours\" about the case in 2014.",
      "Dr. Thomas Rudd: I saw a membrane and I thought, \"my God.\"",
      "Erin Moriarty: What do you mean when you say you saw a membrane?",
      "Dr. Thomas Rudd: You see a scab. Similar to what forms on your skin, except it's in the brain. \u2026",
      "Erin Moriarty: This is a slide of a part of this infant's brain?",
      "Dr. Thomas Rudd: Correct\u2026. By definition, if you have a membrane, you have an old injury.",
      "At Melissa's trial, Choi had told the jury he observed no sign of an old injury. But according to Rudd, Dr. Choi had simply missed it. He called in Dr. Nancy Jones, a well-regarded pathologist, for a second opinion. And she agreed with Rudd and noted that the old injury had been healing for about two or three months \u2014 a time frame consistent with that bump on Ben's head that was noticed at day care.",
      "Dr. Thomas Rudd: How they let that go is beyond me.",
      "Like the defense experts at trial, doctors Jones and Rudd believed that the old injury was further exacerbated by Ben's head banging.",
      "Dr. Thomas Rudd: The added fluid of the recent injury \u2026 pushes that brain down and shuts down the breathing system. That is the cause of the child's death. It was the old injury. The old injury was massive.",
      "Rudd phoned the now-retired Choi, who signed a sworn affidavit, conceding that he had \"missed that Ben had suffered an old injury.\" But he crossed out the word \"significant.\" And when asked if he would have changed his testimony at trial, Choi said, \"no.\"",
      "Matthew DeMartini: There's no indication that anything in there is significant.",
      "But Rudd suspected that Choi may have also been wrong about another major issue in the case: that alleged skull fracture.",
      "Dr. Thomas Rudd: What should have been done was that whole section should have been cut out \u2026 to look under the microscope to see if, in fact, it is a skull fracture. \u2026 And they didn't.",
      "Rudd believed what Choi and the other medical experts thought was a skull fracture may have instead been a normal part of Ben's growing skull, but he couldn't prove it. Then, in 2015, Melissa's father said he received an anonymous call that there was a set of X-rays at the coroner's office that had never been turned over to the defense. When Rudd's staff searched the computer archives, they came across startling images that were never shown at trial.",
      "Dr. Thomas Rudd: I was dumbfounded. \u2026 There's definitely no skull fracture here.",
      "WERE BEN KINGAN'S X-RAYS MANIPULATED?",
      "Dr. Thomas Rudd (2015): I've shown this to various pathologists and a radiologist \u2026 They've all called me and say, \"There is no skull fracture in this child at all.\"",
      "In 2015, four years after Melissa Calusinski's conviction \u2014 and shortly after those clear X-rays of Ben Kingan were found \u2014 Dr. Rudd changed the manner of death on Ben's death certificate from \"homicide\" to \"undetermined.\" By this point, defense attorney Kathleen Zellner had taken on Melissa's case.",
      "Kathleen Zellner: I don't know of a case in America where someone is serving a 31-year prison sentence for a death that was undetermined.",
      "Zellner, \u00a0who has built a career on getting the wrongfully convicted out of prison, was intent on getting Melissa's conviction overturned. And in 2016, Melissa was granted an evidentiary hearing to present what Zellner argued was new evidence before Judge Daniel Shanes, the same judge who presided over Melissa's trial.",
      "Kathleen Zellner: The new evidence was that the images that had been given to Paul De Luca had been darkened.",
      "Remember, the State gave De Luca, Melissa's trial attorney, a disk containing the dark, unreadable X-rays before trial. At the evidentiary hearing, Rudd testified about finding the clear X-rays \u2014 X-rays that he and other defense experts said showed no skull fracture; \u00a0X-rays that Zellner argued would have changed the outcome of Melissa's trial.",
      "Kathleen Zellner: The skull fracture \u2026 was the pivotal point in the state's case to \u2026 convince the jury it was a homicide \u2026",
      "But at the evidentiary hearing, prosecutors argued that this wasn't new evidence in the case. They said the disk provided to De Luca had software that could enhance the X-rays and that he simply didn't do enough to brighten them. De Luca says he couldn't even open the software.",
      "Paul De Luca: I call in a secretary \u2026 I call in somebody else in the office \u2026 no one could get any better images.",
      "Zellner, with the help of an imaging expert, argued that it didn't matter what De Luca did \u2014 that the X-rays that he had been given had been modified and were inferior to the ones on the coroner's office computer. She also called a witness whom she believed raised more questions about the prosecution's case: Paul Forman, the deputy coroner during Ben Kingan's autopsies. Forman disputed the testimony of one of the most important witnesses at Melissa's trial \u2014 Dr. Manny Montez. Remember, Montez was the State's final witness who testified that he felt a fracture in Ben Kingan's skull.",
      "But Forman, who said he was there when Montez came to the coroner's office, testified that Montez never physically examined Ben's body or actually touched the child's skull.",
      "Erin Moriarty (2016): Could he have somehow gone in and looked at Ben's body, examined the body without you knowing?",
      "Paul Forman (2016): No, I was with him from the moment he came in the door to the moment he left.",
      "The State tried to discredit Forman by questioning his memory as well as his mental health. Forman told \"48 Hours\" he had been treated for bipolar disorder and depression.",
      "Paul Forman: Well, it was a personal attack.",
      "But Forman wasn't the only defense witness who raised questions about Montez's testimony. Dr. Robert Zimmerman, a renowned pediatric neuroradiologist who examined the readable X-rays, testified that if that skull fracture had existed, it would be clearly visible.",
      "Dr. Robert Zimmerman (outside of courthouse): It wasn't there on the X-ray, so I don't think he could've actually seen it.",
      "But prosecutors stood by their trial witnesses \u2014 doctors Montez and Choi \u2014 who said they saw and felt a skull fracture. \"48 Hours\" reached out to both doctors for this broadcast, but they did not respond to our requests for comment. When the evidentiary hearing ended, Judge Shanes ruled against Melissa.",
      "In his ruling, Judge Shanes stated that he didn't find Forman's testimony regarding Montez credible. And he agreed with the State that De Luca could have brightened the X-rays and made them readable. It was another letdown for Melissa and her family.",
      "Melissa Calusinski: You clearly made a mistake. (Crying) \u2026 I just don't understand.",
      "Zellner appealed the ruling, but again, a disappointment. And then, four years later, in 2022, there was a development that few saw coming. Eric Rinehart, a new state's attorney in Lake County \u2014 the county where Melissa was convicted \u2014 had taken office. Zellner says he wanted more information on the discrepancy over the X-rays, so he recommended she retain the digital forensics company, Garrett Discovery.",
      "Kathleen Zellner: We paid for them, but he recommended them.",
      "Andrew Garrett is the CEO of Garrett Discovery. Brian Bowman is a digital forensics expert who works for him. They concluded the X-rays were manipulated by someone using a software tool used to view X-rays.",
      "Erin Moriarty: How did Paul De Luca, the defense attorney, end up with these very dark pictures?",
      "Andrew Garrett (at computer with X-ray on monitor): I can show you. So, if I take these sliders here and I drag 'em all the way down or all the way up, you can manipulate this photo. \u2026 So, somebody went in, and they altered the contrast to make it look like that on screen, and then exported that file \u2026",
      "Erin Moriarty: On the coroner's computer?",
      "Andrew Garrett: On the coroner's computer.",
      "Bowman agrees there was little De Luca could do.",
      "Brian Bowman: The defense counsel could have adjusted some of the contrast on the JPEGs that they were given. But they couldn't make the images bigger, and they wouldn't be able to go in and zoom into the depth and have the clarity of the image that the original is.",
      "But if Ben Kingan's X-rays were manipulated, who did it? In their report, Garrett and Bowman pointed to the State.",
      "Erin Moriarty: You put in here, the State adjusted the settings of the images that resulted in black, washed-out images \u2026 You're saying that either the prosecutor's office or the coroner's office, but somebody representing the State did this?",
      "Andrew Garrett: Yes.",
      "Brian Bowman: Yes.",
      "Andrew Garrett: This is not a kiosk computer sitting in a lobby. This is in their custody and control. You have to be in the coroner's office to get access to this.",
      "WAS MELISSA CALUSINSKI'S CONFESSION COERCED?",
      "In late 2022, when Lake County State's Attorney Eric Rinehart met with the forensic experts \u2014 experts he recommended \u2014 and learned of their findings, attorneys Kathleen Zellner and Paul De Luca were also there.",
      "Kathleen Zellner: Eric was just indignant \u2026 He was saying, whoever had done this manipulation should be held accountable. \u2026 I believed after the meeting \u2026 that he believed in Melissa's innocence, and he was going to try to rectify this.",
      "Paul De Luca: I thought he was gonna do something about it.",
      "But nothing happened, say Zellner and De Luca. And as the months stretched on, Zellner decided to also look more closely at Melissa's confession.",
      "Kathleen Zellner: That's the only evidence against her \u2026 there's nothing that tips this as being a homicide. Absolutely nothing.",
      "Zellner asked Dr. Saul Kassin, a psychology professor and leading expert on false confessions, to review the case. Dr. Kassin had first analyzed the interrogation back in 2016, when he was a CBS News consultant. He told us then \u2014 and now \u2014 that it appears police went into that room determined to get a confession.",

      "The defense recently had Melissa evaluated by a psychologist and psychiatrist. They diagnosed her with post-traumatic stress disorder.

But when we located her, she agreed to speak to us on the condition we obscure her face and identify her only by Brenda, her first name.",

      "It's so cool that TV and film star Winona Ryder is named for the town, as she told the world in a 2020 Super Bowl ad: \u00a0\"There's something about this place, something that feels so me \u2026\"",
      "Madeline Kingsbury, 26, also felt that certain \"something\" about Winona. So, when Mayor Sherman heard that she had gone missing, he wanted to help.",
      "\"I felt that Maddi was a daughter of Winona,\" said Mayor Sherman. \"She was a bright young woman working through school, working \u2026 a \u2014 a job in Rochester and raising kids all at the same time, that's a lot. \u2026 So, I had respect for Maddi.",
      "And Sherman thought he could help because, as an avid bicyclist, he rides the woodsy paths around Winona all year long.",
      "\"You know the back roads of this area?\" Van Sant asked.\u00a0\"I do,\" said Sherman.",
      "\"And you went out yourself,\" said Van Sant. \"I did,\" Sherman replied.",
      "But as mayor, Sherman felt his first job was to support Maddi's distraught mother Krista Naber when she arrived at the search command center.",
      "\"She gave me a hug that I will never forget the rest of my life,\" Sherman said. \"It was a hug that showed fear, concern.\"",
      "\"And so what were \u2014 what message were you sending with that hug?\" Van Sant asked.",
      "\"I'm here for you. We will do our damndest to find her,\" said Sherman.",
      "WHERE'S MADDI KINGSBURY?",
      "Maddi's family first began worrying about her late in the afternoon of Friday, March 31, 2023, when Naber realized she had not heard from her daughter for nearly the entire day.",
      "Krista Naber: Something in my gut just didn't feel right.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Mother's intuition?",
      "Krista Naber: Right.",
      "Naber contacted Megan, Maddi's older sister, but Megan said she was not overly concerned.",

      "At the time, Maddi was living with Adam Fravel, the father of their children. The two had met in college at Winona State University.",
      "Megan Kingsbury: He was outgoing, and seemed interested in getting to know us, and he seemed very, almost infatuated, I guess, with \u2026 Madeline.",
      "While still in college, Maddi and Adam learned they were expecting their first child and decided to settle in Winona.",
      "Theresa Sis Mejia: He manned up, he manned up.",
      "Theresa Sis Mejia, Fravel's sister, says Adam quit school to support his new family.",
      "Theresa Sis Mejia: He knew he was gonna be a dad. He went and got a job \u2026 and he had that job up until COVID, and then he got laid off \u2026 while he let Maddi continue college so that she could graduate \u2026 and she did. She graduated and he supported her.",
      "After graduation, Maddi began working at the Mayo Clinic and became a clinical research coordinator. And Maddi's father David Kingsbury said she recently had begun studying for an advanced degree.",
      "David Kingsbury: She was \u2026 a graduate student in a master's program at the University of Minnesota \u2026 Had just completed her first semester there and was doing very well.",
      "Fravel, who had studied computer science in college, began taking flying lessons with an eye toward getting his pilot's license.",
      "Theresa Sis Mejia: When he was taking pilot lessons like that, he felt so accomplished \u2026 It made him feel good. And I was so proud of him for doing it, for doing something for himself.",
      "Krista Naber: I enjoyed being around him \u2026 I could tell that he really cared for Madeline.",
      "On the evening of March 31, Megan Kingsbury was hours away from Winona when she reached out to Fravel, who said he was concerned.",
      "Megan Kingsbury: \u00a0He said \u2026 I got home today and she was gone \u2026",
      "Fravel and the children were at his parents' home in Mabel, an hour south of Winona. That's when Megan Kingsbury messaged Maddi's close friend Katie Kolka, who lived in Winona: \"My parents and I haven't been able to get in contact with Maddi all day ...\" Katie responds: \"I'm on my way over there right now.\"",
      "The house was eerily silent, and it was at that point Kolka called the Winona police.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And you want this missing persons report to be filed, but what did they tell you?",
      "Katie Kolka: They told me that I wasn't able to report it because it hadn't been 24 hours yet.",
      "Megan Kingsbury: I was pacing in my kitchen. I was getting really really worried.",
      "So was Maddi's father who tried to reach her.",

      "The next morning, with Maddi now missing nearly 24 hours, the Kingsbury family filed a missing persons report.",
      "And then Fravel went to Facebook asking for help. His post read in part: \"If anybody has seen Maddi \u2026 please contact the Winona PD, me or any of her family members \u2026 Please help me find the mom to our 2 beautiful kids.\"",
      "Mary Fulginiti | \"48 Hours\" consultant: The police went to great lengths, I have to say, to try to \u2026 find Maddi quickly \u2026 because they know that there's a ticking clock on these things.",

      "Hailey Scott: I reached out to our sorority \u2026 I reached out to news outlets \u2026 I was grasping at straws.",
      "At the same time, detectives reached out to Adam Fravel. According to police reports, Fravel told them how on the morning of March 31, the couple dropped off their children at the daycare center.",
      "Investigators confirmed the drop-off after speaking to the daycare provider who gave police security video.",
      "This video has never been seen by the public until now. It was one of the last times Maddi is seen on video before she vanished. Police say Fravel told them he and Maddi returned home after the drop-off and she went to her office in the basement to do a little work before heading to the Mayo Clinic.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: I have taken a look at all the evidence that we have thus far in the Maddi Kingsbury case.",
      "Mary Fulginiti, a former prosecutor and defense attorney, is a \"48 Hours\" consultant. She says that in his police interview, Fravel told detectives he left Maddi his car and borrowed her blue minivan to haul some boxes.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: He \u2026 proceeded to put some boxes in the van that he was going to move to his parents' house \u2026 He said he didn't see Maddi again \u2026 He drove to his parents' house on Highway 43.",
      "Police say Fravel told them he got as far as the township of Choice, Minnesota, when he realized he had made a mistake.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: The boxes that he had in the van were ones that he actually wanted to put in storage. So he turned around and he went back to the home.",
      "Police say Fravel told investigators he arrived back at his Winona home around 11:30 a.m. and saw his car still in the driveway.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: He said he had texted her a few times, asking about dinner and whether or not she was gonna pick up the kids \u2026 There was no response.",
      "Police say Fravel told them he'd assumed Maddi had carpooled to work and when he did not hear from her, he went alone to do that pick up of the kids. Again, the video from the daycare appears to corroborate that part of Fravel's story.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: So he ultimately picked up the children around 4:20 or 4:30, um, from daycare and brought them to his parents' house in Mabel, Minnesota.",
      "During a police interview, investigators noted that Fravel had \"fresh scratches\" on his face the day after Maddi disappeared. Fravel's sister says he told her the scratches came from a friend's dog.",
      "On Saturday, April 1, police searched the Winona house where Fravel lived with Maddi. Investigators reported they saw no overt signs of foul play.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: But what was in the house was her purse, her jacket, her credit cards, um, but no Maddi.",

About three years before Maddi went missing, Hailey Scott says she witnessed Fravel slap Maddi during a video call. Scott and Maddi were talking, Scott says, when Fravel appeared in the background and began shouting at Maddi.",
      "Hailey Scott: He yelled, \"I don't understand why this house is such a f****** mess\" \u2026 and she said, \"I don't know, maybe you should help me,\" um, to which Adam turned, and he slapped her with an open hand across the face.",
      "And in September 2021, some 18 months before Maddi disappeared, she told Scott about Fravel's dark fascination with the Petito story.",
      "Hailey Scott: Adam had an infatuation, and I would call it an obsession, with the Gabby Petito case.",

      "His plane landed at Dulles Airport in the evening before he headed to Trump Sterling Golf Club for planned evening celebrations and fireworks. Trump got off the plane around 7:20 p.m., he did not take questions, reporters said, but stopped briefly to wave at the press and pumped his fist twice in the air.",
      "Earlier, Trump, Melania and their son Barron boarded the plane at 5:13 p.m. Eastern Time and departed Palm Beach International Airport, Florida, near Mar-a-Lago,\u00a0where his team has spent his transition since he won the election. The three of them turned around at the top of the stairs, and Trump waved before heading inside the plane.",
      "The ritualistic changing of power will get underway as Washington's solemn pomp is paired with Trump's brand of party: a fireworks showcase at one of his luxury golf properties, guests including tech industry titans, friends from the business world and conservative media stars, and thousands of his supporters streaming in from around the country.",
      "With a blast of Arctic air expected to leave the nation's capital facing frigid temperatures on Inauguration Day organizers were also scrambling to move inside most of Monday's outdoor events, including the swearing-in ceremony.",

It's not quite clear how the ceremony will be adapted to the Capitol Rotunda, which holds only 600 people. More than 250,000 guests were ticketed to view the inauguration from around the Capitol grounds.",

This year, much outspoken resistance to Trump has faded away, though there will be two notable absences: former first lady Michelle Obama and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Neither gave an explanation as to why she was skipping the ceremony.",

Some of the special advisers, such as Ric Grenell and retired Gen. Keith Kellogg, will likely have offices both at the State Department and in the EEOB.",

      "Early in the transition, Trump returned to golfing after choosing to forgo the sport for months to focus on winning the election. He grumbled that his stroke was rusty.",
      "Business leaders tried to finagle tee times. But Trump, who is choosy about golf partners, preferred players like the head of the PGA tour, Jay Monahan; pro golfer Dustin Johnson; hockey great Wayne Gretzky, who is Johnson's father-in-law; real estate developer and incoming Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff; South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and Missouri Sen. Eric Schmitt.",
      "One executive got in to play a round with the president-elect but Trump complained that the man was poor at golf, grousing, \"This guy sucks.\"",
      "The pace of phone calls from heads of state was so heavy that incoming national security adviser Mike Waltz flew to Mar-a-Lago to establish order and to track conversations, knowing foreign leaders would have their intelligence agencies on the line. Trump's staff tried to limit some calls to just a minute and asked that they be congratulatory in nature, not substantive.",
      "For a period, all head-of-state calls ceased. \"He got burned out,\" one aide said of the president-elect. Staffers took phone numbers and said they'd reach out when they could.",
      "Trump could be found some nights past 11 p.m. in the club's living room, using trusted allies as a sounding board on the world of politics, while staff dashed to and fro to bring in guests or to grab \"TRUMP\" hats for him to sign. He'd juggle various phones \u2014 on one occasion swiveling between a conversation with a CEO and a call with House Speaker Mike Johnson, before turning back to his top fundraising aide, Meredith O'Rourke, to continue hashing over ambassador assignments. When his daughter Ivanka rang, he picked up.",
      "Trump cracked jokes \u2014 \"everyone calls me chaotic, but look at South Korea,\" he said one day. He said he'd meet with Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol \"if they ever stop impeaching him.\"",
      "During dinner with Akie Abe, the widow of the assassinated Japanese prime minister, Trump, who fondly remembers that Shinzo Abe had written a letter nominating him for easing tensions with North Korea, talked about how he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. The Nobel, one adviser said, has been \"a hyper fixation\" for Trump, and it re-emerged as he strategized a Middle East deal.",
      "Who gets special access?",
      "A few regulars \u2014 Witkoff, Michael Whatley, Corey Lewandowski, Boris Epshteyn, Waltz \u2014 have Secret Service lapel pins for special access to the president-elect. One visitor didn't need a hard pin: Musk, whose security detail coordinates his arrival.",
      "The rear lawn, nearest the waterway, is usually off limits. But one night in November, it was covered with people, including Trump and Musk, for an opera performance. Starstruck guests took photos from a few paces away, held back by Secret Service. \"There's definitely a lot of buzz for Elon,\" one partygoer observed. \"There's President Trump!' and 'Oh my God, there's Elon.'\"",
      "And Musk, who donated a quarter of a billion dollars to back Trump and other GOP candidates, was everywhere.",
      "It quickly became an irritant for some of the president-elect's aides that Musk \"shows up at every meeting,\" as one adviser put it. They debated assigning a Trump person to wrangle Musk. \"He's not wrangleable,\" another aide said.",
      "VIPs with face-to-face appointments with Trump were told to come early, and that they could wait in the living room \u2014 a formal reception area just inside Mar-a-Lago's front doors. Some thought they'd be dining alone with Trump only to find a big show at a crowded table.",
      "\"A lot of clown cars had access, and there was an incredible amount of activity,\" one adviser said. \"It won't be like that in the White House.\"",
      "If someone got to Trump in person or by phone and presented an argument for an administration post, and Trump was in a \"yes\" mood, snap decisions were made, according to seven sources familiar with such moves.",
      "After eventual attorney general pick Pam Bondi said something nice about a Florida sheriff, he ended up named to lead the Drug Enforcement Administration \u2014- before withdrawing days later. A private equity executive and GOP donor who didn't serve in the Navy has been tapped to be secretary of the Navy.",
      "When Wiles left for Las Vegas for a couple days \u2014 along with inner circle dwellers Chris LaCivita, Taylor Budowich, Tony Fabrizio and James Blair \u2014 people nudged Trump into selecting several hires. Wiles undid some of that over subsequent weeks.",
      "Candidates for Cabinet and upper-level posts were brought in to pitch to Trump at Mar-a-Lago. Some interviews had a reality TV show quality. Doors opened dramatically. A candidate might be ushered in to a big reveal: with their image on a large screen behind a seated Trump. A top adviser \u2014 at times Wiles or Miller or Lutnick \u2014 was at Trump's side. Staffers ran the video screens. Clips of the candidates' past remarks were at the ready.",
      "In December, Trump aides fretted about the pace of hiring. \"When loyalty is the most important metric, it is going to be difficult to fill a government,\" one adviser noted.",
      "Trump transition spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told CBS News in early January, \"President Trump picked a brilliant Cabinet in record and historic time and the Trump-Vance Transition is working non-stop to fill the Administration with hard workers who believe fully in the America First Agenda.\"",
      "Almost immediately after the election, prospects for rank-and-file jobs were asked to name four preferences for administration roles and to fill out an application in a Google Docs link. There was no way to upload a resume, and the process came across as \"one step above Survey Monkey,\" one applicant said. \"My reaction was: 'That's it? That's all? I must have missed a secret page.' Went back. Nope.\"",
      "Stallone and \"Shark Tank\" star part of \"just another night at Mar-a-Lago\"",
      "Mar-a-Lago was so packed some nights during the transition that the restaurant did a buffet. The food at Mar-a-Lago can be mediocre, several frequent guests said, but the seafood buffet catches praise. No one hands Trump a menu \u2014 a waiter just asks what he'd like to eat. Often it's a burger or a steak.",
      "Actor Sylvester Stallone waited in the line one night to fill a buffet plate like everyone else, not far from Waltz, the incoming national security chief. \"Shark Tank\" star Kevin O'Leary posed for photos with guests. The music was cranked up \u2014 \"Don't Cry for Me Argentina,\" followed by a Sinatra tune. Out in a parking area, a multimillion-dollar Bugatti Veyron was parked by Rolls Royce SUVs and a Ferrari.",
      "\"And no one blinks,\" one diner said. \"It's just another night at Mar-a-Lago.\"",
      "Mar-a-Lago, Spanish for \"sea to lake,\" is situated on a wisp of a barrier island between the Atlantic Ocean and an intracoastal waterway. Its manicured lawns, beach club, event spaces, spa and Trump's private quarters cover 20 acres.",
      "One slice of palace intrigue was when Donald Trump Jr., who shares a home with Kimberly Guilfoyle near a Trump golf property 25 minutes north of Mar-a-Lago, started introducing someone else around the club as his girlfriend. Weeks later, Trump announced that Guilfoyle would be moving overseas as his U.S. ambassador to Greece. Three sources said the breakup was unrelated to the appointment.",
      "Some in the Mar-a-Lago orbit were obsessed with details, but, as one outside adviser put it, were more obsessed about booking a lunch or dinner, hoping to bump into the president-elect to lobby for jobs. Reservations are exclusively for members and their guests.",
      "A topic of conversation one December night was about how Scott Bessent and Howard Lutnick, after some tense moments, were speaking to each other again. \"Not friends, but cordial,\" one adviser said. The two had been rivals for Treasury secretary. Trump ultimately chose the more reserved Bessent, but gave Lutnick, the gregarious co-chair of his transition, the top Commerce Department job.",
      "\"That competition was driven by DJT,\" one adviser said, adding that he likes billionaire advisers fighting over him. \"He let that drag out.\"",
      "Second-term agenda",
      "More to Trump's liking was the work on his inauguration speech and executive orders, which were the closely guarded realm of two scribes, speechwriter Vince Haley and Stephen Miller, deputy chief of staff for policy.",
      "Despite Democrats' predictions Trump would support a national abortion ban, that wasn't a topic under discussion. \"He's done with that,\" one adviser said. The executive actions will mostly relate to energy, immigration and a third category aides refer to as \"weaponization of government,\" plus some \"anti-woke\" actions, such as on transgender participation in women's sports.",
      "Trump aides are also strategizing for next year's 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. Expect some wear and tear on Pennsylvania Avenue's pavement \u2013 advisers have discussed tanks in a parade. And while Trump might not hold a rally in every state during the Semiquincentennial, if he drops in on districts where GOP candidates need a lift, \"it wouldn't be a bad thing,\" one aide said.",
      "A haven for Trumpworld",
      "At the back of a lavender-scented courtyard, just beyond the whirlpool with club guests in swimwear, a gift shop sells Trump-branded souvenirs: Trump chocolates, Trump playing cards, Trump coffee mugs, a gold lapel pin with Trump's face in profile. Guests' bills can tally in the hundreds for collections of bottle openers, sequined \"MAGA\" purses and Bibles. One of the trending items is a black Trump cap like the one Musk wore when he bounced onto stage at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, his first public appearance after weeks of covert support.",
      "Mar-a-Lago is viewed as a place of safety for those in Trump circles, who said that being out in public with him can feel risky, after two assassination attempts and one cell phone thrown at his feet that aides momentarily thought was a bomb.",
      "Trump allies don't always feel safe at bars and restaurants in Washington, D.C., where they say staff might refuse to serve them. The old Trump Hotel, now a Waldorf Astoria, can handle large numbers and \"we know our food won't be spat in,\" one adviser said.",
      "Some hoped Tilman Fertitta, a billionaire who owns restaurant and hotel chains (and is Trump's pick for ambassador to Italy), would open a D.C. haven for Trumpworld. And Trump has been talking seriously about buying back the hotel in the old D.C. Post Office.",
      "Aides expect Trump will return occasionally to Mar-a-Lago during the next four years, but for now, the show is moving 1,000 miles up the road.",

      "The long-awaited ceasefire and hostage release deal\u00a0between Hamas and Israel that had been set to go into effect on Sunday morning in the Middle East was delayed, with Israel's military accusing Hamas of failing to provide the names of the first hostages to be released. Israel Defense Forces spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari gave a statement at the intended start time, 8:30 a.m. local (1:30 a.m. Eastern) and said Hamas wasn't complying with the agreement as the names of the hostages were not yet transferred.",
      "\"According to the Prime Minister [Benjamin Netanyahu], the ceasefire will not come into effect as long as Hamas does not fulfill its commitment to the agreement,\" said Hagari, warning that \"any violation of the agreement will have a full security significance.\"",
      "He said Israel's military \"continues to attack, even now, inside the Gaza arena,\" and would do so until Hamas complies with the agreement.",
      "A short time after, the Israeli prime minister's office announced that it had received a the list of names of the first hostages to be released and said the first phase of the ceasefire and hostage release deal would come into effect at 11:15 a.m. local time (4:15 a.m. Eastern).",
      "Hamas blamed the delay in handing over the names on \"technical field reasons.\" It said in a statement that it was still committed to the ceasefire deal announced last week, but there was no indication how long implementation of the agreement could be delayed.",
      "CBS News' team inside Gaza confirmed that IDF strikes were ongoing in both the north and central parts of the Palestinian territory. According to initial reports, at least three people were killed by gunfire in the north, and there were reports of IDF troops opening fire on people trying to return to their homes in the decimated southern city of Rafah.",
      "Qatar's foreign minister, Majid al-Ansari, had posted Saturday on X that the ceasefire would start at 8:30 a.m. local time in Gaza on Sunday. He advised people to exercise caution when the agreement came into effect and to wait for directions from officials.",

      "The prime minister, speaking to the nation about 12 hours before the ceasefire is set to start, also said Israel is treating the ceasefire with Gaza as temporary and retains the right to continue fighting if necessary. He claimed that he had the support of President-elect Donald Trump, who he said he spoke with Wednesday.",
      "Early Saturday morning local time, Israel's Cabinet approved the deal for a ceasefire in Gaza that would see the release of dozens of hostages and pause the 15-month war with Hamas. The deal brings the two sides a step closer to ending their deadliest and most destructive fighting ever.",
      "\"We hope by the name of God that today is the last day of war,\" a displaced man from southern Gaza told CBS News.",
      "How the ceasefire and hostage deal works",
      "According to a translated draft of the agreement viewed by CBS News, and as described by President Biden, the deal consists of three phases, each lasting 42 days.",
      "Hamas would start releasing hostages on the first day, initially returning three to Israel, according to the draft viewed by CBS News. On the seventh day, Hamas would release four hostages. Thereafter, Hamas would release three hostages taken from Israel every seven days, starting with the living and then moving on to return the bodies of those who have died.",
      "It would release 33 women and children hostages in total during the first phase, as well as hostages over 50 years old, the draft viewed by CBS News said.",
      "Mr. Biden said Wednesday that Americans would be among the hostages released in this phase, but he did not specify any names or how soon they would be freed.",
      "The remainder of the hostages, including male soldiers, are to be released in a second phase that will be negotiated during the first. Hamas has said it will not release the remaining captives without a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal.",
      "Eli David, the brother of Eyvatar David, who has been held hostage by Hamas since the attack on Oct. 7, 2023, told CBS News' Remy Inocencio that he has mixed feelings as the ceasefire nears. Eyvatar is set to be released in the second phase.",
      "\"If they have a heart, if they can feel empathy, if they know my brother, just send him a message,\" Eli David said as a message to Hamas. \"Tell him that we are fighting for him, that we love him and we are so hopeful we know that he's coming back home.\"",
      "The plan says that during phase one, some 1,900 Palestinian prisoners will be released, in exchange for 33 Israeli hostages, both alive and dead. Among the prisoners, 1,167 are residents of Gaza who were held by Israel but were not involved in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack. All women and children under 19 from Gaza held by Israel will be freed during this phase.",
      "According to the ceasefire plan, approved by the Cabinet and signed by Israel's national security adviser, the exchange will begin Sunday at 9 a.m. EST. During each exchange, prisoners will be released by Israel after the hostages have arrived safely.",
      "Missile strikes continue while aid is on the way",

      "The Iran-backed Houthis have stepped up their missile attacks, in recent weeks. The group says the attacks are part of their campaign aimed at pressuring Israel and the West over the war in Gaza.",
      "There were also continued Israeli strikes into Gaza. The Palestinian Health Ministry said at least 23 people were killed in the previous day.",
      "Also, during the first phase, Israeli troops are to pull back into a buffer zone about a kilometer (0.6 miles) wide inside Gaza, along its borders with Israel.",
      "That will allow displaced Palestinians to return to their homes, including in Gaza City and northern Gaza. With most of Gaza's population driven into massive, squalid tent camps, Palestinians are desperate to get back to their homes, even though many were destroyed or heavily damaged by Israel's campaign.",

    "story": [
      "South Korea's impeached president, Yoon Suk Yeol, was formally arrested early Sunday, days after being apprehended at his presidential compound in Seoul, as he faces possible imprisonment over his ill-fated declaration of martial law last month.",
      "Yoon's arrest could mark the beginning of an extended period in custody for him, lasting months or more.",
      "The Seoul Western District Court granted law enforcement's request for an arrest warrant for Yoon following an hourslong deliberation, saying he was a threat to destroy evidence. Yoon and his lawyers on Saturday appeared before the court's judge during a hearing and argued for his release.",
      "Yoon, who has been in detention since he was apprehended on Wednesday in a massive law enforcement operation at his residential compound, faces potential rebellion charges linked to his declaration of martial law on Dec. 3, which set off the country's most serious political crisis since its democratization in the late 1980s.",
      "The Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials, which is leading a joint investigation with police and the military, can now extend his detention to 20 days, during which they will transfer the case to public prosecutors for indictment.",
      "Yoon's lawyers could also file a petition to challenge the court's arrest warrant.",
      "Yoon's appearance at the Seoul Western District Court triggered chaotic scenes in nearby streets, where thousands of his fervent supporters rallied for hours calling for his release. They clashed with police, who detained around 40 protesters, including about 20 who climbed over a fence in an attempt to approach the court. At least two vehicles carrying anti-corruption investigators were damaged as they left the court after arguing for Yoon's arrest.",
      "Yoon's lawyers said he spoke for about 40 minutes to the judge during the nearly five-hour closed-door hearing. His legal team and anti-corruption agencies presented opposing arguments about whether he should be held in custody. The lawyers did not share his specific comments.",
      "The judge is expected to make a decision by late Saturday or early Sunday. Yoon's motorcade was seen leaving the court Saturday evening for the detention center, where Yoon will await the decision.",
      "Yoon was transported to the court from a detention center in Uiwang, near Seoul, in a blue Justice Ministry van escorted by police and the presidential security service.",
      "The motorcade entered the court's basement parking space as thousands of Yoon's supporters gathered in nearby streets despite a heavy police presence. Some protesters broke through the police lines and tapped on the windows of his van approaching the court. Yoon did not speak to reporters.",
      "After its investigators were attacked by protesters, the anti-corruption agency asked media companies to obscure the faces of its members attending the hearing.",
      "It hadn't been clear until Saturday morning whether Yoon would choose to attend the hearing.",
      "Defense lawyers met Yoon at the detention center and he accepted his legal team's advice to appear personally before the judge, said Yoon Kab-keun, one of the president's lawyers. The lawyer said the president was to argue that his decree was a legitimate exercise of his powers and that accusations of rebellion would not hold up before a criminal court or the Constitutional Court, which is reviewing whether to formally remove him from office or reinstate him.",
      "Nine people, including Yoon's defense minister, police chief, and several top military commanders, have already been arrested and indicted for their roles in the enforcement of martial law.",
      "The crisis began when Yoon, in an attempt to break through legislative gridlock, imposed military rule and sent troops to the National Assembly and election offices. The standoff lasted only hours after lawmakers who managed to get through a blockade voted to lift the measure. The opposition-dominated assembly voted to impeach him on Dec. 14.",
      "If Yoon is formally arrested, it could mark the beginning of an extended period in custody for him, lasting months or more.",
      "If prosecutors indict Yoon on rebellion and abuse of power charges, which are the allegations now being examined by investigators, they could keep him in custody for up to six months before trial.",
      "Under South Korean law, orchestrating a rebellion is punishable by life imprisonment or the death penalty.",
      "Yoon's lawyers have argued that there is no need to detain him during the investigation, saying he doesn't pose a threat to flee or destroy evidence.",

      "Archeologists in Pompeii, the ancient Roman city buried by ash and lava in 70 AD, unearthed a private bathhouse built over 2,000 years ago, officials said Friday.",
      "The discovery includes sumptuous mosaics and is equipped with a series of hot, warm and cold rooms and a huge plunge pool in the manner of a spa.",
      "\"We have here perhaps the largest thermal complex in a private house in Pompeii,\" said Gabriel Zuchtriegel, director of the Pompeii archaeological park. \"The members of the ruling class of Pompeii set up enormous spaces in their homes to host banquets.\"",
      "The spa-like baths were unearthed in the so-called Regio IX, a central area of Pompeii park still unexplored, where major archaeological excavations are revealing new aspects of Pompeians' daily life.",
      "\"It's these spaces that really are part of the 'Pompeii effect' \u2014 it's almost as if the people had only left a minute ago,\" Zuchtriegel told CBS News partner BBC News.",
      "Zuchtriegel said wealthy habitants of Pompeii often used first to take a bath and then to have a banquet, so the private spa complex allowed to do that altogether inside the same house.",
      "\"There is room for about 30 people who could do the whole routine, and that could also be done in public baths. So there is the calidarium, a very warm environment and also a large tub with cold water,\" he said.",
      "Recently, archeologists working in the same area found a bakery, a laundry shop, two villas and the bones of three people who died during the volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius, which destroyed both the ancient Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum.",
      "The bodies belonged to a woman, who was clutching jewelry and coins, and a young man in his teens or early 20s, the BBC reported.",
      "\"The pyroclastic flow from Vesuvius came along the street just outside this room, and caused a wall to collapse, and that had basically crushed him to death,\" Sophie Hay, an archaeologist at Pompeii, told the BBC. \"The woman was still alive while he was dying \u2014 imagine the trauma \u2014 and then this room filled with the rest of the pyroclastic flow, and that's how she died.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 08:35:29 -0500",
    "summary": "Part of an astonishing generation of British actors, including Judi Dench,\u200b Vanessa Redgrave, Eileen Atkins and Maggie Smith\u200b, Joan Plowright won a Tony Award, two Golden Globes and nominations for an Oscar and an Emmy.",
    "story": [
      "Award-winning British actor Joan Plowright, who with her late husband Laurence Olivier did much to revitalize the U.K.'s theatrical scene in the decades after World War II, has died. She was 95.",
      "In a statement Friday, her family said Plowright died the previous day at Denville Hall, a retirement home for actors in southern England, surrounded by her loved ones.",
      "\"She enjoyed a long and illustrious career across theatre, film and TV over seven decades until blindness made her retire,\" the family said. \"We are so proud of all Joan did and who she was as a loving and deeply inclusive human being.\"",
      "Part of an astonishing generation of British actors, including Judi Dench, Vanessa Redgrave, Eileen Atkins and Maggie Smith, Plowright won a Tony Award, two Golden Globes and nominations for an Oscar and an Emmy. She was made a dame by Queen Elizabeth II in 2004.",
      "From the 1950s to the 1980s, Plowright racked up dozens of stage roles in everything from Anton Chekhov's \"The Seagull\" to William Shakespeare's \"The Merchant of Venice.\" She stunned in Eugene Ionesco's \"The Chairs,\" and George Bernard Shaw's totemic two female roles \"Major Barbara\" and \"Saint Joan.\"",
      "\"I've been very privileged to have such a life,\" Plowright said in a 2010 interview with\u00a0The Actor's Work. \"I mean it's magic and I still feel, when a curtain goes up or the lights come on if there's no curtain, the magic of a beginning of what is going to unfold in front of me.\"",
      "The esteem in which Plowright was held in London was evident with the news that theaters across the West End will dim their lights for two minutes at 7 p.m. on Tuesday in her honor.",
      "Born Joan Ann Plowright in Brigg, Lincolnshire, England, her mother ran an amateur drama group and Plowright was involved in the theater from age 3. She was soon spending school vacations at summer sessions of university drama schools. After high school, she studied at the Laban Art of Movement Studio in Manchester, then won a two-year scholarship to the drama school at the Old Vic Theatre in London.",
      "Following her London stage debut in 1954, Plowright became a member of the Royal Court Theatre in 1956 and gained recognition in dramas written by the so-called Angry Young Men, such as John Osborne, who were giving British theater a thorough airing-out. The new, rough-hewn, working-class actors like Albert Finney, Alan Bates and Anthony Hopkins were her peers.",
      "Plowright made her feature film debut with an uncredited turn in American director John Huston's epic adaptation of Herman Melville's \"Moby Dick\" in 1956, starring Gregory Peck as the obsessed Captain Ahab.",
      "A year later, she co-starred with her future husband Olivier in the original London production of Osborne's \"The Entertainer.\" She played Olivier's daughter in the work and the two reunited for the 1960 film adaptation.",
      "By then, Plowright's marriage to British actor Roger Cage had ended, as had Olivier's 20-year union with Vivien Leigh. Plowright and Olivier were married in Connecticut in 1961, while both were starring on Broadway, he in \"Becket\" and she in \"A Taste of Honey,\" for which she won a Tony.",
      "One love letter Olivier sent summed up his love: \"I sometimes feel such a peacefulness come over me when I think of you, or write to you \u2014 a gentle tenderness and serenity. A feeling devoid of all violence, passion or shattering longing... it makes me go out into the street with a smile on my face and in my heart for everybody.\"",
      "Olivier died in 1989 at the age of 82. After that, Plowright enjoyed a career resurgence at the age of 60, satisfying both upmarket tastes and more commercial fare.",
      "She was in Franco Zeffirelli's version of Charlotte Bront\u00eb's \"Jane Eyre\" in 1996 and the Merchant-Ivory production of \"Surviving Picasso,\" as well as starring as the stalwart nanny in Disney's live-action remake of \"101 Dalmatians\" in 1996 with Glenn Close.",
      "She starred opposite Walter Matthau in the big screen adaptation of the classic comic strip \"Dennis the Menace,\" and made a brief appearance in the Arnold Schwarzenegger self-referencing satire \"Last Action Hero\" in 1993.",
      "Plowright became one of only a handful of actors to win two Golden Globes in the same year, in 1993, when she won the supporting actress TV award for \"Stalin\" and the supporting actress movie award for \"Enchanted April.\" For the latter, which told the story of a group of Britons finding their lives transformed on a vacation to Italy, she received her sole nomination for an Academy Award.",
      "Not all her works were career roses, as with the disastrous \"The Scarlet Letter\" starring Demi Moore and a pilot that went nowhere for a TV series based on \"Driving Miss Daisy.\" An appearance alongside Chevy Chase in the 2011 holiday family comedy \"Goose on the Loose\" didn't rouse critics.",
      "A prominent role in later life was keeper of the Olivier flame \u2014 bestowing awards, defending her husband in the press and curating his letters.",
      "\"That is my choice because I was privileged to live with him,\" she told The Daily Telegraph in 2003. \"When someone who has had such fame and idolatry and worship goes, then there's bound to be a backlash which comes the other way and you get a bit sick of that. Mine was really trying to put things straight.\"",
      "Plowright is survived by her three children \u2014 Tamsin, Richard and Julie-Kate, all actors, and several grandchildren.",

      "Vadim Kobzev, Alexey Liptser and Igor Sergunin were found guilty of participating in an \"extremist organization\" by a court in the town of Petushki.",
      "Kobzev, the most high-profile member of Navalny's legal team, was given a five-and-a-half year sentence, while Liptser was handed five years and Sergunin three-and-a-half years.",
      "Navalny's exiled widow,\u00a0Yulia Navalnaya, said the lawyers are \"political prisoners and should be freed immediately\".",
      "They were almost the only people visiting Navalny in prison while he served his 19-year sentence.",
      "Navalny, Putin's main political opponent, communicated with the world by transmitting messages through his lawyers that his team then published on social media. Passing letters and messages through lawyers is a normal practice in Russian prisons.",
      "The men were sentenced after a closed-door trial the town about 72 miles east of Moscow, near the Pokrov prison where Navalny was held before he was moved to a remote colony above the Arctic Circle, where he died.",
      "\"We are on trial for passing Navalny's thoughts to other people,\" Kobzev said in court last week.",
      "The court said the men had \"used their status as lawyers while visiting convict Navalny ... to ensure the regular transfer of information between the members of the extremist community, including those wanted and hiding outside the Russian Federation, and Navalny.\"",
      "It said that enabled Navalny to continue \"planning the preparation and creating conditions for committing crimes with an extremist character.\"",
      "Navalny had condemned the arrests of the lawyers in October 2023 as \"outrageous\" and part of a campaign to further isolate him in jail.",
      "The verdicts come several days before four independent journalists accused of helping Navalny will be back in court, facing up to six years in prison.",
      "They also come four years after Navalny defiantly returned to Russia - on Jan. 17, 2021 - after recovering from a poison attack that almost killed him.",
      "In his messages to the outside world, Navalny denounced the Kremlin's Ukraine offensive as \"criminal\" and told supporters \"not to give up.\"",
      "Just last week, Kobzev compared Moscow's current crackdown on dissent to Stalin-era mass repression.",
      "\"Eight years have passed ... and in the Petushki court, people are once again on trial for discrediting officials and the state agencies,\" he said in a speech published by the Novaya Gazeta newspaper.",

      "\"Defending a client, regardless of their political views or actions, is a cornerstone of the rule of law and a universal principle enshrined in international legal standards,\" the organization said last month.",
      "It said the trial \"sets a dangerous precedent\" in \"potentially deterring\" lawyers from defending clients in sensitive cases.",
      "International rights groups and some Western countries slammed the sentencing.",
      "\"Today marks yet another low point in the already dire human rights situation in the Russian Federation,\" Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp said on social media Friday.",
      "Navalny's team has accused prison authorities of secretly filming Navalny's meetings - meant to be confidential - with his lawyers and publishing obtained footage on social media.",
      "Last week, Navalnaya said Russia refused to remove her late husband from its list of terrorists and extremists.",
      "She published a December letter from Russia's financial watchdog Rosfinmonitoring addressed to Navalny's mother that said the late opposition leader was still being investigated for money laundering and \"financing terrorism.\"",

      "London - Britain's Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced Thursday that there would be a number of new central government-backed local inquiries into years-old allegations of child grooming gangs, weeks after Elon Musk accused British Prime Minister Keir Starmer of failings in relation to the handling of the crimes in a series of tweets. The crimes took place a decade ago when Starmer was the country's top prosecutor.",
      "Musk's tweets\u00a0targeted Starmer personally, suggesting he should be in jail and that \"America should liberate the people of Britain from their tyrannical government,\" thrusting the crimes back into the political conversation in Britain.",
      "Starmer defended his record and denounced the criticism as politically motivated.",
      "\"Those that are spreading lies and misinformation as far and as wide as possible, they're not interested in victims. They're interested in themselves,\" Starmer told reporters after Musk's tweets earlier this month, not mentioning the tech mogul and close associate of Donald Trump by name.",
      "In 2012, a newspaper report on the grooming led to a major government inquiry, which two years later found that at least 1,400 children had been subjected to sexual exploitation in Rotherham, northern England, between 1997 and 2013. Similar exploitation was discovered in other towns, leading to a national inquiry.",
      "The prosecution service, which was led by Starmer between 2008 and 2013, was criticized in the report for not pursuing charges in Rochdale because it viewed a victim as \"unreliable\" following an investigation between 2008 and 2009. That decision was later overturned by a Starmer appointee.",
      "\"Mr. Starmer has striven to improve the treatment of victims of sexual assault within the criminal justice system throughout his term as Director of Public Prosecution,\" a 2013 report from the Home Affairs Committee said.",

      "\"I brought the first major prosecution of an Asian grooming gang in this particular case. \u2026 it was the first of its kind. We changed, or I changed, the whole prosecution approach, because I wanted to challenge, and did challenge, the myths and stereotypes that were stopping those victims being heard,\" Starmer said. \"When I left office, we had the highest number of child sexual abuse cases being prosecuted on record.\"",
      "Starmer had initially said further inquiries into the grooming gangs could delay action on tackling child abuse.",

      "\"One of the things that I've learned, especially about politics, is you're not going to agree with somebody about everything, and it's OK,\" she said.",
      "\"We've learned to talk through it. Talk it out. Listen to each other. Sometimes, agree to disagree or say, 'Oh, I'm going to think about that and I hear what you're saying,' or 'I don't like the way you're saying it. I wish you'd say it in a different way.'",

      "On Jan. 12, the French television channel TF1 aired an episode of its show \"Sept \u00e0 Huit,\" which told the story of a 53-year-old interior designer named Anne who revealed that she had lost 830,000 euros (approximately $850,000) in personal funds because she thought she was sending money to a cancer-ridden Pitt.",
      "Through falsified documents and images as well as artificial intelligence, Anne believed she was speaking to, and eventually in a relationship with, the 61-year-old actor.",

      "\"It's awful that scammers take advantage of fans' strong connection with celebrities,\" the rep said, \"but this is an important reminder to not respond to unsolicited online outreach, especially from actors who have no social media presence.\"",
      "Pitt does not have any verified social media platforms.",
      "Brad Pitt attends the Japan premiere of \"Ad Astra\" on Sept. 13, 2019 in Tokyo. (Ken Ishii)",
      "Reportedly contacted in February 2023 on Instagram by a person who introduced themselves as Pitt's 85-year-old mother, Jane Etta Pitt, Anne received a message that said, \"It\u2019s a woman like you that my son needs,\" per BFM TV and The Sunday Times.",
      "\"At first I said to myself that it was fake, that it's ridiculous,\" Anne said, per AFP. \"But I'm not used to social media and I didn't really understand what was happening to me.\" Despite her skepticism, Anne proceeded with the conversation before being messaged by the alleged Pitt.",

      "Anne was barraged with countless romantic messages and poetry as well as doctored photographs. The operation was multifaceted, with others posing as Pitt's manager and daughter, Shiloh, who he shares with ex-wife Angelina Jolie, to aid in the con. Following a contentious eight-year legal battle, Pitt and Jolie finalized their divorce settlement in 2024 after being legally declared \"single\" in 2019.",
      "\"What makes these scams particularly dangerous is their multilayered approach,\" Marva Bailer, AI expert and founder and CEO of Qualaix, told Fox News Digital. \"Scammers build trust over time, often pretending to be a family member, a staff member or even someone close to the celebrity who claims they are helping the celebrity by managing their charitable efforts. This indirect approach makes the scam seem more credible, as it\u2019s not the celebrity asking for help directly, it's someone positioned to be more relatable or \u2018realistic.\u2019 It plays on the idea that the celebrity is too proud or private to ask for help themselves, which makes the situation seem more genuine.\"",

Money was introduced into the conversation when Anne was told she'd need to pay more than 9,000 euros in customs tariffs in order to accept luxury gifts from the person posing as Pitt.",
      "A recent divorc\u00e9e, Anne relayed to the scammer that she'd received a hefty divorce settlement of 775,000 euros. After this admission, the Pitt impersonator told Anne that he had kidney cancer and was struggling to pay for his treatments due to his ongoing divorce proceedings with Jolie. Anne sent most of her divorce settlement to the fake Pitt.",
      "Throughout the treatment, the alleged Pitt sent Anne a series of doctored pictures depicting his time in the hospital receiving treatment. In one picture, Pitt lies in a hospital bed holding a card that reads, \"Anne I love you.\"",
      "Doctored photos of Brad Pitt were sent to Anne. An AI-generated video of Pitt was also sent. (Axelle/Bauer-Griffin)",
      "A novice at social media, Anne had lingering doubts and the wherewithal to block the scammer's number on multiple occasions, ultimately succumbing to her feelings and resuming communication. After initially reading a report that Pitt was involved with businesswoman In\u00e9s de Ramon, she was sent a fake TV report to mitigate her qualms, which clarified the couple wasn't together.",
      "When photos of the couple were released over the summer, Anne knew it was all a con and decided to take legal action. The story was ultimately pulled by TF1 because she started to experience extreme ridicule. The network released a statement saying they'd chosen to pull the story from their platforms after the initial broadcast \"sparked a wave of harassment\" against the victim.",

      "Bailer shared that with how easily accessible celebrity imagery is, people are at risk: \"With access to a celebrity's public persona and online presence, they can create fake social media accounts or send highly convincing emails or messages that look as though they come directly from the celebrity or their team. Fans, eager to be a part of something that feels exclusive, can easily be misled into thinking they are engaging with someone they trust.\"",

      "The spotlight should help DeSantis if he ends up launching a second straight GOP presidential nomination run in 2028, a race in which soon-to-be Vice President JD Vance will be considered the clear early frontrunner as the perceived America First and MAGA heir apparent to Trump.",
      "\"He needs to do what he did in 2022, which is pick good fights. And he\u2019s shown a lot of capability to pick good fights with the left both in Florida and nationally,\" longtime Republican strategist David Kochel said of DeSantis.",

And that's when DeSantis will be wrapping up his second and final four-year term steering Florida, allowing him to concentrate 100% on a White House run if that's in his cards.",
      "But what about another high-profile Republican governor who likely has national ambitions in 2028?",
      "HERE ARE THE DEMOCRATS WHO MAY RUN FOR THE WHITE HOUSE IN 2028",
      "The Virginia Constitution doesn't allow for incumbent governors to run for a second consecutive term, so Gov. Glenn Youngkin will be out of office in Richmond in a year.",
      "Compared to DeSantis, who also enjoys large GOP majorities in his state legislature, which will allow him to continue to enact a conservative agenda, Virginia is a purple state where Democrats have a slight upper hand in the legislature.",
      "\"It might be a little tougher for Youngkin, a little tougher for him to find ways to stay in the news\" after he leaves office in a year, Kochel suggested.",
      "But, Younkin predicted, \"You\u2019re going to see me a lot.\"",
      "\"We\u2019ve got a very aggressive agenda for being governor in the last 14 months,\" he said in a Fox News Digital interview in November. \"But part of that agenda that I have is to make sure that we have [Lt. Gov.] Winsome Sears as our next governor. [Virginia Attorney General] Jason Miyares is back as our attorney general and a super lieutenant governor who we will pick at our primaries.\"",
      "Youngkin, who energized Republicans nationwide in 2021 as a first-time candidate who hailed from the party\u2019s business wing, edged former Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe to become the first GOP candidate in a dozen years to win a gubernatorial election in the one-time swing state that had trended toward the Democrats over the previous decade. He could also potentially end up in the Trump administration after his term in Richmond sunsets in a year.",
      "\"I told the president when I called him and told him that I wanted to finish my term that I would be available to help him at any time while I\u2019m governor and afterwards,\" Youngkin told Fox News Digital, referring to a call he held with Trump right after the November election.",
      "But if he doesn't enter the Trump administration, another route for Youngkin to stay in the spotlight in 2026 would be criss-crossing the country on behalf of fellow Republicans running in the midterm elections. It's a role Youngkin previously played in 2022, helping fellow Republican governors and gubernatorial candidates.",
      "\"He\u2019s got to do the blocking and tackling, go state by state, help a lot of candidates, raise a lot of money for them. Get a bunch of governors elected,\" Kochel suggested. \"That\u2019s the playbook for him.\"",

      "Haley does have a weekly national radio show on Sirius XM, where she noted a few weeks ago, \"I had no interest in being in [Trump's] Cabinet.\"",

      "\"While JD Vance starts as the presumed frontrunner right now, there\u2019s a million miles to go between now and then,\" seasoned Republican strategist Colin Reed told Fox News.",
      "And Kochel added that for some Republicans mulling a 2028 presidential bid, \"I think a little strategic distance is not a bad idea. Because you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen over the next two years.\"",

      "\"So, there is a group of people in California that could fuel a revolt of liberals or Democrats,\" Hanson, a Hoover Institution public policy think tank senior fellow, told Fox News Digital in an interview on Tuesday.",
      "That group of people could include the wealthy on the coastal line whose homes were destroyed or damaged by the wildfires that broke out Jan. 7. Several celebrities, including filmmaker Mel Gibson and actor Michael Rapaport, openly blasted California leadership for its response to the crisis as the blaze destroyed several Los Angeles districts.",

      "\"So, the shock of LA is most of the people that were burned out in Pacific Palisades or on the areas around it were very, very left-wing and very wealthy,\" Hanson said. \"And this was what's shocking politically, because the consequences of their votes and their ideology had never really personally affected them to this degree.",
      "\"This is going to be an accelerant or a force multiplier. That's because it affects two different groups of people,\" Hanson explained. \"It affects the very wealthy. For the first time, they got firebombed. Looks like Dresden, and that's going to be $300 or $400 billion when it's all over. And they're going to have to deal with the Coastal Commission, the Los Angeles Planning Commission and permits for building. And they're going to be irate when they have to do that.",

Gavin Newsom's backing of billions for new reservoirs \u2014 highlighted severe flaws in the state's response, noted by lawmakers and experts.",
      "The state\u2019s response to the crisis has fueled further criticism, particularly regarding its bureaucracy. In response, Newsom signed an executive order Sunday to suspend certain state commission requirements, aiming to speed up the rebuilding process for homeowners.",
      "\"Goodbye, red tape,\" Newsom wrote in a post on X. \"Through an executive order, we are making it easier for victims of the SoCal fires to quickly rebuild their homes and lives.\"",

      "Another issue that has been a multiyear problem is California's loss of residents to red states.

So far, the Republican Party doesn't know what to do. They don't know whether to go left and try to accommodate this left-wing population or go further right and galvanize it.",

      "Scammers are taking advantage of this. They have come up with a new trick where they pretend to be recruiters to spread crypto miners on people\u2019s devices.",
      "It starts with an email inviting the person to schedule an interview for a job. But when they click the link, it installs a malicious app that secretly mines cryptocurrency.\u00a0This app hijacks your PC\u2019s resources, like the CPU and GPU, which slows down its performance significantly.",

      "What you need to know",
      "This malicious campaign begins with an email that tricks victims into thinking it is part of a recruitment process, as reported by\u00a0Dark Reading. In most cases, these emails are pretending to be from recruiters at the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike.",
      "The fraudulent email contains a link claiming to take the recipient to a site where they can schedule an interview. However, in reality, it redirects the victim to a malicious website that offers a download for a supposed \"CRM application.\"",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The site provides download options for both Windows and macOS. Regardless of which option the victim selects, the download will be a Windows executable written in Rust. This executable then downloads the XMRig cryptominer.",
      "The executable performs several environmental checks to analyze the device and avoid detection. It scans running processes, checks the CPU and more. If the device passes these checks, the executable will display a fake error message while secretly downloading additional payloads needed to run the XMRig miner.",

      "How does a cryptominer affect your PC?",
      "A cryptomining app can significantly impact your PC\u2019s performance. Once installed, it hijacks your computer's resources, including the CPU and GPU, to secretly mine cryptocurrency. This process requires a lot of computational power, which can cause your system to slow down drastically. You might notice your computer becoming unresponsive, running hotter than usual, or consuming more power.",
      "In some cases, prolonged use of cryptominers can also lead to hardware damage due to the increased strain on your components. Additionally, these miners often run in the background without your knowledge, making it harder to detect the issue until the damage is already done.",
      "CrowdStrike is aware of the scam and advises individuals to stay vigilant.\u00a0\"This campaign highlights the importance of vigilance against phishing scams, particularly those targeting job seekers. Individuals in the recruitment process should verify the authenticity of CrowdStrike communications and avoid downloading unsolicited files,\" the\u00a0company said in a blog post.",

      "5 ways to stay safe from job interview scams",
      "1. Check if you applied for the job: If you receive an unsolicited interview invitation, think back to whether you actually applied for that job or company. Scammers often target jobseekers randomly, hoping someone takes the bait. If you didn't apply, it's likely a scam. Always confirm directly with the company before proceeding.",
      "2. Verify recruiter credentials:\u00a0Always double-check the recruiter\u2019s details before responding to an email or clicking any links. Verify their email address, LinkedIn profile and company association. Legitimate companies will use official email domains, not free services like Gmail or Yahoo.",
      "3. Avoid downloading unsolicited files:\u00a0Be cautious of emails asking you to download any files or applications. Legitimate recruitment processes rarely require you to install software. If unsure, contact the company directly to confirm the request.",
      "4. Inspect links before clicking:\u00a0Hover over any links in the email to see their actual URL. Scammers often use URLs that mimic legitimate sites but have subtle differences. If a link looks suspicious, avoid clicking on it.",
      "5. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Use strong antivirus or endpoint protection software to detect and block malicious downloads. Regularly update your security tools to ensure they can handle new threats effectively.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "Cybercriminals always manage to come up with new ways to exploit people. While this particular scam is more focused on using your computer\u2019s resources than stealing data, it is still very dangerous. It shows that if a hacker can easily install software on your PC, they can also go ahead and steal your financial information and other personal data. Always verify the emails you receive, and try not to download anything you don\u2019t trust.",

Elastic Security Labs first highlighted this malware in mid-2024, noting that it operates as malware-as-a-service, a business model in which cybercriminals provide access to malicious software and related infrastructure for a fee. At that time, it was available for as much as $3,000 per month.",
      "Check Point says this malware evolved in September after being exposed. This time, its developers had \"stolen\" a string encryption algorithm from Apple\u2019s own XProtect antivirus engine, which replaced the plain text strings used in the original version. Since antivirus programs expect to see this kind of encryption from Apple\u2019s legitimate security tools, they weren\u2019t flagged as suspicious, allowing the BanShee to remain undetected and quietly steal data from targeted devices.",

This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2)\u00a0Be cautious with downloads and links: Only download software from reputable sources such as the Mac App Store or official websites of trusted developers. Be wary of unsolicited emails or messages prompting you to download or install updates, especially if they contain links. Phishing attempts often disguise themselves as legitimate update notifications or urgent messages.",
      "3)\u00a0Keep your software updated: Ensure that both macOS and all installed applications are up to date. Apple frequently releases security patches and updates that address vulnerabilities. Enable automatic updates for macOS and your apps to stay protected without having to manually check for updates. If you need more help, see my\u00a0guide on keeping all your devices updated.",
      "4)\u00a0Use strong and unique passwords:\u00a0To protect your Mac from malware, it\u2019s also crucial to use strong, unique passwords for all your accounts and devices. Avoid reusing passwords across different sites or services. A\u00a0password manager can be incredibly helpful here; it generates and stores complex passwords for you, making them difficult for hackers to crack.",
      "It also keeps track of all your passwords in one place and automatically fills them in when you log into accounts, so you don\u2019t have to remember them yourself. By reducing the number of passwords you need to recall, you\u2019re less likely to reuse them, which lowers the risk of security breaches.

      "No device is immune to cyberattacks when a human operator is involved. Take the BanShee Stealer, for example. It managed to target Macs not due to weak cybersecurity measures by Apple but because it successfully tricked users into installing it and granting the required permissions. Most breaches, hacks and other cyberattacks stem from human error. This highlights the importance of maintaining basic cybersecurity hygiene. It's crucial to know what you\u2019re downloading, ensure it\u2019s from a trusted source and carefully review the permissions you grant to any online service or application.",

    "summary": "Tech expert Kurt \u201cCyberGuy&quot; Knutsson reveals that hackers stole data from Gravy Analytics, a major seller of smartphone location data to the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "When we talk about data privacy, tech giants like Google and Facebook are often blamed for using personal data to show ads and recommendations. Less discussed are the businesses whose entire business model revolves around collecting your data and selling it to other companies and governments. These companies often operate in legal gray areas, with the consent required to collect user data buried deep in the fine print.",
      "What\u2019s even more concerning is that these data brokers fail to adequately protect the data they collect. Last year, National Public Data made headlines for\u00a0failing to secure 2.7 billion records of individuals whose data it had harvested. Now, hackers have reportedly stolen data from Gravy Analytics, the parent company of Venntel, which has sold vast amounts of smartphone location data to the U.S. government.",

The compromise is massive, including sensitive location data that tracks precise smartphone movements, customer information and even internal infrastructure, according to a\u00a0404 Media report.",
      "The hackers are threatening to make the stolen data public. The files contain precise latitude and longitude coordinates of the phone and the time at which the phone was there. Some even indicate what country the data has been collected from.",
      "Hackers have claimed access to Gravy's systems since 2018. If true, this represents a serious security lapse on the company\u2019s part. It is baffling how companies that collect and sell user data (a practice that arguably shouldn\u2019t be allowed in the first place) failed to protect it from being leaked.",
      "404 Media also suggests that the hackers gained deep access to the company\u2019s infrastructure, including Amazon S3 buckets and server root access.

      "What this breach means for people",
      "This data breach highlights the serious security flaws in the location data industry. Companies like Gravy Analytics and Venntel have been profiting from collecting and selling sensitive location data, often without proper user consent. They've prioritized profit over security, and now the privacy of millions is at risk. This data could end up on black markets, endangering individuals, especially those in vulnerable situations, by making them targets for harassment or worse.",
      "The FTC's recent crackdown on Gravy, announced in December, underscores their negligence. The proposed order will prohibit these companies from selling or using location data, except in specific cases like national security or law enforcement. The implications are worrying. Sensitive locations like schools and workplaces could become easy targets for those with malicious intent.",

      "The Gravy Analytics breach serves as a sobering reminder of the vulnerabilities in the digital age. While it\u2019s impossible to control how every company handles data, you can take steps to minimize your exposure and protect your privacy. Here are five actionable tips to stay safe.",
      "1) Limit app permissions: Many apps request access to location data, contacts and more, even when it's not necessary for their functionality. Regularly review the permissions for apps on your smartphone and revoke access to anything that feels excessive. For instance, a weather app doesn\u2019t need access to your microphone or camera.",
      "2) Use a VPN:\u00a0Virtual private networks (VPNs) can mask your IP address and encrypt your internet activity, making it harder for data brokers and hackers to track your online behavior. A good VPN adds an extra layer of security, especially when using public Wi-Fi networks.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Opt out of data sharing where possible:\u00a0Some companies allow you to opt out of having your data collected or shared. Services like Your Ad Choices and privacy settings within platforms like Google can help you reduce the amount of data collected. Check for opt-out options with any apps or services you use frequently.",
      "4)\u00a0Avoid free apps that monetize data: Free apps often generate revenue by selling user data. Instead, consider paid versions of apps that explicitly prioritize privacy. Research the company behind the app to understand its data handling policies before downloading.",
      "5) Invest in data removal services:\u00a0Data removal services can help you regain some control over your personal information by identifying and removing it from people-search websites, data broker platforms and other online databases.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "WHAT TO DO IF YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IS HACKED",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Companies that collect and sell user data pose a significant threat to privacy, and when they fail to protect this data, it often ends up in the hands of even worse actors. Cybercriminals, and even some governments, can exploit this information to target individuals. It is crucial to implement stringent repercussions for these companies when they fail in their duty to safeguard user data. A mere slap on the wrist is not enough. We need real accountability to deter negligence and protect individual privacy rights.",

      "13) Try out the new Passwords app",
      "I always stress the importance of using a password manager to store your passwords. Let\u2019s be honest, we all have a ton of apps and services that require an account and password. If you use the same password everywhere, you risk having your important info stolen by cybercriminals. But it\u2019s also impossible to come up with a unique password for every app and remember them all.",
      "Password managers make life easier by storing your passwords and filling them in when you log into apps. But they usually charge a monthly or yearly fee. That\u2019s where Apple\u2019s Passwords app comes in. It works just like a password manager but without the extra cost. Open the app from the App Library, and it\u2019ll keep your login details encrypted and synced across all your devices.",
      "While Apple's new Passwords app in iOS 18 offers a convenient and cost-free solution for password management, it's important to consider its limitations. These include its exclusivity to the Apple ecosystem, lack of compatibility with Android or Linux devices and limited functionality outside of Safari and Apple apps. For those seeking a more comprehensive password management solution that works across various browsers and apps, check out my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",

      "German automaker Volkswagen isn't having a great time. The company is planning to cut capacity at five factories, reducing production by about 700,000 vehicles, while also laying off more than 35,000 workers in its home country. Now, reports suggest the company had a massive data leak at its subsidiary software company Cariad, which exposed personal data, including geolocation data, of around 800,000 EV owners online and accessible for months. Such information could be valuable to criminals for extortion purposes. What's interesting is that a hacker association informed the company about this data leak after receiving a tip from an anonymous hacker.",

      "What you need to know about the data leak",
      "As reported by Germany\u2019s Der Spiegel magazine, Volkswagen is facing a major data security issue after movement data from 800,000 electric cars and the personal contact information of their owners were left exposed on the internet. This data revealed sensitive details, such as the precise locations where cars were parked, including private locations like people\u2019s homes, government buildings and even questionable spots like brothels.",
      "The exposed data includes detailed movement patterns of these vehicles, allowing for the creation of comprehensive profiles of individuals' daily activities. This could be particularly concerning for public figures or anyone with privacy concerns.",
      "Several car brands under the Volkswagen group, including VW, Audi, Seat and Skoda, were affected by the breach, which exposed sensitive data across multiple countries. The information was stored on Amazon cloud servers without adequate protection, leaving it vulnerable for months before the issue was discovered.",
      "For around 466,000 of the 800,000 affected vehicles, the location data was detailed enough to map out drivers\u2019 daily routines. Spiegel reported that the list of affected users included German politicians, business leaders, the entire EV fleet used by Hamburg police and even suspected intelligence agents.",
      "The breach came to light when an anonymous hacker tipped off the Chaos Computer Club. While Volkswagen left the data easily accessible during this time, there is no indication so far that anyone misused or accessed it maliciously.",
      "We reached out to Volkswagen for comment but did not hear back by our deadline.",

      "How can this data leak affect you?",
      "The Volkswagen data leak is more than just a tech issue. It is a real concern for anyone who values their privacy. With precise location data out in the open, someone could figure out where you live, work or spend your free time. This information could be misused in many ways, from targeted scams where hackers pretend to be Volkswagen or its partners to trick you into giving up sensitive information, to more personal threats like stalking or harassment.",
      "Imagine someone knowing your daily routine or identifying places you visit that you would prefer to keep private. Visits to clinics, legal offices or other sensitive locations could expose you to embarrassment or blackmail.",
      "The breach also raises concerns for business leaders, government officials and military personnel as their movements linked to high-security or restricted areas could be exposed, increasing the risk of corporate espionage or national security threats. Moreover, when paired with other vulnerabilities, such as app credentials, hackers could potentially exploit the data to unlock or even control vehicles remotely.",

      "THE ONE SIMPLE TRICK TO HELP KEEP OUT CYBER CREEPS ON IPHONE",
      "In light of the recent Volkswagen data breach, it is crucial to take proactive measures to safeguard your personal data. Here are 6 ways you can stay safe after this leak:",
      "1) Check your app settings:\u00a0Review the permissions and data-sharing settings in your car's companion app. Disable features that track or share your location if they are not essential for your use. Regularly update the app to ensure you have the latest security patches.",
      "2) Be alert to scams:\u00a0Keep an eye out for suspicious emails, messages or calls pretending to be from Volkswagen or related services. Avoid clicking on links or sharing sensitive information without verifying the sender.",
      "3) Consider data opt-out options:\u00a0Many vehicles with online features allow you to limit or disable certain data-sharing functionalities. Check your car\u2019s settings to reduce the amount of personal data being collected.",
      "4) Strengthen your online accounts:\u00a0If you use the same email or password across multiple accounts, update them immediately. Enable\u00a0two-factor authentication wherever possible to add an extra layer of security to your accounts.",
      "5) Beware of snail mail scams: While most people focus on digital threats, physical mail scams can also follow a data breach like this. If your contact information was exposed, you might receive fraudulent letters pretending to be from Volkswagen or related services. These could ask for payments, personal details or even encourage you to visit fake websites.",
      "6) Install strong antivirus software: Ensure that you have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices, especially those connected to your vehicle or its apps. This can help protect you from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Volkswagen data leak is a glaring example of how companies need to take user data security more seriously. Exposing personal details and precise locations is not just a technical mistake. It is a massive breach of trust. While VW has patched the issue, the damage shows how important it is for businesses to be more responsible with the data they collect. People deserve to know their information is safe and used only when necessary. If companies cannot protect their customers\u2019 privacy, they risk losing their confidence altogether. It is time for the industry to step up and do better.",

      "Aerodynamic design: The Starship 3.0 features a sleek design with curved edges and optimized aerodynamics that reduce wind resistance. Additional enhancements like low rolling resistance tires and integrated aerodynamic panels further contribute to its efficiency.",
      "Advanced lubricants: Shell has developed specialized lubricants tailored for the higher temperatures generated by natural gas engines. The truck uses Shell Rotella NG Plus SAE 5W-30 synthetic oil, formulated specifically for this purpose, alongside advanced transmission lubricants that improve overall performance.",
      "Real-world testing: The input from experienced truck drivers, such as brothers Brian and Eric Rector, has been invaluable in refining the Starship's design and functionality. Their hands-on experience with all three iterations of the truck has provided critical data that informs ongoing improvements.",

      "\"Lone wolf actors are always extremely significant to law enforcement personnel who are trying to safeguard the people that are attending these events,\" Sergeant Matthew Fagiana, a retired patrol commander with over 25 years of experience with law enforcement, told Fox News Digital. \"One of the reasons that they're always a concern is they can be very unpredictable, and they are driven by extremist ideologies.\"",
      "The threat of potential lone wolf actors was heightened after a machete-wielding suspect attempted to get through a magnetometer and X-ray security screen as Trump was paying respect to former President Carter. The 44-year-old suspect was granted a conditional pre-trial release after a hearing just days prior to Trump's inauguration.",
      "\"Federal partners that are tasked with intelligence gathering, the folks that are tasked with protecting the dignitaries that are present on Monday, are going to know where this individual is,\" Fagiana said. \"It's not like he's out of sight, out of mind. And that goes to the same for anybody that has made a credible threat. They're going to make sure that they know where that person is.\"",

      "Fagiana noted that some events moving inside, such as Trump's swearing-in ceremony being moved indoors due to record-lows, will assist authorities. Former President Reagan\u2019s second inauguration in 1985 was the first time a president took the oath in the Capitol's Rotunda.",

      "The ACLU of Vermont and Pregnancy Justice, a national advocacy group, filed the lawsuit on Wednesday against the Vermont Department for Children and Families, a counseling center and the hospital where the woman gave birth in February 2022.",
      "In the lawsuit, the state also faces accusations that it routinely tracks pregnant women deemed unsuitable to be mothers.",

The state began investigating and eventually spoke to the woman\u2019s counselor, midwife and a hospital social worker without her knowledge, even though it had no jurisdiction over fetuses.",
      "The woman remained unaware of the probe until she gave birth and her daughter was immediately taken away, according to ACLU senior staff attorney Harrison Stark.",
      "A.V. had no knowledge that hospital officials were giving updates to the state while she was in labor, including details of her cervix dilation, and that she had lost temporary custody of her baby. The state even sought a court order forcing the woman to undergo a cesarean section, although it was rendered moot because she agreed to the surgery.",

      "\"It\u2019s a horrific set of circumstances for our client,\" Stark said. \"It\u2019s also clear from what has happened that this is not the first time the agency has done this. We have learned from several confidential sources that DCF has a pattern and practice of looking into folks like our client who are pregnant, who are of interest to the agency based on a set of unofficial criteria and who the agency is tracking on what is called a 'high risk pregnancy docket' or 'high risk pregnancy calendar.'\"",

      "He was Donald Trump\u2019s man in the room as the ceasefire and hostage release deal was forged between Israel and Hamas, but Steve Witkoff is no diplomat despite his appointment as the president-elect\u2019s special envoy to the Middle East.",
      "Instead, he brought to the negotiating table decades of experience clinching some of New York\u2019s biggest real estate deals, as well as opening up about his very personal loss during the arduous talks.",
      "Born in the Bronx, the billionaire real estate developer could hardly have a more different profile from those of the American diplomats who usually craft complicated international agreements. Witkoff, 67, was raised in Long Island and trained as a real estate lawyer before charting a path in the rough-and-tumble world of New York real estate development.",
      "He has known Trump for decades, is a Republican donor and served on one of Trump\u2019s Great American Economic Revival Industry Groups to combat the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. He\u2019s also going to be one of the speakers at Trump\u2019s pre-inauguration rally Sunday, alongside Hulk Hogan, Megyn Kelly, Elon Musk and others.",
      "Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani made a clear reference to Witkoff, who is Jewish and has done business throughout the Middle East, during a Wednesday press conference confirming that a Hamas-Israel ceasefire deal had been reached.",
      "\u201cWhat we have seen from the U.S. in the past few days, seeing a collaboration transcending both administrations, was a clear demonstration for the commitment of the U.S. to reach to that deal,\u201d Sheikh Mohammed, a key mediator in the talks, told the crowd of reporters and dignitaries, which included Witkoff himself. \u201cAnd I really would like to thank both the envoys who are here with us in the last couple of days, and they played a vital role in reaching to this moment.\u201d",
      "A senior administration official close to the negotiations also told NBC News that Witkoff had been \u201cvery helpful, in particular ironing out a couple of issues\u201d on the \u201cvery complex deal.\u201d They added that he had been \u201cworking seamlessly\u201d on the effort with Brett McGurk, the White House coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa.",
      "\u201cI have to say, Brett McGurk has been very fortunate to have been joined in these last 96 hours by Steve Witkoff\u201d in what \u201chas really been a historic and crucial partnership between the two of them to help nail down some of the final arrangements,\u201d the official said.",
      "Witkoff brought \u201ca new energy and a new dynamic\u201d to the table, a person familiar with the negotiations said in a separate interview before the deal was announced. \u201cHe\u2019s very much engaged and his heart is in the right place.\u201d",
      "A Middle Eastern diplomat who spoke with NBC News on condition of anonymity said Witkoff, as well as being a tough negotiator, talked about his son Andrew, who died of an OxyContin overdose in 2011 at age 22, telling \u201cofficials he empathizes with parents who have lost children on both sides.\u201d",
      "Neither Witkoff nor his office responded to requests for comment on this story."

    "published": "Sat, 18 Jan 2025 23:01:58 GMT",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, is considering a visit to the war-torn Gaza Strip as part of his efforts to keep a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas on track, according to a transition official with direct knowledge of the ceasefire process.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, is considering a visit to the war-torn Gaza Strip as part of his efforts to keep a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas on track, according to a transition official with direct knowledge of the ceasefire process.",
      "Underscoring just how fragile the president-elect\u2019s team believes the ceasefire deal that\u2019s set to go into effect on Sunday is, Witkoff also plans to be a near-constant presence in the region over the coming weeks and months to troubleshoot flare-ups on the ground that he believes could unravel the agreement and halt the release of hostages held by Hamas at any moment, the official said.",
      "\u201cYou have to be right on top of it, ready to snuff out a problem if it happens,\u201d the official said.",
      "At the same time, Witkoff is working to achieve long-term stability for the Israelis and 2 million displaced Palestinians, the path to which runs through the three phases of the deal reached this past week.",
      "The first phase, which begins on Sunday, is set to last about six weeks and involves the release of hostages held by Hamas and Palestinians held by Israel. The second phase would be negotiated during the first and is supposed to result in the release of additional hostages and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. The goal of the final phase, which also still needs to be negotiated, is to end the war and begin rebuilding Gaza.",
      "During Hamas\u2019 initial Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel, 1,200 people were killed and about 250 were taken hostage. The attack shocked the nation and sent many Israelis who believed they had military superiority in the region reeling.",
      "Since then, the conflict has added multiple fronts, with Israel seeking to root out Iranian and Iran-backed enemies in other countries around it.",
      "For now, a top concern for Trump\u2019s envoy is a rogue incident sparked by inevitable day-to-day interfacing between Israelis and Palestinians on the ground in and near Gaza, even given the ceasefire agreement.",
      "\u201cRemember, there\u2019s a lot of people, radicals, fanatics, not just from the Hamas side, from the right wing of the Israeli side, who are absolutely incentivized to blow this whole deal up,\u201d the transition official said.",
      "Visiting Gaza would allow Witkoff to see for himself what the dynamics are there, rather than taking Israel\u2019s or the Palestinians\u2019 word for it, the official said, adding: \u201cYou got to see it, you got to feel it.\u201d",
      "While managing the current phase of the deal and negotiating the next, Trump and his team also are contending with longer-term solutions.",
      "\u201cIf we don\u2019t help the Gazans, if we don\u2019t make their life better, if we don\u2019t give them a sense of hope, there\u2019s going to be a rebellion,\u201d the transition official said.",
      "The question of how to rebuild Gaza remains, as well as where some 2 million Palestinians can be relocated in the meantime. Indonesia, for instance, is among the locations under discussion for where some of them could go, the transition official said.",
      "Even the question of whether Gazans would be willing to relocate is up in the air. The idea of relocation is deeply controversial among Palestinians and fellow Arabs. Many believe that relocating would be the first step in Israel forcing them off their land.",
      "At the moment, however, the issue of getting aid into Gaza that\u2019s required in the first phase of the ceasefire deal remains a challenge. Israel maintains concerns that Hamas takes a portion of any aid that\u2019s allowed into Gaza, and the humanitarian crisis there is dire. Hunger and disease are rampant and conditions are continuing to deteriorate.",
      "Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza over the last year and a half has killed more than 45,000 people in Gaza, most of whom were women and children, according to Palestinian health officials. The bombings have also decimated the enclave\u2019s health system and pushed people out of their homes and into squalid tent camps.",
      "Witkoff, a real estate developer who has known Trump for decades, went into negotiations for a deal \u2014 joining President Joe Biden\u2019s team that\u2019s been working toward it for more than a year \u2014 with a singular directive from Trump, the transition official said: Get the hostages home, and if you don\u2019t, come back and explain why.",
      "The window for achieving an agreement was narrower than it had ever been. Not only had Trump set a deadline \u2014 Jan. 20, when he\u2019s set to be sworn in to office \u2014 which had not been done in previous rounds of negotiation,\u00a0several additional hostages had died in the preceding weeks\u00a0as temperatures in the region got colder and conditions continued to deteriorate,\u00a0the transition official said.",
      "Trump\u2019s close alliance with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as well as the threat that he would not stop Israel from further bombing Gaza if there was no deal, also hung over the process.",
      "Israel is a close American ally and the U.S. has given the nation at least $17.9 billion in military aid over the last year.",
      "Witkoff used Trump\u2019s history with Israel and dynamic with Netanyahu to pressure the Israelis. In one instance, he went to see the prime minister on the Sabbath to have a blunt exchange.\u00a0Witkoff privately has told people his comments to Netanyahu that Saturday, Jan. 11, were not a threat, and that he had been invited to the prime minister\u2019s residence by one of Netanyahu\u2019s closest aides, Ron Dermer.",
      "Witkoff was in search of a reality check from Netanyahu about what he was willing to do, and candidly told him what was needed to get to an agreement, including for Israel to send a high-level representative to the negotiations in Doha who could make decisions in real time, the transition official said. He essentially conveyed to the prime minister, \u201cIf you\u2019re not intent on making a deal, then tell me, and I\u2019ll get on the plane and I\u2019ll go home.\u201d",
      "In discussions with Israeli officials, he also didn\u2019t hesitate to point out all that Trump had done for Israel. In his first term, Trump moved the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, recognized the Golan Heights as Israeli territory and cut U.S. aid for the Palestinians. At times in his discussions with Israeli officials, he also pointed to Trump\u2019s willingness to take political heat to get a deal and implored the Israelis to do the same.",
      "To Hamas, the message, delivered through the Qataris, was: Unless you\u2019re prepared to die, tell me why you don\u2019t see this as the deal that could ultimately lead to the end of the war?",
      "Witkoff also developed close ties with the families of hostages. They expressed worry that their loved ones would be left behind in the second phase of the deal, when they are supposed to be released, specifically concerned whether there would be enough Palestinian prisoners held by Israel to exchange: The numbers were built into the framework deal agreed to last May, and if there\u2019s no Phase 1, there can be no Phase 2,\u00a0which has yet to be negotiated.",
      "Phase 1 could fall apart at any time over the next six weeks, and the first American hostage, Keith Siegel, is not scheduled to be released until Day 14 of the ceasefire. Five other American families will not get their children home, alive or dead, unless the ceasefire holds into the second phase."

      "TEL AVIV \u2014 For eight months, the framework of the ceasefire deal that could bring an end to the war between Israel and Hamas had been on the table, prompting fury about the delay among some, and now praise for President-elect Donald Trump for helping to get it over the line.",
      "President Joe Biden confirmed in a statement Wednesday that the deal was based on the \u201cprecise contours\u201d of a May 2024 ceasefire plan that was \u201cendorsed unanimously\u201d by the United Nations Security Council. He also credited the work of key negotiators, including Egypt and Qatar, and \u201cextreme pressure\u201d on Hamas for helping to secure the truce.",
      "While U.S. officials have credited the collaboration between Trump\u2019s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, and Biden\u2019s Middle East representative Brett McGurk for securing the deal, the president-elect sought to claim much of the credit for himself on Thursday.",
      "Biden \u201cdidn\u2019t do anything,\u201d he said in an interview on \u201cThe Dan Bongino Show.\u201d\u00a0\u201cIf I didn\u2019t do this, if we didn\u2019t get involved, the hostages would never be out.\u201d",
      "The deal could soon bring an end to more than 15 months of war in Gaza that began on Oct. 7, 2023, with Hamas attacks on Israel in which roughly 1,200 people were killed and around 240 people taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict. Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza has killed more than 46,500 people since then, according to health officials in the enclave.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked Trump directly for his role in the negotiations in a phone call Wednesday, Netanyahu\u2019s office said in a statement. Afterward, he thanked Biden in a separate call, the statement added.",
      "For David Mencer, a spokesman for Netanyahu, it was Hamas that had changed its stance since the deal was first tabled in May. The death of its leader Yahya Sinwar, who was confirmed killed by Israeli forces in October, had also played a role, he said in a voice note Friday.",
      "\u201cWhat changed was that Hamas had been heavily degraded,\u201d he said, adding that most of its leadership had been \u201celiminated\u201d and \u201ctheir weapons stockpile has been wiped out.\u201d",
      "In an interview with NBC\u2019s \u201cTODAY\u201d on Thursday, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby also said, \u201cWhat really got us to this point was the isolating and weakening of Hamas.\u201d Previously, Hamas had thrown up obstacles to the deal \u201ctime and time again\u201d and \u201cwasn\u2019t willing to negotiate in good faith,\u201d he added.",
      "Trump\u2019s support for the deal had \u201ccertainly helped,\u201d but \u201cwe need to stop worrying about this whole credit business and who gets credit for what,\u201d he said.",
      "Asher Kaufman, a professor of history and peace studies at Indiana\u2019s University of Notre Dame, also noted that progress in the talks came amid a shifting landscape in the Middle East, although he did attribute the success to Trump.",
      "\u201cIt has to be remembered that the world, the region has changed with the weakening of Hezbollah, the weakening of Iran, the fall of Assad,\u201d he said in a phone interview on Thursday. \u201cThere are changing dynamics ... which facilitate the possibility of such an arrangement.\u201d",
      "Nonetheless, he said, he believed that ultimately Trump was \u201cthe game changer in a sense, because of the relationship between him and Netanyahu.\u201d",
      "Inside Israel, many are crediting the \u201cTrump effect\u201d for the breakthrough.",
      "Among them is Efrat Machikawa, whose 80-year-old uncle Gadi Moses remains in captivity. \u201cI\u2019m very grateful for the Biden administration for the very long period where they tried, but I have to say the Trump effect is great,\u201d Machikawa, 56, said Friday.",
      "Machikawa, 56, added that she had not received any news about her uncle for months, but he is\u00a0on the list of the 33 hostages expected to be released in the first phase of the ceasefire deal. Not knowing his fate was \u201cjust terrible,\u201d she said.",
      "Trump was also credited as the \u201cX factor\u201d that got the deal over the line by Gil Dickmann, whose cousin Carmel Gat was taken hostage and killed in Gaza. Dickmann said in an interview Wednesday that the only thing that had changed since May was \u201cthat Carmel is now dead and Trump is now president, and now we have a deal.\u201d",
      "In Gaza, the death toll has risen by more than 11,500 since May, according to Palestinian tallies, although researchers have warned that the death toll is likely significantly higher than official numbers suggest and thousands of people are feared buried under the rubble.",
      "Even Gershon Baskin, an Israeli who has acted as a mediator with Hamas for decades, credited Trump for the success, although he said it was \u201cdisgusting\u201d that a truce has only come to fruition eight months after it was first tabled.",
      "Pointing to the fact that thousands of Palestinians and several hostages were killed in Gaza in the intervening period, Baskin, a frequent critic of Netanyahu\u2019s government, said it was \u201coutrageous\u201d that it had taken so long.",
      "\u201cIt was only really accepted in the end because Trump came along and Trump told Netanyahu to do it,\u201d added the seasoned negotiator, who helped to secure the release of captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit more than a decade ago.",
      "Just as it seemed ready to be approved, the deal appeared to hit a roadblock after Netanyahu\u2019s office claimed Hamas had reneged on part of the agreement \u2014 an accusation the group strongly denied.",
      "However, in the early hours of Friday morning, Nentanyahu\u2019s office said he would seek approval for a deal from his security Cabinet and then his full Cabinet. Israel\u2019s Supreme Court would then have 24 hours to permit an appeal.",
      "If all goes to plan, the deal will come into effect as early as this Sunday, the day before Trump\u2019s inauguration.",
      "But Baskin said he feared a \u201cdifficult process\u201d in seeing the three-phase ceasefire deal enforced in the months ahead.",
      "\u201cThe crucial thing is that it has to be implemented now,\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "Leaders of several sanctuary cities where officials had prominently rejected Donald Trump\u2019s first-term immigration policies are shifting their tone as he prepares to take office again and carry out his mass deportation plans.",
      "Some local officials have softened on how closely they want their cities to be identified with the \u201csanctuary city\u201d label and have pledged to work with federal immigration authorities. But others have doubled down on their cities being sanctuaries for undocumented immigrants and reject any notion that they\u2019d cooperate with a Trump administration seeking to deport millions of them.",
      "The mixed approaches of officials in some of the largest and heavily Democratic cities in the U.S. underscore the country\u2019s shifting politics on immigration. While leaders in these cities largely \u2014 and often loudly \u2014 rejected Trump\u2019s immigration policies when he was last in the White House, some are now willing to work more closely with his administration on a top priority or tamp down their rhetoric.",
      "In Philadelphia, Mayor Cherelle Parker and District Attorney Larry Krasner, both Democrats, seem to have shied away from some of the rhetoric celebrating the city as a sanctuary \u2014 as well as the oppositional approach city officials took in the past.",
      "Asked whether he still considered Philadelphia a sanctuary city, Krasner did not directly answer.",
      "\u201cSanctuary city can mean a lot of things, and so that whole discussion can get confusing and maybe generate more heat than light,\u201d he said in an interview with NBC News. Krasner said Philadelphia was a \u201ccity of brotherhood, of love, of sisterly affection, where we respect and support our immigrant neighbors who are hardworking and are law-abiding and are contributing to our society.\u201d",
      "Krasner added that he would \u201cfollow the law, uphold the Constitution, and whatever that says we have to do, we\u2019re going to do.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo the extent that ICE has the legal right to do things, obviously we will not interfere,\u201d he said, but added that if \u201cICE agents do things that are crimes, they\u2019re going to have a problem.\u201d",
      "Sanctuary city is not an official term. Rather, it refers to a city, county or municipality that has enacted laws that either explicitly or effectively prevent or limit local officials from cooperating with federal immigration authorities as part of a broader effort to make undocumented immigrants feel safe.",
      "Parker, the mayor, was asked during an interview last week with NBC10 in Philadelphia if she considered Philly a sanctuary city. She danced around the question, replying, \u201cI believe that in America, our diversity is by far our greatest strength.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re a city made up of neighborhoods, and I too believe that our diversity is our greatest strength,\u201d she said.",
      "Asked by NBC News whether Parker identified Philadelphia as a sanctuary city, and whether city authorities would cooperate with ICE and the Trump administration if they move forward with deporting undocumented immigrants, her spokesperson also declined to answer directly.",
      "\u201cAs Mayor Parker made abundantly clear after the November election, the Parker Administration remains laser-focused on the agenda that Philadelphians elected her to implement: making Philadelphia a safer, cleaner, greener City, with access to economic opportunity for all,\u201d the spokesperson, Joe Grace, said in an email to NBC News.",
      "Grace added that the city\u2019s 2016 executive order on ICE detainers remains in place. In 2016, Jim Kenney, then the mayor of Philadelphia, signed an executive order barring the city from honoring some ICE detainers (a detainer is a request that local officials hold an immigrant who is due to be released from custody for an additional 48 hours to allow ICE to take them into its custody).",
      "While that policy remains in place, the cautious tone struck by Parker and Krasner marks a notable departure from the one city officials struck during Trump\u2019s first term. Kenney, for example, was caught on camera singing and dancing gleefully in 2018 after a judge ruled in favor of the city\u2019s sanctuary policies.",
      "New York City\u2019s yearslong immigration pivot",
      "In New York City, a shift on immigration policy has been underway for several years. Democratic Mayor Eric Adams, who met with Trump in Florida on Friday, has indicated his interest in working with the incoming administration, including on immigration issues.",
      "New York has struggled to cope with a surge in migrant arrivals in recent years \u2014 a \u201ccrisis\u201d that would \u201cdestroy\u201d the city, Adams said in 2023. Adams repeatedly criticized the Biden administration on the issue, saying it hadn\u2019t done enough to help New York and other cities. He also met with incoming border czar Tom Homan in December.",
      "While Adams continues to call New York a sanctuary city, he has signaled a desire to change the city\u2019s laws in a way that would allow city officials to cooperate with federal immigration and law enforcement officials to deport undocumented immigrants with criminal records. Last month, he said migrants accused of crimes should not necessarily receive due process.",
      "His broader approach is a stark contrast from that of his predecessor, Bill de Blasio, who was New York City\u2019s mayor during Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "In 2014, when Barack Obama was president, de Blasio, a Democrat, helped enact laws that significantly hampered city law enforcement officials from working with ICE agents seeking to deport undocumented immigrants. Throughout the Trump administration, he expanded some of those laws to make it even more difficult for ICE agents to deport undocumented immigrants.",
      "Adams spokesperson Liz Garcia said the mayor \u201chas been clear that New York City will always be a city of immigrants, which is why the Adams administration has worked diligently over the past few months to ensure city staff has the most accurate, up-to-date information on how to uphold our sanctuary city laws.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe also continue to work with immigrant New Yorkers to ensure they know their rights around federal immigration enforcement,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cOur administration is doing the work to provide for immigrant communities across the city.\u201d",
      "Other local Democratic leaders say they won\u2019t be \u2018bullied\u2019",
      "Meanwhile, leaders in other big sanctuary cities have maintained an aggressively oppositional posture to the incoming Trump administration on immigration issues.",
      "In the weeks following Trump\u2019s victory in November, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, a Democrat, said the city \u201cwill not bend or break\u201d on its sanctuary laws.",
      "He told The Washington Post in November that \u201cthere will not be any cooperation\u201d with ICE deportations.",
      "And last week, the Chicago City Council voted down\u00a0a proposal that would have eased laws barring city officials from cooperating with federal immigration authorities who are targeting individuals involved in certain violent and drug-related crimes.",
      "Responding to questions on the issue from NBC News, Johnson spokesperson Erin Connelly forwarded a recent press release that stated, \u201cThe City of Chicago and Mayor Brandon Johnson\u2019s Administration reaffirm our commitment to the welcoming city ordinance.\u201d Chicago\u2019s sanctuary policies are part of that ordinance.",
      "NBC News reported that ICE officials are planning a major enforcement operation in Chicago following Trump's inauguration.",
      "Denver Mayor Mike Johnston, a Democrat, has been even more outspoken on preserving his city\u2019s sanctuary laws during the second Trump administration.",
      "\u201cWe won\u2019t change that, because those are one of our core values,\u201d Johnston told Colorado news website Denverite in November. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to sell out those values to anyone. We\u2019re not going to be bullied into changing them.\u201d",
      "In that interview, Johnston also raised the idea that Denver police, as well as Denver citizens, could band together to prevent federal immigration authorities from deporting undocumented immigrants.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like the Tiananmen Square moment with the rose and the gun, right?\u201d he said.",
      "Responding to questions from NBC News about Denver\u2019s status as a sanctuary city, and regarding the extent to which city officials might cooperate with ICE, Johnston spokesperson Jordan Fuja said in a statement: \u201cDenver defines itself as a welcoming city and we do have laws on the books, both city and state, that ensure that local police do not do the work of federal immigration enforcement. That\u2019s the federal government\u2019s job, not ours.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf Donald Trump tries to break the law and abuse his power, he will get no help from us,\u201d the statement said, adding that the mayor is \u201cconsidering a number of options to strengthen protections for all our residents.\u201d",
      "\u201cDenver is proud to be a welcoming city, and we will do everything in our power to protect those who live here,\u201d the statement continued."

      "\u201cWe\u2019re already geared up and it will begin,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to get the criminals that have come here illegally out of our country.\u201d",
      "A briefing for agents who plan to participate in the operation, called \u201cOperation Safeguard,\u201d was scheduled for Friday afternoon in Chicago, according to the document. It also says the operation will involve agents who were asked to volunteer and that more agents than needed have volunteered.",
      "The Wall Street Journal first reported that the operation is expected to occur in Chicago.",
      "Operations in other cities are also possible. Before NBC News\u00a0reviewed\u00a0the document, several sources familiar with the planning said major metropolitan areas that could see early enforcement actions include the Washington, D.C., area, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Denver and Chicago.",
      "As a candidate, Trump promised the largest deportation operation in American history. A 2022 federal estimate said that as many as 11 million\u00a0undocumented migrants lived in the U.S.,\u00a0but the exact number today is unknown.",
      "The American Immigration Council, a pro-immigration group, estimates that it could cost at least $315 billion to deport all of them. In addition to the costs, experts have warned that mass deportations could increase the price of some goods in the U.S. The federal government estimates that 40% of agricultural workers are undocumented immigrants.",
      "ICE currently has a $230 million budget shortfall and does not have the funding to carry out Trump\u2019s plans on a prolonged and widespread scale. Congress must first appropriate additional funds for enforcement operations and detention facilities.",
      "After arrest, migrants are held in detention before they are deported. According to ICE\u2019s website, there are currently no beds available in its detention facilities in Chicago.",
      "Tom Homan, Trump\u2019s incoming border czar, has said he would like at least 100,000 detention beds across the U.S.; currently, the U.S. has approximately 34,000.\u00a0And the highest number of people deported in a single year during Trump\u2019s first term was 267,000 in fiscal 2019.",
      "The Biden administration deported more people annually than the first Trump administration did in his first term. The highest number of people deported from the U.S. in a single year was 438,000 in fiscal 2013 during the Obama administration.",
      "Trump\u2019s apparent plans to target Democratic-run cities will also likely be met with political pushback. Responding to reports that the new administration could start deportation operations in Chicago, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said Friday that he will protect migrants if they are arrested unlawfully.",
      "\u201cWe have laws that protect people that are undocumented,\u201d Pritzker said. \u201cI am going to make sure to follow the law. I am concerned that the Trump administration and his lackeys aren\u2019t going to follow the law.\u201d",
      "Homan has told NBC News that the new administration is willing to take on the political fight and the fiscal costs of mass deportations. \u201cI think mass deportation and results of mass deportation are more important to this country than anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t put a price on our national security.\u201d"

    "published": "Sun, 19 Jan 2025 12:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Donald Trump has vowed to begin enacting the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history on Day 1 of his presidency, with one aide saying enforcement will begin \u201cthe moment that President Trump puts his hand on that Bible and takes the oath of office\u201d on Monday.",

      "Donald Trump has vowed to begin enacting the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history on Day 1 of his presidency, with one aide saying enforcement will begin \u201cthe moment that President Trump puts his hand on that Bible and takes the oath of office\u201d on Monday.",
      "But just how large that operation is and how swiftly it can be carried out will be determined, in part, by whether the administration can clear a number of hurdles, immigration experts said. Those include pushback from some cities and local law enforcement agencies, a budget and staffing shortfall for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, lawsuits from advocacy and civil rights groups, and questions about the cooperation of countries needed to increase removal numbers.",
      "There are currently an estimated 11 million people in the United States who lack legal status.",
      "\u201cI do not think that it will be possible to deport the entire unauthorized immigrant population,\u201d Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst with the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute, told NBC News.",
      "Trump\u2019s first administration removed unauthorized immigrants nearly 1.2 million times, according to data from the Department of Homeland Security. The Obama administration removed unauthorized immigrants 2.9 million times in his first term and 1.9 million in his second. The figures can include people who were deported more than once.",
      "\u201cThe first Trump administration didn\u2019t reach those levels partly because of decreased cooperation with local and state law enforcement, due to in many cases sanctuary policies and laws,\u201d Bush-Joseph said. \u201cThis time around, we have many sheriffs and local law enforcement departments on record saying either that they are willing to support the mass deportation plans or that they will not.\u201d",
      "She said she will be watching for a potential \u201cgrowing divide between red and blue states and localities.\u201d",
      "Democratic city and state leaders across the country have already promised to oppose Trump\u2019s plans, and in some cases have passed ordinances intended to shield undocumented immigrants from his efforts to deport them. Meanwhile, Texas has flexed its own law enforcement power at the border and positioned itself to be a key player in Trump\u2019s immigration agenda as other conservative states have passed anti-sanctuary policies.",
      "During the last decade, about 70% to 75% of arrests by ICE in the interior of the United States were handed over from other law enforcement agencies, including local and state jails as well as federal prison, according to the Immigrant Legal Resource Center.",
      "Rick Su, a law professor at the\u00a0University of North Carolina, said that \u201cfor Trump\u2019s policy to work, it may be that a lot of it is going to be coordination with the states.\u201d",
      "Trump officials have said they will take on localities that resist his plans and that the incoming president is considering withholding federal police grants from law enforcement agencies that decline to aid in deportations.",
      "Trump pursued a similar strategy during his first term but was met with significant legal hurdles. The question of what his administration can legally force states and localities to do remains an open question, Su said.",
      "If the courts rule in favor of Trump\u2019s ability to mobilize federal resources and push states and localities to comply, \u201cresidents may start turning against these things pretty dramatically,\u201d he said.",
      "As Trump\u2019s second administration unfolds, there could be efforts by some places to fully maintain their sanctuary status, while others could cooperate in cases deemed to be higher priority, such as those who have criminal backgrounds or are deemed national security threats, said Andrea Flores, the vice president of immigration policy and campaigns at FWD.us, which describes itself as a bipartisan organization that advocates for immigration reform.",
      "\u201cBut cities will continue to be a front-line defense because they\u2019ve had to provide a patchwork of protections for their population,\u201d said Flores, an immigration policy adviser to the Biden and Obama administrations.",
      "Trump told NBC News last month that his administration would first focus on deporting criminals and then expand its operations.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s ability to enact that plan at the pace and scale he seeks could also be hindered by legal action from civil rights and immigrant advocacy groups. While the specific legal strategies will depend on what actions Trump takes and if there are potential civil rights issues, the American Civil Liberties Union has said it is \u201cready to take action the minute Trump takes the oath of office.\u201d",
      "ICE budget shortfall",
      "Another potential major obstacle is the $230 million ICE budget shortfall, even before the costs associated with mass deportations, two U.S. officials familiar with the figure exclusively told NBC News in December.",
      "\u201cICE is already operating at a shortfall. Unless and until Congress provides a large amount of additional funding for the enforcement aspects of the mass deportation plans, it could really take time to ramp up,\u201d Bush-Joseph said.",
      "Negotiations on spending will begin in January, when Republicans have control of the White House and the Senate and narrow control of the House, but it remains unclear when and how Congress will agree to funding.",
      "\u201cThe fact is that even when Trump came in with his tough talk, he didn\u2019t dramatically increase deportations,\u201d Su said of Trump\u2019s first term. \u201cPart of that was resources, part of that was funding.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s mass deportation policy could cost more than an estimated $88 billion, according to the American Immigration Council, an immigration research and immigrant advocacy group. Trump previously told NBC News that there was \u201cno price tag\u201d when it came to his mass deportation plan.",
      "Tom Homan, Trump\u2019s pick for \u201cborder czar,\u201d previously told NBC News $86 billion would be a \u201cgreat start,\u201d and that he would like at least 100,000 detention beds. Currently, the U.S. has approximately 34,000.",
      "Outgoing ICE Director P.J. Lechleitner told NBC News earlier this month that the agency has nearly 8 million people on its nondetained docket, with one officer for more than every 7,000 cases. Of those, \u200b\u200b435,719 are known to have a criminal background as of September 2024, according to a letter to Congress from ICE, with 13,099 of them convicted of homicide and 15,811 convicted of sexual assault.",
      "Lechleitner said ICE has been \u201cchronically underfunded\u201d and needs more personnel and resources.",
      "He also said that with ICE\u2019s current resources, it would not be possible to increase the number of deportations.",
      "Cooperation from other countries",
      "Bush-Joseph said Trump \u201ccan\u2019t deport everyone, but if Congress does provide significant additional funding and the restrictive anticipated measures are allowed to go into effect, it is possible that the administration could ramp up deportations over the course of his term.\u201d",
      "Flores and Bush-Joseph said another barrier to mass deportations is the need for diplomatic agreements with other countries, as not all unauthorized immigrants can be deported to the countries they left.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an absolutely critical element of this mass deportations plan,\u201d Bush-Joseph said.",
      "\u201cThe Biden administration made a really concerted push in negotiating with other countries to get more to accept their nationals back,\u201d she said. \u201cThat includes a historic agreement with Mexico to take back third-country nationals, but in return for the establishment of lawful pathways, such as humanitarian parole processes.\u201d",
      "Trump has threatened to use tariffs to try to compel countries to take their nationals back, and \u201cit\u2019s not clear what other countries would seek in return for or in exchange for accepting their own nationals or third-country nationals\u201d during his administration, she said.",
      "Most people deported are from Mexico and northern Central America because those countries accept large numbers of returns of their own nationals, she said. But there has a been a major increase in migrants from Venezuela and Cuba in recent years, and those countries do not accept returns of their citizens.",
      "The experts said there are some factors that could assist Trump in his plans to ramp up deportations, including rapidly deporting more migrants who cross illegally through the expansion of expedited removal.",
      "Starting in 2004, the policy allowed authorities to use an expedited removal process for unauthorized immigrants caught within 100 miles of a U.S. land border and arrested within 14 days of arrival.",
      "Trump\u2019s first administration moved to broadly expand that policy to undocumented immigrants anywhere in the United States who could not prove being in the country continuously for two years or more.",
      "That decision was blocked by the courts before it was eventually allowed to go into effect. A lawyer for the Biden administration withdrew the policy.",
      "\u201cI expect the Trump administration to once again expand expedited removal because that avoids the lengthy immigration court backlogs and delays,\u201d said Bush-Joseph, noting that there were more than 3.5 million pending immigration cases.",
      "The conservative-majority Supreme Court in recent years has also backed the executive branch\u2019s authority on immigration cases, and recent precedent has limited the ability to sue, Bush-Joseph said.",
      "Even when a major lawsuit is brought, courts will have to decide whether to block a policy or let it continue to be enforced as the case makes its way through the legal system."

      "HOUSTON \u2014 It took just seconds for a routine traffic stop on a Texas highway to escalate into a fatal shooting that left 24-year-old Ashtian Barnes bleeding to death in the driver\u2019s seat.",
      "What happened during those seconds and the minutes prior during the April 2016 incident is now central to a Supreme Court case being argued on Wednesday that could make it easier \u2014 or harder \u2014 to hold police officers accountable for the use of excessive force.",
      "For Barnes\u2019 mother, Janice Hughes, 55, who filed the civil rights lawsuit at the center of the case, the oral argument at the high court is the latest stop on a more than eight-year quest for justice on behalf of her only son, who was a Black man.",
      "\u201cI want out of this that my son was a victim. He was never a suspect \u2026 and I need that to be clear. He was a victim from the very beginning,\u201d she said in an emotional interview at her lawyer\u2019s home in Houston with her two daughters and granddaughter by her side.",
      "Almost five years since the death of George Floyd, another Black man killed by a police officer, Hughes believes no progress has been made despite the mass protests and calls for social justice that followed.",
      "\u201cI feel like at some point, somebody has to really take this seriously, because it continues to happen and all we get to do is rally, and \u2018Black Lives Matter,\u2019 and nothing changes,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cNobody\u2019s policing the police.\u201d",
      "Hughes\u2019 civil rights lawsuit was dismissed by lower courts on the grounds that no excessive force was used.",
      "But the courts made that assessment based only on the precise moment that force was used, based on a precedent adopted in parts of the country but not to date embraced by the Supreme Court.",
      "Hughes\u2019 lawyers are now asking the Supreme Court to reject what has been dubbed the \u201cmoment of the threat doctrine,\u201d which could lead to a nationwide ruling that makes clear courts should consider events leading up to the use of force when assessing an officer\u2019s conduct."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 No matter what path President-elect Donald Trump takes to the Capitol rotunda before he says his oath on Monday, he\u2019s guaranteed to pass sites of chaos, violence and destruction wrought by supporters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "If Trump comes through the Senate carriage entrance, as he did en route to the inauguration stage when he took his first oath of office eight years ago, he would have two paths to choose from. The first left, going up the stairs toward the Senate chamber, would trace the path\u00a0where a mob chased a Capitol Police officer\u00a0toward the floor of the Senate on Jan. 6.",
      "Staying on the same level and taking the second left instead, he would pass the very first breach point, where the windows were smashed, alarms were blaring, and hundreds of rioters flooded into the building. Later, that\u2019s where many rioters brawled with police trying to force the mob outside.",
      "Another possible entry point \u2014 the one President Joe Biden took four years ago before his inauguration \u2014 would take Trump through the rotunda doors on the east side of the Capitol, the scene of forceful entries and violent clashes \u2014 and the spot where some of the Oath Keepers militia members\u00a0convicted of seditious conspiracy\u00a0breached the building.",
      "If Trump were to enter through the House side of the Capitol, he would cross over the path of Jeffrey Smith, a D.C. Metropolitan Police officer who was repeatedly assaulted \u2014 including when he was struck in the head with a flying metal object on the West Front of the U.S. Capitol \u2014 and then died by suicide. (Smith was found to have died in the line of duty after a medical board determined the injury he sustained on Jan. 6 was \u201cthe sole and direct cause of his death.\u201d)",
      "Should Trump come in through the north doors on the Senate side, he would walk over the site of a major clash, where police and rioters battled with chemical agents.",
      "And should he come in through the south doors on the House side, he\u2019d come in through the exit where first responders took Ashli Babbitt as they tried to save the life of the Trump supporter, a participant in the mob who was shot when she tried to jump through a window into the House Speaker\u2019s Lobby.",
      "Trump was originally supposed to speak from the inauguration platform, massive scaffolding that workers spend months constructing on the West Front of the Capitol. That was the scene of some of the most brutal violence on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "To get to the area, the usual site of presidential inaugurations before this one was moved indoors because of winter weather, Trump would have emerged through the lower west terrace doors, where officers spent hours in a battle with a mob \u2014 and where a Trump supporter named Rosanne Boyland was before she died. That\u2019s the main entrance point to the inauguration platform; the spot where all the dignitaries enter; the location one federal judge dubbed \u201cthe entranceway for Lady Gaga\u201d because of her performance at Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration.",
      "Now, with cold temperatures forcing a change in plans, Trump is set to be sworn in for his second term in the Capitol rotunda itself, under the dome where\u00a0more assaults took place and where men in gas masks used poles bearing American flags as weapons against police.",
      "The scenes of violence four years ago are inescapably intertwined with the place where Trump will formally retake office, though the president-elect has tried to downplay the brutality and previewed pardons to come for many of those involved.",
      "\u201cIt played out on national news in front of everybody, and you had people like myself that stepped up, that told our stories, mine being well-documented with video and audio, and people didn\u2019t care,\u201d said former D.C. Metropolitan Police Department officer Michael Fanone. \u201cIt didn\u2019t resonate.\u201d",
      "Fanone is not planning to watch the inauguration festivities on Monday, instead preferring to train his focus on his beloved Baltimore Ravens\u2019 playoff game over the weekend before tuning out on Jan. 20. But he had some business to attend to the week before: driving into Washington on Friday to appear at a sentencing hearing for a Jan. 6 riot participant for the sixth time, imploring the judge to punish another one of his assailants.",
      "As Fanone spoke to NBC News outside the courthouse,\u00a0U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan passed nearby with two bodyguards, one on each side \u2014\u00a0a persistent reminder of the security threats facing people involved in investigating, prosecuting or hearing cases related to the Capitol riot. Before it was dismissed following Trump\u2019s election in 2024, Chutkan was set to hear the federal case against the former president on election interference charges.",
      "Chutkan, like Fanone\u2019s mother, was \u201cswatted\u201d last year, with someone calling in a false report to trigger a police response to their homes.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a shame that that\u2019s what it\u2019s come to,\u201d said Fanone, who voted for Trump in 2016. \u201cBut I guess the silver lining there is she\u2019s in a position to be afforded security. I\u2019m not. Lots of Americans are not.\u201d",
      "To get to the place where presidential oaths and inaugural addresses traditionally take place when cold weather hasn\u2019t forced them indoors, incoming presidents walk over the spot in the lower west tunnel where members of a pro-Trump mob ripped Fanone away from the police line and assaulted him. The double golden doors nearby mark where officers were attacked with implements including fire extinguishers, baseball bats, hockey sticks, pepper and bear spray and flagpoles. An\u00a0explosive device even went off inside the tunnel.",
      "Anyone can watch some of the worst moments unfold in footage from Fanone\u2019s body-worn camera, which, unlike Fanone\u2019s police radio and badge,\u00a0was not ripped off during the riot.",
      "This time around,\u00a0outdoor preparations for the inauguration have halted and signage was already starting to come down by Friday afternoon, as inside the Capitol rotunda, workers were beginning to run the backup plan for\u00a0an indoor swearing-in.",
      "There are no official permanent markers of the riot in the Capitol. The windows were repaired. The walls were repainted. Capitol doors, including those at the lower west tunnel, got some security enhancements.",
      "Congress did pass a law that included a provision for a plaque honoring officers who responded to the attack, but the deadline for installation has long since passed without action. House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters ahead of the inauguration that it wasn\u2019t on his mind.",
      "\u201cYou know, I haven\u2019t even looked at that. I need to check on it,\u201d Johnson said.",

      "\u201cYou can\u2019t dispatch and organize enough engines to keep up,\u201d he said \u2014\u00a0let alone fit that many vehicles on the region\u2019s narrow, hillside roads.",
      "In other words, when 70 mph winds are raining embers into suburban communities so achingly vulnerable to fire, extreme blazes are an inevitability that no number of firefighters can control. What begins as wildfire becomes an urban conflagration, with homes serving as the main fuel.",
      "To Cohen, the finger-pointing that has ensued since the deadly fires broke out in Southern California \u2014 amid reports that hydrants ran dry, a reservoir was empty and extra firefighters were not positioned where fires erupted \u2014 is \u201cnonsense.\u201d",

      "A dozen experts \u2014 top fire officials, academic researchers, conservation advocates and scientists \u2014 told NBC News that instead, Southern California and other vulnerable areas need a transformational shift in mindset away from heavy reliance on firefighters to control blazes, and toward an understanding that vulnerable homes are themselves the primary fuel for these kinds of fires."

      "Wine sales in the U.S. last year tumbled approximately 6% from 2023, according to data from the industry data group SipSource. The drop is the latest in a long-term decline in wine demand in restaurants, bars and stores that some are calling an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to the industry.",
      "Wine isn\u2019t the only alcoholic drink that\u2019s fallen on hard times; data from NIQ shows sales for beer, cider and spirits have also decreased. But wine\u2019s fall is steeper, and the whole industry is aware of the shift.",
      "\u201cWines have been surging, surging, surging all these years, but the last few years they have dropped off,\u201d said Larry Duke, who has owned and operated Schumer\u2019s Wine and Liquor in Manhattan since 1978.",
      "The wine industry got a boost in 2020 when Covid-fueled lockdowns and stay-at-home orders juiced demand. But that spike has proved to be fleeting.",
      "Wine industry scholar Mike Veseth, author of several books and The Wine Economist newsletter, pointed to generational trends to explain the drop in wine consumption.",
      "\u201cThe baby boom generation embraced wine,\u201d Veseth said. \u201cWe imagined that the generations that followed would keep doing that, but they haven\u2019t.\u201d",
      "A 2023 Gallup poll backed up that theory, showing that younger Americans drank less than previous generations.",
      "The drop in demand comes as a second Gallup poll, from August, shows that more than 4 in 10 Americans now think alcohol is unhealthy. The U.S. surgeon general issued a report on Jan. 3 warning that alcoholic drinks should carry cancer warning labels.",
      "Experts say when younger consumers do indulge, they are choosing premixed, ready-to-drink options. In fact, premixed beverages are one of few areas in the alcohol industry to see growth.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s not that they dislike wine,\u201d said Christian Miller, research director for the Wine Market Council, a research-focused nonprofit. \u201cIt\u2019s that they are drinking a much wider variety of other things.\u201d",

      "Eating more fiber, which is found in whole grains, vegetables and fruits, might help protect against dangerous bacteria in the gut.",
      "After analyzing samples from the gut microbiomes of more than 12,000 people hailing from 45 countries, researchers determined that people with high levels of a certain type of beneficial bacteria known as Faecalibacterium were more likely to have low levels of potentially fatal bacteria such as E. coli, according to the report published this month in Nature Microbiology.",
      "The researchers also found that samples with high levels of Faecalibacterium had high levels of beneficial compounds called short-chain fatty acids, which are a byproduct from the breakdown of fiber. Research has indicated that having reduced levels of this type of bacteria is linked to inflammatory bowel or gastrointestinal conditions.",
      "\u201cThe main takeaway from our study is that our gut microbiome plays an important role in reducing the growth of potentially harmful bacteria in our gut, and it seems this effect may be modulated through diet,\u201d the study\u2019s principle investigator, Alexandre Almeida, a research fellow at Cambridge University, told NBC News in an email.",
      "The gut microbiome is a collection of microbes including bacteria, fungi and viruses that dwell in the gastrointestinal tract. Gut microbiomes vary from person to person.",
      "The new findings suggest that eating high-fiber foods such as vegetables, beans and grains might help protect against harmful bacteria, he added.",
      "More research on fiber and health",
      "How often you poop can affect your health well beyond your gut. Vegan and vegetarian diets, both high in fiber, may lower risk of cancer, heart disease and early death.These foods don\u2019t deserve their bad reputations, nutritionists say. They\u2019re actually good carbs.",

      "These foods don\u2019t deserve their bad reputations, nutritionists say. They\u2019re actually good carbs.",
      "Almeida cautioned that the new study doesn\u2019t prove that fiber protects against harmful bacteria. \u201cThis was an observational study performed on the gut microbiome of people at one point in time, so we need to be mindful that most of our results are based on associations,\u201d he said. \u201cThis means that future work is needed to experimentally test whether certain things like fiber and other nutrients prevent the incidence of infections in a longer time span.\u201d",
      "Using stool\u00a0samples from 65 studies across 45 countries, the scientists analyzed the bacterial makeup from 12,238 people. They found that the composition of a person\u2019s microbiome could predict whether the person\u2019s gut was likely to be overrun with harmful bacteria.",
      "\u201cThis is an impressive analysis,\u201d said Dr. Walter Willett, a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston, who noted that it doesn\u2019t prove that fiber affects a person\u2019s susceptibility to harmful bacteria. \u201cIt\u2019s one little piece of the puzzle. In the future it will be critical to include diet in the analysis.\u201d",
      "There are plenty of other reasons to consume the recommended amounts of fiber, Willett said. \u201cThere\u2019s really solid evidence that fiber helps with diabetes, weight control and cardiovascular disease.\u201d",
      "Adults need 30 grams of fiber a day, Willett said.",
      "Most Americans get only about 58% of that daily amount, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture research.",
      "\u201cBut it\u2019s not practical to count out the grams,\u201d Willett said. \u201cThe simplest thing is to follow a couple of rules: Whenever you\u2019re having grains, make sure they are whole grains, and eat a variety of fruits and vegetables. Just by doing that you\u2019ll get plenty of fiber.\u201d",
      "Certain foods are especially high in fiber.",
      "For example:",
      "Unsweetened bran cereal (14 g per \u00bd cup) versus toasted oat cereal (3 g per cup)Lima beans (13.2 g per cup) versus asparagus (2.9 g per cup)Pumpkin seeds (5.2 g per ounce) versus hazelnuts (2.8 g per ounce)Raspberries (8 g per cup) versus blueberries (3.6 g per cup)",

      "Lima beans (13.2 g per cup) versus asparagus (2.9 g per cup)",
      "Pumpkin seeds (5.2 g per ounce) versus hazelnuts (2.8 g per ounce)",
      "Raspberries (8 g per cup) versus blueberries (3.6 g per cup)",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know from this study that eating more fiber will result in making more beneficial bacteria,\u201d said Dr. Daniel Freedberg, a gastroenterologist and associate professor of medicine and epidemiology at the Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of evidence suggesting that we do eat too little fiber.\u201d",
      "Certainly increasing fiber consumption would be good for people who don\u2019t get enough.",
      "\u201cI see people with gastrointestinal conditions like constipation and diarrhea, and fiber is the only thing that is good for both,\u201d Freedberg said.",
      "A high-fiber diet might protect the colon, he added.",
      "\u201cThere are some studies where people were briefly randomized to consume a very, very high-fiber diet or an ultraprocessed diet,\u201d Freedberg said. \u201cIn their biopsies, you can see not-so-good changes in the colon tissues of people who consumed the ultraprocessed food.\u201d"

      "Araiza's end zone surrender \u2014 which put the finishing touches on Kansas City\u2019s 23-14 playoff victory over the Houston Texans  \u2014 settled wagers from Las Vegas to cyberspace in a play gamblers call a \"backdoor cover.\"",
      "Gamblers who smelled a possible upset could've bet on underdog Houston and gained 9.5 points on Saturday, in the closing point spread that had started at Kansas City -8. But as early week Las Vegas money went on Kansas City, the line shifted and forced late Chiefs backers to have to surrender 9.5 points by Saturday.",
      "So in other words, betting on Houston would be a winning investment as long as the Texans won the game outright or lost by no more than 9 points. And conversely, K.C. bettors needed the Chiefs to win by 10 or more.",
      "The spread-deciding play was an unusual one to be sure, as Kansas City, leading 23-12, faced fourth-and-15 from their own 18 yard-line with 15 seconds left. Chiefs coach Andy Reid could have easily punted the ball with virtually no chance of Houston scoring twice in final seconds, possibly with help from a blocked kick.",
      "But to absolutely lock the game away, Reid elected to have Araiza sprint toward his own goal, dance on the edge of the end zone to kill precious seconds and then step out of bounds with nine seconds to play.",
      "Those two points meant everything to gamblers who received or gave 9.5 points as the final margin shrank from 11 to 9. The ESPN crew calling the game immediately took note of what those points meant.",
      "\u201cAnd there are a lot of people who are paying attention to that,\" play-by-play man Joe Buck said.  \"That makes it a 9-point game.\"",

      "\u201cAl Michaels is giddy,\" Buck added. \"Wow.\"",
      "Despite that heartbreaking loss for Chiefs bettors at -9.5, a bulk of Kansas City backers wagered early at -8 or -8.5, thus surviving Araiza\u2019s end zone dash, according to Caesars Sportsbook.",
      "That early Kansas City action and late support for Houston at +9.5 worked out well for a majority of sports bettors.",

    "published": "Sun, 19 Jan 2025 10:01:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Though not without its flaws, the first 12-team College Football Playoff was an undeniable success.",
    "story": [
      "With just one game to go to close out the 2024-25 college football season, we\u2019ve seen enough to call it: The inaugural 12-team College Football Playoff has been an undeniable success.",
      "There are minor issues that need to be addressed or tweaked, but the overall format change has been a net positive for the sport. More teams were in Playoff contention throughout the final month of the season than ever before, which meant more meaningful games played each Saturday down the stretch. College football still got its usual, spirited debate about which teams should get the final spots in the bracket. And there were 11 CFP games instead of three at the end of the season \u2014 with four of those games played in electric campus environments.",
      "Interest in the sport has been strong all season long, with 11 regular-season games topping 9 million viewers. First-round CFP games averaged 10.6 million viewers, the quarters averaged 16.9, and the semifinals (played on Thursday and Friday nights) averaged 19.2. With Monday night\u2019s national championship matchup featuring two of the bluest of blue bloods in Notre Dame and Ohio State, the title-game audience is also expected to be massive.",
      "It is also noteworthy that neither of the championship game participants is unbeaten. Notre Dame had an embarrassing loss to Northern Illinois in Week 2, and then the Irish won 13 games in a row to get here. Ohio State lost to its hated rival to end the regular season but still knew it would qualify for the CFP.",
      "\u201cThe new format has allowed our team to grow and build throughout the season,\u201d Ohio State coach Ryan Day said. \u201cAs much as losses hurt, they really allow us as coaches and players to take a hard look at the issues and get them addressed, and then it\u2019s about the business of getting them fixed as time goes on.",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s really been the biggest thing that I\u2019ve learned about this format, which I think has been great for our players. I think it\u2019s great for college football.\u201d",
      "CFP Executive Director Rich Clark agreed that the event had hit its marks.",
      "\u201cWe played out the format that we laid out, and that was the commissioner\u2019s intent \u2014 for us to execute that as best we could, to get the best teams in it and let them play for the championship,\u201d Clark said. \u201cIt went very well.\u201d",
      "There was some fear heading into the fall that the new format would diminish the regular season. Everyone knew that teams didn\u2019t need to be unbeaten to make the bracket, so would games feel less meaningful? Ask Notre Dame fans after the loss to Northern Illinois if it stung any less because they could win out and make the Playoff. Or Ohio State fans after a fourth-straight loss to Michigan, because of course the Buckeyes could still play for a national championship. In both college towns, the world still felt like it was ending. There was still a great deal of meaning, as it turns out.",
      "Clark said he thought the regular season was the best he\u2019s seen in his lifetime.",
      "\u201cWhen you talk about games of significance, there were lots of them, and it was very exciting,\u201d Clark said. \u201cThe Playoff, we believe, was a really good cap off to that strong regular season.\u201d",
      "Clark said that he expects the conference commissioners who oversee the CFP to spend time this offseason examining the selection and seeding processes as well the game sites. It is possible that there could be tweaks ahead of the 2025-26 season, but it is far more likely that substantial changes may not occur until the following season (when decisions will not require unanimity among leadership). The sport\u2019s power brokers expect to examine the value of conference championship games in the future as well \u2014 a separate but related topic.",
      "Several pundits have argued that the top four seed lines should not be reserved for conference champions in the future because that requirement caused this year\u2019s bracket to become unbalanced. No. 3 seed Boise State and No. 4 seed Arizona State were ranked ninth and 12th, respectively, by the CFP selection committee. So they should have been seeded lower in the bracket had it matched the actual final rankings. That caused some of the most dangerous at-large teams, such as Notre Dame and Ohio State, to be seeded lower than they should have been. And Oregon, the top overall seed, was knocked out by the Buckeyes in the quarterfinal round.",
      "The seeding issue might have popped up organically regardless, but it was exacerbated by conference realignment in recent years. The initial bracket (and its conference championship requirement) was pitched before Texas and Oklahoma left the Big 12 for the SEC and before the Big Ten added four West Coast schools, including Oregon. The fact that the Big Ten and SEC now gobble up more at-large spots because of the teams they added (and have a bunch of teams ranked in the top 10 in general) affects the relative strength of various conference champions. If at-large teams from two conferences are stronger than conference champions from two or three other leagues, it affects the bracket structure.",
      "Still, the seeding issue was the only glaring problem with the new format. Everything else seemed to work well, particularly the first-round games being played on campus \u2014 which received rave reviews, prompting the possibility of moving future quarterfinal games away from bowl sites to campuses as well.",
      "\u201cFor the first time out, I don\u2019t think many of us are going to complain about this 12-team Playoff,\u201d Texas coach Steve Sarkisian said. \u201cI can speak on behalf for us at DKR [Darrell K. Royal Memorial Stadium], hosting that first-round game was electric. It was a tremendous atmosphere.\u201d",
      "\u201cPlaying in two bowl games, from the Peach Bowl to the Cotton Bowl, [was] an amazing opportunity for our players. Is this the exact right formula? I don\u2019t know. There are some other people that are going to have to look at this, but I think we\u2019re off to a good start.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s hard to argue with Sarkisian on that point. It may not be perfect, but college football never is. It\u2019s messy. It\u2019s complicated. And it features more debate than just about any other sport on the planet.",
      "But this is a postseason format that ensures the best teams in the country get to determine who is the actual best team in the country by playing it out on the field. They don\u2019t have to rely on polls or a computer formula to determine the national champion. These teams get to determine it themselves, round after round.",
      "And that is worth celebrating."

A sixth defendant was being arraigned separately in juvenile court.",
      "Police said Brainard\u2019s Tinder account was used to lure the man to the private, Roman Catholic school in Worcester. She faces an additional charge of witness intimidation. A male student in the group also faces a charge of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon.",

      "Randall told officers they were inspired by the \u201ccatch a predator\u201d trend, which he said \u201cis big on TikTok\u201d at the moment. He said their group shared ideas of what to tell the man through the Tinder app to lure him to campus, and then spread word through a dormitory chat group that a \u201cpredator\u201d was in the building, the report said.",
      "A review of the messages showed no indication that the man was looking for underage girls, police said.",
      "After the assault, Brainard reported the man to police as a sexual predator and said she was frightened by him. She said he had come to campus uninvited and that she texted a male friend who chased him away. All of this was false, campus police concluded after reviewing surveillance recordings and finding that \u201cfirst person perspective videos\u201d were being circulated among students.",
      "Before leaving court, where cameras were turned on them, the teens were ordered to have no contact with the targeted man.",
      "A lawyer for Brainard, Christopher Todd, said, \u201cWe\u2019re just looking forward to having the process play out.\u201d The lawyer for Trudeau, Robert Iacovelli, said afterward that she\u2019s innocent. He filed a motion seeking dismissal of the charges against her, saying authorities lack probable cause to believe she committed a crime.",

      "NetBlocks, a company that tracks global internet censorship, said there was no indication that any internet service provider was blocking the app, and that its unavailability was purely through TikTok making the service inoperable for U.S. users.",
      "In April, Biden signed a law that required TikTok to divest from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, or risk being banned in the U.S. The law indicates that the ban would take the form of forcing the two primary app stores in the U.S., owned by Google and Apple, to no longer offer the app. Those stores currently do not have TikTok available."

      "Speaker Mike Johnson on Sunday dispelled the notion that President-elect Donald Trump would bring TikTok back early in his second term without the company's willingness to sell to a U.S.-based owner.",
      "\"I think we will enforce the law,\" Johnson told NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday, a day after Trump told NBC News that he would \"most likely\" give TikTok a 90-day extension to operate in the U.S.",
      "Johnson's remarks come just hours after TikTok halted operations in the U.S., cutting user access to the app. At the same time, Apple, Google and Microsoft removed the app from app stores, preventing new users from downloading it.",
      "A bipartisan bill passed last year and signed by President Joe Biden went into effect Sunday, effectively banning TikTok from the U.S. if the app, which is owned by the Chinese-based company ByteDance, isn't sold to a U.S.-based owner.",
      "In the last few months, TikTok made a last-ditch effort with the Supreme Court to save themselves from the ban, but the court upheld the law on Friday.",
      "Trump, who supported banning TikTok during his first term, has now emerged in favor of keeping the app running in the U.S. Before the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the case, Trump's team filed a brief asking the court to hit pause on the law, saying it would give his new administration time to find a solution.",
      "The ban went into effect the day before Trump's inauguration to a second term.",
      "On Saturday, the president-elect told NBC News he would \u201cmost likely\u201d give TikTok a 90-day\u00a0extension to avoid a ban once he takes office, something that the senators specifically disagreed with in their statement.",
      "\"I think that would be, certainly, an option that we look at,\" Trump said in a phone interview. \"The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it\u2019s appropriate. You know, it\u2019s appropriate. We have to look at it carefully. It\u2019s a very big situation.\"",
      "Johnson noted that he believed that in the last few months, Trump has been referring to a plan to bring the app back via a sale, not as it operates now.",
      "\"When President Trump issued the Truth [Social] post and said, 'Save Tiktok,' the way we read that is that he\u2019s going to try to force along a true divestiture, changing of hands, the ownership,\" Johnson said Sunday.",
      "\"It\u2019s not the platform that members of Congress are concerned about. It\u2019s the Chinese Communist Party and their manipulation of the algorithms \u2014 they have been flooding the minds of American children with terrible messages glorifying violence and anti-semitism and even suicide and eating disorders. I mean, crazy kinds of stuff, and they\u2019re mining the data of American citizens. It\u2019s a very dangerous thing,\" he added.",
      "Shortly before Johnson's comments, Sens. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., broke with Trump, too, celebrating the app\u2019s ban that went into effect Sunday.",
      "\u201cWe commend Amazon, Apple, Google, and Microsoft for following the law and halting operations with ByteDance and TikTok, and we encourage other companies to do the same. The law, after all, risks ruinous bankruptcy for any company who violates it,\u201d Cotton and Ricketts wrote in a statement.",
      "\u201cNow that the law has taken effect, there\u2019s no legal basis for any kind of \u2018extension\u2019 of its effective date. For TikTok to come back online in the future, ByteDance must agree to a sale that satisfies the law\u2019s qualified-divestiture requirements by severing all ties between TikTok and Communist China,\u201d they added.",
      "The law on the books doesn't grant the president the authority to make a 90-day extension without guarantees that ByteDance is actually seeking to sell the app to a U.S.-based company.",
      "\"The President may grant a one-time extension of not more than 90 days\u00a0...\u00a0if the President certifies to Congress that\u2014\u00a0(A)\u00a0a path to executing a qualified divestiture has been identified\u00a0with respect to such application,\" the law says, adding that there must be \"evidence of significant progress\" towards a sale, which include \"the relevant binding legal agreements to enable\" a sale.",
      "On Sunday, Johnson said that he doesn't have \"any confidence in ByteDance.\"",
      "\"The law is very precise, and the only way to extend that is if there is an actual deal in the works,\" Johnson added. \"I think President Trump is probably intrigued by all this and he likes to make deals, as you know. So we're very hopeful that that can happen, and that 270 million American people who enjoy the platform can enjoy it, but enjoy it safely and not have their data being mined by our nation's enemy.\""

He also attended a few of her \"Eras Tour\" concerts and even made an onstage appearance during a show in London.",
      "\"Personally, I think that's the beauty of being in a very strong relationship is that you get that support to be able to come in and focus on your craft,\" he said. \"Focus on being the best version of you.",
      "\"That's why I wanted to be at the concerts supporting her and being there for her, making sure she feels comfortable and supported in everything she\u2019s doing in life,\" he continued. \"I think I\u2019m as focused as I\u2019ve ever been on my job and being the best player that I can possibly be week in and week out for this team, and it\u2019s because I don\u2019t have to worry about things off the field.\u201d",

      "However, things changed after Lamar took shots at Drake and other rappers during his guest verses on Big Sean\u2019s song \u201cControl\u201d in August 2013. He appeared to ridicule Drake again in his lyrics during a performance at the BET Hip-Hop Awards in October 2013.",
      "Between 2014 and 2020 the two artists released several diss tracks about each other but the vitriol between the rappers seemed to die down shortly after that.",

      "Lamar\u2019s guest verses prompted Drake to quickly release a new diss track about Lamar called \u201cPush Ups,\u201d in which he called Lamar a \u201cpipsqueak.\u201d Less than two weeks later, Lamar took another swipe at Drake in a song called \u201cEuphoria.\u201d",
      "The diss tracks continued at a breakneck pace until it eventually died down in the summer of 2024.",
      "How successful has \u2018Not Like Us\u2019 been?",

    "story": [
      "\"It Ends With Us\" director and actor Justin Baldoni filed a lawsuit on Thursday against his co-star Blake Lively, adding another layer to the legal saga between the pair that began in December.",
      "Attorneys for Baldoni, his Wayfarer Studios, an \"It Ends With Us\" LLC, producer Jamey Heath and PR pros Melissa Nathan and Jennifer Abel filed a 179-page complaint in a U.S. district court in New York on Jan. 16, accusing Lively; her husband, Ryan Reynolds; her PR person Leslie Sloane; and Sloane's business of defamation and other contractual claims.",
      "\"Heartbreakingly, a film that Baldoni envisioned years ago would honor the survivors of domestic violence by telling their story, with the lofty goal of making a positive impact in the world, has now been overshadowed beyond recognition solely as a result of Lively\u2019s actions and cruelty,\" attorneys for Baldoni write in the complaint.",
      "Lively's legal team responded to the filing, calling the lawsuit \"another chapter in the abuser playbook\" in a statement to NBC News.",
      "\"This is an age-old story: A woman speaks up with concrete evidence of sexual harassment and retaliation and the abuser attempts to turn the tables on the victim,\" the statement continued.",
      "Lively's legal team said Baldoni and Wayfarer \"are trying to shift the narrative to Ms. Lively by falsely claiming that she seized creative control and alienated the cast from Mr. Baldoni. The evidence will show that the cast and others had their own negative experiences with Mr. Baldoni and Wayfarer. The evidence will also show that Sony asked Ms. Lively to oversee Sony\u2019s cut of the film, which they then selected for distribution and was a resounding success.\"",
      "The statement concluded by saying \"the strategy of attacking the woman is desperate, it does not refute the evidence in Ms. Lively\u2019s complaint, and it will fail.\"",
      "Lively previously filed a sexual harassment complaint against Baldoni in California and a lawsuit against him in New York. Baldoni has denied Lively's allegations against him.",
      "Baldoni is seeking damages of at least $400 million for defamation, civil extortion, false light invasion of privacy, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, intentional interference with contractual relations, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage\u00a0and negligent interference with prospective economic advantage.",
      "Bryan Freedman, an attorney for Baldoni, said in a statement to TODAY.com that the lawsuit was \"a legal action based on an overwhelming amount of untampered evidence detailing Blake Lively and her team\u2019s duplicitous attempt to destroy Justin Baldoni, his team and their respective companies by disseminating grossly edited, unsubstantiated, new and doctored information to the media.",
      "\"It is clear based on our own all out willingness to provide all complete text messages, emails, video footage and other documentary evidence that was shared between the parties in real time, that this is a battle she will not win and will certainly regret. Blake Lively was either severely misled by her team or intentionally and knowingly misrepresented the truth,\" he said.",
      "\"Ms. Lively will never again be allowed to continue to exploit actual victims of real harassment solely for her personal reputation gain at the expense of those without power,\" he continued. \"Let\u2019s not forget, Ms. Lively and her team attempted to bulldoze reputations and livelihoods for heinously selfish reasons through their own dangerous manipulation of the media before even taking any actual legal action. We know the truth, and now the public does too. Justin and his team have nothing to hide, documents do not lie.\"",
      "Here\u2019s what Baldoni accuses Lively of in the complaint related to allegations of \u201cbreach of contract, extortion, defamation and further wrongdoing.\u201d",
      "Baldoni says Lively insisted on oversight of her character\u2019s costume",
      "Lively, who was hired as an actor to play Lily Bloom in the film, allegedly insisted on control over her character's costume before filming even began, according to the complaint.",
      "Baldoni alleges that Lively's actions led the costume designer to re-shop her wardrobe, \"far exceeding the allocated budget and diverting time and resources, while also preparing wardrobes for the rest of the cast,\" according to the complaint.",
      "Lively spoke about her involvement with the costumes during the press tour for the film, including with TODAY's Sheinelle Jones.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s storytelling,\u201d she said on TODAY. \u201cTo me, fashion and costume design is storytelling.\u201d",
      "Lively wrote a draft of the rooftop scene, then said Reynolds wrote it at the film's premiere, lawsuit says",
      "During production, Lively asked Baldoni if she could \"take a pass\" at writing one of the scenes in the film, where Lily and Baldoni's character, Ryle, meet on the rooftop of his apartment building, the complaint states.",
      "Baldoni alleges the draft of the scene Lively wrote significantly differed from the original version, and that he thanked her for her passion and said that the final scene would likely end up being somewhere between her version and the original version.",
      "Lively did not respond and went silent for multiple days afterward, according to the complaint.",
      "In text messages, Lively referred to a meeting she called at her penthouse, in which Reynolds greeted Baldoni and gave his wife praise for her version of the scene, the complaint says.",
      "\"Hours later, as the meeting was ending, a famous, and famously close, friend of Reynolds and Lively, walked into the room and similarly began praising Lively\u2019s script,\" the complaint says. \"Baldoni understood the subtext: he needed to comply with Lively\u2019s direction for the script.\"",
      "In one of the messages, Baldoni refers to the friend as \"Taylor,\" but the name is redacted in other messages. (Baldoni's team confirmed this was a reference to Taylor Swift; the pop star has not commented.)",
      "Lively\u2019s complaint did not have details on this specific alleged meeting.",
      "Later, during a red carpet interview, Lively said her husband had written the scene, according to the complaint.",
      "\"This was also the first time that Plaintiffs learned that Reynolds \u2014 who had no formal role whatsoever in the Film\u2019s production \u2014 had made unauthorized changes to the script in secret,\" the complaint alleges.",
      "Baldoni explains why he asked for Lively's weight",
      "Lively introduced Baldoni to the person who would become his personal trainer, according to the complaint.",
      "During production, Baldoni privately reached out to the trainer to ask what Lively's weight was so that he could properly prepare his back muscles for a scene in which he had to lift her up, according to the complaint. (Baldoni has suffered from lifelong back injuries, according to the complaint.)",
      "The next day, Lively asked Baldoni to come to her penthouse, where he was greeted by Reynolds, who swore at Baldoni and accused him of fat-shaming his wife, according to the complaint.",
      "\u201cHow dare you f------- ask about my wife\u2019s weight?\" Reynolds asked Baldoni, according to the complaint. \"What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d",
      "Baldoni offered what are described in the lawsuit as \u201crepeated (and completely unwarranted)\u201d apologies, and Reynolds demanded that the scene be removed entirely, according to his complaint. Lively allegedly refused to perform the scene, even after it was rehearsed with a stunt double, according to the complaint.",
      "In Lively\u2019s original complaint, she alleges that weeks after she gave birth to her fourth child, Baldoni \u201csecretly called her fitness trainer without her knowledge or permission and implied that he wanted her to lose weight in two weeks\u201d because he was concerned about picking her up in a scene. She said in her complaint that \"there was no such scene.\"",
      "Later, according to Baldoni's complaint, Lively delivered an ultimatum: \"If Baldoni could not get on board with her work methods, he had two weeks to recast her.\"",
      "Baldoni's attorneys say a 17-point document brought by Lively was 'essentially signed under duress'",
      "After filming was paused due to multiple strikes, production was set to begin again once the SAG-AFTRA strike ended, according to the complaint.",
      "\"The same day that the SAG-AFTRA strike ended, Baldoni, the studios, and producers were eager to resume production. Instead, they were met with an email from Lively\u2019s lawyer, who sent Wayfarer an unsettling and unexpected 17-point list of non-negotiable conditions that must be met before Lively would return to work,\" the complaint states.",
      "\"The stunning list was drafted for the apparent purpose of insinuating or outright claiming that Baldoni, Heath, and others had engaged in sexually inappropriate conduct during filming,\" the complaint continues.",
      "In Lively\u2019s complaint, she also includes details on the meeting, saying it was to discuss \u201cthe inappropriate conduct that Ms. Lively, her employees and other cast and crew experienced at the hands of Mr. Baldoni and Mr. Heath.\u201d Her complaint included the list\u00a0she says was reviewed at the meeting.",
      "In the list, Lively suggested that there wasn't an intimacy coordinator on set, but attorneys for Baldoni write that there was one assigned to the film.",
      "The complaint alleges that Lively didn't meet with the intimacy coordinator, leading Baldoni to work on scenes with the coordinator and relay any changes to Lively.",
      "Baldoni accuses Lively of unchoreographed kissing during scenes, while one of the 17 points on Lively's list was \"no spontaneous improvisation\" during intimate scenes.",
      "Before returning to production, Lively allegedly had more notes and script changes that Baldoni eventually mostly agreed to, out of fear the film would be taken from him by \"threats and coercion,\" according to the complaint.",
      "Attorneys for Baldoni write that the document was \u201cessentially signed under duress,\u201d and in an email to his team, Baldoni wrote that he was \u201cwaiving the white flag and submitting\u201d and that he would give Lively \u201c98% of what she wants.\u201d",
      "Baldoni says Lively refused to promote the film if she didn\u2019t get her own cuts, replaced film editors with her own",
      "In April and May 2024, Lively was granted her own cut of the film after Sony told Wayfarer that Lively would refuse to promote the film unless her demands were met, according to the complaint.",
      "\u201cUltimately, Lively replaced the Film\u2019s editors with her own choice: an editor often used by Reynolds, and the Film\u2019s editors had to be let go,\u201d the complaint states.",
      "As there were two versions of the film, Lively's cut and Baldoni's cut, the studio agreed to do an official audience test of both versions, according to the complaint. Baldoni's version \"scored significantly higher with key audience demographics,\" according to the complaint.",
      "Lively then said Hoover would not promote the film unless her version was released, and Sony later told Wayfarer that neither Lively nor any of the film's cast would promote the film unless her cut was used.",
      "As noted previously, Lively specified in her response to Baldoni\u2019s lawsuit that \u201cSony asked Ms. Lively to oversee Sony\u2019s cut of the film, which they then selected for distribution and was a resounding success.\u201d",
      "\"Baldoni was forced to choose between killing the film and his own career by insisting on his own creative vision and rights, or putting out a version of the Film that Baldoni knew could still be so important to domestic violence survivors, even if it differed greatly from what it could have been,\" the complaint states. \"Baldoni reluctantly chose the latter, and stood down, allowing Lively\u2019s version of the Film to be released and promoted.\"",
      "The film went on to bring in over $148 million at the box office throughout its theatrical run.",
      "Baldoni alleges he was kept apart from Lively at the film's premiere",
      "The lawsuit contends that Lively communicated that she would not promote the movie if she was not given a producer credit.",
      "Baldoni and Wayfarer also allege they sent a letter to the Producers Guild of America \"under duress\" asking for Lively to be given a \"coveted\" p.g.a. designation on her producer's credit even though they didn't believe she deserved it.",
      "Attorneys for Baldoni write in the lawsuit that he was in Sweden for his wife's birthday when he was informed that Lively and a \"majority of the cast\" would boycott the \"It Ends with Us\" premiere if Baldoni attended it.",
      "A compromise was reached in which \"Wayfarer persuaded Lively to 'permit' Baldoni and the Wayfarer team, along with their friends and family, to attend\" the premiere, according to court documents. Baldoni and his family and friends then attended under \"demeaning and humiliating conditions,\" per the lawsuit.",
      "The lawsuit alleges Baldoni had to cut his time on the red carpet short at the event and was \"instructed to stop immediately\" because Lively was on her way.",
      "The court documents include photos of Baldoni with friends and family on folding chairs and surrounded by pallets of soda bottles. Baldoni's attorneys say the photos are from the basement of the venue, where Baldoni and his entourage were allegedly moved to be separate from the remainder of the cast at the premiere.",
      "The group was then escorted out of the building by security to \"avoid even a chance of interaction with Lively or her guests,\" his complaint says.",
      "Baldoni and Wayfarer also allege that they had to organize and pay for a separate after-party for \"himself and the Wayfarer team\" because he was excluded from the official after-party attended by Lively and the cast. He alleges Wayfarer paid for both parties.",
      "Baldoni's attorneys also allege that he was not invited to any events involving cast members, such as photo shoots, screenings and promotional events, according to court documents.",
      "Baldoni alleges the cast was 'induced' by Lively to shun him, unfollow him on social media",
      "The lawsuit alleges that Lively \"induced\" other cast members to avoid Baldoni \"in an early attempt to give fans the impression that Baldoni had committed an egregious sin, something so egregious that no one wanted to even take photos with him or have him around.\u201d Lively\u2019s response to his lawsuit says that \u201ccast and others had their own negative experiences with Mr. Baldoni and Wayfarer.\u201d",
      "His attorneys also write that Lively told Sony that she and the cast would not take part in any promotion of the film with Baldoni present, according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit also alleges she ordered him to be removed from all artwork promoting the film, including the posters.",

Each student chooses to enter one of four quadrants: Healers, Scribes, Infantry or Riders, the quadrant with the highest death rate. Near Basgiath are the dragon hatching grounds known as the Vale. Basgiath is where the original dragon riders, known as the First Six, wove the wards of Navarre, which protect the borders.",

Xaden is the oldest marked one, fulfilling a de facto leadership role for the rest of the group. He also took responsibility for the 107 marked ones safety. Xaden and Violet have had a tumultuous relationship so far, with plenty of secrets. Xaden is leading another revolution and has two signets: shadow-summoning and is an inntinnsic (meaning he can read minds). He is bonded to Sgaeyl, who is mated to Tairn, giving Xaden and Violet a path to mind speak to one another.",

      "Andarna: She is an unknown breed of dragon and the second bonded dragon to Violet. When she was a baby dragon (known as a feathertail) she was able to stop time for brief moments. However, the power faded with age. Currently, she can change the color of her scales, but her development from a child into an adolescent was altered. By the end of \"Iron Flame,\" her personality is akin to that of a teenager: moody, keen on not being left out and searching for independence.",
      "Sgaeyl: She's a blue daggertail dragon, mated to Tairn and bonded to Xaden.",
      "Dain Aetos: Violet's childhood best friend, although they've grown slightly apart as adults. The pair had a brief romantic moment; however, it did not last.

His signet is retrocognition, meaning he can read and feel others memories by touching them.",

      "Catriona Cordella: A gryphon flier of Poromiel and Xaden's ex-fianc\u00e9e. Known as Cat, she and Xaden were betrothed for nine months. She's bonded to the gryphon Kiralair and niece to Viscount Tecarus, heir to the Poromiel crown. Her magical gift is heightening others' emotions.",
      "Liam Mairi: A marked one and the closest thing Xaden has to a brother. Xaden assigns Liam to shadow Violet and protect her. His signet is farsight, allowing him to see very far away. He's bonded to Deigh.",

      "Violet struggles to survive each day at Basgiath War College, facing threats from fellow cadet Jack Barlowe, who views her as weak. But she uses her book smarts to make it through physical fights and training.",
      "One night, she overhears Xaden holding a secret meeting with all the rebellion children. Basgiath has a rule that no more than three marked ones can meet at once, so this meeting is a capital offense. Violet is caught by Xaden, but she promises to keep the meeting a secret.",
      "She ends up excelling at Threshing, bonding with not only one, but two dragons: Andarna, who is thought to be a golden feathertail, and Tairn, an extremely powerful black dragon.",
      "Violet and Dain kiss after Threshing, although Violet doesn't think it feels right. Afterwards, the pair maintain a friendship.",
      "Bonding with Tairn immediately links her to Xaden, as Tairn is mated to Xaden's dragon, Sgaeyl, giving them the power to mind speak to each other.",
      "Despite being mortal enemies, Xaden ends up training Violet. A rider will die if their dragon dies, and occasionally, a dragon can't recover after their rider's death. Tairn and Sgaeyl's mating bond also means they cannot be apart from each other for long, and if one dies, so does the other. Because of their mated dragons, Xaden now needs to keep Violet alive to keep himself alive.",

      "When the War Games, an end of year test of a squad's abilities, comes around, Dain's dad, Colonel Aetos, assigns Xaden and Violet's squad to go to Aethebyne,\u00a0located beyond the wards' safety.",
      "When they get there, Violet learns that Xaden has been secretly assisting gryphon riders from Poromiel, supplying them with weapons. It turns out, the reason they've been attacking Navarrian outposts is because they are under attack from venin, creatures Violet previously believed were only myth, and needed supplies.",
      "Learning that venin exist and that the gryphon fliers aren't the true enemy, Violet is forced to question her complacency and her mother's role in spreading propaganda.",
      "The squad then realizes that Colonel Aetos sent them into a trap. Instead of a War Games exercise, they are forced into real battle against four venin while trying to defend a nearby village.",
      "Working in tandem with the gryphon riders, they fight the venin and win the battle, but at deadly costs. Liam's dragon is killed, which kills Liam as well. Violet holds him as he dies and promises she will protect his younger sister, Sloane.",

      "What happens in 'Iron Flame'?",
      "\"Iron Flame\" begins where the first book ended, but Violet's inner turmoil is at an all-time high as she comes to terms with fables being real, mourns the loss of Liam, battles conflicting emotions regarding Brennan being alive and misses Xaden, despite not wanting to.",
      "After they return to Basgiath, Xaden graduates and is immediately stationed at Samara. However, because Tairn and Sgaeyl are mated and need to see each other consistently, Violet and Xaden are given leave once a week to see each other.",
      "Xaden promises to help Violet build her mental shields so she can protect her mind from Dain and others with similar signets. As for their relationship, they still struggle with trust. With Xaden becoming the revolution's leader, he needs to keep some secrets, but Violet requests full disclosure if he wants to be together. They remain at an impasse for a while.",
      "Meanwhile, the other marked ones continue to smuggle weapons out of Basgiath to gryphon fliers. Violet, now a second-year, embarks on a research journey in the Archives, with the help of Jesinia, to figure out how Basgiath wards work so she can set up wards around Aretia.",

      "As Violet continues to search for accounts from the First Six on how the wards were created, Jack Barlowe returns to Basgiath. It turns out, Violet didn't kill him in the first book, and he's been going through an extensive mending process.",
      "With the help of her friends, Violet figures out that the journals of the First Six are most likely in King Tauri's private vault, but they'll need someone from his bloodline to get in, so they rope Aaric into their plan.",
      "But before they can enact it, infantry cadets try to kill Violet. Surprisingly, Jack saves her, though it doesn't change her distrust of him.",
      "Violet and Xaden eventually break into the Archives for the journals and take two. However, Nolan, a healer who Violet has always trusted, deceives and drugs her. Varrish arrives, taking one of the journals with him.",
      "Violet is subjected to torture from Varrish, but she holds strong. In a final act to break her, Varrish calls in Dain and commands him read Violet's memories, which he does. After seeing the truth, Dain frees Violet just as Xaden and Garrick arrive. Xaden and Violet then kill Varrish together.",
      "Xaden uses the chaos of Basgiath to his advantage, addressing all the cadets and telling them the truth of what's happening beyond the wards. He gives them the option to stay at Basgiath and defend Navarre, or, come with him to fight for the whole Continent. Nearly half the quadrant decides to join.",
      "The group continues holding classes for the riders at Aretia as Violet tries to translate the journals and get the wards up and running. Soon, she thinks she's discovered the solution: blood magic.",
      "After her first attempt fails, Violet goes in search of a luminary. She visits Poromiel's leader, Viscount Tecarus, and learns that Xaden was offered a luminary in exchange for herself, a deal he refused.  After having to fight off another venin and agreeing to train gryphon fliers in Aretia, Xaden and Violet secure the luminary.",
      "Back at Aretia, Violet, Xaden and his ex-fianc\u00e9e, a gryphon flier named Cat, spar over their twisted romantic pasts. Xaden reveals he is technically heir to Tyrrendor, reassuring Violet that he and Cat were only ever together for a political alliances.",
      "But just as the pair starts to piece their relationship back together, it crumbles once more when Violet realizes that Xaden has a secret second signet, since Sgaeyl bonded Xaden and his grandfather before him.",
      "Violet demands he tell her what it is. He reveals he's inntinnsic, meaning he can read minds. Manifesting as an inntinnsic typically results in death in Navarre.",
      "How does 'Iron Flame' end?",
      "General Melgren, General Lilith Sorrengail and some other members of leadership request a meeting with Violet, Xaden and Mira.",
      "Melgren tells them that he's seen an upcoming battle, claiming the venin will attack Samara and win. He asks them to help in the battle, but Brennan reveals himself, telling them no.",
      "Violet then realizes that the real battle won't be at Samara, but at Basgiath. Violet convinces Xaden that they have to fight for Basgiath, but Brennan refuses.",
      "Violet and Xaden give the cadets and gryphon fliers the choice to fight or not, and most decide to join.",
      "When they arrive, Violet and Xaden rush to the wardstone, passing dead guards, to find Jack and his dragon within the chamber. It turns out, Jack survived Violet dropping a mountain on him because he turned venin. Jack kills his own dragon, which cracks the wardstone in half, knocking down the college's wards.",
      "Xaden knocks Jack out before he can draw power from the ground.",
      "They begin to assemble their forces, as Brennan arrives with more riders and fliers. Brennan tries to mend the wardstone as the battle above begins.",
      "One of the venin reveals that their goal is to take Violet alive. Violet kills the venin and runs to Jesinia, who has been continuously transcribing one of the First Six's journals amidst the battle. Jesinia reveals that Andarna is the secret to activating the wardstone. Andarna turns out to be a dragon breed of her own and waited for Violet \u2014\u00a0a period of 650 years \u2014\u00a0before hatching.",
      "Now, Violet has a solution to their ongoing battle. But a dragon can only power one wardstone, meaning Violet and Xaden have to decide to protect either Basgiath or Aretia.",
      "Xaden tells her to go ahead and ward Basgiath. But first, the wardstone has to be imbued with a rider's power, which typically takes weeks to do safely.",
      "Violet decides to sacrifice herself, pouring all of her power into the wardstone knowing she will die from it. Just before Violet burns out, her mother kicks her aside and forces Sloane to siphon all of her power into the stone. Lilith and her dragon die in an act of sacrifice for her children, and the wards at Basgiath are restored.",
      "The wyvern fall with the wards back up, but a bigger threat looms. It's revealed that while Violet was sacrificing herself, Xaden was taking on a venin general \u2014\u00a0and losing. When Xaden felt Violet dying for him, he channeled power from the Earth so he could save her, turning venin in the process.",
      "Now, in the aftermath of the battle, he reveals his new venin status to Violet, and she looks on in horror.",
      "The final pages of \"Iron Flame\" are from Xaden's perspective. Xaden seeks out Jack for help finding a cure to being venin. Jack responds that there is no cure, saying Xaden will \"only hunger for more\" power.",
      "\"All this time, you've been convincing everyone you're the hero, and now you'll be the villain... especially in her story,\" Jack says. \"Welcome to our f---ed-up family. Guess we're brothers now.\"",
      "What will happen in 'Onyx Storm'?",
      "It's unclear where \"Onyx Storm\" will pick up after the events of \"Iron Flame.\"",
      "Yarros teased what the book will hold in an interview with Elle, revealing that \"fans can expect to see Violet with one singular motivation, which is to save Xaden.\"",
      "\"You\u2019re going to follow the implications of what\u2019s been revealed in\u00a0'Iron Flame,' and you\u2019re going to see Andarna very curious about where she comes from,\" she said. \"I think that\u2019s the biggest thing I can tease before a publisher jumps out and tackles me to the floor.\"",
      "After nearly eighteen months at Basgiath War College, Violet Sorrengail knows there\u2019s no more time for lessons. No more time for uncertainty.",
      "Because the battle has truly begun, and with enemies closing in from outside their walls and within their ranks, it\u2019s impossible to know who to trust.",
      "Now Violet must journey beyond the failing Aretian wards to seek allies from unfamiliar lands to stand with Navarre. The trip will test every bit of her wit, luck, and strength, but she will do anything to save what she loves\u2014her dragons, her family, her home, and\u00a0him.",
      "Even if it means keeping a secret so big, it could destroy everything.",
      "They need an army. They need power. They need\u00a0magic. And they need the one thing only Violet can find\u2014the truth.",
      "But a storm is coming...and not everyone can survive its wrath."

    "story": [
      "Bob Uecker had the kind of career stat line that would be sad if it wasn\u2019t so funny. But funny is what would ultimately cement his legacy.",
      "Uecker, who died Jan. 16 at the age of 90, was a career .200 hitter across six seasons in Major League Baseball. He ultimately embraced his own ineptitude, often mocking himself for his lack of ability on the diamond.",
      "Uecker took his schtick and ran with it, all the way to Hollywood. Nicknamed \u201cMr. Baseball,\u201d he was a frequent, gut-busting guest on \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\u201d for years after he retired. He appeared in several well-known Miller Lite commercials, in which he poked fun at himself when he declared, \u201cI must be in the front row\u201d after an usher at a game informs him that he\u2019s in the wrong seats. He parlayed those efforts into a starring role on the small screen, playing George Owens on the ABC sitcom \u201cMr. Belvedere,\u201d which ran for six seasons from 1985 until 1990.",
      "But all of that may have just been a prologue for what seems like a casting job that was as natural as a tailor-made 4-6-3 double play. In the hit 1989 movie \u201cMajor League,\u201d Uecker played Cleveland play-by-play announcer Harry Doyle, whose wit would often serve as cover for how awful the team was, only for him to get caught up in the fervor when the team begins winning.",
      "(There's profanity in the clip below.)",

      "\u201cTypically, their role was to set the scene for the film\u2019s climactic game with flowery prose or ... act as foil to the players or manager. (Director and writer David S.) Ward and Uecker collaborated on a true innovation of the genre by turning this archetype into a comic Greek chorus punctuating the clownish action on the field with perfectly delivered zingers. It was a breath of fresh air for the baseball film, which had perhaps become overly solemn in the \u201880s with \u2018The Natural,\u2019 \u2018Field of Dreams\u2019 and \u2018Eight Men Out.\u2019\u201d",
      "Uecker, who spent 54 seasons as the radio play-by-play man for the Milwaukee Brewers, reprised the role in \u201cMajor League II.\u201d He wasn\u2019t just a perfect fit as Harry Doyle, though. He also provided a template for those who came after him.",

      "It wasn\u2019t only announcers, either. If you ever played Wiffle ball in your backyard, turned on a baseball game or, heck, even tried archery and missed a target by 10 feet, you\u2019ve probably said, \u201cJuuuust a bit outside.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe most hilarious guy I\u2019ve ever met, off-camera and on,\u201d \u201cMr. Belvedere\u201d co-star Rob Stone once said about Uecker.",

The Traitors selected \"Survivor\" winner Jeremy Collins, \"Summer House\" star Ciara Miller and retired professional wrestler Nikki Garcia. Each person then had to lie down in a coffin and await their fate. Although Jeremy offered to work with the Traitors if he was spared, they chose to murder him since he correctly suspected \"Big Brother\" star Danielle Reyes was a Traitor. In his final confessional, Jeremy became emotional as he spoke about not bringing home the prize pot to his family.",
      "Bob the Drag Queen",
      "Bob the Drag Queen's devilishly cunning run on Season 3 was cut short in Episode 4 when his fellow Traitors, particularly Rob, turned on him. Bob had been vocal throughout the season, trying to cast suspicion onto others and throw his adversaries off his scent. But when he suggested the group question if the three newcomers \u2014 Rob, Wes and Derrick \u2014 were possible Traitors, Rob took it as an opportunity stab the \"RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\" winner in the back. Rob convinced the group to banish Bob, stunning him. After being voted out, Rob stood before the cast and proudly confirmed he had lied and was a Traitor."

      "Williams responded, \u201cDo I seem that way?\u201d The rest of the show\u2019s hosts agreed she didn\u2019t.",
      "Finnie, too, spoke to her aunt\u2019s temperament. \u201cThis does not match an incapacitated person,\u201d she said. \u201cMy aunt has always been a unique personality. \u2026 That is who she is.\u201d",
      "Morrissey did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment.",
      "In the Lifetime documentary, Williams often appeared to have cognitive difficulty when speaking to her loved ones. Her son, Kevin Hunter Jr., and manager Will Selby both suggested that these issues were associated with her alcohol use.",
      "Williams currently has a court-appointed legal guardian, Morrissey, who oversees her money and health to avoid the potential for her to be exploited due to her cognitive issues, People reported.",

      "\u201cShe\u2019s being treated for some of her mental deficiencies, some of the cognitive issues,\u201d Finnie, said in the documentary. \u201cThey\u2019re getting to the root of the problem in terms of what causes maybe some of the drinking and other irrational decisions.\u201d",

      "Primary progressive aphasia, or PPA, impacts speech, reading, writing and the ability to understand what others are saying to you. It\u2019s a subtype of frontotemporal dementia, or FTD, which affects communication, including speech, writing and the ability to understand language.",
      "FTD is caused by shrinking in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, which control personality, behavior and language. Depending on which parts of the brain are affected, someone might experience personality changes, such as behaving erratically, inappropriately, or becoming distant, according to Mayo Clinic.",
      "FTD is sometimes misdiagnosed as a mental health condition or Alzheimer\u2019s disease, but it typically occurs at a younger age, between 40 and 65, than other types of dementia.",
      "\u201cMost people, when they think of the word dementia, they think problems with memory and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, but FTD doesn\u2019t really show up as problems with memory. ... It affects how people behave, how they interact with others and how they speak,\u201d Dr. Sami Barmada, director of Michigan Brain Bank and associate professor of neurology at University of Michigan Medicine, previously told TODAY.com about Bruce Willis, who was diagnosed with the same conditions.",

      "\u201cI continue to need personal space and peace to thrive,\u201d she concluded. \u201cPlease just know that your positivity and encouragement are deeply appreciated.\u201d",

This overproduction of thyroid hormones, or hyperthyroidism, can lead to an increased heart rate, sweating, weight loss, anxiety, hair loss, difficulty sleeping and bulging eyes, according to the Mayo Clinic.",
      "Williams noted that her fans pointed out changes in her eyes when she revealed her diagnosis. \u201cGraves\u2019 disease squeezes the muscles behind the eyeballs,\u201d she explained, adding that it\u2019s caused her eyeballs to twitch.",
      "Williams returned to her show, but she had to take time off in 2019 and again in 2020 to cope with her illness.",
      "\u201cIf hyperthyroidism is untreated, it can be life-threatening,\u201d Adimoolam says. While there are treatments, such as medication, surgery and therapy, Graves\u2019 disease looks different for every person, she adds. Even with treatment, it might remain debilitating for some.",

      "Dressed as the Statue of Liberty, she was talking to the camera and then started to shake and struggle to speak before falling on the ground. The show cut to a commercial, and when it returned, she told viewers, \u201cThat was not a stunt. I overheated in my costume. I passed out.\u201d",
      "The next day, she explained that prior to fainting, she felt \u201chot and a little dizzy.\u201d She said the paramedics later told her she was low on electrolytes.",
      "\u201cIt was scary,\u201d she recalled. \u201cIt was really scary. It was so scary, all I could think of in the middle of the scare was, \u2018Don\u2019t pull the podium over on you, because that\u2019ll make it worse.\u2019\u201d",
      "Wendy Williams has struggled with alcohol and cocaine use",

Thank God I never got stopped by the cops to shame my family and myself and lose my job.\u201d",

      "The documentary and a February 2024 People cover story also reference her alcohol use.

      "Lymphedema is a condition where the limbs \u2014\u00a0in Williams\u2019 case, her feet and legs \u2014 swell because the lymphatic system doesn\u2019t drain properly. Most often, it develops over a person\u2019s lifetime. It\u2019s not curable and can be painful and lead to dangerous complications.",
      "Wendy Williams has been living with lymphedema, a chronic condition that can be highly uncomfortable, for several years.",

      "TEL AVIV \u2014 The long-awaited\u00a0ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas\u00a0went into effect in the Gaza Strip on Sunday morning, with the release of the first hostages and a halt to Israeli military operations after 15 months of conflict.",
      "Many hope the hard-fought reprieve from the fighting will usher in a more permanent end to the war.",
      "Follow live updates",
      "Gazans took the rare opportunity to see what, if anything, was left of their homes. NBC News crews in Gaza captured large crowds of families moving near Rafah, in southern Gaza, mostly on foot.",
      "One family was riding on a cart pulled by a donkey. \u201cTo Rafah, to Rafah, inside, in Gaza,\u201d a smiling young boy exclaims as he steered the cart.",
      "And three female hostages were handed over by Hamas to the Red Cross just after 5 p.m. local time, to be taken to Israel.",
      "In Tel Aviv\u2019s Hostages Square, a crowd cheered and clapped as the news came in that the hostages were in Red Cross custody.",
      "The released hostages are all young women: Doron Steinbrecher, 31, taken from kibbutz Kfar Aza on Oct. 7, a veterinary nurse; Romi Gonen, 24, taken from the Nova Music Festival on Oct. 7; and Emily Damari, 28, a British Israeli citizen taken from kibbutz Kfar Aza on Oct. 7 and a key figure in the kibbutz\u2019s youth community.",
      "Four additional living hostages are expected to be released in seven days, the coordinator for hostages, returnees and missing persons in\u00a0Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office said. It added that their families would be informed of the names of those to be released 24 hours prior to that date.",
      "Israel is set to release 90 Palestinian prisoners and detainees as part of the agreement, all of whom are children and women, according to the Commission of Prisoners\u2019 Affairs. For every hostage released, 30 Palestinian prisoners will be freed \u2014 50 if the hostage is a soldier.",
      "Initially set for 8:30 a.m. local time, the pause in fighting was delayed by a few hours and began after 11:15 a.m. Gaza's Civil Defense agency reported that at least 19 people were killed and 36 injured earlier after the delay was announced.",
      "Under the plan\u2019s first phase of the agreement, 33 hostages will be released in exchange for 1,904 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. At least two Americans, Sagui Dekel-Chen and Keith Siegel, are expected to be set free, with fellow dual national Edan Alexander to follow in the second stage of the ceasefire.",

    "published": "Sat, 18 Jan 2025 23:01:58 GMT",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, is considering a visit to the war-torn Gaza Strip as part of his efforts to keep a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas on track, according to a transition official with direct knowledge of the ceasefire process.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, is considering a visit to the war-torn Gaza Strip as part of his efforts to keep a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas on track, according to a transition official with direct knowledge of the ceasefire process.",
      "Underscoring just how fragile the president-elect\u2019s team believes the ceasefire deal that\u2019s set to go into effect on Sunday is, Witkoff also plans to be a near-constant presence in the region over the coming weeks and months to troubleshoot flare-ups on the ground that he believes could unravel the agreement and halt the release of hostages held by Hamas at any moment, the official said.",
      "\u201cYou have to be right on top of it, ready to snuff out a problem if it happens,\u201d the official said.",
      "At the same time, Witkoff is working to achieve long-term stability for the Israelis and 2 million displaced Palestinians, the path to which runs through the three phases of the deal reached this past week.",
      "The first phase, which begins on Sunday, is set to last about six weeks and involves the release of hostages held by Hamas and Palestinians held by Israel. The second phase would be negotiated during the first and is supposed to result in the release of additional hostages and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. The goal of the final phase, which also still needs to be negotiated, is to end the war and begin rebuilding Gaza.",
      "During Hamas\u2019 initial Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel, 1,200 people were killed and about 250 were taken hostage. The attack shocked the nation and sent many Israelis who believed they had military superiority in the region reeling.",
      "Since then, the conflict has added multiple fronts, with Israel seeking to root out Iranian and Iran-backed enemies in other countries around it.",
      "For now, a top concern for Trump\u2019s envoy is a rogue incident sparked by inevitable day-to-day interfacing between Israelis and Palestinians on the ground in and near Gaza, even given the ceasefire agreement.",
      "\u201cRemember, there\u2019s a lot of people, radicals, fanatics, not just from the Hamas side, from the right wing of the Israeli side, who are absolutely incentivized to blow this whole deal up,\u201d the transition official said.",
      "Visiting Gaza would allow Witkoff to see for himself what the dynamics are there, rather than taking Israel\u2019s or the Palestinians\u2019 word for it, the official said, adding: \u201cYou got to see it, you got to feel it.\u201d",
      "While managing the current phase of the deal and negotiating the next, Trump and his team also are contending with longer-term solutions.",
      "\u201cIf we don\u2019t help the Gazans, if we don\u2019t make their life better, if we don\u2019t give them a sense of hope, there\u2019s going to be a rebellion,\u201d the transition official said.",
      "The question of how to rebuild Gaza remains, as well as where some 2 million Palestinians can be relocated in the meantime. Indonesia, for instance, is among the locations under discussion for where some of them could go, the transition official said.",
      "Even the question of whether Gazans would be willing to relocate is up in the air. The idea of relocation is deeply controversial among Palestinians and fellow Arabs. Many believe that relocating would be the first step in Israel forcing them off their land.",
      "At the moment, however, the issue of getting aid into Gaza that\u2019s required in the first phase of the ceasefire deal remains a challenge. Israel maintains concerns that Hamas takes a portion of any aid that\u2019s allowed into Gaza, and the humanitarian crisis there is dire. Hunger and disease are rampant and conditions are continuing to deteriorate.",
      "Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza over the last year and a half has killed more than 45,000 people in Gaza, most of whom were women and children, according to Palestinian health officials. The bombings have also decimated the enclave\u2019s health system and pushed people out of their homes and into squalid tent camps.",
      "Witkoff, a real estate developer who has known Trump for decades, went into negotiations for a deal \u2014 joining President Joe Biden\u2019s team that\u2019s been working toward it for more than a year \u2014 with a singular directive from Trump, the transition official said: Get the hostages home, and if you don\u2019t, come back and explain why.",
      "The window for achieving an agreement was narrower than it had ever been. Not only had Trump set a deadline \u2014 Jan. 20, when he\u2019s set to be sworn in to office \u2014 which had not been done in previous rounds of negotiation,\u00a0several additional hostages had died in the preceding weeks\u00a0as temperatures in the region got colder and conditions continued to deteriorate,\u00a0the transition official said.",
      "Trump\u2019s close alliance with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as well as the threat that he would not stop Israel from further bombing Gaza if there was no deal, also hung over the process.",
      "Israel is a close American ally and the U.S. has given the nation at least $17.9 billion in military aid over the last year.",
      "Witkoff used Trump\u2019s history with Israel and dynamic with Netanyahu to pressure the Israelis. In one instance, he went to see the prime minister on the Sabbath to have a blunt exchange.\u00a0Witkoff privately has told people his comments to Netanyahu that Saturday, Jan. 11, were not a threat, and that he had been invited to the prime minister\u2019s residence by one of Netanyahu\u2019s closest aides, Ron Dermer.",
      "Witkoff was in search of a reality check from Netanyahu about what he was willing to do, and candidly told him what was needed to get to an agreement, including for Israel to send a high-level representative to the negotiations in Doha who could make decisions in real time, the transition official said. He essentially conveyed to the prime minister, \u201cIf you\u2019re not intent on making a deal, then tell me, and I\u2019ll get on the plane and I\u2019ll go home.\u201d",
      "In discussions with Israeli officials, he also didn\u2019t hesitate to point out all that Trump had done for Israel. In his first term, Trump moved the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, recognized the Golan Heights as Israeli territory and cut U.S. aid for the Palestinians. At times in his discussions with Israeli officials, he also pointed to Trump\u2019s willingness to take political heat to get a deal and implored the Israelis to do the same.",
      "To Hamas, the message, delivered through the Qataris, was: Unless you\u2019re prepared to die, tell me why you don\u2019t see this as the deal that could ultimately lead to the end of the war?",
      "Witkoff also developed close ties with the families of hostages. They expressed worry that their loved ones would be left behind in the second phase of the deal, when they are supposed to be released, specifically concerned whether there would be enough Palestinian prisoners held by Israel to exchange: The numbers were built into the framework deal agreed to last May, and if there\u2019s no Phase 1, there can be no Phase 2,\u00a0which has yet to be negotiated.",
      "Phase 1 could fall apart at any time over the next six weeks, and the first American hostage, Keith Siegel, is not scheduled to be released until Day 14 of the ceasefire. Five other American families will not get their children home, alive or dead, unless the ceasefire holds into the second phase."

      "It has been a point of pride for him, and it is true. In the first year of Trump\u2019s first term,\u00a0U.S. forces, working with Syrian Kurdish allies,\u00a0defeated\u00a0the Islamic State\u2019s self-proclaimed \u201ccaliphate\u201d and liberated\u00a0its capital. But the fall of the Assad regime has left Syria at risk of coming apart under pressure from a variety of terrorist groups, local militias and Israeli airstrikes. And Syria\u2019s interim leaders, while proclaiming moderate intentions, have roots\u00a0in Al Qaeda and\u00a0another terrorist group, Hayat al Sham (HTS). The\u00a0nightmare scenario for many experts is that\u00a0ISIS could re-establish its stronghold in the fledgling state and export more terrorism to the West or inspire it, as it did the New Year\u2019s Day attack in New Orleans.",
      "The situation means that, once he is in office,\u00a0Trump will\u00a0most likely\u00a0have to make some hard choices \u2014\u00a0insist on withdrawing all or some of the 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria, in line with his previous positions,\u00a0or leave them in place to prevent an ISIS resurgence and a tarnishing of what he sees as his accomplishment in his first term. U.S. withdrawal\u00a0could easily re-create Syria as a base of operations for terrorist attacks\u00a0in\u00a0Israel, the United States and Europe.",
      "The United States has been relying on fighters from the\u00a0Syrian Defense Force (SDF),\u00a0an alliance led by Kurds\u00a0in northeast Syria,\u00a0to guard thousands of\u00a0captured\u00a0ISIS\u00a0fighters and their families\u00a0there. At the height of the war\u00a0against ISIS, Gen. Joseph Votel, a former commander of U.S. Central Command,\u00a0told NBC News\u00a0that the SDF\u2019s fighters were among the best he has ever led.",
      "But the SDF\u2019s commander in chief, Gen. Mazloum\u00a0Abdi,\u00a0told The Guardian this\u00a0month\u00a0that ISIS is growing in strength after it seized weapons from the collapsed\u00a0Syrian\u00a0regime. He\u00a0also\u00a0said the Kurdish forces are coming under increased pressure from\u00a0Turkish\u00a0President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, who views them, along with\u00a0Kurdish separatists based in Syria\u00a0known as the PKK,\u00a0as threats\u00a0to his regime.",
      "Outgoing Secretary of State Antony Blinken said\u00a0Monday in an interview with NBC News that the U.S. role in helping guide and shape what is happening in Syria is \u201cessential.\u201d",
      "Blinken described the situation on the ground as \u201cincredibly fragile,\u201d warning that \u201cwhat happens inside of Syria doesn\u2019t stay inside of Syria,\u201d with the potential for terrorism that goes well beyond its borders.",
      "The United States has a stake in the \u201cextraordinary opportunity that is now before the Syrian people to actually control their own lives and their own destinies,\u201d\u00a0he said. \u201cThat means, I believe, keeping some presence, but it also means being very engaged in all of the efforts to help support a Syrian-owned, Syrian-led transition to get the country to a better place.\u201d",
      "Theodore\u00a0Kattouf,\u00a0a career diplomat who was the U.S. ambassador to Syria under President George W. Bush,\u00a0told\u00a0NBC News\u00a0recently\u00a0that even if Trump were to continue bombing campaigns and targeted operations against the terrorist group, removing U.S. troops would leave the Kurdish coalition vulnerable and ultimately lead to an expanded footprint for ISIS.",
      "\u201cWith those troops out of there, we\u2019re putting a lot of U.S. interests at risk,\u201d\u00a0Kattouf\u00a0said. \u201cI don\u2019t see\u00a0[HTS]\u00a0or other allied rebel forces able to take on that issue right now.\u201d",
      "The fear among Biden administration counterterrorism officials\u00a0is that\u00a0a Trump withdrawal of U.S. forces would leave the Syrian Kurds guarding the ISIS prisoners vulnerable to attacks from other factions \u2014 or the looming presence of Turkey, just across the border.\u00a0Both\u00a0Trump in his first term and President Joe Biden\u00a0have worked hard to restrain Erdo\u011fan,\u00a0whose country remains\u00a0a NATO ally, from attacking America\u2019s Kurdish allies. Trump said\u00a0at his news conference last week that\u00a0he had asked Erdo\u011fan\u00a0not to\u00a0go\u00a0after \u201ccertain people,\u201d clearly referring to the Kurds.

      "Beyond serving as a base for operations and planning, any Syrian territory that falls to ISIS could help it project an image of power and resistance and inspire others around the world. The group has already been\u00a0expanding its global\u00a0reach through social media, sponsoring attacks and\u00a0influencing followers worldwide, including so-called lone wolves,\u00a0through what anti-terrorism experts say is a surge of sophisticated online propaganda. CIA Director William Burns\u00a0told NPR\u00a0last\u00a0week\u00a0that\u00a0the agency is \u201cquite concerned\u201d about the rising threat posed by ISIS, particularly its \u201cability to inspire people.\u201d\u00a0And in July, FBI Director Christopher Wray warned the House Judiciary Committee that \u201cthe greatest terrorism threat to our homeland has been posed by lone actors or small cells of individuals who typically radicalize to violence online and use easily accessible weapons to attack soft targets.\u201d",
      "The U.S. intelligence community\u00a0and the FBI have been sounding those alarm bells for more than a year.\u00a0A senior administration official\u00a0told\u00a0NBC News\u00a0on Friday, \u201cThere is a heightened focus on ISIS,\u201d pointing to the cancellation of three Taylor Swift Eras Tour shows in Vienna in August after warnings from U.S. intelligence of ISIS terrorist plots targeting the venues. And in March, gunmen from ISIS-K, an affiliate of ISIS based in Afghanistan, killed more than 130 people at the Crocus City Hall, a well-known concert venue outside Moscow, despite warnings from U.S. intelligence, according to U.S. officials.",
      "\u201cSyria could provide the group with the momentum that it\u2019s long sought to kind of spill back onto the headlines, whether that\u2019s ISIS K in Afghanistan, ISIS core, ISIS Central and Syria and parts of Iraq, and again, the homegrown violent extremists that live in the West that ISIS is attempting to push over the edge conduct the types of attack that we saw in New Orleans,\u201d counterterrorism\u00a0expert\u00a0Collin Clarke\u00a0of the Soufan Group\u00a0told NBC News\u00a0after the New Orleans attack.",

      "American boots?",
      "\u201cSyria is a mess, but is not our friend,\u201d Trump said on X in the hours before the collapse of the Assad regime, adding, \u201cThe United States should have nothing to do with it. This is not our fight. Let it play out. Do not get involved!\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s pick for national security adviser,\u00a0Rep. Mike Waltz,\u00a0R-Fla.,\u00a0echoed Trump\u2019s reluctance for the United States to intervene in Syria but underscored the incoming administration\u2019s commitment to combating ISIS. \u201cWe do not need American boots running around Syria in any way, shape or form, but we\u2019re keeping an eye on those things, ISIS, Israel\u2019s border, and kind of the broader dynamic with our Gulf allies,\u201d Waltz said on a podcast late last month.",
      "But experts question the ability to continue the fight against ISIS in Syria without a U.S.\u00a0military\u00a0presence.",
      "During the transition, a senior Biden administration official said, the current administration has been briefing Trump\u2019s national security team on the need for a continued U.S. military presence to prevent Russia, Turkey or Iran from gaining dominance. The outgoing Biden administration has itself been treading carefully, sending its top Middle East diplomat, Assistant Secretary of State Barbara\u00a0Leaf, to Damascus only after European counterparts had already visited and only after\u00a0public pressure\u00a0from the mother of Austin Tice, the American journalist believed to be imprisoned in Syria,\u00a0who said\u00a0the United States should be more engaged.\u00a0To even meet with the new interim leader, the State Department first\u00a0had to lift\u00a0the\u00a0$10\u00a0million bounty\u00a0it\u00a0had\u00a0put\u00a0on\u00a0his\u00a0head\u00a0when he led\u00a0HTS.",
      "But now the critical question of whether the United States should play a role in preventing Syria from again harboring terrorists or permitting power plays from U.S. regional adversaries will be on Trump\u2019s doorstep as he arrives at the White House. That and the challenge of combating the online propaganda that spreads ISIS\u2019 terrorist philosophy far and wide."

    "story": [
      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korea\u2019s impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol was formally arrested early on Sunday, days after being apprehended at his presidential compound in Seoul.",
      "Yoon\u2019s arrest could mark the beginning of an extended period in custody, lasting months or more. He faces possible imprisonment over his ill-fated declaration of martial law last month.",
      "The decision to arrest Yoon triggered unrest at the Seoul Western District Court, where dozens of his supporters broke in and rioted, destroying the main door and windows. They used plastic chairs, metal beams and police shields that they managed to wrestle away from officers. Some were seen throwing objects and using fire extinguishers, destroying furniture and glass doors. They shouted demands to see the judge who had issued the warrant, but she had already left.",
      "Hundreds of police officers were deployed and nearly 90 protesters were arrested. Some injured police officers were seen being treated at ambulance vans. The court said it was trying to confirm whether any staff members were injured and assess the damage to its facilities.",
      "A court deliberated for 8 hours",
      "Following eight hours of deliberation, the court granted law enforcement\u2019s request for an arrest warrant for Yoon, saying he was a threat to destroy evidence. Yoon and his lawyers on Saturday appeared before the court and argued for his release.",
      "Yoon, who has been in detention since he was apprehended Wednesday in a massive law enforcement operation at his residential compound, faces potential rebellion charges linked to his declaration of martial law on Dec. 3, which set off the country\u2019s most serious political crisis since its democratization in the late 1980s.",
      "While South Korean presidents have wide-ranging immunity from prosecution while in office, the protection does not extend to allegations of rebellion or treason.",
      "The Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials, which is leading a joint investigation with police and the military, can now extend Yoon\u2019s detention to 20 days, during which they will transfer the case to public prosecutors for indictment.",
      "Yoon\u2019s lawyers could also file a petition to challenge the court\u2019s arrest warrant.",
      "Yoon\u2019s appearance in court triggered chaotic scenes in nearby streets, where thousands of his fervent supporters rallied for hours calling for his release. Even before the court issued the warrant for Yoon\u2019s arrest, protesters repeatedly clashed with police who detained dozens of them, including about 20 who climbed over a fence in an attempt to approach the court. At least two vehicles carrying anti-corruption investigators were damaged as they left the court after arguing for Yoon\u2019s arrest.",
      "Yoon\u2019s lawyers said he spoke for about 40 minutes to the judge during the nearly five-hour closed-door hearing Saturday. His legal team and anti-corruption agencies presented opposing arguments about whether he should be held in custody.",
      "Yoon\u2019s defense minister, police chief and several top military commanders have already been arrested and indicted for their roles in the enforcement of martial law.",
      "Yoon\u2019s lawyer decries his arrest",
      "The crisis began when Yoon, in an attempt to break through legislative gridlock, imposed military rule and sent troops to the National Assembly and election offices. The standoff lasted only hours after lawmakers who managed to get through a blockade voted to lift the measure. The opposition-dominated assembly voted to impeach him on Dec. 14.",
      "His political fate now lies with the Constitutional Court, which is deliberating whether to formally remove him from office or reinstate him.",
      "Seok Dong-hyeon, one of Yoon\u2019s lawyers, called the court\u2019s decision to issue the warrant \u201cthe epitome of anti-constitutionalism and anti-rule of law,\u201d maintaining Yoon\u2019s claim that his martial law decree was a legitimate act of governance. He pointed to the chaos at the Seoul Western Court and said Yoon\u2019s arrest would inspire more anger from his supporters.",
      "Yoon\u2019s People Power Party regretted his arrest but also pleaded for his supporters to refrain from further violence.",
      "The liberal opposition Democratic Party, which drove the legislative effort to impeach Yoon on Dec. 14, said his arrest would be a \u201ccornerstone for restoring the collapsed constitutional order.\u201d Kim Sung-hoi, a party lawmaker and spokesperson, called for stern punishment of Yoon\u2019s supporters who stormed the court.",
      "\u201cI urge police to firmly enforce the law so that forces supporting rebellion will never even think of causing turmoil again,\u201d he said.",
      "The country\u2019s acting leader, Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, expressed \u201cstrong regret\u201d about the violence at the court, saying it \u201cdirectly undermines democracy and the rule of law.\u201d He asked for heightened security at the sites related to Yoon\u2019s case and measures to ensure order during protests.",
      "Yoon was transported to the court from a detention center in Uiwang, near Seoul, in a blue Justice Ministry van escorted by police and the presidential security service, to attend the hearing at the court ahead of its warrant decision.",
      "The motorcade entered the court\u2019s basement parking space as thousands of Yoon\u2019s supporters gathered in nearby streets amid a heavy police presence. Following the hearing, Yoon was transported back to the detention center, where he awaited the decision. He did not speak to reporters.",
      "After its investigators were attacked by protesters later on Saturday, the anti-corruption agency asked media companies to obscure the faces of its members attending the hearing.",
      "Yoon insists his martial law decree was legitimate",
      "Yoon and his lawyers have claimed that the martial law declaration was intended as a temporary and \u201cpeaceful\u201d warning to the liberal opposition, which he accuses of obstructing his agenda with its legislative majority. Yoon says the troops sent to the National Election Commission offices were to investigate election fraud allegations, which remains unsubstantiated in South Korea.",
      "Yoon has stressed he had no intention of stopping the functioning of the legislature. He stated that the troops were sent there to maintain order, not prevent lawmakers from entering and voting to lift martial law. He denied allegations that he ordered the arrests of key politicians and election officials.",
      "Military commanders, however, have described a deliberate attempt to seize the legislature that was thwarted by hundreds of civilians and legislative staff who helped lawmakers enter the assembly, and by the troops\u2019 reluctance or refusal to follow Yoon\u2019s orders.",
      "If prosecutors indict Yoon on rebellion and abuse of power charges, which are the allegations now being examined by investigators, they could keep him in custody for up to six months before trial.",
      "If the first court convicts him and issues a prison term, Yoon would serve that sentence as the case possibly moves up to the Seoul High Court and Supreme Court. Under South Korean law, orchestrating a rebellion is punishable by life imprisonment or the death penalty."

    "summary": "A man fatally shot two prominent hard-line judges in Iran\u2019s capital Saturday, officials said, both of whom allegedly took part in the mass execution of dissidents in 1988.",
    "story": [
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates \u2014 A man fatally shot two prominent hard-line judges in Iran\u2019s capital Saturday, officials said, both of whom allegedly took part in the\u00a0mass execution of dissidents\u00a0in 1988.",
      "No group immediately claimed responsibility for the shootings of the judges, clerics Mohammad Mogheiseh and Ali Razini. However, Razini\u2019s involvement in the 1988 executions had likely made him a target in the past, including an assassination attempt in 1999.",
      "Their killings, a rare attack targeting the judiciary, also come as Iran faces economic turmoil,\u00a0the mauling of its Mideast allies\u00a0by Israel and the return of Donald Trump to the White House on Monday.",
      "Both clerics served on Iran\u2019s Supreme Court, the state-run IRNA news agency reported. A bodyguard for one of the judges also was wounded in the attack at the Palace of Justice in Tehran, which also serves as the headquarters of the country\u2019s judiciary and typically has tight security.",
      "The attacker, who was armed with a handgun, killed himself, IRNA said.",
      "\u201cAccording to initial investigations, the person in question did not have a case in the Supreme Court nor was he a client of the branches of the court,\u201d the judiciary\u2019s Mizan news agency said. \u201cCurrently, investigations have been launched to identify and arrest the perpetrators of this terrorist act.\u201d",
      "Asghar Jahangir, a spokesman for Iran\u2019s judiciary, separately told Iranian state television that the shooter had been an \u201cinfiltrator,\u201d suggesting he had worked at the courthouse where the killings took place.",
      "Unlike the U.S. Supreme Court, the Iranian Supreme Court has many branches spread across the country. It is the highest court in Iran and can hear appeals on decisions made by lower courts.",
      "Razini had been targeted previously. In January 1999, attackers on motorcycles hurled an explosive at his vehicle, wounding him as he left work as the head of the judiciary in Tehran.",
      "Mogheiseh had been under sanctions from the U.S. Treasury since 2019. At the time, the Treasury described him as having \u201coverseen countless unfair trials, during which charges went unsubstantiated and evidence was disregarded.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe is notorious for sentencing scores of journalists and internet users to lengthy prison terms,\u201d the Treasury said. Mogheiseh had pressed charges against members of Iran\u2019s Baha\u2019i minority \u201cafter they reportedly held prayer and worship ceremonies with other members,\u201d the Treasury said.",
      "Both men had been named by activists and exiles as taking part in the 1988 executions, which came at the end of Iran\u2019s long war with Iraq. After Iran\u2019s then-Supreme Leader Ruhollah Khomeini accepted a U.N.-brokered ceasefire, members of the exiled Iranian opposition group Mujahedeen-e-Khalq, or MEK, heavily armed by Saddam Hussein, stormed across the Iranian border in a surprise attack.",
      "Iran ultimately blunted their assault, but the attack set the stage for the sham retrials of political prisoners, militants and others that would become known as \u201cdeath commissions.\u201d",
      "International rights groups estimate that as many as 5,000 people were executed, while the MEK puts the number at 30,000. Iran has never fully acknowledged the executions, apparently carried out on Khomeini\u2019s orders, though some argue that other top officials were effectively in charge in the months before his 1989 death.",
      "The MEK declined to comment when reached by The Associated Press.",
      "While Mogheiseh never addressed the accusation he took part in the 1988 \u201cdeath commissions,\u201d Razini gave a 2017 interview published by Iran\u2019s Shargh newspaper in which he defended the panels as \u201cfair and completely in accordance with the law.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur friends and I who are among the 20 judges in the country, we did our best to ensure the security of that time and the years after and from then, we guaranteed that the hypocrites (the MEK) could never become powerful in this country,\u201d he reportedly said."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Donald Trump didn\u2019t hide his disdain for the State Department in his first term, dismissing it as the \"Deep State Department,\" a nickname that implied a cabal of career diplomats were subverting his foreign policy goals.",
      "In the new term that starts Monday, Trump may have come up with a workaround, empowering a series of special envoys whose main responsibilities are whatever missions he gives them to carry out.",
      "The arrangement jibes with Trump\u2019s larger goal of stocking important government jobs with people he deems loyal to his agenda.",
      "But the fast-growing latticework of special envoys, ambassadors and foreign policy professionals creates the potential for duplication that may confuse foreign capitals about who\u2019s really running things, critics contend.",
      "In Britain alone, no fewer than three incoming officials may be able to rightly claim they have Trump's ear or know his thinking.",
      "There's Marco Rubio, Trump\u2019s nominee for secretary of state and onetime political rival; Warren Stephens, the billionaire investment banker nominated to be the ambassador; and Mark Burnett, the incoming special envoy who produced \"The Apprentice,\" the television show that amped up Trump\u2019s celebrity.",
      "\"I'm mystified by the notion that you would have an ambassador to the United Kingdom and a special envoy to the United Kingdom.

      "If foreign capitals perceive that Trump\u2019s envoys are the ones with real clout, it could undermine Rubio and a State Department tasked with promoting America\u2019s enduring national interests.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re building a diplomatic mess,\u201d said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., a member of the Foreign Relations Committee.",
      "\u201cHistorically, presidents have always used envoys,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t broadly have a problem with a president appointing envoys. I just think you should do it in a way that doesn\u2019t create a real mess of overlapping responsibilities.\"",
      "Foreign governments are already trying to game out how best to make their cases to the incoming Trump administration.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been in touch with several officers and envoys, and it\u2019s a bit confusing,\u201d a foreign diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re not sure the envoy and the secretary himself know exactly their responsibilities. Who\u2019s in charge on what issue?\u201d",

      "Rubio faced a question about the role of special envoys at his confirmation hearing Wednesday. Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., asked what he would do to ensure the State Department \u201cmaintains its authority\u201d while seeing to it that the Trump administration vets the special envoys for \u201cpotential conflicts of interest.\u201d",
      "Rubio called the question \u201cvalid\u201d but said he expects to work well with each envoy.",

      "As Trump described it, their mission is to bring movies to foreign countries and thus improve Hollywood\u2019s bottom line.",
      "Not all of the envoys have Trump\u2019s confidence. He named Morgan Ortagus, a State Department spokeswoman in his first term, as a deputy to Witkoff, but he wrote in the announcement that he was doing so to appease fellow Republicans.",
      "\u201cEarly on, Morgan fought me for three years, but hopefully has learned her lesson,\u201d Trump said, without elaborating. (Ortagus said on Fox News in 2016 that she disagreed with Trump\u2019s \u201cisolationist approach to foreign policy.\u201d)",
      "Many presidents have seen value in bringing in special envoys to tackle thorny problems abroad. It\u2019s a way of reassuring Americans that the White House is focusing attention on particular trouble spots.",

    "published": "Sat, 18 Jan 2025 10:11:59 GMT",
    "summary": "The arrival of American users on RedNote has brought instant online connection between Americans and Chinese even as academic and other exchanges have dampened.",
    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 For most people in the U.S. and China, what they hear about each other\u2019s countries comes mostly from their governments and the media. Now they are learning directly from each other, at least for now.",
      "The excitement is palpable on the Chinese social media platform RedNote, or Xiaohongshu (\u201cLittle Red Book\u201d) as it\u2019s known in Chinese, after a wave of American users set up accounts in recent days. The self-described \u201cTikTok refugees\u201d are seeking a replacement for the short-form video app as it faces a U.S. ban stemming from concerns over ties between TikTok\u2019s owner, Beijing-based ByteDance, and the Chinese government.",
      "TikTok says it will go dark when the ban takes effect Sunday unless it receives \u201cdefinitive\u201d assurances from the Biden administration, which has been \u201cexploring options\u201d for how to keep the app available, NBC News reported.",
      "In protest of the looming ban, TikTok users have joined Shanghai-based RedNote, sending it to the top of Apple\u2019s App Store and mocking U.S. security concerns as they try to navigate the Chinese-language app.",
      "Their arrival has brought instant online connection between Americans and Chinese even as academic and other exchanges have been dampened in recent years by pandemic border restrictions and tensions between the world\u2019s two biggest economies.",
      "\u201cI feel very touched to see all of the friendly American people coming here, and see we are getting to know each other and learning from each other,\u201d said Eric Wang, a 28-year-old graphic designer from China\u2019s Shandong province. \u201cIt makes me feel that we\u2019re never really far away from each other.\u201d",
      "On RedNote, Americans and Chinese can communicate in a way they are mostly unable to on Western social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook and X, all of which are inaccessible in China without VPNs. TikTok is also not available in China, although it does have a version there called Douyin.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very moving to see people who have never met, and who may have been misinformed about each other in the past, now engaging on equal terms and eager to learn about each other,\u201d said Jia Yuxuan, a research associate at the Center for China and Globalization, a think tank in Beijing.",
      "The trust that is being established through these connections \u201chas already led to a wave of fact-checking that traditional diplomacy hasn\u2019t been able to achieve in years,\u201d she said.",
      "For example, Americans on RedNote have been asking if people in China really live under a \u201csocial credit system\u201d that scores individuals based on their behavior and blacklists them if their scores are too low.",
      "\u201cThe Chinese netizens in the comments section are simply astonished and say, \u2018This is not true,\u2019\u201d Jia said.",
      "In just one day this week, the number of U.S. iPhone users on RedNote increased from about 400,000 to 1.8 million, according to data from analytics firm Similarweb, and it has since gone even higher. That is still a tiny portion of the 170 million American users on TikTok and 300 million users on Xiaohongshu overall.",
      "The new American users could create problems for the app, which like other Chinese social media platforms is strictly controlled by government censors and is not well equipped to moderate English-language content. The situation has drawn comparisons to the Clubhouse app, which China blocked in 2021 after a brief period in which Chinese users freely discussed politically taboo topics in its chat rooms.",
      "Xiaohongshu has not publicly commented on the influx of new users. The company did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Americans, meanwhile, may chafe under China\u2019s online censorship.",
      "\u201cThere is a very naive base of users in America, who don\u2019t understand any of this. They\u2019re just upset that TikTok is going to be banned,\u201d said Christine Lu, 48, a Los Angeles-based Taiwanese American who lived in China for a decade.",
      "It took all of five hours for Lu\u2019s RedNote account to be banned after she signed up on Tuesday, after she purposely posted hashtags and pictures related to topics deemed sensitive in China. She said she began testing the app after seeing some American users complain that some of their posts, including ones showing cleavage or the flags of Taiwan and Tibet, were getting blocked.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re posts that otherwise in free societies are very normal conversation topics,\u201d she said.",
      "Not all Chinese users are thrilled with the Americans piling into their online community.\u00a0Some who depend on RedNote as a source of income say they may face unfair competition from their American counterparts, whose TikTok-length videos are far shorter than what is typical for the Chinese app.",
      "\u201cIt only takes like two seconds and they\u2019re getting hundreds, thousands and even tens of thousands of likes,\u201d said Becca Wang, a lifestyle vlogger in Beijing.",
      "Others say the new American users need to learn to play by the rules of the Chinese-language app and should respect the culture of its existing users, including by using the app\u2019s Chinese name of Xiaohongshu.",
      "\u201cIf they can\u2019t pronounce it, they should learn,\u201d one comment read.",
      "Yolanda Ma, a journalism lecturer at the University of Hong Kong, said it was unclear how the app would handle the influx of American users. For example, live broadcasts are required to be in Chinese, with English and other languages considered inappropriate and subject to warnings.",
      "If the company decides to broaden its user base, she said in an email, then the best approach would be a separate app for international users, \u201cto both ensure the content on the platform is under control, and to keep the new users on the platform after the initial few days of excitement.\u201d",
      "The discussion between American and Chinese users on RedNote revolves around what they had for breakfast, how they make their morning coffee, what their front yards look like and how they make a living. Jia saw one American fisherman ask if there are fishermen in China.",
      "\u201cIn the comment section, everybody is sharing their catch and fishing equipment,\u201d she said.",
      "Users are also going deeper, asking one another about salaries, debt and health care systems to compare how well they\u2019re living under America\u2019s capitalist system and China\u2019s socialist system.",
      "\u201cThe conclusion is that the ordinary workers are basically the same,\u201d Jia said. \u201cThey\u2019re both struggling for life, and they\u2019re also aspiring for a better life.\u201d",
      "Diego Obando, a new RedNote user who lives in Pasadena, California, says the app is fairly easy to use and has a \u201cnicer\u201d community than TikTok. Obando, 19, said he isn\u2019t really concerned about security, because \u201cthere\u2019s always someone spying on you on any app you\u2019re on.\u201d",
      "Beijing has so far appeared open to the idea of Americans on RedNote.",
      "The Chinese Foreign Ministry said Wednesday that \u201cwe believe that the use of social media is a personal choice.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs a matter of principle, China has always supported and encouraged strengthening people-to-people exchanges and the promotion of people-to-people bonds with all countries,\u201d spokesperson Guo Jiakun said at a regular briefing in Beijing.",
      "Chinese state media coverage has also been positive.",
      "\u201cMoving to RedNote can be seen as an act of defiance against the U.S. government\u2019s narrative that Chinese apps are security threats,\u201d read a commentary Wednesday in the People\u2019s Daily newspaper. \u201cBy embracing RedNote, users challenge the assumption that Chinese platforms are inherently dangerous.\u201d",
      "Jia said Beijing\u2019s openness to the new RedNote users was in line with its efforts to draw more foreign tourists as its economy struggles to recover from the pandemic. Since 2023, China has introduced visa-free policies for visitors from countries around the world, though not yet the United States.",
      "Others were more skeptical, saying the Chinese government was bound to step in.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think this is going to last forever,\u201d said Wang, the lifestyle blogger. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be short.\u201d",
      "Mithil Aggarwal and Jennifer Jett reported from Hong Kong, Larissa Gao from London and Janis Mackey Frayer from Beijing."

    "summary": "TEL AVIV \u2014 For eight months, the framework of the ceasefire deal that could bring an end to the war between Israel and Hamas had been on the table, prompting fury about the delay among some, and now praise for President-elect Donald Trump for helping to get it over the line.",
    "story": [
      "TEL AVIV \u2014 For eight months, the framework of the ceasefire deal that could bring an end to the war between Israel and Hamas had been on the table, prompting fury about the delay among some, and now praise for President-elect Donald Trump for helping to get it over the line.",
      "President Joe Biden confirmed in a statement Wednesday that the deal was based on the \u201cprecise contours\u201d of a May 2024 ceasefire plan that was \u201cendorsed unanimously\u201d by the United Nations Security Council. He also credited the work of key negotiators, including Egypt and Qatar, and \u201cextreme pressure\u201d on Hamas for helping to secure the truce.",
      "While U.S. officials have credited the collaboration between Trump\u2019s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, and Biden\u2019s Middle East representative Brett McGurk for securing the deal, the president-elect sought to claim much of the credit for himself on Thursday.",
      "Biden \u201cdidn\u2019t do anything,\u201d he said in an interview on \u201cThe Dan Bongino Show.\u201d\u00a0\u201cIf I didn\u2019t do this, if we didn\u2019t get involved, the hostages would never be out.\u201d",
      "The deal could soon bring an end to more than 15 months of war in Gaza that began on Oct. 7, 2023, with Hamas attacks on Israel in which roughly 1,200 people were killed and around 240 people taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict. Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza has killed more than 46,500 people since then, according to health officials in the enclave.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked Trump directly for his role in the negotiations in a phone call Wednesday, Netanyahu\u2019s office said in a statement. Afterward, he thanked Biden in a separate call, the statement added.",
      "For David Mencer, a spokesman for Netanyahu, it was Hamas that had changed its stance since the deal was first tabled in May. The death of its leader Yahya Sinwar, who was confirmed killed by Israeli forces in October, had also played a role, he said in a voice note Friday.",
      "\u201cWhat changed was that Hamas had been heavily degraded,\u201d he said, adding that most of its leadership had been \u201celiminated\u201d and \u201ctheir weapons stockpile has been wiped out.\u201d",
      "In an interview with NBC\u2019s \u201cTODAY\u201d on Thursday, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby also said, \u201cWhat really got us to this point was the isolating and weakening of Hamas.\u201d Previously, Hamas had thrown up obstacles to the deal \u201ctime and time again\u201d and \u201cwasn\u2019t willing to negotiate in good faith,\u201d he added.",
      "Trump\u2019s support for the deal had \u201ccertainly helped,\u201d but \u201cwe need to stop worrying about this whole credit business and who gets credit for what,\u201d he said.",
      "Asher Kaufman, a professor of history and peace studies at Indiana\u2019s University of Notre Dame, also noted that progress in the talks came amid a shifting landscape in the Middle East, although he did attribute the success to Trump.",
      "\u201cIt has to be remembered that the world, the region has changed with the weakening of Hezbollah, the weakening of Iran, the fall of Assad,\u201d he said in a phone interview on Thursday. \u201cThere are changing dynamics ... which facilitate the possibility of such an arrangement.\u201d",
      "Nonetheless, he said, he believed that ultimately Trump was \u201cthe game changer in a sense, because of the relationship between him and Netanyahu.\u201d",
      "Inside Israel, many are crediting the \u201cTrump effect\u201d for the breakthrough.",
      "Among them is Efrat Machikawa, whose 80-year-old uncle Gadi Moses remains in captivity. \u201cI\u2019m very grateful for the Biden administration for the very long period where they tried, but I have to say the Trump effect is great,\u201d Machikawa, 56, said Friday.",
      "Machikawa, 56, added that she had not received any news about her uncle for months, but he is\u00a0on the list of the 33 hostages expected to be released in the first phase of the ceasefire deal. Not knowing his fate was \u201cjust terrible,\u201d she said.",
      "Trump was also credited as the \u201cX factor\u201d that got the deal over the line by Gil Dickmann, whose cousin Carmel Gat was taken hostage and killed in Gaza. Dickmann said in an interview Wednesday that the only thing that had changed since May was \u201cthat Carmel is now dead and Trump is now president, and now we have a deal.\u201d",
      "In Gaza, the death toll has risen by more than 11,500 since May, according to Palestinian tallies, although researchers have warned that the death toll is likely significantly higher than official numbers suggest and thousands of people are feared buried under the rubble.",
      "Even Gershon Baskin, an Israeli who has acted as a mediator with Hamas for decades, credited Trump for the success, although he said it was \u201cdisgusting\u201d that a truce has only come to fruition eight months after it was first tabled.",
      "Pointing to the fact that thousands of Palestinians and several hostages were killed in Gaza in the intervening period, Baskin, a frequent critic of Netanyahu\u2019s government, said it was \u201coutrageous\u201d that it had taken so long.",
      "\u201cIt was only really accepted in the end because Trump came along and Trump told Netanyahu to do it,\u201d added the seasoned negotiator, who helped to secure the release of captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit more than a decade ago.",
      "Just as it seemed ready to be approved, the deal appeared to hit a roadblock after Netanyahu\u2019s office claimed Hamas had reneged on part of the agreement \u2014 an accusation the group strongly denied.",
      "However, in the early hours of Friday morning, Nentanyahu\u2019s office said he would seek approval for a deal from his security Cabinet and then his full Cabinet. Israel\u2019s Supreme Court would then have 24 hours to permit an appeal.",
      "If all goes to plan, the deal will come into effect as early as this Sunday, the day before Trump\u2019s inauguration.",
      "But Baskin said he feared a \u201cdifficult process\u201d in seeing the three-phase ceasefire deal enforced in the months ahead.",
      "\u201cThe crucial thing is that it has to be implemented now,\u201d he said."

      "She saw the missed call in the morning and texted back to arrange a call. Then she got another voice message asking for a donation, saying Thailand was the only member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, that had not donated.",
      "When she received another text instructing her to transfer money to a foreign bank account, \u201cI knew this was not real,\u201d Paetongtarn said.",
      "She did not say when she received the messages.",
      "Southeast Asia has become a hub for telecom and other online fraud, especially in the border towns connecting Thailand, Laos and Myanmar, the latter of which is mired in a civil war.

      "They are then forced to engage in what are known as \u201cpig-butchering scams,\u201d using psychological manipulation and other techniques to lure others into online investment or fake romantic relationships in an effort to defraud them of money, in some cases their life savings. The scam centers target people all over the world, including the United States.",

According to Thai police, the actor, Wang Xing, 22, believed he was going to a casting call in Thailand but ended up being trained to scam other Chinese people.",
      "The case was widely shared on social media in China, where authorities have been calling for a crackdown on the scam operations.",
      "Speaking at the ASEAN digital ministers meeting in Bangkok on Thursday, Paetongtarn said online scams were a serious threat to the public and that combating them required regional cooperation.",

    "summary": "Roki Sasaki, a 23-year-old right-handed ace from Japan, signed with the MLB.",
    "story": [
      "Japanese pitcher Roki Sasaki, the hottest international free agent in baseball, is headed to the Los Angeles Dodgers, he announced on social media Friday.",
      "The 23-year-old right-hander said he signed a minor-league deal. Terms of the agreement were not disclosed.",
      "\"I have signed a minor contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers,\" he said on Instagram in a translated post from Japanese to English. \"It was a very difficult decision, but I will do my best to make it the right decision when I look back after my baseball career. I want to slip my sleeve on the Dodgers uniform at the opening conference, thanking everyone who has supported me this far.\"",
      "Sasaki is just the latest Japanese star to join MLB. Reigning National League MVP Shohei Ohtani signed a 10-year, $700 million deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers ahead of the 2024 season after six years with the Los Angeles Angels. The franchise also brought in pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto in 2023 on a 12-year, $325 million deal. Both were instrumental in Los Angeles winning the 2024 World Series.",
      "Sasaki's long-awaited signing follows a suspenseful offseason, during which teams including the, San Diego Padres, Toronto Blue Jays, New York Yankees, the Chicago Cubs and the San Francisco Giants courted the young pitcher. For his initial meetings with teams, Sasaki requested that no players be present, prompting much speculation around his landing spot.",
      "By Monday, Sasaki had narrowed down his finalists to Blue Jays, Dodgers and Padres. Many saw the Dodgers as the long-held favorites thanks to his experience playing with Ohtani and Yamamoto on the Japanese national team and the team\u2019s star-studded lineup. The Padres were also seen as a major contender because Sasaki would be reunited with his one-time mentor, accomplished Japanese pitcher Yu Darvish.",
      "Despite Sasaki\u2019s draw, his contract isn\u2019t the blockbuster that others like Ohtani have signed because of MLB rules. International players under the age of 25 are considered amateurs and can only sign a minor-league contract with an additional bonus.",
      "Sasaki, who played for the Chiba Lotte Marines in Japan\u2019s Nippon Professional Baseball League, has a career ERA of 2.10 with 505 career strikeouts and a 29-15 record. In 2022, he threw a perfect game against the Orix Buffaloes, NPB\u2019s first perfect game in almost 30 years. His stellar performance earned him the nickname \u201cthe Monster of the Reiwa Era,\u201d referring to Japan\u2019s current political era. Still, Sasaki has said he has more to learn in MLB.",
      "\u201cRoki is by no means a finished product,\u201d Sasaki\u2019s agent Joel Wolfe told Sports Illustrated of his move to the U.S. \u201cHe knows it, and the teams know it. He\u2019s incredibly talented. We all know that. But he is a guy that wants to be great. He\u2019s not coming here just to be rich or to get a huge contract. He wants to be great. He wants to be one of the greatest ever.\u201d"

      "Putin praised the deal as a \u201creal breakthrough, creating conditions for the stable and sustainable development of Russia, Iran and the entire region.\u201d",
      "He said the amount of trade and economic cooperation was still insufficient, voicing hope the new treaty will help clear bureaucratic hurdles and expand ties. The Russian leader added that the countries are trying to resolve technical obstacles to advance planned projects to ship Russian natural gas to Iran and build transport corridors to Iranian ports in the Gulf.",
      "Pezeshkian said the projects are feasible, adding that experts were working to resolve the remaining obstacles.",
      "\u201cWe witness a new chapter of strategic relations,\u201d the Iranian president said, adding that the countries were set to expand trade ties and also boost the \u201clevel of security cooperation.\u201d",
      "His visit came ahead of Monday\u2019s inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, who has pledged to broker peace in Ukraine and take a tougher stance on Iran, which is grappling with growing economic problems and other challenges, including military setbacks in its sphere of influence across the Middle East.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed any link with Trump\u2019s inauguration, saying the signing had been planned long ago.",
      "The signing of the treaty with Iran follows last year\u2019s pact with North Korea \u2014 countries once identified by former President George W. Bush, along with Iraq, as \u201cthe Axis of Evil.\u201d",
      "Welcoming Pezeshkian as they sat down for talks, Putin said the new treaty will \u201cgive an additional impulse to practically all areas of our cooperation.\u201d",
      "Pezeshkian, who met Putin for the third time since coming to power in July, said the documents form a \u201csolid foundation for our forward movement.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe do consider our relations with you as vital, sensitive and strategic, and we are on this path strongly,\u201d he said.",
      "The Iranian president emphasized that countries in the region should resolve their own problems themselves, adding in an apparent reference to the U.S. that the presence of outside forces will only exacerbate tensions and destabilize the situation.",
      "\u201cThey come from another side of the world to make chaos in the region,\u201d he said. \u201cThese ties will defuse their plot, definitely.\u201d",
      "Russia\u2019s ties with Iran have grown closer after Putin sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022. Ukraine and the West have accused Tehran of providing Moscow with hundreds of drones for use to attack Ukraine, which Moscow and Tehran have denied.",
      "Pezeshkian spoke in support of prospective Russia-Ukraine peace talks, saying that \u201cwar is not a solution\u201d and urging the West to \u201cavoid imposing excessive demands\u201d and acknowledge others\u2019 \u201csecurity concerns.\u201d",
      "Last year, Iran joined the BRICS bloc of developing economies and Pezeshkian attended its summit, which was hosted by Russia in Kazan.",
      "Russia and Iran, which had troubled relations in the past, developed cordial ties after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, with Moscow emerging as a key trade partner and supplier of weapons and technologies for Tehran, which has faced bruising international sanctions.",
      "Russia built Iran\u2019s first nuclear plant that was launched in 2013 and is building two more nuclear reactors there.",
      "Russia was part of the 2015 deal between Iran and six nuclear powers offering sanctions relief for Tehran in exchange for curbing its atomic program, and the Kremlin offered political support to Iran when the U.S. unilaterally withdrew from the agreement during Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "Russia and Iran also pooled their efforts to shore up Bashar Assad\u2019s government during Syria\u2019s civil war, but failed to prevent his downfall last month after a lightning offensive by the opposition. Assad and his family fled to Russia.",
      "His ouster dealt another blow to Tehran\u2019s self-described \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d across the region, which had already been pummeled by Israel\u2019s offensives against two militant groups backed by Iran \u2014Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israel also attacked Iran directly on two occasions.",
      "Tehran increasingly needs Moscow\u2019s assistance as it faces economic woes and stinging setbacks across its sphere of influence in the Middle East. The troubles could deepen after Trump returns to the White House with his policy of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d on Iran.",
      "In particular, Iran wants sophisticated Russian weapons like long-range air defense systems and fighter jets to help fend off possible attacks by Israel."

      "FIFA has suspended Panama's soccer federation president in the wake of fat-shaming comments he aimed at a star player on Panama's national team last May.",
      "The decision to ban Manuel Arias, who is the acting president of the Panamanian Football Federation known as FEPAFUT, means he will be barred \u00a0by the international football governing body for six months.",
      "\"President Arias was sanctioned for 6 months until July 14, 2025, a period during which he will not be able to participate in activities related to federated football,\" a statement from FEPAFUT said late Thursday.",
      "As replacement, First Vice President Fernando Arce will be taking over the lead duties, the statement added.",
      "Arias' sanction comes months after he directed body-shaming comments towards the Panama women's national team in response to a comment by star player Marta Cox.",
      "After her team was knocked out of an international tournament last spring, Cox told local media that Panama players' greatest hurdle was their lack of adequate facilities at home.",
      "The comment sparked an outburst from Arias, who told reporters that Cox is \"out of shape, she\u2019s fat, she couldn\u2019t move on the pitch.\"",
      "Arias added that Cox, who made history in 2023 for scoring Panama's first-ever Women's World Cup goal, \"doesn't know anything about the Panama league for years, she doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on here.\u201d",
      "Arias' comments pushed Cox to announce that she was not sure she would keep her spot on the team, saying in a statement in May, \"If this type of situation becomes a constant, I will not return to defend the colours of the Panama national team.\"",
      "Quickly after, the federation said Arias \"pledged\" he would not repeat those comments.",
      "\"In the Federation we are committed to continue working for women's football, as we have been doing for the last five years through sports and training programs focused on women,\" the federation said in a statement last May.",
      "Nonetheless, FIFA has decided to bar the president from the league, a decision that FEPAFUT said they had no part in.",
      "\"It is important to emphasize that the Panamanian Football Federation is not a party to any past or present proceedings before any FIFA jurisdictional body and this sanction imposed on the president does not, and will not, affect the normal functioning of the institution,\" the federation's statement Thursday said.",
      "After the ban was announced Thursday, Arias took to social media to acknowledge what he called his \"unfortunate\" language.",
      "\u201cI used some very unfortunate language that should never be used,\u201d Arias said on X.",
      "The federation added that they still hope to continue with their goal of promoting the women's team \"through concrete actions such as equalizing travel expenses and prizes in our women\u2019s and men\u2019s teams, in addition to the recent renewal of the coaching staff in our U-20 and Senior women\u2019s teams, without forgetting the continued development of the Women\u2019s and Men\u2019s Youth Tournaments in their U-14 and U-16 categories.\"",
      "Still, the federation continued, it recognizes \"we still have work to do.\"",
      "FIFA has not yet responded to NBC News' request for comment."

      "Erling Haaland has signed a new contract at Manchester City through 2034, committing his long-term future to the Premier League champions with one of the most lucrative deals in soccer amid uncertain times for the club on and off the field.",
      "City announced the deal \u2014 covering 10 years from the start of this season \u2014 on Friday for the 24-year-old Haaland, who has scored 111 goals in 125 games since joining the club from Borussia Dortmund in 2022 to establish himself as\u00a0one of the best strikers in the world.",
      "The deal is the longest in the Premier League, with Haaland reportedly earning around 500,000 pounds ($600,000) per week.",
      "Asked what his reaction was when told of the unusual length of Haaland\u2019s contract, City manager Pep Guardiola replied: \u201cI said, \u2018Can you repeat?\u2019\u201d",
      "The Norway striker will be turning age 34 when the contract expires. The Athletic reported that the deal removed release clauses that were in his previous contract, which was due to expire in June 2027.",
      "\u201cNow I want to keep developing, keep working to get better and look to do my best to try and help us achieve more success going forward,\u201d Haaland said in a City statement.",
      "The new deal for Haaland comes as City awaits a verdict after being charged with 115 breaches of the Premier League\u2019s financial rules. Possible sanctions include a points deduction or relegation from the top division.",
      "Among\u00a0the promotional material published by City\u00a0to announce the Haaland deal, the striker said tellingly: \u201cNow I am City no matter what.\u201d",
      "In one of the videos, Haaland is seen calling City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak to say: \u201cIt\u2019s all signed now.\u201d",

      "It kickstarts what looks like being a busy few weeks for City, which is expected to buy multiple players with the team enduring its worst season since Guardiola joined as manager in 2016.",
      "City is sixth in the Premier League after 21 games of a title defense that has been derailed by injuries to key players and a dip in form of others. Guardiola\u2019s team isn\u2019t even sure of advancing to the knockout stage of the Champions League, either, and has a crucial game against Paris Saint-Germain next week.",
      "City has been linked with signing striker Omar Marmoush from Eintracht Frankfurt and young defenders Abdukodir Khusanov from Lens and Vitor Reis from Palmeiras. They would reportedly cost more than $150 million.",

      "\u201cTo get this feeling of hunger inside every single one of us to not look at things easier. Don\u2019t take things for granted, that is an important thing. I will do everything I can to change things around.\u201d",

      "\u201cOf course he is a special player,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cTo find a player like Erling, it\u2019s so difficult to find a striker at that level. Once you have it, you need to make the effort to keep him.\u201d",
      "Haaland, who\u00a0announced in October\u00a0he was expecting his first child with his girlfriend, said it has \u201cbeen like a dream in this two-and-a-half years.\u201d",
