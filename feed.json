      "The documentary \u201cJohn Candy: I Like Me,\u201d directed by Colin Hanks and produced by Ryan Reynolds, is a tribute not just to Candy the actor, but Candy, the man",
      "TORONTO -- TORONTO (AP) \u2014 \u201cI wish I had more bad things to say about him,\u201d Bill Murray says in the opening moments of the documentary \u201cJohn Candy: I Like Me.\u201d",
      "It has always been hard to find a negative word about Candy. The great Canadian comedian and actor not only radiated a warm, down-to-earth friendliness in movies like \u201cPlanes, Trains and Automobiles,\u201d \u201cUncle Buck\u201d and \u201cThe Great Outdoors,\u201d he was that way off screen, too. As Mel Brooks says in the film, \u201cHe was a total actor because he was a total person.\u201d",
      "\u201cJohn Candy: I Like Me,\u201d directed by Colin Hanks and produced by Ryan Reynolds, is a tribute not just to Candy the actor, but Candy, the man. On Thursday night, it premieres as the opening night film of the Toronto International Film Festival. For a beloved Canadian icon like Candy, whose nickname was \u201cJohnny Toronto,\u201d the setting could hardly be more fitting. To reference Candy\u2019s cameo in \u201cThe Blues Brothers,\u201d it\u2019s an occasion that calls for orange whips, all around.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t tell you the amount of meetings we had about when the movie can be made, and maybe we can do this festival or that,\u201d Hanks says. \u201cAnd I just kept thinking in the back of my mind: Well, this is a gigantic waste of time. It should just be at Toronto. Period. The End.\u201d",
      "\u201cJohn Candy: I Like Me,\u201d which will debut on Prime Video on Oct. 10, is a kind of cinematic eulogy for Candy, who died of heart failure at the age of 43 in 1994. Long ago as that was, \u201cI Like Me\u201d is the first feature documentary to tackle Candy, who might be even more popular three decades after his death.",
      "\u201cPart of me hates the fact that John maybe never really saw how beloved he was,\u201d Reynolds says. \u201cHe left something really lasting. He died of a heart failure and ironically the thing he left behind was his heart. That\u2019s the thing that stays.\u201d",
      "Hanks, Reynolds and Candy\u2019s children, Jennifer and Chris Candy, spoke in interviews before the TIFF opening about the making of \u201cJohn Candy: I Like Me,\u201d the title of which comes from one of Candy\u2019s most memorable lines from \u201cTrains, Planes and Automobiles.\u201d But it also serves as a guiding ethos to the documentary.",
      "Candy, who grew up in working-class Ontario and whose father also died young, had his own long-range struggles with that loss. He also, through a people-pleasing smile, dealt with the sometimes insensitive way his size was discussed in the media. Says Reynolds: \u201cHe was self-effacing his work, but not self-loathing. He didn\u2019t make a sport of punching down, not even on himself.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe left, but he did leave us some tools to get through this,\u201d says Chris Candy, 40, speaking alongside his 45-year-old sister. \u201cThat would be through the way he raised us and also saying it\u2019s OK to talk to someone if you have heavy feelings.\u201d",
      "For the Candys, \u201cI Like Me\u201d is an extremely emotional experience but one they\u2019re grateful for. They have each navigated their own way through an upbringing marked by their father\u2019s loss. It was years before Chris could visit his father\u2019s grave site or rewatch his movies. Once he did, he was astonished at his father\u2019s talent.",
      "For Jennifer, her father's movies helped carry her through grief.",
      "\u201cI jumped in and watched everything. All through college, I made sure I had the whole DVD collection,\u201d she says. \u201cFor me that was a constant reminder to hear his voice. We had cassette tapes of his \u2018Radio Kandy\u2019 show that I would just listen to all the time in the car during high school.\u201d",

      "Hanks, whose directorial work includes the 2015 documentary \u201cAll Things Must Pass: The Rise and Fall of Tower Records,\u201d wanted to find a thread for the film that went beyond tribute. To him, the movie is about drilling down on what gave Candy such an everyman quality. What made him, to millions, like their Uncle Buck. Hanks experienced Candy's effect firsthand as a child visiting his father, Tom Hanks, on the set of \u201cSplash.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have vivid memories of visiting on set. He was just one of my parents\u2019 friends, someone they worked with,\u201d says Hanks. \u201cHe had a way, even as a kid, of making you feel incredibly important.\u201d",
      "\u201cI had been on the periphery of the most intense fame you can have, as well as a much smaller version myself,\u201d adds Hanks. \u201cIt is an adjustment. It is hard to navigate. Not that it\u2019s not amazing and great, but that idea of how much you can actually give of yourself to people.\u201d",
      "Reynolds, born and raised in Vancouver, has been a fan of Candy\u2019s since growing up watching \u201cSCTV\u201d reruns. His fondness for Candy, in many ways, has been an influence throughout his career.",
      "\u201cI feel like in the bigger movies I\u2019m always either Del Griffith or Neil Page, from \u201cPlanes, Trains,\u201d says Reynolds. \u201cI tend to really fluctuate back and forth between those guys.\u201d",
      "As his own fame grew, alongside with his ability to take some authorship of his films, Reynolds has populated his movies with references to Candy. Easter eggs adorn the \u201cDeadpool\u201d films. In one moment, he utters the \u201cI like me,\u201d albeit in a much different context. Reynolds had the prop department make a mug with the same quote. A Chrysler LeBaron appears in the background of another scene. He even licensed the book \u201cThe Canadian Mounted: A Trivia Guide to Planes, Trains\u201d so it could make a cameo in all the \u201cDeadpool\u201d movies.",
      "\u201cI like having him around,\u201d says Reynolds. \u201cI feel safer. I feel better. I also feel maybe just a skosh more honest.\u201d",
      "\u201cJohn was a good person when nobody was watching, and I think that\u2019s an increasingly scarce resource these days, in an age where everything is not only seen, it\u2019s perfection,\u201d Reynolds adds. \u201cIt\u2019s like an epidemic. All we see is perfection and curation. Nobody wants to try anything new because nobody\u2019s willing to suck at anything.\u201d",
      "For Jennifer and Chris, \u201cJohn Candy: I Like Me,\u201d awash in memories of their father,\u201d is a kind of time capsule that, like their dad's other movies and radio show recordings, will be long treasured.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m fortunate that I will always have this,\u201d says Chris. \u201cAnd I love it for that.\u201d",

      "SAO PAULO -- Taylor Swift is very likely not aware of it, but she's considered a good luck charm for the Brazilian soccer team hosting Friday's game between the Kansas City Chiefs and Los Angeles Chargers.",
      "The unlikely connection between the pop superstar \u2014 whose fianc\u00e9 is Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce \u2014 and one of the most popular clubs in soccer-mad Brazil lies in the release date of her albums dating to 2006. Corinthians has gone unbeaten in all but one game played right before each album release since then and all but one right after.",
      "It all started as a joke about five years ago, but it has developed into a superstition for local fans.",
      "Until last year, Corinthians won 13 matches and drew seven in such instances. Some were against bitter rival Palmeiras and Brazilian social media was flooded with memes and montages of Swift wearing black and white \u2014 Corinthians' colors.",
      "Many Corinthians fans could have tossed their expectations after their team lost both the match prior to the release of \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department\u201d and the one following. But the NFL game in Sao Paulo, which could draw Swift to NeoQuimica Arena, has kept the Swiftie vibe alive among many local supporters.",
      "\u201cI laughed at first, but there\u2019s more coincidences. Taylor\u2019s first contract was signed on Sept. 1, that\u2019s the same day Corinthians was founded in 1910,\u201d said Rebeca Gois, 32, a marketing writer who lives near the stadium and is a Swift fan. \u201cIt has become a thing. Whenever there\u2019s a new album, we have a double joy; new Taylor songs and Corinthians unbeaten before and after that.\u201d",
      "That long run has encouraged Corinthians fans to think of the singer as an honorary supporter. Some have worn Swift costumes during games.",
      "Gavioes da Fiel, a Corinthians-linked samba school that parades in Sao Paulo's Carnival, jokingly invited Swift to join them in the festivities in 2022.",
      "Swift was in Brazil in 2012 to promote her album \u201cRed\u201d and then in 2023 with six concerts in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo during the Eras Tour. She has yet to appear at Corinthians stadium.",
      "Nataly Nascimento, a hardcore Corinthians Swiftie, said the trend got a boost after Swift had all her three concerts in Sao Paulo at the Allianz Parque, the stadium of their archrival Palmeiras.",
      "\u201cPeople started to look for that connection to tease Palmeiras fans. And then Corinthians fans started finding those links,\u201d said Nascimento, a 25-year-old teacher who lives in Brazil's Northeast and won't attend. \u201cBut there's something bigger. In the same way that Corinthians fans are much more passionate about their club, Swifties feel that about Taylor. It is mystical.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Patrick Hemingway, the last surviving child of Ernest Hemingway who was inspired by his father to spend years in Africa and later oversaw numerous posthumous works by the Nobel laureate, died Tuesday at age 97.",
      "Hemingway, the second of the author's three sons, died at his home in Bozeman, Montana, his grandson, Patrick Hemingway Adams, confirmed in a statement.",
      "\u201cMy grandfather was the real thing: a larger than life paradox from the old world; a consummate dreamer saddled with a scientific brain. He spoke half a dozen languages and solved complicated mathematical problems for fun, but his heart truly belonged to the written and visual arts,\u201d Adams said.",
      "While brother Gregory Hemingway had a deeply troubled relationship with his famous parent, Patrick Hemingway spoke proudly of his background and welcomed the chance to bring up the family name or get behind a project he thought could sell or attract critical attention. In the 2022 book \u201cDear Papa: The Letters of Patrick and Ernest Hemingway,\u201d father and son share stories of hunting and fishing and express mutual affection, with the author telling Patrick that \u201cI would rather fish with you and shoot with you than anybody that I have ever known since I was a boy and this is not because we are related.\u201d",
      "As an executor of his father's estate, Patrick Hemingway approved reissues of such classics as \"A Farewell to Arms\" and \"A Moveable Feast,\" featuring revised texts and additional commentary from the author\u2019s son and others. The estate also unsettled Hemingway admirers by expanding beyond books and offering a line of products that included clothing, eyewear, rugs and \"Papa's Pilar Rum.\"",
      "Patrick's most ambitious undertaking was the editing of \"True at First Light,\" a fictionalized account of Ernest Hemingway's time in Africa in the mid-1950s that the author left unfinished at the time of his death. Patrick assembled the 1999 release from some 800 pages of manuscripts, cutting the length by more than half. \"True at First Light\" was highly anticipated, but ended up disappointing readers and critics, some of whom faulted Patrick for exploiting the family name.",
      "Asked by NPR if he read his father's work, Patrick replied: \"Pretty often, because I have a commercial interest. ... I have to read it in order to be competent in the marketing of it and the management of it.\"",
      "Hemingway managed a long life in a family haunted by suicide and mental illness: Ernest Hemingway's father, Clarence, killed himself in 1928, and the author did the same in 1961. Gregory Hemingway suffered from alcoholism and depression and died in a jail cell in 2001 after being arrested for indecent exposure. Patrick's half-niece, the actor and model Margaux Hemingway, died from an overdose of phenobarbital in 1996. (Jack Hemingway, the eldest son, died in 2000).",
      "Inheriting his father\u2019s round face and stocky build, Patrick Hemingway was born in Kansas City, Missouri, to Ernest Hemingway and the second of his four wives, Pauline Pfeiffer. Because the author rarely stayed in one place for an extended time, the Hemingways lived everywhere from Cuba and Spain to Wyoming and Key West, Florida during Patrick\u2019s childhood (Ernest and Pauline divorced in 1940). Patrick Hemingway would recall his father\u2019s various \u201ctrophy mounts\u201d of animals hunted down on safari and how they were \u201ctastefully distributed throughout every room\u201d of their Key West house, including a wildebeest that hung in the bedroom of Patrick and Gregory.",

      "VENICE, Italy -- VENICE, Italy (AP) \u2014 Kim Novak was worried she\u2019d made a mistake. The 92-year-old star of Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s \u201cVertigo\u201d had made the long trek from Oregon to Venice, Italy, for the film festival. There she\u2019d be receiving a lifetime achievement award and supporting the world premiere of a documentary about her life and career, \u201cKim Novak\u2019s Vertigo.\u201d",
      "But on that first day, she wasn\u2019t feeling strong or up to the task.",
      "\u201cI thought I could handle it, then I thought, no I can\u2019t, I\u2019m not physically strong enough,\u201d Novak told The Associated Press this week. \u201cThen I heard my mother\u2019s voice from heaven and she said \u2018just have fun and enjoy it.\u2019\u201d",
      "Novak listened to that voice and was glad she did. Being bipolar, she said, she\u2019s used to going through a lot of emotions. But the experience in Venice has been a dream.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the very first events that I\u2019ve really had fun, really fun,\u201d she said.",
      "Earlier in the week, she was presented with a Golden Lion lifetime achievement award. Filmmaker Guillermo del Toro, who presented the honor, listed off many of her most famous credits, including \u201cVertigo,\u201d Otto Preminger\u2019s \u201cThe Man with the Golden Arm,\u201d Joshua Logan\u2019s \u201cPicnic,\u201d \u201cPal Joey\u201d and \u201cBell, Book and Candle.\u201d Novak was the top box-office star in the world from 1958 through 1960 and became the first woman to start her own production company before leaving Hollywood behind in 1966 to live a private life devoted to painting.",
      "\u201cMost impressive is the fact that she was capable of projecting frailty, power, mystery. To appear, endearing, dynamic, mythical and phenomenal,\u201d del Toro said. \u201cAnd with all those wonderful arresting performances, she always carried a little bit of warmth, a little bit of heartbreak and a little bit of mystery.\u201d",
      "Novak reflects on her extraordinary life in Alexandre O. Philippe\u2019s documentary, which premiered out of competition in Venice. She said it was fate that Philippe came into her life and wanted to make the film.",
      "\u201cI was at the point where I wanted to talk about my life, because I\u2019m at the end of my life,\u201d Novak said. \u201cIt was meant to be. And I can\u2019t think of anyone it was better to do it with.\u201d",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t even know my phone had voice memos,\u201d she laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s not always easy for me to open up and discuss the intimate things, but it was wonderful because it was like I was talking to myself. Once you open the door, it all comes flooding out.\u201d",
      "Coming to the festival was brave of Novak, Philippe said. Just over a decade ago, Novak stepped back in the public eye to present at the 2014 Oscars, which led many online, including Donald Trump, to insult her appearance.",
      "\u201cThe easy thing would have been to stay in Oregon and keep painting,\u201d he said. \u201cAt this point in her life the hard thing is to come back into the spotlight and show herself again. But she did the hard thing. And she came on stage, not as an icon, not as a movie star, but she came on stage and said \u2018I am you and you are me.\u2019\u201d",

      "It\u2019s Novak not as a golden age icon, but as a person that Philippe hopes audiences see and connect with in the film, which does not currently have a release date. For Novak, it\u2019s been an illuminating experience, revisiting her extraordinary life.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s time at the end of your life to put the puzzle pieces together and make them fit,\u201d Novak said. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible experience to see them all falling in place and somehow coming to this festival is like putting some of the other pieces that you couldn\u2019t put together that now come together and make a whole beautiful, beautiful, picture.\u201d",
      "Even the \u201cVertigo\u201d suit she once hated so much as taken on a different light. In the film, she gets to see the costume for the first time since making the film. The fabric that she remembered having been so rough and hard had softened with time, which seemed like an apt metaphor.",
      "\u201cThe opportunity to see it when you have all this life behind you, it makes you think that what you thought was right when you were young is not necessarily so. It could be wrong, and vice versa,\u201d she said. \u201cBut all this you gain over time. And so becoming old is a beautiful thing, you know? And this festival, being able to experience it through Hollywood eyes, it\u2019s just incredible. I loved it, I love it. I\u2019m experiencing great joy.\u201d",
      "The Venice tribute, she added, was like \u201cicing on the cake,\u201d she said. \u201cI like cake, but icing is the best.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat is sweeter in the world than appreciation,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel appreciated and you can\u2019t know how much that means.\u201d",
      "She\u2019s also looking forward to getting home and painting again. Every night at the festival she\u2019s found herself sketching and dreaming up ideas for more works.",
      "\u201cMy legacy is my art,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have my old movies, but you also have my new perspective on life. I do it all in my work and I want that to be my legacy. I want to get in a whole lot more paintings before I pass. So I can\u2019t wait to get back.\u201d",

      "A bill that would let Texas residents sue out-of-state abortion pill providers for up to $100,000 has been passed by lawmakers and sent to the governor",
      "Texas lawmakers on Wednesday approved letting private citizens sue abortion pill manufacturers, doctors and anyone who mails the medication, setting the state up to be the first to try to crack down on the most common abortion method.",
      "The law would be the first of its kind in the U.S. and add another layer of abortion restrictions in Texas, which has some of the toughest in the country and already bans nearly all abortions.",
      "The bill now goes to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, an abortion opponent who is expected to sign it into law. It would take effect in December, though it is nearly certain to spark legal challenges from abortion rights supporters.",
      "Supporters of the proposal, which passed a final vote in the GOP-controlled Texas Senate, call it a key tool to enforce the state's ban and protect women and fetuses. Opponents see it as not only another way to rein in abortion but intimidate providers outside Texas who are complying with the laws in their states. They also say it would encourage a form of vigilantism.",
      "Under the measure, Texas residents could sue those who manufacture, transport or provide abortion-inducing drugs to anyone in Texas for up to $100,000. Women who receive the pills for their own use would not be liable.",
      "Under the bill, providers could be ordered to pay $100,000. But only the pregnant woman, the man who impregnated her or other close relatives could collect the entire amount. Anyone else who sues could receive only $10,000, with the remaining $90,000 going to charity.",
      "Lawmakers also added language to address worries that women would be turned in for seeking to end pregnancies by men who raped them or abusive partners. For instance, a man who impregnated a woman through sexual assault would not be eligible.",
      "The measure has provisions that bar making public the identity or medical details about a woman who receives the pills.",
      "It wasn\u2019t until those provisions were added, along with the limit of a $10,000 payment for people who aren\u2019t themselves injured by the abortion, that several major Texas anti-abortion groups backed the bill.",
      "Texas Right to Life, one of the state\u2019s most prominent anti-abortion groups, called it the \u201cstrongest pro-life law\u201d in the country.",

      "The idea of using citizens rather than government officials to enforce abortion bans is not new in Texas. It was at the heart of 2021 law that curtailed abortion there months before the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for other state bans to take effect.",
      "In the earlier law, citizens could collect $10,000 for bringing a successful lawsuit against a provider or anyone who helps someone obtain an abortion. But that measure didn\u2019t explicitly seek to go after out-of-state providers.",

Carol Alvarado said before the bill cleared a final vote. \u201cIf California or New York tried to impose their gun laws or climate policies on Texas, this legislature would be outraged.\u201d",
      "Pills are a tricky topic for abortion opponents. They were the most common abortion method in the U.S. even before the 2022 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade and allowed states to enforce abortion bans.",
      "They\u2019ve become even more widely used since then. Their availability is a key reason that the number of abortions has risen nationally, even though Texas and 11 other states are enforcing bans on abortion in all stages of pregnancy.",
      "The pills have continued to flow partly because at least eight Democratic-led states have enacted laws that seek to protect medical providers from legal consequences when they use telehealth to prescribe the pills to women who are in states where abortion is illegal.",
      "Earlier this year a Texas judge ordered a New York doctor to pay more than $100,000 in penalties for providing abortion pills to a Dallas-area woman.",
      "The same provider, Dr. Maggie Carpenter, faces criminal charges from a Louisiana prosecutor for similar allegations.",
      "New York officials are invoking their states\u2019 shield laws to block extradition of Carpenter and to refuse to file the civil judgment.",
      "If higher courts side with Louisiana or Texas officials, it could damage the shield laws.",
      "Meanwhile the attorneys general of Texas and Florida are seeking to join Idaho, Kansas and Missouri in an effort to get courts to roll back U.S. Food and Drug Administration approvals for mifepristone, one of the drugs usually used in combination for medication abortions, contending that there are safety concerns. They say it needs tighter controls because of those concerns.",
      "If the states are successful, it\u2019s possible the drug could be distributed only in-person and not by telehealth.",
      "Major medical organizations including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists say the drug is safe.",

      "The nonprofit APOPO has worked in Morogoro, Tanzania, for more than two decades to train African giant pouched rats for lifesaving missions",
      "MOROGORO, Tanzania -- A man lies unmoving, slumped in the rubble of a simulated earthquake, as an unlikely rescuer approaches: a rat with a backpack. Whiskers waving, the rat breezes past garbage, toppled furniture and scattered clothes to find him and pull a trigger on its pack, alerting searchers above.",
      "Then a resounding click. A survivor has been found. The search in Morogoro in Tanzania\u2019s Uluguru Mountains is over and the rat scurries out of the abandoned building to be rewarded with a banana. A successful mission is complete for this African giant pouched rat being trained for search and rescue operations.",
      "\u201cTheir sense of smell is incredible,\u201d said Fabrizio Dell\u2019Anna, an animal behaviorist at APOPO, a Tanzania-based nongovernmental organization that trains the rats for lifesaving applications. \u201cThese rats are able to detect explosives, tuberculosis \u2014 even tiny amounts of the bacteria \u2014 and in this project, they are able to correctly identify and indicate humans.\u201d",
      "In a field nearby, more rats walk on leashes held between handlers, pacing a grid filled with land mines as part of an initiative by APOPO, which works alongside Sokoine University of Agriculture. When they pause, it indicates that explosives are beneath. These rats are readying for their next deployment, perhaps Angola or Cambodia, where APOPO has helped clear more than 50,000 land mines since 2014.",
      "From detecting land mines to sniffing out tuberculosis, these \u201chero rats\u201d have become unlikely, and sometimes unrecognized, front-line responders in Tanzania and beyond.",
      "For decades APOPO has trained these \u201chero rats,\u201d which have one of the most sensitive noses in the animal kingdom. Since 2003, the rats have been finding land mines and, more recently, have been turned on to trafficked wildlife and earthquake survivors.",
      "The rats begin training shortly after birth for specific missions and, with a longer-than-average rodent life span of almost a decade, can spend years carrying out their work. The cost of training each rat runs around 6,000 euros ($6,990).",
      "It is all done with classical conditioning and positive reinforcement, explained Dell\u2019Anna, who oversees the search and rescue program. The first cohort of this group of specialized rats are already in Turkey with a partner search and rescue organization.",
      "While the rats focused on explosives or survivors buried in rubble get all the glory, it is a group of rats inside a lab that are arguably the most impactful lifesavers. These are not typical lab rats, but rather, as their proponents would argue, one of the world\u2019s most effective detectors of tuberculosis.",
      "\u201cEvery day as many people die from TB as from land mines in a whole year,\u201d said Christophe Cox, the CEO of APOPO. \u201cIt\u2019s more spectacular to be on the minefield \u2026 but for TB \u2026 in terms of social impact, it\u2019s tremendous.\u201d",
      "Tuberculosis is an ancient respiratory disease that continues to run rampant despite centuries of research and treatment. The World Health Organization said last October in its most recent TB report that the disease had resurged as the top infectious disease killer, with 1.25 million deaths and a record 8.2 million infections in 2023.",
      "In sub-Saharan Africa, only about half of TB patients receive a diagnosis, according to a study by researchers in the UK and Gambia published in the National Library of Medicine, and this leaves them liable to spread the disease. Tanzania struggles with one of the highest global TB burdens, according to the WHO.",
      "APOPO expanded into TB detection in 2007 and its rats have been deployed in Tanzania, Ethiopia and Mozambique. The group works with 80 hospitals in Tanzania, collecting samples daily and bringing them to the lab rats.",
      "With their sensitive noses, the rats sniff out samples of sputum from patients, looking for positive TB cases that had been marked as negative. Research suggests the rats are picking up on six unique volatile organic compounds in positive TB samples, said Cox.",
      "False negatives remain a persistent issue in TB detection and suppression because each infected person can spread the disease to 10 to 15 more people each year.",
      "\u201cThe benefits of using rats are significant,\u201d said Felista Stanesloaus, a doctor at a TB clinic in Morogoro. \u201cThey help us detect cases that might otherwise be missed, which prevents people from unknowingly spreading infections.\u201d",

      "TB detection has made significant advances in recent years, including using artificial intelligence tools in conjunction with lung scans. However, many areas that are burdened most by TB, such as rural villages or low-income urban communities, do not have access to these tools.",
      "While the use of molecular detection devices, such as one called GeneXpert, have become more widespread, a clinic may only have one of these devices and it can take two hours to process a sample. Overburdened clinics turn to the centuries-old technique of microscopy, or investigation of sputum under a microscope, which is both fallible and time-consuming.",
      "\u201cHuman error may result in a person being told they are disease-free when they are not,\u201d said Stanesloaus. \u201cUsing rats is a very effective initiative.\u201d",
      "APOPO\u2019s rats can scan 100 samples in 20 minutes, and since the program's inception, the rats have been able to identify more than 30,000 patients who had been sent home with a clean bill of health but were actually carrying TB, said Cox. The NGO is able to do with one lab what 55 hospitals do in a day, he adds.",
      "Yet using live animals in the place of medical devices poses challenges, especially when it comes to scale. Samples have to be brought directly to a lab with enough trained rats to conduct the detection, with some samples brought to Morogoro by motorbike each day. Operations are most effective in dense urban centers, like Dar es Salaam, Cox said.",
      "The more existential challenge for these \u201chero rats\u201d comes from regulators and a wider health community who doubt this unconventional method of disease detection.",
      "APOPO\u2019s rats are not classified as primary diagnostic tools by the WHO. Instead, they are a second line of defense. Any positive samples detected by the rats must be confirmed with human microscopy in APOPO\u2019s labs before treatment can be administered.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big challenge,\u201d said Cox. \u201cNot being recognized by the WHO means that the mainstream funding for TB \u2026 never reaches us.\u201d",
      "Cox has given up on the prospect of getting approval from the WHO, though APOPO has faced pressure from donors to go through this process, which would be extensive and rigorous with no guarantee of success.",
      "Regulators may also challenge APOPO\u2019s method of focusing on finding every single positive case possible at the cost of more potential false positives.",
      "APOPO relies on the indication of just one rat to proceed with further investigation into a possible positive case, while higher specificity standards may need multiple rats to flag a sample.",
      "Cox defends this approach.",
      "\u201cOur choice was to go for that last patient out there \u2014 to go for the social impact,\u201d said Cox.",

      "Wearing a helmet and body armor, Mosiichuk approached the apartment building of those who had requested evacuation. Explosions rumbled at varying distances. He and his colleague worked quickly, knowing every minute in the city was life-threatening.",
      "The entrance was littered with shattered glass, and every floor had broken windows. Faded notices on the walls advertised electricians and plumbers who would never come.",
      "They climbed to the seventh floor. A few residents peeked out after hearing the commotion. Police shouted at them to leave as soon as possible, warning that it would soon be impossible to enter the city.",
      "When police came to evacuate 67-year-old Mykhailo Maistruk, it was the first time in two years he had set foot outside. With an amputated leg, he had been trapped in his apartment since the elevator stopped working and the city became too dangerous.",
      "Together with his wife, Larysa Naumenko, he packed what little they had. Naumenko had lived in the apartment since before the Soviet Union collapsed.",
      "They handed the keys to one of the two neighbors left in the building and left under the thunder of shelling.",
      "\u201cWe hoped \u2026 we lived here for 40 years. Do you think it\u2019s easy to leave all this behind? At our age, we are left with nothing,\u201d Naumenko said.",
      "Maistruk said even they could no longer endure the endless explosions and finally decided to leave. Many of their neighbors and friends had fled in the first months of the invasion; some later returned and left again. What kept them in place was not only Maistruk\u2019s disability but also their small pensions, which made it nearly impossible to start from scratch elsewhere.",
      "\u201cHardly anyone will come back here. It feels like the city is being wiped off the face of the earth,\u201d Naumenko said as she was driven away by the evacuation car. \u201cWho will rebuild all this? It was such a developed city, with so many factories. Now they are gone.\u201d",

      "India\u2019s clean energy appetite is helping the country\u2019s solar power industry wean itself off imported Chinese parts and continue growing even as it faces a tougher sell to its biggest foreign customer, the United States",
      "JAIPUR, India -- On the edge of Jaipur, an Indian city known for its colorful bazaars and palaces, a bustling industrial complex is the epicenter of the country's push to compete with China in making components for solar technology.",
      "India, the world's most populous nation, is jockeying for market share against the global leader in solar in part by selling to its own citizens, which helps the country with its other goal: meeting growing domestic demand for electricity.",
      "In the government-subsidized zone that provides tax breaks, solar manufacturer ReNew's sprawling factory makes enough modules to produce 4 gigawatts of power each year \u2014 equivalent to the energy needed for approximately 2.5 million Indian homes. The 2-year-old facility that employs nearly 1,000 people serves as a symbol of the solar industry\u2019s momentum. India\u2019s capacity to build key solar components more than doubled in the fiscal year ending in March.",
      "\u201cWhen I got this opportunity, I was really happy that I was directly contributing to the clean energy transition,\u201d said Monisha, an engineer at ReNew who goes by one name. She said the work has helped her become independent and assist her family with their finances.",
      "The country still faces a steep climb in its efforts to develop solar manufacturing that could one day rival China, which makes more than 80% of all solar components in the world and supplies key materials to Indian manufacturers.",
      "India's solar industry must also contend with a tougher sell to its biggest foreign customer, the United States. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs of 50% on Indian goods took effect last month, while Trump\u2019s administration and Republican lawmakers have taken other steps to hinder U.S. adoption of solar and other clean energy.",
      "Still, India's clean energy appetite is helping its solar manufacturers deal with the external pressures. Energy analysts said India's domestic demand for solar power will likely reduce disruption from tariffs imposed by the U.S., where about a third of the solar panels produced by India were sold in a recent fiscal year. Proceeds from selling in the lucrative U.S. market have helped Indian solar manufacturers update their supply chains in recent years so they were less dependent on imported Chinese parts and materials.",
      "While Indian solar manufacturers can sell at higher prices abroad, ambitious domestic clean energy targets and domestic demand will help them find buyers within India if sales in the U.S. slow, analysts said.",
      "\u201cThis is a huge industry that can absorb these modules and cells that are being produced. We are not necessarily as export dependent as other countries are,\u201d said Charith Konda, an energy analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.",
      "India's domestic solar market has already helped Hyderabad-based Vega Solar shift its customer base for off-grid solar modules for RVs, electric fences and other uses to customers in India in the years since the COVID-19 pandemic, said Vinay Keesara, a company director.",
      "\u201cBefore the pandemic, 90% of my business was exports and 10% used to be domestic supply, now this has just flipped the other way around,\u201d he said.",
      "One of the most carbon-polluting countries, India is making huge efforts to harness the power of the sun and other clean energy sources. The cost of solar power \u2014 now half that of new coal-powered plants \u2014 and India's many sunny days are reasons that experts said installed solar power increased 30 times in the last decade.",
      "Before the U.S. tariffs were announced, researchers with IEEFA and Gurugram, India-based JMK Research wrote that India's demand for solar modules during the next two years could exceed what its manufacturers are selling within the country because so many are being exported. India has also been importing solar modules from China.",
      "Konda said it was too early to determine how the U.S. tariffs will affect Indian solar manufacturers, but that the impact won\u2019t be felt for at least another year because solar component orders are placed well in advance. And uncertainty remains over the fate of all of Trump's tariffs. Despite a U.S. court ruling against Trump\u2019s tariffs, they remain in place until at least October while his administration files appeals.",
      "India has nearly 170 gigawatts of renewable energy projects in the pipeline \u2014 most of which are solar \u2014 and are expected to be completed in the next few years. The country also has an ambitious clean energy target of 500 gigawatts by 2030.",
      "Government policies restricting imports of solar components, incentives for solar manufacturers and mandates for solar power producers to purchase material from government-approved sources gave Indian companies the right signals to ramp up solar manufacturing, said Sanjay Verghese, ReNew\u2019s group president for solar manufacturing and solar projects.",

Government data showed India imported $1.3 billion worth of solar cells and modules from China in the first quarter of the year, down by more than one-third from the same period a year earlier. Cells are individual units that convert sunlight into energy, while modules are made up of multiple cells.",

    "story": [
      "Pope Leo XIV will preside over his first canonization ceremony Sunday to create the first millennial saint",
      "CHICAGO -- At a Catholic school in Pope Leo XIV\u2019s hometown, fifth graders read comic books about Carlo Acutis' life entitled \u201cDigital Disciple.\u201d They draw pictures of what the teenage Italian computer whiz might have had as his cellphone wallpaper. They discuss the miracles that allegedly occurred thanks to Acutis' intercession.",
      "In the run-up to Acutis' canonization Sunday, it is all Acutis, all the time at the Blessed Carlo Acutis Parish and school in Chicago. The parish was the first in the United States to take its name from Acutis, who died in 2006 at age 15 and is about to become history's first millennial saint.",
      "In recent years, Acutis has shot to near rockstar-like fame among many young Catholics, generating a global following the likes of which the Catholic Church hasn\u2019t seen in ages. Much of that popularity is thanks to a concerted campaign by the Vatican to give the next generation of faithful a relatable, modern-day role model, who used his technological talents to spread the faith.",
      "He\u2019s not a world figure like Mother Teresa or St. John Paul II, but rather a \u201csaint next door,\u201d said the Rev. Ed Howe, the pastor at Blessed Carlo Acutis Parish in Chicago\u2019s Northwest Side. \u201cHe\u2019s someone who I think a lot of young people today say, \u2018I could be the saint next door.'\"",
      "Leo, a Chicago native, will declare Acutis a saint Sunday in his first canonization ceremony, alongside another popular Italian, Pier Giorgio Frassati. Both ceremonies had been scheduled for earlier this year but were postponed following the death in April of Pope Francis.",
      "It was Francis who had fervently willed the Acutis sainthood case forward, convinced that the church needed someone like him to attract young Catholics to church while addressing the promises and perils of the digital age.",
      "Acutis was precociously savvy with computers before the social media era, reading college-level textbooks on programming and coding as a youngster. But he limited himself to an hour of video games a week, apparently deciding long before TikTok that human relationships were far more important than virtual ones.",
      "\u201cCarlo was well aware that the whole apparatus of communications, advertising and social networking can be used to lull us, to make us addicted to consumerism and buying the latest thing on the market,\u201d Francis wrote in a 2019 document. \u201cYet he knew how to use the new communications technology to transmit the Gospel, to communicate values and beauty.\u201d",
      "Leo inherited the Acutis cause, but he too has pointed to technology \u2014 especially artificial intelligence \u2014 as one of the main challenges facing humanity.",
      "For his admirers, Acutis was an ordinary kid who did extraordinary things, a typical Milan teen who went to school, played soccer and loved animals. But he also brought food to the poor, attended Mass daily and got his less-than-devout parents back to church.",
      "\u201cWhen I read his story for the first time, it was just like shocking to me because from a very early age he was just really drawn to Jesus Christ and he would go to Mass all the time,\u201d said Sona Harrison, an 8th grader at the St. John Berchmans\u2019 school, which is part of the Acutis parish. \u201cI feel like he\u2019s a lot more relatable and I definitely feel like I\u2019m closer to God when I read about him.\u201d",
      "Acutis earned the nickname \u201cGod\u2019s Influencer\u201d because he used technology to spread the faith. His most well-known tech legacy is the website he created about so-called Eucharistic miracles, available in nearly 20 different languages. The site compiles information about the 196 seemingly inexplicable events over the history of the church related to the Eucharist, which the faithful believe is the body of Christ.",
      "Acutis was known to spend hours in prayer before the Eucharist each day, a practice known as Eucharistic adoration.",
      "\u201cThis was the fixed appointment of his day,\u201d his mother, Antonia Salzano, said in a documentary that was airing Friday night at the U.S. seminary in Rome.",
      "Acutis was born on May 3, 1991, in London to Salzano and Andrea Acutis \u2014 a wealthy but not particularly observant Catholic family. They moved back to Milan soon after he was born and he enjoyed a typical, happy childhood, albeit marked by his increasingly intense religious devotion.",
      "In October 2006, at age 15, he fell ill with what was quickly diagnosed as acute leukemia. Within days he was dead. He was entombed in Assisi, which known for its association with another popular saint, St. Francis.",

Those who can\u2019t make it in person can watch the comings and goings on a webcam pointed at his tomb, a level of Internet accessibility not afforded to even popes buried in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica.",
      "Kathleen Sprows Cummings, a history professor at the University of Notre Dame, said Acutis\u2019 enormous popularity was clearly the result of a concerted church campaign, pushed strongly by his grief-stricken mother. But she said that is nothing new, and that in the 2,000-year history of the church, saints have very often been pushed ahead to respond to a particular need at a particular time.",

      "A new study says climate change has made extreme weather conditions, like those fueling wildfires in the Iberian Peninsula, 40 times more likely",
      "MADRID -- The extremely hot, dry and windy conditions, which fueled one of the IberianPeninsula's most destructive wildfire seasons in recorded history, were 40 times more likely due to climate change, according to a study released Thursday.",
      "The analysis by World Weather Attribution, or WWA, said the weather conditions were about 30% more intense compared to the preindustrial era, when heavy reliance on fossil fuels began.",
      "Hundreds of wildfires in the Iberian Peninsula broke out in July and August. They spread rapidly thanks to temperatures that pushed above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) and strong winds.",
      "The fires in Spain and Portugal killed eight people, forced more than 35,000 evacuations and scorched more than 640,000 hectares (1.58 million acres) or roughly two-thirds of Europe\u2019s total burned area this year.",
      "Most blazes are now under control, officials say, as temperatures have dropped considerably.",

      "WWA, a group of researchers that examines whether and to what extent extreme weather events are linked to climate change, focused on the conditions that allowed the Iberian wildfires to spread that fast, including during Spain's hottest ten-day period on record in August, according to the country's weather agency AEMET.",
      "Without climate change, similar ten-day spells of hot, dry and windy conditions would be rare, expected once every 500 years, they found.",

      "WWA's analysis wasn't a full attribution study. Those seek to determine the influence of climate change, driven primarily by the burning of fossil fuels, on a specific extreme weather event. This time, the researchers looked at weather observations without using climate models. But the results were consistent with existing research on wildfires in the region, the researchers said, and another study WWA recently published on this year's fires in Turkey, Greece and Cyprus, which found that climate change made fire-prone weather conditions there 10 times more likely.",
      "\u201cWhile fires are a characteristic of the Mediterranean climate, human-caused climate change increases the recurrence and severity of conditions favorable for intense fires, making fire control efforts much more challenging,\u201d Masson-Delmotte said.",
      "The researchers mentioned other factors that have contributed to the severity of the wildfires, including large population shifts that have taken place over decades in Spain and Portugal from the countryside to cities. The study said this has resulted in large areas of neglected overgrown farms and forests, which further fuel the fires.",
      "Removing vegetation using machinery, encouraging grazing by sheep, horses and goats and using other methods, such as controlled burns, would reduce the risk during wildfire seasons, researchers said.",
      "\u201cFrom a human perspective, most of these rural areas have suffered massive abandonment since the 1970s, which has allowed fine fuels to accumulate to dangerous levels, a problem worsened by inadequate forestry management,\u201d said Ricardo Trigo, a professor at the University of Lisbon's geophysics, geographical engineering and energy department.",

      "MASAFI, United Arab Emirates -- Outside of a mountain village in the northern outskirts of the United Arab Emirates, clouds on a recent weekend suddenly crowded out the white-hot sun that bakes this desert nation in the summer months. Fierce winds blew over planters and pushed a dumpster down the street. And then came the most infrequent visitor of all: rain.",
      "Rainfall long has fascinated the people of the Emirates. That includes both its white-thobed locals crowding into the deserts for any downpour and its vast population of foreign workers, many coming from homes in the Indian subcontinent who grew up with monsoon deluges.",

      "With some 4 million people now estimated to be living in Dubai alone compared to around 255,000 in 1980, pressure on water consumption continues. Meanwhile, as weather patterns change with global warming, the country saw the heaviest recorded rainfall ever last year that disrupted worldwide travel and now has its leaders reconsidering how to build as residents nervously look to the skies.",
      "\u201cOut here, rain is almost like a firework event,\u201d said Howard Townsend, an unofficial weather forecaster in Dubai with a Facebook following. \u201cIt\u2019s too hot to go outside. When you get a rain event, it\u2019s like a blessing, a release.\u201d",
      "The UAE, home to an estimated 10 million people in total, sits along both the Persian Gulf to its north and west and the Gulf of Oman to the east. The stone Hajar Mountains separate it from neighboring Oman. Along the southern borders of the peninsula, monsoon rains can hit seaside areas of Oman and Yemen. But the vast desert stretch of the peninsula, known as the Empty Quarter, has a weather pattern that keeps the clouds out.",
      "That means little to no rain, sometimes for years at a time in some areas. For the Emirates, that has meant relying heavily on some 70 water desalination plants to supply drinking water, as well as drip irrigation for plants that can rely on recycled wastewater. Dams have also been built in recent years to catch and store water runoff.",
      "Even then, the UAE ranks seventh worldwide for being at risk for water scarcity, according to the World Resources Institute. Groundwater reservoirs have been known to be under pressure for years. The UAE also has been \u201ccloud seeding\u201d for years, flying aircraft to release chemicals into clouds to try to induce rains.",
      "\u201cWater is more important than oil,\u201d Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the leader of the UAE and ruler of Abu Dhabi, reportedly said back in 2011.",
      "That's particularly true in Dubai, where its booming population strains its roadways. The government-owned utility, the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority, reported producing 683.7 billion liters (180.6 billion gallons) of water last year alone through desalination, with water demand continuing to grow alongside the city-state.",
      "Yet Emirati government statistics suggest residents use around 550 liters (145 gallons) of water per day, which is among some of the highest usage around the world.",
      "But for all the fascination with rain, there's fear now as well for many after the April 2024 floods that swept across Dubai. In one day, more rain fell than ever recorded since 1949, when the officials in what became the UAE first began taking statistics.",
      "More than 142 millimeters (5.59 inches) of rainfall had soaked Dubai over 24 hours. An average year sees 94.7 millimeters (3.73 inches) of rain at Dubai International Airport, the world's busiest for international travel.",

      "In a good year, his land could produce as much as 800 to 900 kilograms (1,764 to 1,984 pounds) of wheat per dunam, an area equal to 0.1 hectares and 0.25 acres. This year, it yielded about a quarter that much, he said. He hired only six or seven workers this harvest season instead of last year\u2019s 15.",
      "Because the drought followed a prolonged war, farmers who were already financially stretched have had little ability to cope with its effects, said Jalal Al Hamoud, national food security officer for the U.N.\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization in Syria.",
      "Before the uprising-turned-civil war that began in 2011, Syrian farmers produced an average of 3.5 million to 4.5 million tons of wheat per year, which was enough to meet the country\u2019s domestic needs, according to Saeed Ibrahim, director of agricultural planning and economics in Syria\u2019s Agriculture Ministry.",
      "That annual yield dropped to 2.2 million to 2.6 million tons during the war, and in recent years, the government has had to import 60% to 70% of its wheat to feed its roughly 23 million people. This year's harvest is expected to yield only 1 million tons, forcing the country to spend even more of its strained resources on imports.",
      "Mudar Dayoub, a spokesperson for Syria's Ministry of Internal Trade and Consumer Protection, said this year\u2019s wheat crop will only last for two or three months and that the government is \"currently relying on signing contracts to import wheat from abroad\u201d and on donations, including from neighboring Iraq.",
      "But in a country where the World Food Program estimates that half the population is food-insecure, Ibrahim warned that \u201ctotal reliance on imports and aid threatens food security\u201d and is \u201cunsustainable.\u201d",
      "The drought isn't the only major issue facing Syria, where postwar reconstruction is projected to cost hundreds of billions of dollars. Since Assad fled, the country has been rattled by outbreaks of sectarian violence, and there's growing doubt about whether the new authorities will be able to hold it together. Without jobs or stability, millions of refugees who fled during the war are unlikely to come home.",
      "A dam on the Litani River in neighboring Lebanon's fertile Bekaa Valley forms Lake Qaraoun, a reservoir that spans about 12 square kilometers (4.6 square miles).",
      "Over the years, climate change has led to a gradual decline in the water flowing into the reservoir, said Sami Alawieh, head of the Litani River National Authority.",
      "This summer, after an unusually dry winter left Lebanon without the water reserves its usually banks through snow and rainfall, it has shrunk to the size of a pond, surrounded by a vast expanse of parched land.",
      "Although an average of 350 million cubic meters (12.4 billion cubic feet) of water flows into the lake during the rainy season each year, meeting about one-third of Lebanon's annual demand, this year the incoming water didn't exceed 45 million cubic meters (1.6 billion cubic feet), he said.",
      "Lebanon\u2019s water woes have further exacerbated the drought in Syria, which partially relies on rivers flowing in from its western neighbor.",

      "\u201cThere is no compensation for the loss of crops,\" Haj Salah said. \"And you know the farmers make just enough to get by.\"",
      "Mostafa Summaq, director of water resources in Idlib province, said the groundwater dropped by more than 10 meters (33 feet) in three months in some monitoring wells, which he attributed to farmers overpumping due to a lack of rain. Local officials are considering installing metered irrigation systems, but it would be too expensive to do without assistance, he said.",
      "Most experts agree that Syria and the broader region appear headed toward worse climate shocks, which they aren't prepared to absorb.",
      "Climate change makes some regions wetter and others drier, and the Middle East and Mediterranean are among those that are drying out, said Matti Kummu, a professor at Aalto University in Finland who specializes in global food and water issues. Syria, specifically, has shown a trend of reduced rainfall over the past 40 years, while it has been using water at an unsustainable rate.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not enough water from rainfall or from snowmelt in the mountains to recharge the groundwater,\u201d Kummu said. Due to increasing irrigation needs, he said, \"the groundwater table is going lower and lower, which means that it\u2019s less accessible and requires more energy (to pump).\" At some point, the groundwater might run out.",
      "Even with limited means, the country could take measures to mitigate the impacts, such as increased rainwater harvesting, switching to more drought-tolerant crops and trying to put more effective irrigation systems in place, even simple ones.",

      "If you have trouble finding dates, spare a thought for Ned, a perfectly nice snail with dire romantic prospects",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Ned is a perfectly nice snail. If he had a dating profile, it might read: good listener, stable home, likes broccoli, seeks love.",
      "But he\u2019s already exhausted his local options and it\u2019s not because he\u2019s picky or unappealing. Instead, he\u2019s a common garden snail with an uncommon anatomical problem that\u2019s ruining his love life.",
      "Ned\u2019s shell coils to the left, not the right, making him the 1 in 40,000 snails whose sex organs don\u2019t line up with those of the rest of their species. Unless another lefty snail is found, the young gastropod faces a lifetime of unintentional celibacy.",
      "That dire prospect prompted a New Zealand nature lover who found the snail in her garden in August to launch a campaign to find his perfect match. But Ned\u2019s quest for true love, perhaps predictably, is slow.",
      "Giselle Clarkson was weeding her home vegetable patch in Wairarapa on the North Island when a snail tumbling out of the leafy greens caught her eye. Clarkson, the author and illustrator of a nature book, \u201cThe Observologist,\u201d has an affection for snails and had long been on the lookout for a sinistral, or left-coiled shell.",
      "\u201cI knew immediately that I couldn\u2019t just toss the snail back into the weeds with the others,\u201d she said. Instead, she sent a photo of the snail, pictured alongside a right-coiled gastropod as proof, to her colleagues at New Zealand Geographic.",
      "The magazine launched a nationwide campaign to find a mate for Ned, named for the left-handed character Ned Flanders in \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d who once opened a store called The Leftorium. That explains the male pronouns some use for Ned, although snails are hermaphrodites with sex organs on their necks and the capacity for both eggs and sperm.",
      "\u201cWhen you have a right-coiling snail and a left-coiling snail, they can\u2019t slide up and get their pieces meeting in the right position,\u201d Clarkson said. \u201cSo a lefty can only mate with another lefty.\u201d",
      "The fact that romantic hopefuls need not be a sex match should have boosted Ned\u2019s prospects. But his inbox has remained empty except for photos of \u201coptimistically misidentified right-coiling snails,\" Clarkson said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had lots of enthusiasm and encouragement for Ned, a lot of people who can relate and really want the best for them, as a symbol of hope for everyone who\u2019s looking for love,\u201d she said. \u201cBut as yet, no lefties have been forthcoming.\u201d",
      "Ned\u2019s relatable romantic woes have attracted global news coverage, but New Zealand\u2019s strict biosecurity controls mean long-distance love probably isn\u2019t on the cards. Other left-coiled snails have gotten lucky through public campaigns to find mates before, however, so Clarkson remains optimistic.",

      "It was a fascinating chance for scientists to investigate what produces left-coiled snails, with the cause most likely a rare genetic mutation. Studies of snail farms in Europe prompted researchers to estimate about 1 in every 40,000 snails is a lefty.",

      "MAEBASHI, Japan -- Kokichi Akuzawa almost gave up during his trek to became the oldest person to summit Mount Fuji at age 102, an achievement recognized by Guinness World Records after he reached the top in early August.",
      "\u201cI was really tempted to give up halfway through,\u201d Akuzawa told The Associated Press in a recent interview. \u201cReaching the summit was tough, but my friends encouraged me, and it turned out well. I managed to get through it because so many people supported me.\u201d",
      "Akuzawa climbed with his 70-year-old daughter Motoe, his granddaughter, her husband and four friends from a local mountain climbing club.",
      "The climbing party camped for two nights on the trail before their Aug. 5 ascent to the top of Japan\u2019s tallest mountain, which peaks at 3,776 meters (12,388 feet).",
      "\u201cI\u2019m impressed I climbed so well,\u201d he said, communicating with the help of his 75-year-old daughter Yukiko, who repeated questions into her father\u2019s ear because he is hard of hearing. Akuzawa added that he doesn\u2019t take any mountain for granted at his age. \u201cIt\u2019s better to climb while you still can.\u201d",
      "The trip was not Akuzawa\u2019s first record-breaking ascent up Mount Fuji. He was 96 the first time he became the oldest person to scale the country's most famous mountain. In the six years since, he overcame heart issues, shingles and stitches from a climbing fall.",
      "Akuzawa spent three months training before the Fuji climb, waking at 5 a.m. for hour-long walks and tackling roughly one mountain each week, mostly around Nagano prefecture to the west of Gunma in central Japan.",
      "Surrounded by relatives and framed paintings of mountains in his home in Maebashi, about 241 kilometers (150 miles) northwest of Tokyo, Akuzawa recalls what first drew him to the mountains 88 years ago. While the magic of reaching the summit is undeniable, it was the people who kept him coming back.",
      "\u201cI climb because I like it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to make friends on the mountain.\u201d",
      "Akuzawa was a capable student and worked as an engine design engineer and later as a livestock artificial inseminator, a profession he held until age 85, his family said.",
      "\u201cWhether you liked studying or not, you could enjoy the mountain just the same,\u201d he said. \u201cIntelligence didn\u2019t matter up there. We were all on equal footing and moved forward together.\u201d",

I didn\u2019t have pain, but I kept wondering why I was so slow, why I had no stamina. I\u2019d long since passed my physical limit, and it was only thanks to everyone else\u2019s strength that I made it.\u201d",

      "MAR DEL PLATA, Argentina -- Prosecutors in Argentina on Thursday charged the daughter of a fugitive Nazi official with trying to hide an 18th-century painting from authorities following revelations that it had been stolen from a Jewish art dealer during World War II.",
      "The federal prosecutor in charge of the case announced the cover-up charge a day after Patricia Kadgien, one of the daughters of high-level Nazi officer Friedrich Kadgien, handed \u201cPortrait of a Lady\u201d by Italian artist Giuseppe Ghislandi to the Argentine judiciary eight decades after it was stolen.",
      "The fate of the work remains unclear, pending a decision in the case. The heir of Jacques Goudstikker \u2014 the Dutch-Jewish art collector who owned the painting before Nazis confiscated his world-famous inventory \u2014 has made a legal claim to get the painting back, her lawyers have said.",
      "Goudstikker died in a shipwreck in 1940 while fleeing the Netherlands as German troops advanced. He sold his collection, which included Rembrandts and Vermeers, under duress and far below market price. At least 1,100 stolen works from his gallery remain missing.",
      "The Argentine court has asked that the painting be displayed at the Holocaust Museum in Buenos Aires ahead of any further transfer abroad. The museum did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Patricia Kadgien, 59, and her husband, Juan Carlos Cortegoso, 62, have been under house arrest on suspicion of concealing the painting since police raided their home on Monday for the second time in as many weeks without finding \u201cPortrait of a Lady.\u201d",
      "Kadgien, with disheveled dirty-blond hair and sunglasses on her head, wore a look that mixed concern and puzzlement as she listened to Prosecutor Carlos Mart\u00ednez in a jam-packed courtroom. Mart\u00ednez said that Kadgien's and her husband's efforts to hide the painting over several days following its sudden appearance in a real estate listing amounted to obstruction of justice.",
      "Cortegoso gazed straight ahead, his arms crossed and a stern expression on his face.",
      "After the hearing the couple was released from house arrest but barred from traveling abroad and required to notify the court whenever they leave their registered address.",
      "Photos of the painting hanging in Kadgien\u2019s living room in Mar del Plata surfaced last month for the first time in eight decades in an online real estate advertisement.",
      "Dutch journalists investigating Kadgien\u2019s past in Argentina \u2013 where he took refuge after the collapse of the Third Reich \u2013 spotted \u201cPortrait of a Lady\u201d hanging above a green velvet couch in the living room during a 3D tour of the house for sale.",
      "After recognizing it as the same portrait listed as missing in international archives of Nazi-looted art, the newspaper Algemeen Dagblad published an expos\u00e9 on Aug. 25 that grabbed headlines around the world.",

      "But police couldn\u2019t find \u201cPortrait of a Lady.\u201d They found scuff marks and a pastoral tapestry on Patricia Kadgien's living room wall where the portrait had been photographed.",
      "The real estate ad, first posted in February, was swiftly taken down. Prosecutors on Thursday said that security footage showed people removing the \u201cfor sale\u201d sign from Kadgien\u2019s front yard as media scrutiny intensified last week.",
      "In presenting the charges, Mart\u00ednez told the court that the couple was \u201caware that the artwork was being sought by the criminal justice system and international authorities\u201d but nevertheless went to lengths to hide it.",
      "\u201cIt was only after several police raids that they turned it in,\" he said.",
      "With the defendants under house arrest on Monday, their lawyer, Carlos Murias, filed a petition with a civil court in Mar del Plata asking that Kadgien be allowed to auction the painting.",
      "The court rejected the request, arguing that it lacked jurisdiction given the painting's provenance.",
      "Prosecutor Mart\u00ednez told reporters on Thursday that his office was informed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation that Marei von Saher, the heir to art dealer Goudstikker, lodged a legal claim to \u201cPortrait of a Lady\u201d at the bureau\u2019s New York office.",

      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum's strategy of managing a tumultuous relationship with President Donald Trump may be running up against wider regional tensions and a lack of willingness by the Trump administration to make concessions",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum' s strategy of managing a tumultuous relationship with President Donald Trump may be running up against wider regional tensions and lack of willingness by the Trump administration to make concessions, experts say.",
      "Since Trump took office, the freshly elected Mexican president has been lauded, and even dubbed a sort of \u201cTrump whisperer,\u201d for being able to offset the brunt of U.S. tariffs that have dealt a blow to other foreign economies. Sheinbaum has done so by cracking down on cartels with a heavier hand than her predecessor, delivering dozens of cartel affiliates to American authorities and pointing to lower fentanyl seizures at the U.S. border.",
      "It was an exchange she said Thursday that she hoped to formalize. When the two leaders spoke in February, Trump tied the fentanyl coming from Mexico to the tariff threat, she said.",
      "\u201cSo what do we propose?\u201d Sheinbaum said at her morning press conference Thursday. \u201cIf this problems reduces, then we evidently want to see that 25% (tariff) shrink.\u201d",
      "But now, observers say Sheinbaum is increasingly backed against a wall. Michael Shifter, senior fellow at the Inter-American Dialogue, said Sheinbaum is now having to walk \u201ca fine line\u201d with Trump that appears to only be getting more complicated.",
      "\"There\u2019s a sort of uncertainty that hangs over the relationship,\u201d Shifter said. \u201cSheinbaum likely feels incredibly frustrated because she has taken major steps toward dealing with the cartels. And it never seems to be enough to satisfy Trump.\u201d",
      "Just a day before, Sheinbaum met with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio during his visit to Mexico, in which the leaders discussed security issues and agreed to continue working together to combat crime.",
      "For weeks, Sheinbaum had been gunning to sign a formal security agreement with the U.S. underscoring the importance of respecting Mexican sovereignty, with the hope of setting clear rules amid Trump's volatile foreign policy tactics.",
      "The push for the security deal came as Sheinbaum has repeatedly and publicly rejected offers by the Trump administration to send U.S. troops to fight cartels. Her meeting with Rubio came just after the Trump administration carried out a strike in the southern Caribbean, killing 11 people it claimed were trafficking drugs to the U.S., something Rubio said was meant as a warning.",
      "\u201cI think the idea behind having an agreement is creating and building parameters,\u201d said Carin Zissis, Washington interim director of the Council of the Americas. \u201cYou can see why Claudia Sheinbaum would be emphasizing sovereignty when on the way to visiting Mexico, Secretary Rubio was highlighting a U.S. military attack on an alleged vessel in the Caribbean.\"",
      "\u201cU.S. boots on the ground, that\u2019s a very concrete concern from the Mexican side,\u201d she said.",
      "But by Wednesday's meeting, it was clear the two governments were not going to sign a formal agreement. Instead, they announced a high-level group of Mexican and U.S. officials who would monitor their cooperation. It was unclear how much of a change that would actually make, given the fact that Mexican officials have been meeting regularly with the Trump administration since January.",
      "\u201cThat seems like a fancy term that means nothing, but it means a lot,\u201d Rubio said of the newly established joint group.",

      "Just last month, Trump glibly told press that \u201cMexico does what we tell them to do\u201d and last week said that while he liked Sheinbaum, he believed that Mexico was still run by cartels.",
      "\u201cThere aren't really any incentives for Trump,\u201d Tapia said. \u201cBecause his winning strategy has been to get what he wants with the threat of tariffs.\u201d",
      "It's left Sheinbaum with few alternatives at a time when tensions have peaked in Latin America due to the U.S. strike in the Caribbean.",
      "The move ruffled the feathers of a number of leaders across Latin America, who still grapple with the complicated legacy and violent fallout of past American intervention in the region. Following the meeting with Rubio, Mexico's government once again reminded the Trump administration of the importance of operating in the region \"without subordination\u201d and respecting allies.",
      "However, Zissis and other observers said that while the Trump administration has showed little willingness to cede ground, Sheinbaum does have a few cards up her sleeve.",
      "One, long used by Mexico's government, has been helping the U.S. in block migratory flows north. The other is Sheinbaum's soaring level of popularity in Mexico, where polls show she boasts anywhere between 70% to 80% approval.",
      "At the same time, they said Sheinbaum has little room to radically shift her strategy toward Trump.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very delicate balance, because at the same time that she\u2019s handled this relationship so well, so much is at stake for Mexico,\u201d Zissis said.",

      "Paul Colford, an inexhaustibly curious journalist and author who covered the media business for decades before becoming The Associated Press\u2019 chief spokesperson, has died",
      "NEW YORK -- Paul Colford, an inexhaustibly curious journalist and author who covered the media business for decades before seeing it from another vantage point as The Associated Press' chief spokesperson, has died. He was 71.",
      "Colford, who retired from the AP in 2017, died Aug. 26 after a fall the previous month turned a long struggle with Parkinson's disease into a rapid decline, said his wife, Anne LaBate. Despite his health problems, he was working even in recent months on his third book, about a notorious figure from his hometown of Jersey City, New Jersey.",
      "During a decade as AP's director and ultimately vice president of media relations, Colford was known for his sage, unflappable handling of the news cooperative's dealings with other media outlets, from requests for interviews with its journalists to inquiries about its practices.",
      "\u201cPaul was both graceful and tough and believed completely in the AP\u2019s journalists and their mission. That was important during some pretty tough moments, particularly when an AP journalist was hurt or worse,\" said Kathleen Carroll, who was the news service's executive editor from 2002 to 2016. She recalled Colford as \u201ca talented and classy colleague\u201d who loved journalism.",
      "Colford knew the media ecosystem from the inside out and the outside in, having been a media reporter and columnist for the Daily News of New York, Newsday and the former New York Newsday. He covered magazines, book publishing, newspapers' digital evolution and the new media of the dot-com era. Reporting on the radio landscape as conservative talk rose to prominence, Colford penned unauthorized biographies of Rush Limbaugh and shock jock Howard Stern.",
      "\u201cHe just was indefatigable,\u201d said longtime Newsday TV writer and critic Verne Gay, a colleague and friend of Colford's. \u201cHe vacuumed everything up. He knew everything and everybody. And he constantly broke stories on the beat.... I was just in awe of him.\"",
      "Born Sept. 24, 1953, in Jersey City, Colford grew up there with seven siblings and graduated in 1975 from St. Peter's University. He spent part of his college years studying in Turin, Italy, and still spoke Italian in phone calls with friends from that time, his wife said.",
      "His early jobs included a stint at The Courier News of central New Jersey, where the couple met and dated for a time in the 1970s. He took her to the first Shakespeare in the Park production she ever attended, she recalled.",
      "The relationship fizzled, Colford went on to New York Newsday and later the Daily News, and he married the late Jane Colford and had two children, Catherine and Liam. He and LaBate still had ties through friends and family, and they got back together after he was widowed.",
      "\u201cWe certainly both had lived whole lives\u201d in the meantime, she said, but \u201cit was probably even a clearer connection.\u201d They married in 2022.",
      "Colford's professional life also had evolved. He took the AP's media relations job in 2007.",

      "\u201cTo him, it was a natural extension of everything he'd ever done, which was: collect the facts, make sure that everything is accurate, make sure people get information in a timely manner,\u201d Gay said. \u201cIt was about getting information to people who needed it.\u201d",
      "The job, in a 24/7 global news operation, is not easy. Tom Kent, who was AP's standards editor during much of Colford's tenure, recalled him as invaluable in responding to public controversies that erupted at times over its reports.",
      "As editors debated, readers and viewers complained and other news outlets called for comment, Colford kept his cool and gave smart guidance about how best to react, said Kent, now a consultant. He said editors and executives ended up taking Colford's advice, which came with \u201ca journalistic sensitivity and ethical integrity that won the confidence and respect of journalists and editors across the AP.\u201d",
      "Lauren Easton, whom Colford hired in a junior role, is now an AP vice president overseeing global communications. She said he was \u201ca fierce defender of The Associated Press, always stepping up to advocate for press freedom, access and the importance of factual, nonpartisan journalism.\u201d",
      "Colford was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease while still at AP and kept working for a while before deciding to retire, his wife and friends said.",
      "In retirement, he was delighted that the Briscoe Center for American History, housed at the University of Texas at Austin, acquired his trove of audiotapes, videos, photos, newspaper clippings and other materials from his journalism career. And he worked on his book, amassing a new batch of news clippings and other research in his home office in Trenton, N.J., said Gay, who visited him in June.",

      "The trend of ditching traditional office space to work from living rooms and hotels accelerated when the coronavirus hit in 2020",
      "NEW YORK -- When Kate Smith worked a 9-to-5 office job, she was burned-out, suffering from daily migraines and thinking, \u201cI can't do this for the rest of my life.\u201d",
      "She didn't have to. For her next role, Smith landed a remote, full-time marketing job that enabled her to travel the world.",
      "Her laptop lifestyle took her to Bali, where she lived and worked for a year-and-a-half. \u201cEvery day, I was riding my scooter through the rice fields and thinking, \u2018I love my life, this is amazing,'\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that feeling never fades. ... I feel so grateful for the freedom and flexibility.\u201d",
      "While Smith, 36, has worked remotely for more than a decade, the trend of ditching traditional office spaces to work from living rooms or beachfront shacks accelerated in 2020, when the coronavirus hit and workers who could began performing their jobs from home.",
      "Many people grew accustomed to the lifestyle change once they tasted the freedom and flexibility a home office afforded. Working parents enjoyed meeting children at the school bus. Others found more time for exercise, socializing and basking in nature once their jobs did not include long commutes.",
      "But after the pandemic subsided, many large companies began calling employees back into the office, creating fierce competition for jobs that could be done from anywhere. Many positions advertised as remote attract hundreds, if not more than a thousand, of applications, experts said.",
      "\u201cFully remote is very rare now in the U.S.,\u201d said Mark Ma, associate professor of business administration at the University of Pittsburgh. \u201cIt is getting much more difficult and you need to look for the smaller firms or medium-sized firms ... and those firms do not provide as competitive financial packages as the big firms, but they try to attract talent by providing more flexibility.\u201d",
      "About 9% of paid U.S. job postings on social networking platform LinkedIn in July offered remote work, while those types of roles attracted 37% of applications, according to the company.",
      "Below, employers and people who haven't returned to an office offer advice on how to land remote jobs in a competitive climate.",
      "The biggest concern for an employer hiring remote workers is ensuring they will do their work, said Carla Rover, co-founder of Strategy and Content, a startup that leverages artificial intelligence.",

This is how much I\u2019ve built in a period of time,\u2019\u201d said Rover, who mostly has worked remotely since 2010. Assembling a strong portfolio showcases what you can do while working outside an office, Rover advised.",
      "\u201cTime management and independence, being self-motivated, are really critical,\u201d said Toni Frana, career expert at FlexJobs, a platform dedicated to helping people find remote or flexible work.",
      "If you've worked remotely before, highlight that on your resume. List communication tools you've used, such as Slack or Microsoft Teams, said Dawn Fay, operational president at staffing firm Robert Half International. \u201cCall out that you have worked remotely, independently, for X amount of time successfully,\" Fay added. \"You really want to stress that.\u201d",
      "After moving on from the office job that made her miserable, Smith created a side hustle coaching other professionals who longed for a nomadic lifestyle. Her coaching eventually grew into a full-time job.",
      "When looking to transition into remote work, find a job that's similar to your current role instead of competing with better-qualified candidates for jobs that require more experience, she advised. \u201cGet your foot in the door ... and then from there work your way to the long-term goal,\u201d Smith said.",
      "You can also try to convert your current job into a remote role. That's what Courtney Sandifer attempted after her husband, 60, had a heart attack and underwent cancer treatment within the same year. He retired early and they bought a small property in Mexico near the beach, hoping to reduce stress. \u201cWe just got tired of the rat race,\u201d Sandifer said.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News seemed to be dealt a crippling blow in a $787 million settlement of a libel lawsuit more than two years ago, but has instead thrived",
      "NEW YORK -- Twice recently, the people who run Fox News were reminded of their biggest nightmare.",
      "The conservative network Newsmax's $67 million settlement with Dominion Voting Systems over false claims after the 2020 election recalled Fox's own $787.5 million deal with the same company more than two years ago. New legal papers filed last month by a second company suing Fox, Smartmatic, also put an episode they would like to forget back in the news.",
      "Between the staggering payment to bypass a defamation trial and revelations about the lengths to which Fox went to avoid telling its audience what it didn't want to hear about Donald Trump's defeat, many wondered if its actions in November 2020 would damage Fox News or compel it to change directions.",
      "Not so much, it turns out.",
      "Fox News Channel has defied gravity with its ratings, and is more popular with viewers this summer than ABC, CBS or NBC. Its top personalities resolutely support Trump, who has filled his second administration with former Fox stars like Pete Hegseth and Jeanine Pirro. Time after time, the White House turns to Fox to make news; shortly after meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump was sitting with Sean Hannity.",
      "Reached by The Associated Press, Fox declined to make anyone available to speak for this story.",
      "An ethos many at Fox share with the president \u2014 no expressed regrets, no apologies \u2014 has also shown signs of spreading, given Newsmax's swagger following the Aug. 11 settlement announcement.",
      "Fox News averaged 2.63 million viewers in weekday prime-time for the second quarter of 2025, up 56% from the same period in 2023, the Nielsen company said. While the increase is somewhat inflated since Fox took a hit in the ratings two years ago following the firing of Tucker Carlson, the advance of cord-cutting means that any network gaining viewers now is unusual.",
      "MSNBC's prime-time audience of 1 million this spring was down 21% in two years, and CNN's viewership of 538,000 was down 6%, Nielsen said. Forty-five percent of people watching one of the top three cable news networks at any given time two years ago were tuned to Fox. This year, that audience share jumped to 62%.",
      "Clearly, Fox's audience is more interested in following a Trump administration than it was for a Joe Biden administration. Just as clearly, the Dominion case had little appreciable impact on viewership.",
      "\u201cFox's audience didn't really look at that verdict and say, \u2018Oh, I can\u2019t watch them anymore,'\u201d said Tim Graham, director of media analysis at the conservative Media Research Center. \u201cI think Fox's audience looked at that and said, \u2018oh, the left is coming after them.\u2019\u201d",
      "Financially, the Dominion settlement was stiff enough that Newsmax is spreading its payments out over three years. The much larger Fox had a greater ability to absorb its hit. Fox confirmed at the time that it could deduct the settlement from its income taxes, and insurance could make the payment lower. Meanwhile, Fox News is a profit engine and becoming even more so; Axios reported earlier this year that the company expected to make half a billion dollars on non-TV products like books, podcasts and streaming.",
      "Carlson was the face of the network before he was fired shortly after the settlement was announced, but Fox has always been able to generate new stars. Carlson took over from Bill O'Reilly when he was fired in 2017. Fox started \u201cThe Five,\u201d arguably its centerpiece show, when Glenn Beck was shown the door in 2011. Jesse Watters now owns Carlson and O'Reilly's old time slot.",
      "Yet, it's hard to understate the worry many at Fox had about losing audience immediately following the 2020 election. Trump, and many of his fans, were angry that the network declared Biden the winner in Arizona before most news outlets, a pivotal moment in the vote-counting.",
      "Internal messages and deposition interviews revealed in court papers tied to Smartmatic's lawsuit reveal much of that drama. Management criticized anchor Neil Cavuto for ordering his show to cut away from Trump press secretary Kayleigh McEnany when she began talking about election fraud. News reporters were disciplined for fact-checking some of Trump's claims. Many in Fox's audience expressed anger at hearing Trump corrected and wanted to hear conspiracy theories.",
      "Cavuto left Fox after 28 years last December. McEnany is now a co-host of Fox's midday show, \u201cOutnumbered.\u201d Trump's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, hosts a weekend show at Fox.",

      "Former Fox politics editor Chris Stirewalt, who was fired by Fox shortly after the network's correct call in Arizona, identified in a Smartmatic deposition a programming strategy that Fox excels at. \u201cThe best way to capture an audience is to make them afraid, make them fearful of something \u2014 to make them hate or resent other people to try to keep them with your telecast and that they're afraid to change the channel,\u201d he said.",
      "Fox has also maintained its dominance by playing a form of hardball that Newsmax alleged, in a lawsuit filed this week, violates antitrust laws. Newsmax said Fox has tried to block television distributors from carrying its rival, hired private detectives to investigate Newsmax executives and pressured guests not to appear on the network.",
      "In response, Fox said, \u201cNewsmax cannot sue their way out of their own competitive failures in the marketplace to chase headlines simply because they can't attract viewers.\u201d",

Fox, which would not make an executive available for this story, said fraud charges made by a president or his representatives were newsworthy, and the network is defending itself on free speech grounds.",
      "Newsmax has twice publicly expressed some regrets about its postelection coverage. The network settled a lawsuit with Smartmatic in 2024.",
      "In a statement aired on Newsmax in December 2020, the network said that \u201cno evidence has been offered that Dominion or Smartmatic used software or reprogrammed software that manipulated votes in the 2020 election.\u201d The following April, Newsmax apologized for airing false allegations that a Dominion employee, Eric Coomer, manipulated voting machines or tallies to the detriment of Trump in 2020. Coomer, in turn, dropped Newsmax from a defamation lawsuit.",
      "According to court papers in the case, Newsmax executive Gary Kanofsky wrote about conspiracy theorists to a colleague shortly after the election: \u201cSimply giving them a microphone to spew more anti-election rhetoric and advance their claims without being properly equipped to question the legitimacy or factual accuracy of their assertions may be fun, but it\u2019s terrible journalism.\u201d",
      "But Newsmax offered no apology in making the Dominion settlement, announced Aug. 11. The network's CEO, Chris Ruddy, attacked the judge, saying he \u201ceffectively entered a confiscation of our property because our reporting was not always sympathetic to Joe Biden.\u201d",
      "The network said on the air: \u201cNewsmax believed it was critically important for the American people to hear both sides of the election disputes that arose in 2020. We stand by our coverage as fair, balanced and conducted within professional standards of journalism.\u201d",
      "What has changed? Newsmax has grown, and two months after Trump took office again, it went public. It invites members of its audience \u2014 dominated by Trump fans \u2014 to invest in the network.",
      "\u201cIf you're paying attention to your audience at Newsmax,\u201d Graham said, \u201cyou don't want to give the impression that you're knuckling under.\u201d",

      "RIO FRIO, Portugal -- U.S. winemakers have something to celebrate: the corks they\u2019re popping aren\u2019t subject to tariffs.",
      "Cork comes from the spongy bark of the cork oak tree, which is primarily grown and harvested in the Mediterranean basin. The framework trade agreement between the United States and the European Union singled out the material as an \u201cunavailable natural product.\u201d So as of Sept. 1, cork joined a handful of other items, including airplanes and generic pharmaceuticals, that are exempt from a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU products.",
      "The cork carve-out was vital for Portugal. The European country is the world\u2019s largest cork producer, accounting for about half of global production.",
      "Portuguese diplomats lobbied for the exemption on both sides of the Atlantic. Patrick Spencer, the executive director of the U.S.-based Natural Cork Council, raced from Salem, Oregon, to Washington in June to explain cork\u2019s origins to U.S. trade officials and to seek a tariff reprieve. The Wine Institute, which represents California vintners, said it also pushed for the special dispensation.",
      "Spencer said he was thrilled when a summary of the U.S.-EU agreement released in August mentioned cork.",
      "\u201cIt was a great day in our neighborhood,\u201d said Spencer, a self-described \u201ccork dork.\"",
      "It\u2019s unclear if cork is unique or if other natural products will be exempt from U.S. tariffs in future trade agreements. The U.S. Department of Commerce and the White House did not respond when The Associated Press asked about tariff exemptions.",
      "It\u2019s not even clear if the tariffs President Donald Trump put on imports from the EU's 27 member nations and almost every country will remain. Late last month, a U.S. appeals court ruled that Trump had no right to impose his sweeping tariffs, although it left them in place while his administration appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "But if the tariffs stay in place, cork may signal other exemptions to come. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated during a July interview with CNBC that natural products like mangoes or cocoa may be free from tariffs",
      "The U.S. is the second-largest market for Portuguese cork after France. In 2023, the U.S. imported $241 million worth of cork from Portugal; just over 70% of it came in the form of stoppers for wine, spirits, olive oil, honey and other liquids, according to the Natural Cork Council, a trade group.",
      "Cork has other applications, too. NASA and SpaceX have used it for thermal protection on rockets. Cork crumbles are also used as infill for sports fields and inserted into concrete on airport runways to help absorb the shock of plane landings.",
      "Even though California has a similar climate to the Mediterranean, the U.S. has never developed a cork industry. There was an attempt to start one during World War II, and around 500 cork oaks from that period remain on the campus of the University of California, Davis.",
      "But the effort evaporated when the war ended. The problem: it takes 25 years for a cork tree to produce its first bark for harvesting, and the initial yield typically isn\u2019t high quality. After that, it takes the tree about nine years to grow new bark.",
      "\u201cAmericans are not patient enough to wait for a tree that takes 25 years to give its first harvest,\u201d said Antonio Amorim, the chairman and CEO of Portugal\u2019s Corticeira Amorim, one of the world\u2019s largest cork companies.",

      "Amorim, which exports cork to more than 100 countries, has more than 20 million cork trees spread over 700,000 hectares (1.7 million acres) of woodland.",
      "On a recent day at Amorim\u2019s Herdade de Rio Frio, a farm 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Lisbon, crews zig-zagged across the thin, pale grass between scattered cork trees, kicking up dust.",
      "The quiet woodland echoed with the gentle thud of the workers\u2019 axes. They gently pierced the bark, feeling for the thickness of cork that could be peeled off without harming the trunk. The Portuguese have harvested cork this way for more than 200 years.",
      "The tree bark came off in featherweight slabs that the workers, their hands black from the oaks' natural tannins, tossed onto a flatbed truck. It would go to factories to be cut into strips and fed into a machine that punches out stoppers.",
      "Once the trees were bare, a woman painted a white \u201c5\u201d on the orange-colored trunks, signaling they were stripped in 2025. Herdade de Rio Frio's cork oaks, which are native to Portugal and can resist frequent droughts and scorching summer temperatures, were planted more than 100 years ago.",
      "Cork\u2019s sustainable harvesting process and its biodegradability are two reasons many U.S. winemakers have returned to plugging bottles with it after experimenting with closures made of aluminum, plastic and glass. In 2010, 53% of premium U.S. wines used cork stoppers; by 2022, that had risen to 64.5%, according to the Natural Cork Council.",
      "Cork taint, which gives wine a funky taste and is caused by a fungus in natural corks, was a big problem in the 1990s, and it pushed many vintners into aluminum screw caps and other closures, said Andrew Waterhouse, a chemist and director of the Robert Mondavi Institute of Wine and Food Science at the University of California, Davis.",
      "The cork industry has largely solved that problem, Waterhouse said. In the meantime, the wine industry came up with new technology, like screw caps that can mimic cork in the amount of oxygen they let into a bottle over time.",
      "Many wineries, including Trump Winery in Virginia, now use both screw caps and natural corks. Waterhouse said screw caps generally make more sense for a wine like ros\u00e9, which isn\u2019t intended to age, while cork is the standard for aging wines.",

      "Still, India's clean energy appetite is helping its solar manufacturers deal with the external pressures. Energy analysts said India's domestic demand for solar power will likely reduce disruption from tariffs imposed by the U.S., where about a third of the solar panels produced by India were sold in a recent fiscal year. Proceeds from selling in the lucrative U.S. market have helped Indian solar manufacturers update their supply chains in recent years so they were less dependent on imported Chinese parts and materials.",
      "While Indian solar manufacturers can sell at higher prices abroad, ambitious domestic clean energy targets and domestic demand will help them find buyers within India if sales in the U.S. slow, analysts said.",
      "\u201cThis is a huge industry that can absorb these modules and cells that are being produced. We are not necessarily as export dependent as other countries are,\u201d said Charith Konda, an energy analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.",
      "India's domestic solar market has already helped Hyderabad-based Vega Solar shift its customer base for off-grid solar modules for RVs, electric fences and other uses to customers in India in the years since the COVID-19 pandemic, said Vinay Keesara, a company director.",
      "\u201cBefore the pandemic, 90% of my business was exports and 10% used to be domestic supply, now this has just flipped the other way around,\u201d he said.",
      "One of the most carbon-polluting countries, India is making huge efforts to harness the power of the sun and other clean energy sources. The cost of solar power \u2014 now half that of new coal-powered plants \u2014 and India's many sunny days are reasons that experts said installed solar power increased 30 times in the last decade.",
      "Before the U.S. tariffs were announced, researchers with IEEFA and Gurugram, India-based JMK Research wrote that India's demand for solar modules during the next two years could exceed what its manufacturers are selling within the country because so many are being exported. India has also been importing solar modules from China.",
      "Konda said it was too early to determine how the U.S. tariffs will affect Indian solar manufacturers, but that the impact won\u2019t be felt for at least another year because solar component orders are placed well in advance. And uncertainty remains over the fate of all of Trump's tariffs. Despite a U.S. court ruling against Trump\u2019s tariffs, they remain in place until at least October while his administration files appeals.",
      "India has nearly 170 gigawatts of renewable energy projects in the pipeline \u2014 most of which are solar \u2014 and are expected to be completed in the next few years. The country also has an ambitious clean energy target of 500 gigawatts by 2030.",
      "Government policies restricting imports of solar components, incentives for solar manufacturers and mandates for solar power producers to purchase material from government-approved sources gave Indian companies the right signals to ramp up solar manufacturing, said Sanjay Verghese, ReNew\u2019s group president for solar manufacturing and solar projects.",

Government data showed India imported $1.3 billion worth of solar cells and modules from China in the first quarter of the year, down by more than one-third from the same period a year earlier. Cells are individual units that convert sunlight into energy, while modules are made up of multiple cells.",
      "Neshwin Rodrigues, an analyst at climate energy think tank Ember, predicted that by 2030, India might be in a position of needing to import only the raw material polysilicon while producing other solar panel ingredients in the country.",
      "According to India\u2019s renewable energy ministry, the country\u2019s solar module manufacturing capacity more than doubled to 74 gigawatts over the fiscal year ending March 2025. Solar cell manufacturing tripled in the same period, from 9 gigawatts to 25 gigawatts.",

      "President Donald Trump's appearances on podcasts were a pivotal media strategy in his successful 2024 Republican campaign. Moving forward, mastering a personal podcast could replace soft-focus biographies or wonky books as a way for politicians to increase their profiles.",
      "Beshear said on NBC's \u201cMeet the Press\u201d this summer that he will \u201ctake a look\u201d at running for president in 2028. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, also in the circle of potential presidential nominees, started his own podcast earlier this year.",

      "\u201cThat's how Americans feel,\u201d he said. \u201cThey feel like the news hits them minute after minute after minute. And it can feel like chaos. It can feel like the world is out of control. With this podcast, we're trying to help Americans process what we're going through.\u201d",
      "He's already done nearly two dozen podcasts, with his audience heavily weighted toward Kentucky residents. His guests have included some potential Democratic presidential rivals, including Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar. Entrepreneur Mark Cuban, former Kentucky basketball coach John Calipari and Kentucky-born actor and comic Steve Zahn have also appeared.",
      "Beshear, the son of a former governor who's been leading Kentucky since 2019, talks issues himself. Two of his friends, a Republican and a Democrat, are regular guests, and his 16-year-old son helps Dad navigate some youthful lingo.",

      "Newsom's podcast started slowly in the marketplace but has caught fire in recent weeks, his regular audiences jumping from the tens of thousands to the hundreds of thousands, said Paul Riismandel, president of Signal Hill Insights, an audio-focused market research company.",
      "The California governor's increased visibility, particularly on social media, is likely a factor in the growing popularity of the podcast, Riismandel said. But it's also a function of how podcasts often catch on: Many tend to be slow burns as audiences discover them, he said.",

      "South Korea\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Lee Jaewoong, read a statement following South Korean media reports that the raid by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement resulted in the detainment of around 450 people, including 30 South Korean nationals. Lee did not specify exactly how many South Koreans were detained but called the number \u201clarge.\u201d",
      "Thursday's raid targeted one of Georgia\u2019s largest and most high-profile manufacturing sites, touted by the governor and other officials as the largest economic development project in the state\u2019s history. Hyundai Motor Group, South Korea's biggest automaker, began manufacturing EVs a year ago at the $7.6 billion plant, which employs about 1,200 people, and has partnered with LG Energy Solution to build an adjacent battery plant, slated to open next year.",
      "ICE spokesman Lindsay Williams confirmed that federal authorities were conducting an enforcement operation at the 3,000-acre (1,214-hectare) site west of Savannah, Georgia. He said agents were focused on the construction site for the battery plant.",
      "\u201cThe business activities of our investors and the rights of our nationals must not be unjustly infringed in the process of U.S. law enforcement,\u201d Lee said.",
      "Lee said the ministry is taking active measures to address the case, dispatching diplomats from its embassy in Washington and consulate in Atlanta to the site, and planning to form an on-site response team centered on the local mission.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that agents executed a search warrant \u201cas part of an ongoing criminal investigation into allegations of unlawful employment practices and other serious federal crimes.\u201d",
      "It did not say whether anyone was detained or arrested.",

      "As the cost of electricity outpaces inflation, consumer advocates are sounding alarms about the risks to low-income people who can't afford consistent air conditioning in deadly heat",
      "NEW YORK -- As the cost of electricity outpaces inflation and summers grow deadlier, consumer advocates are sounding alarms about the risks to low-income people who can\u2019t afford consistent air conditioning in dangerous temperatures.",
      "While about half of U.S. states offer protections from utility shutoffs during extreme heat, the rest do not. In contrast, 41 states have \u201ccold weather rules,\u201d which forbid utility companies from shutting off household heat during extreme cold. The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) provides funds for vulnerable groups who have trouble affording heating bills in the winter, but the program has less funding available to meet consumers' increasing needs in the summer months.",
      "Shylee Johnson, 27, based in Wichita, Kansas, saw firsthand the protection that the local Low Income Energy Assistance Program (LIEAP) brought to her community during the three years she worked as a case manager for families who were behind on utility bills.",
      "\u201cIt was amazing at keeping people's electricity on in the winter,\u201d she said of the program, which subsidizes costs for households who can't afford utility expenses. \u201cFamilies would be deciding between paying their heating bill or another bill, and this took that decision away.\u201d",
      "In the summer, though, Johnson said she's seen how late or missed utility payments can result in the shutoff of electricity and the removal of vital services, despite air conditioning becoming increasingly essential to families' health and well-being.",
      "\u201cIt's terrifying,\u201d she said. \u201cThere's a \u2018cold weather rule\u2019 \u2014 in freezing temperatures, your heat can't be turned off. But there isn't an equivalent for summer in Kansas.\"",
      "The clients Johnson served were often the most vulnerable, including families with young children, pregnant people, and those with sick or disabled family members, including some who need electricity to operate essential medical equipment in their homes. LIHEAP also sometimes provides air conditioning units in the summer for households that can't afford to purchase their own units.",
      "Recent studies show that extreme heat in the summer is now the leading cause of weather-related deaths, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). That's ahead of deaths due to extreme cold in the winter or other weather emergencies, like hurricanes or tornadoes. The frequency, duration and intensity of extreme heat waves has significantly increased over the past several decades, according to the EPA, and insignificant support for low-income households contributes to the danger.",
      "In 2023, the death certificates of more than 2,300 people who died in the summer mention the effects of excessive heat, the highest number in 45 years of records, according to an Associated Press analysis of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. And that figure is only a fraction of the real death toll, according to coroner, hospital, and ambulance records, also analyzed by the AP.",
      "Nationally, the cost of electricity has risen at twice the pace of the average cost of living, exacerbating the problem.",
      "According to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA), which represents state program managers of LIHEAP, almost 20% of very low-income families lack consistent access to cooling. Currently, 26 states and the District of Columbia offer assistance with summer energy bills, while 21 states plus D.C. have policies protecting low-income families from utility disconnections during summer months.",
      "Still, roughly 85% of LIHEAP resources are used for heating in the winter, leaving little support for households seeking cooling, according to Mark Wolfe, executive director of NEADA.",

      "Karen Lusson, senior attorney at the National Consumer Law Center who focuses on energy and utility affordability, said that many deaths from extreme heat in the summer months are preventable.",
      "\u201cThe impression we\u2019ve all had is that weather is most dangerous in the wintertime,\u201d she said. \u201cNot any more.\u201d",
      "While the Trump administration fired the entire staff of the LIHEAP program in April, Wolfe and Lusson are hopeful Congress will approve slightly more funding for the program in the fall compared to the previous fiscal year, they said.",
      "To protect households during increasingly hotter summers, Lusson recommends individuals seek information about their rights when it comes to utility shutoffs. State utility commissions, which regulate public utilities, dictate local rules. To find your relevant commission, consult the government site operated by the national association of regulatory commissions, which has a state-by-state look-up tool.",
      "Lusson also encourages people to look into whether their state protections are calendar- or temperature-based, which can make a difference in planning. While some states forbid shut-offs during certain months of the year, others base the protections on the temperature of a given day or the presence of a heat advisory. This LIHEAP site has a break-down of every state's policies.",
      "Some state attorney generals' offices also have public utility bureaus that advocate on behalf of consumers, Lusson said.",
      "Lastly, it can be helpful to determine if your utility company offers discount rates or percentage-of-income payment plans to help with electricity bills. Both commission and utility websites have specific information about how to access LIHEAP assistance and whether or not the utility company itself offers assistance.",

      "A new paper from Vanderbilt University suggests Americans could save about $100 billion annually if credit card interest rates were capped at 10%, as proposed by President Donald Trump",
      "NEW YORK -- Americans would save roughly $100 billion a year in interest costs if President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign proposal to cap credit card interest rates at 10% were implemented, according to a paper published by Vanderbilt University on Thursday.",
      "Further, the banks and credit card companies would be able to withstand, and even still be profitable, if there were to be a national cap on interest rates. While limited in scope, the paper gives some academic backing to President Trump\u2019s campaign promise.",
      "The paper found that banks would still be able to earn a profit on most of their customers even if credit card interest rates were capped at 15%, and if the banks continued to offer rewards and perks like points and airport lounge access. If interest rates were capped at 10%, the business model gets more difficult for the banks, but they could still make money off most card customers by cutting back on some rewards.",
      "Usury laws are as old as the Bible but have gotten traction again through Trump's populist politics. When he was a candidate in the 2024 election, Trump proposed a temporary 10% cap on credit card interest rates. He has not spoken about it since the election.",
      "That said, politicians have seized on the idea. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders introduced a bill in Congress that would match Trump\u2019s campaign proposal of capping interest rates at 10%. A similar bill was introduced in the House by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York.",
      "There are already some interest rate caps in effect in the U.S. The Military Lending Act makes it illegal to charge active servicemen and women more than 36% for any financial product. The national regulator for credit unions, the NCUA, has capped interest rates on credit union credit cards at 18%.",
      "The banking industry is adamantly against any caps on credit card rates. Historically, the industry has argued that any cap on interest rates would decimate the credit card business model and would threaten the viability of popular rewards and perks programs that millions of Americans use for free flights and hotel stays.",
      "It was this rhetoric that made Brian Shearer, the author of the report, start to look into the issue. Shearer previously worked at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as the regulator\u2019s assistant director of policy planning and strategy, working under Republican and Democratic administrations.",
      "\u201cI wanted to see if President Trump\u2019s proposed cap could be taken seriously, and the idea appears that it could be seriously considered and it would not have the amount of downside that often the pundits assume there will be,\u201d Shearer said.",

      "Americans are carrying more credit card debt than ever before, to the tune of $1.21 trillion, or roughly $6,400 per person. The average credit card interest rate is roughly 21%, according to data from the Federal Reserve. That\u2019s significantly higher than a decade ago, when the average credit card interest rate was roughly 12%.",
      "Banks earn revenue from credit cards two different ways: the amount of money they charge merchants to process a credit card transaction, often referred to as interchange, and the interest and fees the banks charge customers. That could be the annual fee on a credit card, or the monthly interest that accrues when a customer carries a balance.",
      "Shearer says the revenue earned from interchange is why banks would remain profitable, even if credit card interest rates are capped. Credit card rewards programs are largely funded through interchange. American Express, for instance, earned $35.2 billion in revenue from the fees they charge merchants.",
      "Under Shearer\u2019s analysis, if interest rates were capped at 15%, Americans would save roughly $48 billion in interest a year, while at 10%, that figure goes to $100 billion. In his analysis, Shearer assumed that banks would charge as close to the national cap as possible.",
      "The Vanderbilt paper finds that banks, because they largely fund their rewards programs from interchange, would not likely universally cut back on rewards for Americans. Instead, the Americans who would likely see the biggest reduction in rewards would be those with low credit scores, because they are considered the riskiest borrowers. However, Shearer believes that any modest reduction in rewards for those customers would likely be made up in the interest they would save annually. Historically, bank customers with low credit scores tend to be \"revolvers\", or those who carry a balance, instead of \u201ctransactors,\u201d which are customers who pay off their credit cards at the end of each month.",
      "\u201cIt is true that there would need to be some reward reduction, but it\u2019s not the kind of sky-is-falling story that you often hear,\u201d Shearer said.",

      "For decades, U.S. Open women's singles champions received a replica trophy that was much smaller than the ones the men's title winners were allowed to take home",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Coco Gauff was surprised at how much tinier the replica trophy she got to keep after winning this year's French Open was than the trophy she posed with on court at Roland-Garros for all the world to see. She even did a TikTok about the discrepancy, drawing more than 2 million views.",
      "Why was Gauff so taken aback by what she called the \u201c miniature version \u201d?",
      "\u201cI honestly did not know the size it was going to be. ... I know you never really take the original, but when I won the U.S. Open, they gave me the same size (trophy), with my name engraved on it,\u201d Gauff told The Associated Press. \u201cSo I just assumed that Roland Garros would be the same.\u201d",
      "Actually, it turns out Gauff's 2023 championship at the U.S. Open marked the first time the women's singles winner in New York was given a silver cup significantly larger than the one that is used in the postmatch ceremony. Her replica hardware is 19 1/2 inches tall, the same as both the original and keepsake men's trophies \u2014 and 7 1/2 inches bigger than the original women's trophy.",
      "That one, like the original men's, is displayed during the tournament in a locked glass box near where players enter the event's main arena and will be briefly handed to, then taken away from, whoever wins the women's final in Arthur Ashe Stadium this Saturday.",
      "From 1987, when the tradition of providing keepsakes at Flushing Meadows began, until two years ago, the female champion took home a 12-inch-tall copy. But the U.S. Tennis Association asked Tiffany & Co. to create replicas for the women to match the size of what the men are allowed to keep. That change coincided with the 50th anniversary of the tournament's 1973 move to pay equal prize money to women and men at then-player Billie Jean King's urging.",
      "\u201cEquality is in our DNA here at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. Everything we do, we\u2019re very intentional about equality ... and we wanted to do the same as it relates to the champion\u2019s trophies,\u201d U.S. Open tournament director Stacey Allaster said in an interview.",

      "After all, therein lies the foundation of the Border War.",
      "One of the most bitter rivalries in college sports, the once-annual showdown between Tigers and Jayhawks has been on hiatus since 2011, when Missouri jumped from the Big 12 Conference to the Southeastern Conference. But it will be renewed on Saturday, when Kansas makes the short trip across the state line to face Missouri in a nonconference matchup that can trace its roots to literal warfare.",
      "In the 1850s and '60s, guerilla fighting in western Missouri and eastern Kansas erupted over whether slavery would be legal in the proposed state of Kansas. The anti-slavery \u201cJayhawkers\u201d would pillage pro-slavery communities in Missouri, which led in part to the formation of the \u201cTigers,\u201d a militia unit whose responsibility it became to protect Columbia from attacks.",
      "For the last 134 years, the Tigers and Jayhawks have waged their own sort of battle on the football field.",
      "\u201cWe gave them a little background history,\u201d Leipold said of his team this week, \u201call the way back to the border, and what the border stood for, and free states and slave states, and kind of went through the whole history of where these two states have been competitive, and not always agreed. And then we went through when the first game was played, and all the things that have gone on from there, and where the series is. Touched on why it hasn't been played in a while.\u201d",
      "That decision by Missouri to bolt from its longtime conference home to the SEC only added to the animosity.",
      "As if there wasn't enough already.",
      "Longtime Missouri basketball coach Norm Stewart famously refused to let his team stay in Kansas hotels, or even refuel the bus across the state line, lest he inject a single dollar into its economy. Kansas football coach Don Fambrough once said he'd rather die than seek medical attention from a physician in Missouri. And over the years, the notorious Mizzou student section, known as the Antlers, would spend the night before games calling up Kansas coaches and players at all hours.",
      "Pretty innocent stuff, really, compared with William Quantrill's band of vigilantes ransacking Lawrence way back in 1863.",
      "Then again, folks haven't forgotten about that, either.",
      "\u201cMy wife and I were at church and somebody wanted to talk about it,\" Leipold said of the rivalry. \"I didn't know that was the right time to, really. Somebody said, you know, \u2018Kick their butt.\u2019 But they didn't say butt. And it was in church.",

The 1911 game is recognized by the NCAA as the birth of \u201chomecoming.\" And in 2007, Kansas was ranked No. 2 and Missouri was No. 3 for an epic showdown at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, which the Tigers won 36-28 to reach the Big 12 title game.",
      "\u201cTwo big games were \u201807 and \u201908, and I remember watching those games on TV, to be honest,\u201d Drinkwitz said. \u201cI wasn't in college coaching at that point. I was a high school school. ... Taking the job, I understood the importance of this.\u201d",
      "Two decades of conference realignment have rendered many longtime rivalries a rarity. But as more financial pressure is placed on athletic departments, the argument can be made that the importance of winning them has never been greater.",
      "\u201cAnything that stirs the passion of your fanbase is important,\u201d Drinkwitz said, \u201cespecially when you're asking fans to do so much. We ask our fans to do so much from a financial contribution, a time contribution, an engagement contribution. So any time you get a chance to stir their passion for bragging rights and whatever other rights might be on the line with this game, it's important that your team is ready to play.\u201d",
      "To that point, Drinkwitz and Leipold have had to walk a fine line. They may have brought in former players to talk to their teams about the rivalry this week, and the history lessons have been important. But none of that matters at kickoff on Saturday.",
      "\u201cCoach showed us a video about the rivalry and how it goes back hundreds of years,\u201d Kansas safety Taylor Davis said. \u201cThere's obviously a lot of emotions for both sides. We're just going to try to keep it neutral and play football.\u201d",

      "But he\u2019s already exhausted his local options and it\u2019s not because he\u2019s picky or unappealing. Instead, he\u2019s a common garden snail with an uncommon anatomical problem that\u2019s ruining his love life.",

      "That dire prospect prompted a New Zealand nature lover who found the snail in her garden in August to launch a campaign to find his perfect match. But Ned\u2019s quest for true love, perhaps predictably, is slow.",
      "Giselle Clarkson was weeding her home vegetable patch in Wairarapa on the North Island when a snail tumbling out of the leafy greens caught her eye. Clarkson, the author and illustrator of a nature book, \u201cThe Observologist,\u201d has an affection for snails and had long been on the lookout for a sinistral, or left-coiled shell.",
      "\u201cI knew immediately that I couldn\u2019t just toss the snail back into the weeds with the others,\u201d she said. Instead, she sent a photo of the snail, pictured alongside a right-coiled gastropod as proof, to her colleagues at New Zealand Geographic.",
      "The magazine launched a nationwide campaign to find a mate for Ned, named for the left-handed character Ned Flanders in \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d who once opened a store called The Leftorium. That explains the male pronouns some use for Ned, although snails are hermaphrodites with sex organs on their necks and the capacity for both eggs and sperm.",
      "\u201cWhen you have a right-coiling snail and a left-coiling snail, they can\u2019t slide up and get their pieces meeting in the right position,\u201d Clarkson said. \u201cSo a lefty can only mate with another lefty.\u201d",
      "The fact that romantic hopefuls need not be a sex match should have boosted Ned\u2019s prospects. But his inbox has remained empty except for photos of \u201coptimistically misidentified right-coiling snails,\" Clarkson said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had lots of enthusiasm and encouragement for Ned, a lot of people who can relate and really want the best for them, as a symbol of hope for everyone who\u2019s looking for love,\u201d she said. \u201cBut as yet, no lefties have been forthcoming.\u201d",
      "Ned\u2019s relatable romantic woes have attracted global news coverage, but New Zealand\u2019s strict biosecurity controls mean long-distance love probably isn\u2019t on the cards.

      "IRVING, Texas -- Crowded around a workshop table, four girls at de Zavala Middle School puzzled over a Lego machine they had built. As they flashed a purple card in front of a light sensor, nothing happened.",
      "The teacher at the Dallas-area school had emphasized that in the building process, there is no such thing as mistakes. Only iterations. So the girls dug back into the box of blocks and pulled out an orange card. They held it over the sensor and the machine kicked into motion.",
      "\u201cOh! Oh, it reacts differently to different colors,\u201d said sixth grader Sofia Cruz.",
      "In de Zavala\u2019s first year as a choice school focused on science, technology, engineering and math, the school recruited a sixth grade class that\u2019s half girls. School leaders are hoping the girls will stick with STEM fields. In de Zavala\u2019s higher grades \u2014 whose students joined before it was a STEM school \u2014 some elective STEM classes have just one girl enrolled.",
      "Efforts to close the gap between boys and girls in STEM classes are picking up after losing steam nationwide during the chaos of the COVID-19 pandemic. Schools have extensive work ahead to make up for the ground girls lost, in both interest and performance.",
      "In the years leading up to the pandemic, the gender gap nearly closed. But within a few years, girls lost all the ground they had gained in math test scores over the previous decade, according to an Associated Press analysis. While boys' scores also suffered during COVID, they have recovered faster than girls, widening the gender gap.",
      "As learning went online, special programs to engage girls lapsed \u2014 and schools were slow to restart them. Zoom school also emphasized rote learning, a technique based on repetition that some experts believe may favor boys, instead of teaching students to solve problems in different ways, which may benefit girls.",
      "Old practices and biases likely reemerged during the pandemic, said Michelle Stie, a vice president at the National Math and Science Initiative.",

It was based on average test scores for third through eighth graders in 33 states, compiled by the Educational Opportunity Project at Stanford University.",
      "A decade later, girls had not only caught up, they were ahead: Slightly more than half of districts had higher math averages for girls.",
      "Within a few years of the pandemic, the parity disappeared. In 2023-2024, boys on average outscored girls in math in nearly nine out of 10 districts.",
      "A separate study by NWEA, an education research company, found gaps between boys and girls in science and math on national assessments went from being practically non-existent in 2019 to favoring boys around 2022.",
      "Studies have indicated girls reported higher levels of anxiety and depression during the pandemic, plus more caretaking burdens than boys, but the dip in academic performance did not appear outside STEM. Girls outperformed boys in reading in nearly every district nationwide before the pandemic and continued to do so afterward.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t something like COVID happened and girls just fell apart,\u201d said Megan Kuhfeld, one of the authors of the NWEA study.",

Through new curriculum standards, schools moved toward research-backed methods that emphasized how to think flexibly to solve problems and how to tackle numeric problems conceptually.",
      "Educators also promoted participation in STEM subjects and programs that boosted girls\u2019 confidence, including extracurriculars that emphasized hands-on learning and connected abstract concepts to real-life applications.",
      "When STEM courses had large male enrollment, Superintendent Kenny Rodrequez noticed girls losing interest as boys dominated classroom discussions at his schools in Grandview C-4 District outside Kansas City.

      "A federal judge on Tuesday ordered a shake-up of Google\u2019s search engine in an attempt to curb the corrosive power of an illegal monopoly while rebuffing the U.S. government\u2019s attempt to break up the company and impose other restraints",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge on Tuesday ordered a shake-up of Google\u2019s search engine in an attempt to curb the corrosive power of an illegal monopoly while rebuffing the U.S. government's attempt to break up the company and impose other restraints.",
      "The 226-page decision made by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington, D.C., will likely ripple across the technological landscape at a time when the industry is being reshaped by breakthroughs in artificial intelligence \u2014 including conversational \u201canswer engines\u201d as companies like ChatGPT and Perplexity try to upend Google\u2019s long-held position as the internet\u2019s main gateway.",
      "The innovations and competition being unleashed by AI also reshaped the judge\u2019s approach to the remedies in the nearly five-year-old antitrust case brought by the U.S. Justice Department during President Donald Trump\u2019s first administration and carried onward by President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "\u201cUnlike the typical case where the court\u2019s job is to resolve a dispute based on historic facts, here the court is asked to gaze into a crystal ball and look to the future. Not exactly a judge\u2019s forte,\u201d Mehta wrote.",
      "The judge is trying to rein in Google by prohibiting some of the tactics the company deployed to drive traffic to its search engine and other services. The ruling also will pry open some of the prized databases of closely guarded information about search that have provided Google with a seemingly insurmountable advantage.",
      "The handcuffs being slapped on Google will preclude contracts that give its search engine, Gemini AI app, Play Store for Android and virtual assistant an exclusive position on smartphone, personal computers and other devices.",
      "But Mehta stopped short of banning the multi-billion dollar deals that Google has been making for years to lock in its search engine as the default on smartphones, personal computers and other devices. Those deals, involving payments of more than $26 billion annually, were one of the main issues that prompted the judge to conclude Google\u2019s search engine was an illegal monopoly, but he decided banning them in the future would do more harm than good.",
      "The judge also rejected the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s effort to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, concluding it was an unwarranted step that \u201cwould be incredibly messy and highly risky.\u201d",
      "Partially because he is allowing the default deals to continue, Mehta is ordering Google to give its current and would-be rivals access to some of its search engine\u2019s secret sauce \u2014 the data stockpiled from trillions of queries that it used to help improve the quality of its search results. That is a measure that Google had also fiercely opposed, contending it was unfair and would raise privacy and security risk for the billions of people who have posed questions to its search engine \u2014 sometimes delving into sensitive issues.",
      "The Justice Department's antitrust chief, Gail Slater, hailed the decision as a \u201cmajor win for the American people,\u201d even though the agency didn't get everything it sought. \u201cWe are now weighing our options and thinking through whether the ordered relief goes far enough,\u201d Slater wrote in a post.",
      "In its own post, Google framed Mehta's ruling as a vindication of its long-held position that the case never should have been brought. The decision \u201crecognizes how much the industry has changed through the advent of AI, which is giving people so many more ways to find information,\u201d wrote Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs. \u201cThis underlines what we\u2019ve been saying since this case was filed in 2020: Competition is intense and people can easily choose the services they want.\u201d",
      "The Mountain View, California, company has already vowed to appeal the judge\u2019s monopoly findings issued 13 months ago that led to Tuesday's ruling.",

      "Investors seemed to interpret the ruling as a relatively light slap on the wrist for Google, as the stock price of its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., surged more than 7% in extended trading. That would translate into a nearly $200 billion increase in Alphabet's market value, if the shares follow a similar trajectory in Wednesday's regular trading session.",
      "Allowing the default search deals to continue is more than just a victory for Google. It\u2019s also a win for Apple, which receives more than $20 billion annually from Google, and other recipients of the payments.",
      "In hearings earlier this year, Apple warned the judge that banning the contracts would deprive the company of money that it funnels into its own innovative research. The Cupertino, California, company also cautioned that the ban could have the unintended consequence of making Google even more powerful by pocketing the money it had been spending on deals while most consumers will still end up flocking to Google\u2019s search engine anyway.",
      "Others, such as the owners of the Firefox search engine, asserted that losing the Google contracts would threaten their future survival by depriving them of essential revenue.",
      "Apple's shares rose 3% in extended trading after the ruling came out.",
      "Mehta refrained from ordering a sale of Chrome because he decided there wasn't adequate proof the browser served as an essential ingredient in Google's search monopoly, making a divestiture \u201ca poor fit for this case.\u201d",
      "Chrome would have been a hot commodity had the judge forced Google to put it on the auction block. Perplexity submitted an unsolicited $34.5 billion offer to buy Chrome last month. And during court testimony earlier this year, a ChatGPT executive left no doubt that service\u2019s owner, OpenAI, would be interested in be interested in buying Chrome, too.",
      "But the judge decided forcing Google to open up parts of its search data to rivals such as DuckDuckGo, Bing, and others will offer he best and fairest way to foster more compelling competition. In doing so, Mehta still narrowed the scope of the Justice Department's request and will limit the access to Google's search index and query histories.",
      "While the wrangling over Mehta's ruling continues, Google is facing another potentially debilitating threat in another antitrust case brought by the Justice Department targeting the digital ad empire that was built up around its search engine. After different federal judge in Virginia declared that some of the technology underlying the ad network to be an illegal monopoly earlier this year, the Justice Department plans to make its case for another proposed breakup  in a trial scheduled to begin later this month.",

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Scientists revealed Wednesday that Mars\u2019 innermost core appears to be a solid hunk of metal just like Earth\u2019s.",
      "The Chinese-led research team based their findings on seismic readings from NASA\u2019s InSight lander on Mars, which recorded more than 1,300 marsquakes before shutting down in 2022. The spacecraft landed on a broad plain near Mars\u2019 equator in 2018.",
      "Previous studies pointed to liquid at the heart of the red planet. The latest findings indicate the inner core, while small, is indeed solid and surrounded by molten metal \u2014 a liquid outer core.",
      "The Martian inner core extends from the planet\u2019s center out to a radius of approximately 380 miles (613 kilometers), according to the scientists whose findings appeared in the journal Nature.",
      "It\u2019s likely composed of iron and nickel, the same ingredients as Earth\u2019s core, but quite possibly also enriched with lighter elements like oxygen.",
      "Mars\u2019 liquid outer core is bigger, stretching from 380 miles (613 kilometers) to as much as 1,100 miles (1,800 kilometers) from the planet\u2019s center.",
      "Crystallization of Mars\u2019 inner core may have occurred in the past and still be occurring today, one of the lead investigators, Daoyuan Sun of the University of Science and Technology of China, said in an email.",
      "Mars\u2019 core initially would have been entirely liquid. It\u2019s unclear whether the liquid outer core contains any solid material like droplets or whether there might be \u201ca mushy zone\u201d near the boundary between the inner and outer cores, he added.",
      "For their study, Sun and his team relied primarily on 23 marsquakes recorded by InSight, all of them relatively weak. The epicenters were 740 miles to 1,465 miles (1,200 kilometers to 2,360 kilometers) away from the lander.",

    "story": [
      "Bulgarian authorities aren't investigating a suspected Russian interference operation involving a plane carrying European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen because they say the interference is now common",
      "LONDON -- Bulgaria will not investigate suspected Russian electronic interference with a top European official's plane, officials said Monday \u2014 because this kind of GPS jamming is now so common.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was flying to Plovdiv, Bulgaria on Sunday when her plane was hit by GPS jamming. It landed safely but the disruption was the latest in a string of almost 80 incidents tracked by The Associated Press and blamed on Russia by Western officials since Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022.",
      "This year, Nordic and Baltic nations \u2014 including Finland, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia \u2014 have repeatedly warned about greater electronic interference from Russia disrupting communications with planes, ships and drones.",
      "While Russian authorities suggest the jamming is defensive \u2014 to protect key cities and military infrastructure from Ukrainian drone attacks \u2014 Baltic officials say the depth of electronic interference has increased, causing navigation failures far from Russia's borders.",
      "In 2024, a plane carrying the British defense secretary had its satellite signal jammed as it flew near Russian territory, while a Finnish airline temporarily suspended flights to the Estonian city of Tartu.",
      "NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said the interference experienced by von der Leyen's plane was part of a complex campaign by Russia against Europe which could have \u201cpotentially disastrous effects.\u201d",
      "Satellite communications systems \u2014 known collectively as the Global Navigation Satellite System or GNSS \u2014 receive precise time signals from satellites around 20,000 kilometers (12,400 miles) away in space. A smartphone, car, marine or aircraft navigation system compares how long it takes to receive signals from several different satellites to calculate an exact location.",
      "But the signals can be interfered with \u2014 commonly known as jamming or spoofing.",
      "Jamming means a receiver is overwhelmed by a strong radio signal transmitted in the same range where GNSS and other satellite navigation signals operate, leaving the receiver unable to fix a location or time. Spoofing involves transmitting fake signals which imitate a real GNSS satellite signal \u2014 commonly known as GPS \u2014 to mislead a phone, ship or aircraft into thinking it is in a different place.",
      "In a military context, jamming could be used to stop an incoming missile or drone attack, whereas the idea behind spoofing is to \u201ccreate deception,\u201d said Thomas Withington, an expert in electronic warfare at the Royal United Services Institute in London.",
      "It's possible that Israel used spoofing technology to fly into Iranian airspace in June, when it killed top generals and struck nuclear sites, Withington suggested. Spoofing, he said, could have helped Israel deceive Iranian radar.",
      "Long before the invasion of Ukraine, Russian authorities deployed spoofing technology around the Kremlin in Moscow, causing chaos for taxi drivers or other motorists using GPS.",
      "Russia \u201cdoes not mind\u201d if its own infrastructure is affected, as long as enemy activity is deterred, said Withington.",
      "In August, Latvia\u2019s Electronic Communications Office said it had identified at least three hot spots for electronic interference along borders with Russia in the Kaliningrad, Leningrad and Pskov regions. All three regions host important Russian military bases.",
      "In April 2024, Finland's national carrier Finnair temporarily suspended flights to Tartu, Estonia after it said two of its planes were prevented from landing because of GPS disruptions. At that time, Tartu airport required approaching planes to use GPS to land, although planes have \u2014 and use \u2014 other forms of navigation.",
      "These include radio navigation and Inertial Navigation Systems, which determine where an aircraft \u2014 or submarine \u2014 is located by measuring its position in the air or water without relying on GPS.",

      "\u201cI have no musical talent at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t sing, I can\u2019t play instruments, and I have no musical background at all.\"",
      "McCann, 37, who has a background as a visual designer, started experimenting with AI to see if it could boost his creativity and \"bring some of my lyrics to life.\u201d Last month, he signed with independent record label Hallwood Media after one of his tracks racked up 3 million streams, in what's billed as the first time a music label has inked a contract with an AI music creator.",
      "McCann is an example of how ChatGPT-style AI song generation tools like Suno and Udio have spawned a wave of synthetic music. A movement most notably highlighted by a fictitious group, Velvet Sundown, that went viral even though all its songs, lyrics and album art were created by AI.",
      "It fueled debate about AI's role in music while raising fears about \"AI slop\" \u2014 automatically generated low quality mass produced content. It also cast a spotlight on AI song generators that are democratizing song making but threaten to disrupt the music industry.",

      "The most reliable figures come from music streaming service Deezer, which estimates that 18% of songs uploaded to its platform every day are purely AI generated, though they only account for a tiny amount of total streams, hinting that few people are actually listening. Other, bigger streaming platforms like Spotify haven't released any figures on AI music.",
      "Udio declined to comment on how many users it has and how many songs it has generated. Suno did not respond to a request for comment. Both have free basic levels as well as pro and premium tiers that come with access to more advanced AI models.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a total boom. It\u2019s a tsunami,\u201d said Josh Antonuccio, director of Ohio University's School of Media Arts and Studies. The amount of AI generated music \u201cis just going to only exponentially increase\u201d as young people grow up with AI and become more comfortable with it, he said.",
      "Yet generative AI, with its ability to spit out seemingly unique content, has divided the music world, with musicians and industry groups complaining that recorded works are being exploited to train AI models that power song generation tools.",
      "Record labels are trying to fend off the threat that AI music startups pose to their revenue streams even as they hope to tap into it for new earnings, while recording artists worry that it will devalue their creativity.",
      "Three major record companies, Sony Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group and Warner Records, filed lawsuits last year against Suno and Udio for copyright infringement. In June, the two sides also reportedly entered negotiations that could go beyond settling the lawsuits and set rules for how artists are paid when AI is used to remix their songs.",

      "More than 1,000 musicians, including Kate Bush, Annie Lennox and Damon Albarn, released a silent album to protest proposed changes to U.K. laws on AI they fear would erode their creative control. Meanwhile, other artists, such as will.i.am, Timbaland and Imogen Heap, have embraced the technology.",

      "Biologists are using drones to scare wolves away from cattle",
      "For millennia humans have tried to scare wolves away from their livestock. Most of them didn\u2019t have drones.",
      "But a team of biologists working near the California-Oregon border do, and they're using them to blast AC/DC\u2019s \u201cThunderstruck,\u201d movie clips and live human voices at the apex predators to shoo them away from cattle in an ongoing experiment.",
      "\u201cI am not putting up with this anymore!\u201d actor Scarlett Johansson yells in one clip, from the 2019 film \u201c Marriage Story.\u201d",
      "\u201cWith what? I can't talk to people?\u201d co-star Adam Driver shouts back.",
      "Gray wolves were hunted nearly to extinction throughout the U.S. West by the first half of the 20th century. Since their reintroduction in Idaho and at Yellowstone National Park in the mid-1990s, they've proliferated to the point that a population in the Northern Rockies has been removed from the endangered species list.",
      "There are now hundreds of wolves in Washington and Oregon, dozens more in northern California, and thousands roaming near the Great Lakes.",
      "The recovering population has meant increasing conflict with ranchers \u2014 and increasingly creative efforts by the latter to protect livestock. They've turned to electrified fencing, wolf alarms, guard dogs, horseback patrols, trapping and relocating, and now drones. In some areas where nonlethal efforts have failed, officials routinely approve killing wolves, including last week in Washington state.",
      "Gray wolves killed some 800 domesticated animals across 10 states in 2022, a previous Associated Press review of data from state and federal agencies found.",
      "Scientists with the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service developed the techniques for hazing wolves by drone while monitoring them using thermal imaging cameras at night, when the predators are most active. A preliminary study released in 2022 demonstrated that adding human voices through a loudspeaker rigged onto a drone can freak them out.",
      "The team documented successful interruptions of wolf hunts. When Dustin Ranglack, the USDA\u2019s lead researcher on the project, saw one for the first time, he smiled from ear to ear.",
      "\u201cIf we could reduce those negative impacts of wolves, that is going to be more likely to lead to a situation where we have coexistence,\u201d Ranglack said.",
      "The preloaded clips include recordings of music, gunshots, fireworks and voices. A drone pilot starts by playing three clips chosen at random, such as the \u201cMarriage Story\u201d scene or \u201cThunderstruck,\u201d with its screams and hair-raising electric guitar licks.",
      "If those don't work, the operator can improvise by yelling through a microphone or playing a different clip that's not among the randomized presets. One favorite is the heavy metal band Five Finger Death Punch 's cover of \u201cBlue on Black,\u201d which might blast the lyric \u201cYou turned and you ran\u201d as the wolves flee.",

      "USDA drone pilots have continued cattle protection patrols this summer while researching wolf responses at ranches with high conflict levels along the Oregon-California border. Patrols extended south to the Sierra Valley in August for the first time, according to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether the wolves might become accustomed to the drones. Herders and wolf hunters in Europe have long deterred them with long lines hung with flapping cloth, but the wolves can eventually learn that the flags are not a threat.",
      "Environmental advocates are optimistic about drones, though, because they allow for scaring wolves in different ways, in different places.",
      "\u201cWolves are frightened of novel things,\u201d said Amaroq Weiss, a wolf advocate with the Center for Biological Diversity. \u201cI know that in the human imagination, people think of wolves as big, scary critters that are scared of nothing.\u201d",
      "There are also drawbacks to the technology. A drone with night vision and a loudspeaker costs around $20,000, requires professional training and doesn't work well in wooded areas, making it impractical for many ranchers.",
      "Ranchers in Northern California who have hosted USDA drone patrols agree that they have reduced livestock deaths so far.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very appreciative of what they did. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a long-term solution,\u201d said Mary Rickert, the owner of a cattle ranch north of Mount Shasta. \u201cWhat I\u2019m afraid of is that after some period of time, that all of a sudden they go, \u2018Wow, this isn\u2019t going to hurt me. It just makes a lot of noise.\u2019\u201d",
      "Ranchers are compensated if they can prove that a wolf killed their livestock. But there are uncompensated costs of having stressed-out cows, such as lower birth rates and tougher meat.",
      "Rickert said if the drones don't work over the long term, she might have to close the business, which she's been involved in since at least the 1980s. She wants permission to shoot wolves if they're attacking her animals or if they come onto her property after a certain number of attacks.",
      "If the technology proves effective and costs come down, someday ranchers might merely have to ask the wolves to go away.",
      "Oregon-based Paul Wolf \u2014 yes, Wolf \u2014 is the USDA's southwest district supervisor and the main Five Finger Death Punch fan among the drone pilots. He recalled an early encounter during which a wolf at first merely seemed curious at the sight of a drone, until the pilot talked to it through the speaker.",
      "\u201cHe said, \u2018Hey wolf \u2014 get out of here,\u2019\u201d Wolf said. \u201cThe wolf immediately lets go of the cattle and runs away.\u201d",

      "For decades, U.S. Open women's singles champions received a replica trophy that was much smaller than the ones the men's title winners were allowed to take home",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Coco Gauff was surprised at how much tinier the replica trophy she got to keep after winning this year's French Open was than the trophy she posed with on court at Roland-Garros for all the world to see. She even did a TikTok about the discrepancy, drawing more than 2 million views.",
      "Why was Gauff so taken aback by what she called the \u201c miniature version \u201d?",
      "\u201cI honestly did not know the size it was going to be. ... I know you never really take the original, but when I won the U.S. Open, they gave me the same size (trophy), with my name engraved on it,\u201d Gauff told The Associated Press. \u201cSo I just assumed that Roland Garros would be the same.\u201d",
      "Actually, it turns out Gauff's 2023 championship at the U.S. Open marked the first time the women's singles winner in New York was given a silver cup significantly larger than the one that is used in the postmatch ceremony. Her replica hardware is 19 1/2 inches tall, the same as both the original and keepsake men's trophies \u2014 and 7 1/2 inches bigger than the original women's trophy.",
      "That one, like the original men's, is displayed during the tournament in a locked glass box near where players enter the event's main arena and will be briefly handed to, then taken away from, whoever wins the women's final in Arthur Ashe Stadium this Saturday.",
      "From 1987, when the tradition of providing keepsakes at Flushing Meadows began, until two years ago, the female champion took home a 12-inch-tall copy. But the U.S. Tennis Association asked Tiffany & Co. to create replicas for the women to match the size of what the men are allowed to keep. That change coincided with the 50th anniversary of the tournament's 1973 move to pay equal prize money to women and men at then-player Billie Jean King's urging.",
      "\u201cEquality is in our DNA here at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. Everything we do, we\u2019re very intentional about equality ... and we wanted to do the same as it relates to the champion\u2019s trophies,\u201d U.S. Open tournament director Stacey Allaster said in an interview.",

      "A New Hampshire teenager on a deep sea fishing trip may have set a world record by reeling in a fish that weighs more than himself",
      "HAMPTON, N.H. -- A New Hampshire teenager on a deep-sea fishing trip this week hauled in a 177-pound (80 kilogram) Atlantic halibut, a fish so big that it weighed more than him and could be a world record.",
      "Jackson Denio, a 13-year-old from Hampton, New Hampshire, was fishing about 100 miles (161 kilometers) off the New England Coast on Cashes Ledge Monday morning when he caught the fish.",
      "\u201cI think I screamed, honestly,\u201d said Denio, who weighs around 120 pounds and is 5-foot-9-inches. \u201cI don\u2019t know exactly what happened, but I was very excited.\u201d",
      "Denio had set out on Sunday with about 30 others on an overnight charter trip with Al Gauron\u2019s Deep Sea Fishing and Whale Watching. After everyone had caught plenty of pollock and other fish, Denio told the crew he wanted to catch a shark. They told him to fish at the bottom.",
      "Minutes after he dropped his hook with pollock on it, Denio got a hit and knew he had something big.",
      "Denio fought the fish for about 30 minutes, bringing it near the boat only to have it dive back down. He was eventually able to get the fish to the surface, guided by the crew and cheered on by fellow passengers who uttered plenty of oohs and ahhs spiced with profanity as the size of the fish became clear. One person even yelled out \u201cJackson, you are an angel of a man.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m standing there watching him. Then all of a sudden the fish took off it, bit it and started pounding away,\u201d said Jim Walsh, the captain of the vessel that Denio was on. \u201cI looked at him and I said, were you on the bottom? And he goes, yes. And I said, you don\u2019t have a shark.\u201d",

      "The shooter who killed two children and injured 21 others at a Minneapolis church was seen on video visiting a gun shop the weekend before the attack",
      "ST. LOUIS PARK, Minn. -- The shooter who killed two schoolchildren and injured 21 other people at a Catholic church in Minneapolis was caught on video visiting a suburban gun shop the weekend before the attack, but the owner of the store said Thursday that his staff saw no warning signs in his conduct.",
      "The video shows that Robin Westman spent around 40 minutes at Frontiersman Sports in St. Louis Park on Aug. 23. Westman examined several guns and ultimately bought a revolver, owner Kory Krause told The Associated Press. Westman had already passed the required background checks and had a valid permit to purchase the gun, he said.",
      "But the revolver wasn't one of the guns Westman used in the shootings at the Church of the Annunciation on Aug. 27, when it was full of students from the affiliated Annunciation Catholic School who had gathered for their first Mass of the academic year. Investigators recovered a semiautomatic assault-style rifle, a shotgun and a different handgun at the scene, and said Westman was legally entitled to buy them. Krause said none came from his store.",
      "Westman, 23, attended the school for eighth grade and Westman's mother formerly worked for the parish, but investigators are still trying to determine a motive. Westman died by suicide after firing 116 rifle rounds through the church\u2019s stained-glass windows.",
      "As first reported by KSTP-TV, the security video shows Westman handling several firearms and talking with employees and other customers. Krause wasn't in the store at the time, but he said he promptly shared the video with investigators and is cooperating with them.",
      "Krause stressed that nothing in Westman's conduct raised any concerns among his staffers, who he said are trained to watch for warning signs.",
      "\u201cThis person said all the right things, they checked all the right boxes, asked all the questions, they were friendly, talkative, making jokes, laughing, knowledgeable about guns, handled a lot of guns that were not the type of guns you would think are of the interest of somebody looking to do a mass shooting,\u201d Krause told AP.",
      "Krause said his employees have extensive experience in picking out bad actors, straw purchasers, people who are homicidal, suicidal, mentally unstable or under the influence of alcohol or drugs. But he said nothing stood out with Westman.",

      "The deadly strike on a boat U.S. officials say was carrying drugs from Venezuela may have marked a stunning shift, but escalating pressure on the South American country has defined much of Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s quarter-century in politics",
      "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- The deadly strike on a boat U.S. officials say was carrying drugs from Venezuela may have marked a stunning shift in the countries\u2019 relations, but escalating pressure on the South American nation has defined much of Secretary of State Marco Rubio's quarter-century in politics.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s top diplomat, a former Florida senator, has depicted Venezuela as a vestige of the communist ideology in the Western Hemisphere. Rubio has consistently pushed for the ouster of its leader, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, advocated for economic sanctions and even argued for American military intervention.",
      "\u201cI think that U.S. armed forces should only be used in cases of national security threats,\u201d he said in a 2018 interview with Univision. \u201cI think there is a strong argument that can be made right now that Venezuela and Maduro\u2019s regime have become a threat to the region and to the U.S.\u201d",
      "Before joining the administration, Rubio had represented a more interventionist wing of the Republican Party that at times seemed at odds with Trump's \u201cAmerica First\u201d ethos. While Trump has promised no more foreign wars, Rubio and other administration officials have warned of more operations against drug traffickers in Latin America, escalating pressure on an adversary Rubio has long sought to confront.",
      "\"The president has said he wants to wage war on these groups because they\u2019ve been waging war on us for 30 years and no one has responded,\u201d Rubio told reporters Thursday.",
      "Before being tapped as secretary of state and national security adviser, the Florida senator had already exerted influence over U.S. policy toward Latin America during Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "For Rubio, his interest in targeting leftist Latin American leaders has been personal. His parents are Cuban immigrants who arrived in Miami in 1956, a few years before Fidel Castro\u2019s 1959 communist revolution. He grew up in Miami, where many Cubans sought refuge after Castro's rise to power.",
      "His consistent criticism of communism has helped win him support from thousands of members of the Venezuelan diaspora who made Florida their new home to escape crime, economic deprivation and unrest under Maduro and his predecessor, the late Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who took power in 1999 and began his self-described socialist revolution.",
      "While the U.S. has tried to move past its Cold War-era legacy of interfering and destabilizing governments in Latin America, Rubio frequently advocated for more action, going against Ch\u00e1vez and then Maduro. He tied the struggle of the opposition movement there to that of Cuban exiles.",
      "Now, \u201che sees an opportunity to move forward a much more aggressive U.S. policy toward Latin America,\u201d said Geoff Ramsey, a senior analyst on Venezuela at the Atlantic Council in Washington.",
      "Rubio shared some of the first details about the strike Tuesday despite it being a military operation, posting on social media as Trump briefly announced it in the Oval Office. The White House says 11 people were killed.",
      "A day later, he said \u201cit\u2019ll happen again\u201d and said Trump had authority \u201cunder exigent circumstances to eliminate imminent threats to the United States.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat will stop them is when you blow them up, when you get rid of them,\u201d Rubio said Wednesday while visiting Mexico.",
      "The Defense Department said late Thursday that two Venezuelan military aircraft flew near a U.S. Navy vessel, calling it \u201ca highly provocative move\u201d and warning Maduro's government against further actions.",
      "The reaction within Trump\u2019s Make America Great Again base to the U.S. strike has been fairly muted, even supportive of it as a drug trafficking effort, unlike the divide that emerged over U.S. intervention in the Israel-Iran conflict.",
      "After Trump bested Rubio in the 2016 GOP primary and later took office in 2017, Rubio became a shadow adviser and was the main driver of sanctions against top-level Venezuelan officials for human rights abuses and ties to drug trafficking.",

      "Many believed Rubio was among the voices that urged Trump to back an opposition leader to unseat Maduro.",

      "Teresa Youngblut, 21, of Seattle, is among a group of radical computer scientists focused on veganism, gender identity and artificial intelligence who have been linked to six killings in three states. She\u2019s accused of fatally shooting agent David Maland in Vermont on Jan. 20, the same day President Donald Trump was inaugurated and signed a sweeping executive order lifting the moratorium on federal executions.",
      "Youngblut initially was charged with using a deadly weapon against law enforcement and discharging a firearm during an assault with a deadly weapon, crimes that were not punishable by the death penalty. But the Trump administration signaled early on that more serious charges were coming as part of its push for more federal executions, and a new indictment released last month charged her with murder of a federal law enforcement agent, assaulting other agents with a deadly weapon and related firearms offenses.",

      "Paine died on Sunday in a senior living facility in Santa Rosa, California, her daughter Tamarin Laurel-Paine said Thursday.",
      "Oswald's wife and children had been staying at Paine's home in the Dallas of suburb of Irving in the fall of 1963. Oswald stayed at the house the night before the assassination, and before setting off to his job at the Texas School Book Depository, retrieved his rifle that he had stowed in the garage \u2014 unbeknownst to Paine.",
      "Laurel-Paine said she admired her mother's willingness over the years to grant interviews and speak out. \u201cShe had adopted the notion that she was just there to be witness to what she knew of history and she would do it for any serious inquiry,\" Laurel-Paine said.",

      "\"She really put up with a lot of preposterous notions that people had, people who were determined to in some ways implicate her in what had gone on and I think she braved this very, very well, very politely always and I think that that took real strength of character,\u201d Mallon said.",
      "Kennedy was killed on Nov. 22, 1963, as shots rang out from the Texas School Book Depository building as his motorcade was ending its parade route. Police arrested Oswald, who worked in the building and was believed to have positioned himself from a sniper's perch on the sixth floor.",
      "That fall, Oswald's Russian-born wife Marina Oswald and her two children had been staying with Paine, a 31-year-old mother of two who was amicably separated from her husband.",
      "The two women had become friends earlier that year, and the living arrangement helped the struggling Oswalds while also giving Paine a chance to improve her Russian, which she had studied.",

      "Lee Harvey Oswald, who was living in a rooming house near downtown, would usually visit his family at Paine\u2019s house on the weekends. But on the day before the assassination, he made an unexpected mid-week visit to Paine's home, where he'd tried unsuccessfully to reconcile with his wife after a fight a few days earlier.",

      "\u201cToday, the courts have affirmed what Bryan Hooper, his family, his loved ones, and his advocates have always known: Mr. Hooper is an innocent man,\u201d Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty said in a statement. \u201cIt is our duty as prosecutors to hold the correct individuals responsible for their actions, and that duty demands that we acknowledge our mistakes and make things right as quickly as we can.\"",
      "Hooper reunited with his children and planned to enjoy a meal with them and spend time with family, Project spokesperson Hayley Poxleitner said. He plans to make his home for now in the Twin Cities area, where his children live.",
      "In 1998, a jury convicted Hooper of premeditated murder, felony murder while committing burglary and felony murder while committing kidnapping in connection with the death of 77-year-old Ann Prazniak. His conviction hinged largely on testimony from a woman who authorities say has since confessed to the crime.",
      "Police found Prazniak\u2019s body in April 1998 in a cardboard box wrapped with Christmas lights in a closet in her Minneapolis apartment \u2014 her ankles, nose, mouth, wrists and head bound and her body wrapped in garbage bags, blankets and bedding. Her cause of death was ruled asphyxiation, and she died two weeks to a month before police found her body, according to court documents.",
      "Hooper received three life sentences with the possibility of release after 30 years. In 2020, a judge granted his request to vacate two of three first-degree murder charges after he argued he was wrongly convicted and sentenced for three counts of first-degree murder against the same person.",

The school system would, however, be allowed to revert back to the \u201cThunderbirds\u201d name if the state regulation is repealed or overturned, the proposal states.",
      "Joseph Pierce, director of Native American studies at Stony Brook University on Long Island, said it remains to be seen how much the proposed new nickname actually changes the way people describe Connetquot and its teams.",
      "\u201cIn my view, this is a case where nobody really wins,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a shame that people are litigating over this, rather than understanding that Native American people, imagery, and symbols, including the Thunderbird, are not theirs to use.\u201d",

      "Philadelphia \u2014 Jalen Hurts rushed for two touchdowns for the Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles, who lost their hot-tempered star defender for spitting on Dak Prescott, then withstood a rare weather delay and needed a late stop to beat the Dallas Cowboys 24-20 early Friday in a wild start to the NFL season.",
      "With one last chance at a comeback, Prescott threw an incomplete pass on fourth-and-3 with 1:54 left to send what was left of a thinned out Eagles crowd into a frenzy.",
      "The game ended at 12:18 a.m.",
      "It was delayed 65 minutes because of lightning in the area. The Eagles led 24-20 with 4:44 left in the third quarter when the gamn was stopped - and that's the way it ended.",
      "Hurts wore out a defense without Micah Parsons on TD runs of 4 and 8 yards - no legal tush push needed. Saquon Barkley also ran for a 10-yard score, even if his final rushing total of 60 yards was minuscule compared to the last season, when he topped 2,000 yards.",
      "Hurts punctuated one score by chucking the ball into the stands and shrugging his shoulders much like his friend and mentor, Michael Jordan, who received a nice ovation when he was shown on the big screen.",
      "\"I think our discipline wasn't in it early in the game,\" Hurts said. \"Great job by our defense being able to battle and respond. Guys stepped in and filled those roles. We came into this game talking about discipline and focus, and we'll leave it saying the same things.\"",
      "Hurts, Barkley and the rest of the Eagles spent a pregame ceremony where the team raised their 2024 championship banner inside the locker room, per the wishes of coach Nick Sirianni.",
      "\"It's a new team. It's a new journey. We got tested tonight,\" Hurts said. \"We know how they are when Dak is back and they've got their crew all together. We've played better football, but it's always good to say that and find a way to win.\"",
      "Jalen Carter headed right back inside only moments after the banner was raised.",
      "Prescott and Carter exchanged words after the opening kickoff, and Carter spit on Prescott's jersey before backing away. Prescott quickly motioned to a nearby official who threw the flag and sent Carter packing. Fans booed as Carter walked off slowly, the standout defensive tackle holding his helmet in his hands behind his back.",
      "Carter could be headed toward a hefty financial penalty, if not worse, in the first major test of the NFL's increased emphasis this season on sportsmanship.",
      "The ejection was the quickest in a game since 2005, when former Eagles linebacker Jeremiah Trotter Sr. was ejected from the game for a pregame altercation prior to Philadelphia's season opener, notes CBSSports.com's Garrett Podell and Jeff Kerr.",
      "Still one of the NFL's nastiest division rivalries, the game was full of skirmishes and a near-costly unnecessary roughness penalty late in the third against the Eagles that put the Cowboys in position to take the lead.",
      "Dallas running back Miles Sanders, though, fumbled the ball at the 10 and the Super Bowl champions recovered. Prescott made a touchdown-saving diving tackle on cornerback Quinyon Mitchell on the play.",
      "It would be a while until the Eagles got the ball back, thanks to the delay.",
      "The scores by Hurts and Barkley made the Eagles the first defending Super Bowl champions to score touchdown on the first three drives of the season since Green Bay in 2011. Jake Elliott put the finishing touches on the scoring with a 58-yard field goal.",
      "Javonte Williams had a pair of 1-yard touchdown runs - the first on the opening driving after Carter was ejected - and Brandon Aubrey kicked field goals of 41 and 53 yards.",
      "Eagles offensive lineman Landon Dickerson left with a back injury.",

      "Ed said he was at the Philadelphia Eagles' public practice on Aug. 10 when he got a FaceTime from the newly engaged couple. He told \"The Jimmy & Nath Show\" that Travis had planned to propose next weekend.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bill-belichick-college-coaching-debut-north-carolina-pummeled-tcu/",
    "published": "Tue, 02 Sep 2025 05:07:00 -0400",
    "summary": "North Carolina was pummeled by TCU, 48-14, in the college coaching debut of NFL coaching legend Bill Belichick.",
    "story": [
      "Chapel Hill, N.C. \u2014 North Carolina's high-point moment in its first game under coach Bill Belichick came early.",
      "A festive pregame atmosphere led to a roar from the crowd at kickoff. And a season-opening drive moved at a crisp pace to the end zone.",
      "After that, well, Monday night's hyped-up debut turned into a romp by TCU - along with a reminder that even an NFL icon with six Super Bowl titles as a head coach can't just magically turn the Tar Heels into winners after decades of also-ran status.",
      "\"We played competitively but then just couldn't sustain it,\" Belichick said in the familiar low tone from his NFL news conferences after the 48-14 loss. \"Obviously, we have a lot of work to do. We need to do a better job all the way around \u2014 coaching, playing, all three phases of the game.\"",
      "CBSSports.com's Shehan Jeyarajah points out\u00a0that, \"The NFL is generally a defensive league where teams are close to evenly matched. At the college level, Belichick will come to understand just how big the talent differentials are between the good and bad teams \u2014 and he was on the wrong end.\"",
      "The blowout put a major damper on a night buzzing with optimism for the 73-year-old Belichick's college debut, only to see the Horned Frogs dominate so thoroughly they drove UNC fans to the Kenan Stadium exits by midway through the third quarter.",
      "\"It was a great environment tonight,\" Belichick said. \"I mean, the fans were awesome. There was great energy in the stadium. We just didn't do enough to keep it going. We've got to play better for the energy to be sustainable.\"",
      "By the end of the game, Kenan was a ghost town and the Tar Heels had given up more points than in any previous opener in their history, according to Sportradar.",
      "It was a jarring result, even amid uncertainty as to exactly what to expect from UNC with roughly 70 new players between transfers and incoming recruits. There were few highlights after that opening drive beyond Kaleb Cost's athletic reeling in of a deflected ball for an interception and quarterback Max Johnson returning in relief from a serious leg injury sustained in last year's opener at Minnesota.",
      "\"We're just moving forward, just moving forward,\" said Cost, offering an unintentional callback to Belichick's famous \"We're on to Cincinnati\" response to reporters' questions after a blowout loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in 2014.",
      "UNC was picked to finish eighth in the 17-team Atlantic Coast Conference, though that seemed almost entirely predicated on Belichick's mere presence. This is a man, after all, who teamed with legendary quarterback Tom Brady to win six world titles in his 24-year run with the New England Patriots. Someone who won more regular-season and playoff games in the NFL (333) than anyone other than Don Shula.",
      "So there was spectacle to Belichick's debut as he took the field sporting a familiar look from the pro sideline with a gray hoodie - only this one bearing the name \"Carolina Football\" in that distinctive shade of light blue.",
      "An estimated 5,000 fans packed onto a main campus quad for a pregame concert and throngs lined the team's walk to Kenan, where UNC has sold out all its season tickets \u2014 at an elevated price with Belichick's arrival \u2014 and single-game seats for the season. The game attracted ESPN to hold a pregame studio show from the sideline with a crew that included former Alabama coach Nick Saban, with Belichick popping over briefly to say hello.",
      "There were notable former UNC athletes from years past, including NBA legend Michael Jordan \u2014 who won a national championship under Dean Smith here in 1982 \u2014 and former UNC star linebacker Lawrence Taylor, who played under Belichick when he was an assistant and eventually defensive coordinator with the New York Giants during the 1980s.",
      "And it wasn't hard to spot Jordon Hudson \u2014 Belichick's 24-year-old girlfriend who has generated her own tabloid-level curiosity \u2014 as she walked the pregame sideline sporting Carolina blue pants shimmering with sequins-like additions on the legs.",
      "Belichick roamed the field during pregame warmups for the better part of a half-hour. At one point, he stood on the UNC end of the field with general manager Michael Lombardi, then shared a quick handshake with ACC commissioner Jim Phillips as he made his way toward midfield.",
      "Once there, Belichick shook hands with members of the officiating crew and watched the Horned Frogs warm up.",
      "The Tar Heels got off to a sprint of a start with an 83-yard drive that ended with Caleb Hood scoring through the right side from 8 yards out, followed by forcing a quick punt. But things soon started getting away.",
      "TCU \u2014 which lost in a similar scenario as the \"other\" team in Deion Sanders' debut at Colorado two years ago \u2014 never looked rattled or thrown. Bud Clark provided a highlight by jumping Gio Lopez's sideline throw for an easy 25-yard pick-six as TCU took a 20-7 lead into the break.",
      "It quickly got worse after halftime. Kevorian Barnes sprinted through the right side and down the sideline for a 75-yard touchdown on the first snap. Trent Battle added his own big run, slipping through the left side untouched and going 28 yards for a TD.",
      "And finally, Devean Deal had a 37-yard scoop-and-score on Lopez's fumble to make it 41-7 and start the Kenan exodus.",
      "By the end, UNC had just 222 total yards, 320 fewer than TCU, and a short week to fix problems before visiting Charlotte on Saturday.",
      "\"They were clearly the better team tonight,\" Belichick said. \"They deserved to win and they did it decisively.\"",

      "Prime Video's hit romance series has captivated audiences as it follows Isabel \"Belly\" Conklin who finds herself in a love triangle with brothers Jeremiah and Conrad Fisher competing for her attention. Passionate fans have broken off into two dueling camps: #TeamJeremiah versus #TeamConrad. And they're taking to social media to battle over which love interest should ultimately win Belly's heart.",
      "But some of these so-called fans are turning on the actors themselves.",
      "Last month, actors Christopher Briney (Conrad) and Gavin Casalegno (Jeremiah) told \"CBS Mornings\" they often have to remind fans that they're just playing a role.",
      "\"It's a story that people can relate to and love. Yeah, we're just grateful that people are passionate about the story we're telling,\" Casalegno said. Briney added, \"You root for both of these characters at times.\"",
      "Lola Tung, who plays Belly, also admitted the rivalry gets a bit too intense at times.",
      "\"When people have an attachment to the characters, they want to see it come together at the end. I'm so grateful that they care so much, but people get a little scary about it. Please don't threaten to kill someone if something doesn't go your way \u2014 I promise you, it's not that serious,\" she told Teen Vogue.",
      "\"There is a line between fiction and reality\"",
      "Last week, Prime Video launched a social media campaign called, \"The Summer We Started Acting Normal Online,\" urging viewers to keep the conversation kind and highlighted its zero tolerance policy for bullying and hate speech.",

      "\"There is a line between fiction and reality. And I feel as if these lines are becoming really blurred when people are projecting their anger, their hatred, their harassment and resentment onto fictional characters,\" she said.",
      "Varma said this indicates that there is perhaps a \"deep void in our society right now\" with people longing for human connection.",
      "She explained these fan behaviors are a sign of a psychological phenomenon known as parasocial relationships \u2013 or one-sided bonds with media figures. Varma adds the anonymity of social media emboldens fans to exhibit bad behavior.",

    "summary": "One of the founding members of Creedence Clearwater Revival lost control of his own songs when the band broke up in the early 1970s. Now, after buying back rights to his Creedence catalog, John Fogerty has come back to his music, recording the album \"Legacy.\"",
    "story": [
      "\"It was life and death,\" said musician John Fogerty. \"I used to tell myself that phrase: 'This is life and death.' You're against the whole world.\"",
      "He felt that as a young man: \"Yes, oh yes. I mean, there's a million records out there. It's me against everybody that's every recorded and ever will record. You've got to do a great job. It was either be great, or go home!\"",
      "You know how it turned out for Fogerty. \"Great\" is something of an understatement. That voice \u2026 that guitar \u2026 and those songs, so many of which became hits that are now classics. But Fogerty, who recently turned 80, says every time he steps up to the mic, he still has something to prove \u2013 and still feel a little nerve. \"Oh yeah, yeah, every time!\" he laughed. \"But I think the nerves is what gives you the edge.",
      "I asked, \"How do you do that? What's the magic there?\"",
      "\"I wish I had a really great, contrived answer for you, but I don't!\" he laughed.",
      "The answer seems quite simple when you watch Fogerty rehearse. There is love of craft, and love of family. (His sons, Shane and Tyler Fogerty, help lead his touring band.)",
      "The group that put Fogerty on the charts was Creedence Clearwater Revival, which got its start in the late 1950s. Though a native of Northern California, Fogerty soaked up the rhythms of the South, giving birth to his so-called \"swamp rock\" sound, which he honed in the mid-'60s.",
      "He recalled: \"I received my honorable discharge from the Army. And the first line I wrote was, 'Left a good job in the city, workin' for the man every night and day.' Well, of course that was the Army. I mean, it had just happened. But as I begin to strum, I started singing this phrase: 'Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river.' And at that point I'm, Well, what is this song? What is this? And I went to this songbook that I had just started keeping, and on the very first page, the very first entry, I had written the words 'Proud Mary.'",
      "\"And I actually understood right then that I'd written a classic song, a really great, American song,\" he said. \"And a few moments later, 'Oh my God. What if I never get to do this again? What if this is the only one that ever happens, and I'm a one-hit wonder?'\"",
      "Turns out, Fogerty was anything but that. Yet, after the 1972 breakup of Creedence, his solo career became mired in legal battles. He was stunned to discover he no longer had control over the use of the songs he wrote \u2013 and a limited share of the profits.",
      "Fogerty has looked on as others have endured similar challenges, and pain. The most famous current example: Taylor Swift, who earlier this year purchased the rights to her compositions, and won back control of her music.",
      "I asked, \"If you could pull her aside, John, and give her a piece of advice about how to get over the pain of a fight over your own music, what would you tell her?\"",
      "\"Well, I don't think you get over that kind of fight,\" he replied. \"What happened to me is, I stopped touring, and I stopped singing my own songs. I don't recommend that move to anybody. You become invisible. You're just forgotten about. It's like you died.\"",
      "I asked Julie, his wife of 34 years, if she ever doubted that he would be able to pull himself out of that anger. \"I think it was more sadness than anger,\" she said. \"And all he ever wanted to do in life was make music. That was his love. That was his best friend. And having that taken away and turned so bad was really hard for me to understand.\"",
      "Fogerty gives Julie credit for turning his life around. And she encouraged him not only to buy back the rights to his Creedence catalog, but to re-record those songs with his sons.\u00a0 The result: a new album, \"Legacy: The Creedence Clearwater Revival Years (John's Version).\"",
      "Julie said, \"Having those songs and being able to put his fist in the air and go, 'I own those songs,' I couldn't think of a better gift than having him record these with friends and family.\"",
      "You can stream John Fogerty's album \"Legacy: The Creedence Clearwater Revival Years (John's Version)\" by clicking on the embed below (Free Spotify registration required to hear the tracks in full):",
      "Since they were children, sons Shane and Tyler learned guitar from their father.\u00a0 The new album is a family affair, but it's also serious business. \"I have the feeling that somehow Julie knew, she knew that at some point, the life-and-death John would kick in and I would have to roll up my sleeves,\" Fogerty said. \"'Cause that's what happened. And literally, this was kind of when the record was done, I think she told me, she said she could see me going back in time. With each one of these tracks, especially when I was doing the lead vocal, I had to remember what I felt like when I sang it the first time.\"",
      "And what a time it has been. For John Fogerty, the highs and lows have landed him here: at peace with it all, and lucky enough to have his songs still playing.",
      "I asked, \"What's it like for you to hear your music everywhere, even now?\"",
      "\"I don't know the exact right words; I can almost not believe it actually happened, or that that was me,\" he said. \"It's a prideful thing. I think it makes you feel really happy that you are able to tune into the radio station that God delivers, you know, and receive a song like 'Proud Mary,' and write it down, and even take credit for it, right? And then have it go around the world like that? It's kind of too much to really be able to grab hold of.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 31 Aug 2025 09:40:22 -0400",
    "summary": "A master of figurative art is now focused on the work of other artists, gifting a collection of more than 100 paintings by emerging and established artists to Maine's Portland Museum of Art.",
    "story": [
      "When Alex Katz began painting more than 75 years ago, he ignored what was popular then, to pursue his passion: figurative art. \"Most people didn't like my work,\" he said. \"It was figurative, and everyone was abstract, and everything was pop art. But a lotta people didn't like it.\"",
      "But he says he didn't care that much what they thought: \"If they liked it, swell. And if they didn't like it, go to hell.\"",
      "Katz depicts recognizable figures and objects from the real world. Using unfussy backgrounds and large areas of color, he emphasizes shapes and outlines, and paints massive pieces, often with his wife, Ada, as his subject. \"I did the figures on a flat ground,\" he said. \"I did the double portraits of Ada. I did the big heads before anyone. And that's really aggressive. And the big compositions. No one had done anything like it.\"",
      "Katz grew up in Queens, New York, and attended the Skowhegan School of Painting & Sculpture in Maine. He's been honing his technique ever since.",
      "In 1986, \"Sunday Morning\" documented his artistic process:",
      "These days, the art world has caught up to Alex Katz's talent. His paintings can sell for millions of dollars, and exhibitions around the world have highlighted his work, including a show in 2022 at New York's Guggenheim Museum.",
      "Now famed for his portraits, Katz is also highly-regarded for his landscapes, often inspired by the picturesque scenes near his summer studio in Maine. \"It's a long way from Queens,\" he said, \"but it is like Queens. It's all kinda small!\"",
      "Katz says painting the outdoors heightened his creativity: \"I thought I was connecting with outdoor painting, but actually I was connecting with myself,\" he said. \"The painting was no longer cerebral. It was coming from the inside.\"",
      "This summer, Katz turned 98, and after a lifetime painting, he's focused on the work of other artists. He gifted a collection of more than a hundred paintings by emerging and established artists to Maine's Portland Museum of Art.",
      "\"As the art world has moved in different ways and fashions, Alex has always stayed true to his self,\" said museum director Mark Bessire. \"I see his love of artists taking chance and his love of artists emanating that sense of energy that he likes in a painting. He doesn't like a painting because it looks like his or it's figurative. He likes it 'cause it's got the energy, and it pops.\"",
      "The exhibit is called \"Painting Energy.\"",
      "Asked to describe the sensation of looking at some of those paintings, Katz replied, \"It's just like a pow! You get it right through the air. It's very quick. Sometimes you can get a whole show \u2013 as they open the elevator door, blink, and they shut it, you know what this painting's about.\"",
      "One painting that gave Katz that \"pow\" was Katherine Bradford's \"Shadows.\"",
      "Bradford said that when she learned Katz had bought one of her paintings, \"I just felt, 'Oh, wow! Maybe I am a little good!' And Alex Katz, he certainly is really good. Good eye, good person.\"",
      "Bradford didn't start painting until her 30s. Now she's 83, and her pieces typically sell for tens of thousands of dollars. \"Alex Katz is a leader in contemporary art,\" she said. \"But in the state of Maine, he's king. And we all look up to him. He decided to use what he had gained to give back to artists, to buy artists' work.\"",
      "Asked why he wanted to collect other artists' paintings, Katz said, \"Well, I wanted to help other people who went through the same difficulty that I did, you know? I know every little help I got in that period from 25-35, I really appreciated.\"",
      "Like when a paint manufacturer who recognized Katz's talent early on gave him art supplies as part of a deal: \"He got five or six little paintings, and I had free paints,\" said Katz. \"But the big thing was someone believed there was something in me.\"",
      "Katz still works seven days a week, and is still taking risks. \"Sometime, in about a week, I'll do the first painting of a new series,\" he said.",
      "\"And you seem excited about that?\" I asked.",
      "\"Excited and frightened,\" he laughed. \"Yeah, I'm scared it really won't work out.\"",
      "\"So, after all that you've accomplished, you still worry?\"",
      "\"Uh-huh. I want to go where I'm scared. And the new things might be better, they might be worse, but I have to do 'em.\"",

      "Susan Monarez was fired from the position less than a month after her Senate confirmation. In an opinion piece\u00a0in the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, Monarez said that Kennedy \"pressured me to resign or face termination\" in an Aug. 25 meeting.",
      "\"One of the troubling directives from that meeting more than a week ago: I was told to preapprove the recommendations of a vaccine advisory panel newly filled with people who have publicly expressed antivaccine rhetoric,\" she wrote.",
      "The piece was published shortly before Kennedy testified before the Senate Finance Committee, where he faced tough questioning about his vaccine policies.",
      "\"I did not say that to her,\" Kennedy told Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon. \"I never had a private meeting with her. Other witnesses to every meeting that we have, and all those witnesses will say, I never said that.\"",
      "\"So she's lying today to the American people in the Wall Street Journal?\" Wyden asked.",
      "\"Yes, sir,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Later, Kennedy told Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia that he did not demand Monarez accept the recommendations of the panel without further review from career scientists at the CDC.",
      "\"I told her I didn't want her to have a rule that she's not going to sign onto it,\" Kennedy said when asked whether he told Monarez to accept the recommendations.",
      "At another point in the hearing, Kennedy claimed he asked Monarez to resign \"because I asked her, 'Are you a trustworthy person?' and she said no.\"",
      "In a statement Thursday afternoon, lawyers for Monarez said Kennedy's claims were \"false, and at times, patently ridiculous.\"",
      "\"Dr. Monarez stands by what she said in her op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, would repeat it all under oath and continues to support the vision she outlined at her confirmation hearing that science will control her decisions,\" attorneys Mark Zaid and Abbe Lowell said.",
      "In June, Kennedy removed every member of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, a government panel that makes vaccine recommendations. At the time, he asserted that it \"has become little more than a rubber stamp for any vaccine.\" He then named several members to the panel, including vaccine skeptics, circumventing the usual CDC practice for selecting medical and public health experts.",
      "The newly constituted ACIP is set to meet later this month to consider vaccine recommendations. In her op-ed, Monarez wrote that \"[i]t is imperative that the panel's recommendations aren't rubber-stamped but instead are rigorously and scientifically reviewed before being accepted or rejected.\"",

    "summary": "A large group of current and former HHS staffers are pushing for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to either resign or be fired, after weeks of tumult at the health agency.",
    "story": [
      "More than 1,000 current and former Health and Human Services employees penned an open letter Wednesday calling for HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to either resign or be fired.",
      "The letter \u2014 whose signatories were not publicly named \u2014 was released at a tense time for the health agency. Last week, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Susan Monarez was fired, and several other top CDC officials resigned from their jobs in protest. Staff are also reeling from layoffs, changes to the vaccine approval system \u2014 led by Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic \u2014 and a shooting outside the CDC headquarters last month.",
      "Wednesday's letter accused Kennedy of \"endangering the nation's health.\" It cited last week's upheaval at the CDC, the Food and Drug Administration's decision to rescind emergency approvals that made the COVID-19 vaccines available for young children, and the elevation of \"political ideologues who pose as scientific experts\" to key vaccine approval posts.",
      "It called for Kennedy to resign, and said that if he declines to leave his post voluntarily, President Trump should pick a new HHS secretary.",
      "\"We swore an oath to support and defend the United States Constitution and to serve the American people. Our oath requires us to speak out when the Constitution is violated and the American people are put at risk,\" the letter reads.",
      "The letter was released by a group called Save HHS, which penned a similar open letter last month urging Kennedy to \"stop spreading inaccurate health information.\"",
      "The group said the signatories for Wednesday's letter were provided to members of Congress, but weren't publicly listed due to security and privacy concerns.",
      "HHS Communications Director Andrew Nixon responded to the letter by defending Kennedy's record and arguing he is working to restore trust in a \"broken\" CDC.",
      "\"From his first day in office, he pledged to check his assumptions at the door \u2014 and he asked every HHS colleague to do the same,\" Nixon said. \"That commitment to evidence-based science is why, in just seven months, he and the HHS team have accomplished more than any health secretary in history in the fight to end the chronic disease epidemic and Make America Healthy Again.\"",
      "Separately, nine former CDC directors wrote a New York Times op-ed on Monday that castigated Kennedy for making decisions they said were \"unlike anything we had ever seen at the agency,\" and argued Monarez's firing \"adds considerable fuel to this raging fire.\"",
      "Kennedy is set to testify before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday morning, where he's likely to face questions about the tumult at HHS.",
      "Last week, the White House confirmed that Monarez was fired. Her lawyers called the firing \"legally deficient\" and said she was \"targeted\" because she \"refused to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated public health experts.\"",
      "At least four other senior CDC leaders also stepped down last week, in some cases penning resignation letters that decried cuts to the CDC, accused the Trump administration of an \"ongoing weaponizing of public health\" and blasted \"misinformation\" about vaccines.",
      "Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a physician who chairs the Senate health committee, said the resignations will \"require oversight.\" He also sits on the Senate Finance Committee.",
      "Meanwhile, Kennedy ousted every member of a CDC panel responsible for making vaccine recommendations earlier this year, in some cases replacing them with people who have questioned the safety of vaccines.",
      "And last week, the FDA only authorized a set of updated COVID-19 vaccines for younger adults and children with preexisting health conditions, in addition to all seniors.",

      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Jane Pauley's interview with Dr. Gupta on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" August 31!",
      "\"It Doesn't Have to Hurt: Your Smart Guide to a Pain-Free Life\" by Dr. Sanjay Gupta",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Over a hundred years ago, William Osler, the Canadian physician and founding influence on modern medicine and medical education, is said to have instructed his students to \"listen to the patient. Quite often he is telling you the diagnosis.\"",
      "Today, the urgent search for meaningful insights into chronic pain has given that idea a new relevance, with impressive results. Health care providers now encourage patients to engage as partners in the treatment process. Research programs now routinely include people with lived experience\u2014patients, family members, caregivers\u2014as members of committees that advise and direct pain studies.",
      "Pain scientists are calling for a dramatic change that puts greater emphasis on the studies that draw first from people's real-life pain experience, then follows up with lab-based research to develop targeted solutions for effective pain management. This reverse translational research flips the classic bench-to-bedside process that starts in a laboratory and ends with a clinical trial.",
      "Reverse translational research begins with the patient's real-world experience and then tries to decipher the mechanisms through brain imaging and blood tests, correlated with the patient's symptoms and self-reports. Instead of the bench to the bedside, which was taught when I was in medical school, this is bedside to the bench research. The bench scientists then work with the findings to learn more about the basic mechanisms.",
      "Prasad Shirvalkar, a pain physician, neuroscientist, and the director of the Shirvalkar Lab at the University of California at San Francisco, used such a hybrid approach a couple of years ago to find the unicorn in pain science: objective biomarkers of a subjective experience. He started by implanting electrodes in the brains of patients, to measure brain signals. He then followed the trial participants home and, with the use of continuous surveys and digital monitoring, tracked their pain through everyday life and correlated those results with direct readings from the brain. The combination of lab-based and home-based monitoring led to a groundbreaking series of clinical trials that made headlines around the world. In 2023, his team was able to directly map signals of chronic pain for the first time in history. In more recent trials, the team used electrodes implanted in the brain to map the unique neural signature of each participant's pain experience over thousands of hours. The result was the ability, for the first time, to create an objective measure of an individual patient's subjective pain experiences.",
      "In a more recent and ongoing trial, the maps and electrodes were used to predict a pain burst, which was followed by the delivery of a carefully calibrated electrical impulse\u2014deep brain stimulation (DBS) to interrupt the pain, reducing or even eliminating it altogether. Predicting when pain might occur, objectively measuring its severity, and then quickly inhibiting it is in many ways the ultimate achievement.",
      "Ed Mowery's story is about someone using this remarkable treatment approach, but first a caveat. It's not currently available, or even feasible, for general use, so it can't deliver on the dream of a cure for chronic pain. But it does deliver evidence that pain circuitry in the brain is measurable and malleable. It can be targeted and treated, and we'll likely see the emergence of a range of approaches that can do so without brain surgery.",

    "summary": "Jane Pauley talks with the author of \"It Doesn't Have to Hurt\" about the body's defenses against pain; and with Ed Mowery, whose decades-long experience with pain led to a revolutionary surgery and treatment.",
    "story": [
      "Ed Mowery, the founder and lead singer of a death metal band, suffered unfathomable pain for decades: \"It was 24/7, 365,\" he said, likening it to \"lightning bolt razor snakes in my legs and nerve pain in my arms.",
      "\"Have you ever had a really bad burn when you're cooking? Imagine that really bad burn, multiply it by, say, 20 to 30, and then apply it from the neck down. And on top of that burn was the lightning bolt razor snakes in my legs and the crazy nerve burn in my arms. So, it was several different kinds of pain at once.\"",
      "It's a rare condition affecting 200,000 people in the U.S., called complex regional pain syndrome, or CRPS. But doctors could find no cause for it.",
      "\"There was nothing to point to and says, 'This is why it's hurting.' It was just a sort of unrelenting pain,\" said Dr. Sanjay Gupta, best known as chief medical correspondent at CNN. A neurosurgeon and author, his latest book, \"It Doesn't Have to Hurt,\" explores the mystery of pain \u2013 mundane aches and pains, or excruciating pain like Mowery suffered.",
      "A lot of Americans are hurting; the CDC says approximately 20% are in pain. And while writing the book, Gupta found one of them was his mother \u2013 83-year-old Damyanti Gupta, who had a fall right outside her front door.",
      "\"I had osteoporosis,\" she said, \"and I think one of my bones must have given up, I think, because I didn't trip over anything.\"",
      "Imaging showed a compressed lumbar vertebra. But pain doesn't appear on X-rays and MRIs.\u00a0 \"You know how they ask you, doctors tell me, 'From a scale of one to 10, what is your pain?' I would've said 100,\" Damyanti said. \"You don't really realize 'til you have it. I never realized that pain can be that terrible. You don't want to even live anymore.\"",
      "\"I don't want to live anymore \u2013 coming from my mom, obviously it's really painful to hear,\" said Dr. Gupta. \"But also this was someone who'd never complained about anything. So, you had a sense of just how significant an impact this was on her.\"",
      "Spinal surgery successfully repaired the injured spine, and immediately Damyanti's pain went from 100 to about 3.",
      "The surprising source of pain",
      "As a brain surgeon, Gupta sees patients in pain every day, but he personally experienced serious pain when he was a kid who thought he could vault over a spiked fence. \"I don't know what I was thinking,\" he said. \"But I didn't make it. And this spike from the fence went right through the back of my skin on the side, and came right out the front. So, I was essentially pinned and impaled on top of this fence.\"",
      "As the shock wore off, the future doctor \u2013 still on the fence \u2013 took note: \"The pain started to come in waves. So it was there, felt like someone was sort of slapping my back, but then after a while it just didn't hurt that much anymore. And there was a couple of times when I had to reach back around and say, 'It's still there, right?' Even at the time, that struck me as a really surprising experience. Like, I had a hot poker thing going through my back, and yet I'm not feeling pain? Like, why would that be?\"",
      "Later, he learned the reason why. \"It took years to sort of understand this,\" he said. \"My body's endogenous opioid system \u2013 we have our own opioid system \u2013 it reacted, and it reacted in a big, big way. Because the body is just flooded with all these opioids and it improves my mood, it decreases my memory of the painful experience, and obviously it helps with the overall hurt.",
      "\"These are endorphins, and by the way, endorphins \u2013 endo, which means comes from your body, and phin, morphine\u2014so it's like your body's own natural morphine,\" he said.",
      "After years of suffering despite pain medication (including morphine), Ed Mowery joined a clinical trial at the University of California at San Francisco, which not only found the source of those \"lightning bolt razor snakes,\" but would make headlines around the world.",
      "Treating Chronic Pain Is Hard. An Experimental Approach Shows Promise (New York Times)",
      "Treating Chronic Pain Is Hard. An Experimental Approach Shows Promise (New York Times)",
      "The source of the pain, said Gupta, was \"the brain. It's hard to conceptualize, I realize this. But Ed is sort of this daredevil guy. He had a lot of injuries over his life. He had had a knee operation, and it was after that knee operation that, for some reason, his brain had taken the experience of his knee surgery and started to memorize it, and got it a little bit wrong. So instead of saying, 'Hey, your knee hurts,' it just went into this hyper-drive. The best metaphor would be something known as 'phantom pain.' That's when someone loses a limb and then they still hurt, even though that limb doesn't even exist anymore. How can that happen? The brain. The brain is creating that pain. Why that's happening exactly, we're not sure.\"",
      "\"Shutting off\" the pain",
      "Mowery had volunteered for a study in deep brain stimulation and pain, and three rounds of brain surgery. \"I had nodes sticking out of my head,\" Mowery said. \"And I had 144 wires going to two computers. And I had a turban on my head. And I also had a lot more hair!\"",
      "Gupta said, \"After weeks they were able to draw this link between Ed's pain and these changes in the brain. And what they found with Ed was not only could they start to predict that Ed was gonna have pain, they could quantify how bad that pain was likely to be, and they could even interrupt the pain by giving a little stimulation. So even before the pain would get to conscious awareness, the stimulator would go off and it would start to interrupt that pain cycle.\"",
      "Gupta predicts Mowery's story is just the beginning: \"What these doctors were able to do, they were essentially able to put these probes all over the brain and just leave these probes in sort of to listen to Ed's brain.\"",
      "Even now, a computer can recognize his pain coming on \u2013 and shut it off.",
      "It's been life-changing for Mowery, who spoke about the clinical trial at the National Institutes of Health: \"The last two days of testing, the signal started working, and killing my pain,\" he said. \"I was beside myself.\"",
      "Though a small study, the implications for managing all sorts of pain are far-reaching. \u00a0As Gupta explains, the brain is the source of every sensation of pain, from a paper cut, to a broken vertebra, to \"razor snakes.\"",
      "I asked Mowery, \"Did you know when you signed up for this, what you were signing up for?\"",
      "\"It's funny you ask that question, because when I first found out, I said, 'There's no way. I'm not doing three brain surgeries. You're not going into my brain. No way,\" Mowery said. \"And then a year-and-a-half later, I was in so much pain, I just didn't care anymore.\"",
      "\"You seem very comfortable when you describe this as your brain,\" I said.",
      "\"It took me a while to wrap my brain around the fact that this is a brain disease,\" Mowery replied. \"It took a long time for me to just say, oh, you know, this is actually all in my head. But it wasn't imaginary. It was real.\"",
      "Today, Mowery is playing his music again, and looking forward to touring internationally with his band. \"I never lost hope,\" he said, \"because I knew something would come along to help me. And I think that's part of what got me through all this, was my attitude towards the whole thing.\"",

      "The award comes just six months after a Delaware judge ordered the company to revoke his\u00a0$56 billion pay package\u00a0from 2018.",
      "Musk appealed the order in March. A month later, Tesla said in a regulatory filing that it was\u00a0creating\u00a0a special committee to look at Musk's compensation as CEO. Creating this new compensation will ensure Musk stays as CEO of Tesla for next several years and alleviate some Tesla shareholder concerns, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.",
      "\"We believe this grant will now keep Musk as CEO of Tesla at least until 2030 and removes an overhang on the stock,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a research note. The grant will motivate Musk to lead the company through an \"inflection point,\" as Tesla transitions to an AI-first company, he added.",
      "Equal to 2018 pay package",
      "The electric vehicle maker said in a regulatory filing on Monday that Musk must first pay Tesla $23.34 per share of restricted stock that vests, which is equal to the exercise price per share of the 2018 pay package that was awarded to the company's CEO.",
      "After that pay package was initially approved, a Tesla stockholder challenged it in a lawsuit, leading to a legal showdown.",
      "In a December\u00a02024 ruling, Delaware Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick reaffirmed an earlier ruling that Tesla must revoke Musk's multibillion-dollar pay package. She found that Musk engineered the landmark pay package in\u00a0sham negotiations\u00a0with directors who were not independent.",
      "At the time McCormick also rejected an equally unprecedented and massive\u00a0fee request by plaintiff attorneys, who argued that they were entitled to legal fees in the form of Tesla stock valued at more than $5 billion. The judge said the attorneys were entitled to a fee award of $345 million.",
      "According to the regulatory filing, if the Delaware courts reinstate Musk's 2018 pay package, the $29 billion award would be \"immediately forfeited and returned to the Company.\"",
      "Tesla stock troubles",
      "Tesla shares have plunged 25% this year, largely due to blowback over Musk's affiliation with President Donald Trump. But Tesla also faces intensifying competition from both the big Detroit automakers, and from China.",
      "In its most recent quarter, Tesla reported that quarterly profits plunged from $1.39 billion to $409 million. Revenue also plummeted and the company fell short of even lowered expectations on Wall Street.",
      "Under pressure from shareholders last month, Tesla scheduled an annual shareholders meeting for November to comply with Texas state law.",
      "A group of more than 20 Tesla shareholders, which have watched Tesla shares plummet, said in a letter to the company that it needed to at least provide public notice of the annual meeting.",
      "Investors have grown increasingly worried about the trajectory of the company after Musk had spent so much time in Washington this year, becoming one of the most prominent officials in the Trump administration as the head of the Department of Government Government Efficiency, or DOGE, overseeing mass federal layoffs.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariffs-refunds-court-ruling-business-refunds/",
    "published": "Thu, 04 Sep 2025 15:01:21 -0400",
    "summary": "The U.S. government could have to refund domestic businesses billions in tariffs, should the Supreme Court uphold a recent federal appeals court ruling.",
    "story": [
      "American businesses could be owed tens of billions of dollars in refunds for tariffs they paid on foreign goods.",
      "U.S. Customs and Border Protection has collected more than $200 billion in tariff revenue from American businesses of all sizes from October through August 24, according to agency data. Of that, more than $70 billion comes from payments of country-based tariffs that\u00a0a federal appeals court recently ruled\u00a0President Trump lacked the authority to impose.",
      "Industry-specific tariffs, such as steel and aluminum levies, are unaffected by Friday's ruling.",
      "The court on Friday ruled that President Trump unlawfully invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to impose sweeping tariffs of up to 145% on dozens of U.S. trade partners. Mr. Trump on Wednesday asked the Supreme Court to review the federal appeals court's decision before it takes effect on Oct. 14.",
      "Mr. Trump's appeal means that, for now, there's no guarantee businesses will receive refunds. That spells more uncertainty for enterprises struggling to balance raising prices to cover the cost of levies against potentially turning away customers, according to supply chain experts.",
      "\"From the supply chain perspective, we are seeing a lot of uncertainty, which has been the case since April 2,\" Scott Pruneau, CEO of ITS Logistics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"No one knows how to price their goods, because you can't whipsaw your customers on pricing.\"",
      "If the court's decision stands, the U.S. government could have to return billions in tariff revenue it has collected from businesses.",
      "\"It'd be very challenging\"",
      "But even if the Supreme Court strikes down the tariffs, businesses could still face hurdles in collecting refunds for the levies they've already paid the U.S. government, experts told CBS MoneyWatch. For one, there is no guarantee that whatever kind of refund system the government sets up would be automatic or that the process will be simple.",
      "\"There's been speculation that if ultimately, the Supreme Court overturns the tariffs, then Customs could just issue refunds, but I don't know that it's going to happen that way,\" Felicia Pullam, former executive director of the Office of Trade Relations at U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and the current senior director for geo-commerce at APCO, a global advisory firm, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The easiest way would be for Customs to put a process in place and issue refunds, rather than make companies go and apply,\" she added.",
      "Ultimately, however, if refunds are owed, it would be up to the Trump administration to decide how to administer them. \"It'd be very challenging, but I am confident CBP could handle it.\"",
      "U.S. Customs and Border Protection didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "Requests for refunds",
      "Ted Murphy, co-leader of Sidley Austin's global arbitration, trade and advocacy practice, told CBS MoneyWatch that if the Supreme Court affirms the federal circuit court's ruling that Trump's reliance on IEEPA to impose country-based tariffs was illegal, the government would have to cease collecting tariffs from companies.",
      "When it comes to recouping levies that have already been paid, there are three ways refunds could be administered, Murphy said.",
      "Most simply, the government could provide automatic refunds to businesses for levy amounts paid. \"The government has that information, so it could happen automatically,\" Murphy told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I don't think that's particularly likely, but it is an option.\"",
      "The government could instead decide that only the plaintiffs who filed suit against the tariffs are entitled to refunds, and require additional parties seeking refunds to bring similar legal actions. \"In that case, you'd see tens and tens of thousands of people filing complaints at the Court of International Trade,\" he said.",
      "But the most likely repayment option in Murphy's view would be that the government agrees to refund duties paid by parties who submit requests for reimbursement.",
      "Historical precedent for refunds",
      "There's precedent for the government reimbursing businesses for tariff payments that were later deemed unlawful. In 1998, the Supreme Court struck down a harbor maintenance tax assessed on exports, which had been imposed by the Reagan administration. The government then owed companies more than a billion dollars in refunds, which it required companies to apply for in order to receive.",
      "Dan Anthony, president of Trade Partnership Worldwide, a trade consultancy, echoed Murphy, saying that it is hard to predict how the government might choose to process refunds, should the Supreme Court determine they are owed.",
      "\"It's up to the administration to decide, and that's where it gets very complicated and speculative,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Technically speaking, issuing refunds wouldn't be hard. \"Theoretically, the government could quite quickly figure out who paid what, and refund it to the payer,\" he said. \"But the government could also make it very difficult and force people to make requests.\"",
      "That would create work for companies, but also for the government, which would then have to review requests for refunds from thousands of companies. \"That's infinitely more work for the government, but it's pretty clear the government does not want to give money back, so if you make it a difficult process, then a number of importers are probably not going to pursue it,\" Anthony said.",
      "Large refunds to businesses could weigh on the Treasury's finances, TD Securities analysts noted in a report Thursday. \"Treasury would likely step up bill supply even further to obtain the extra funds, creating little disruption in longer-dated yields, but potentially pressuring funding spreads,\" TD Securities analysts said.",
      "The Trump administration could also turn to other emergency powers to replace the IEEPA tariffs in order to maintain the U.S.' effective tariff rate, the analysts noted.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Treasury immediately responded to a request for comment.",

      "The Florida company confirmed to CBS News on Thursday that it would exit the following markets on Oct. 2: Albuquerque, New Mexico; Birmingham, Alabama; Boise, Idaho; Chattanooga, Tennessee; Oakland, California; Columbia, South Carolina; Portland, Oregon; Sacramento, California; Salt Lake City, Utah; San Diego, California; and San Jose, California. The airline also said it is nixing plans to launch service in Macon, Georgia, which was slated for Oct. 16.",
      "Spirit serves dozens of cities in North, Central and South America and the Caribbean, according to its route map.",
      "\"We apologize to our Guests for any inconvenience this may cause and will reach out to those with affected reservations to notify them of their options, including a refund,\" a Spirit spokesperson told CBS News in an email statement.",
      "The news comes at a financially tumultuous time for the budget carrier. Spirit initially filed for bankruptcy protection in November 2024 after years of of struggling with rising operation costs and mounting debt. Just months after emerging from Chapter 11 reorganization, the airline filed for bankruptcy protection again in August.",
      "At the time, Spirit said it intended to conduct business as usual during the restructuring process, signaling passengers would still be able to book flights and use tickets.",
      "Spirit is seeking to cut costs by eliminating money-losing routes. In its quarterly earnings report in August, the company said it had \"substantial doubt\" about its ability to stay in business, citing factors including weak demand for domestic leisure travel and \"adverse market conditions.\"",
      "Rival airlines swoop in",
      "Rival airlines reacted quickly by announcing new lineups of domestic flights and international flights as they sought to gain some of the market share left in Spirit's absence.",
      "United Airlines, the world's largest airline carrier, said in an email statement that it would add flights to 15 cities starting Jan. 6 including trips to and from Houston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Fort Lauderdale, Orlando and Las Vegas.",
      "\"If Spirit suddenly goes out of business it will be incredibly disruptive, so we're adding these flights to give their customers other options if they want or need them,\" Patrick Quayle, United's senior vice president of global network planning and alliances, said in the company's statement.",
      "In response to United's statement, a spokesperson for Spirit said, \"While we appreciate the obsession certain airline executives have with us, we're focused on competing and running a great operation.\" Spirit plans to continue offering low fares to customers \"for many years to come,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "Meanwhile, Frontier Airlines, a low-cost airline carrier based out of Denver, announced it was introducing 20 new routes from Detroit, Houston, Baltimore, Fort Lauderdale, Charlotte and Dallas. The flights range in price from $29 to $89.",

      "At $299, the pass costs less than what customers typically pay for a domestic ticket on other U.S. airlines, Frontier said, citing data from the U.S. Department of Transportation. On Friday, the pass's cost will rise to $599.",
      "This year's pass offers the most amount of travel time that Frontier has offered through the program, Frontier Airlines chief commercial officer Bobby Schroeter said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "It's a step that could help Frontier catapult past its competitors, industry experts said. Frontier is expanding the pass as low-cost competitor Spirit struggles with its second bankruptcy in less than a year, while rival Southwest's new policies, like ending its\u00a0free checked bag policy, have alienated some customers.",
      "\"They see all other budget airlines really struggling, and there is market share for travelers who are in the market for budget airline flights,\" Scott Keyes, founder of flight deals site Going.com, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They smell opportunity, and Frontier has always been good at expanding.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 04 Sep 2025 09:41:14 -0400",
    "summary": "After President Trump expressed \"shock\" over the pace of hiring in July, much is riding on the employment data for August.",
    "story": [
      "When President Trump last month fired the head of the federal bureau that produces the government's monthly jobs report after the numbers pointed to a slump in U.S. hiring, he drew rebukes from critics who accused him of politicizing a technical \u2014 and nonpartisan \u2014 data collection process.",
      "On Friday, the Labor Department is set to release employment figures for August in what could emerge as another possible flashpoint.",
      "The new payroll report comes at a critical juncture for the economy. Recent data suggests the labor market is cooling, a particular concern as workers and businesses head into the crucial\u00a0holiday spending period. The Federal Reserve later this month is also expected to cut its benchmark interest rate for the first time since December 2024 as it swivels from fighting inflation to shoring up job growth.",
      "The August employment report will be the first since Mr. Trump ordered the dismissal of former Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer and questioned the Labor Department's competence in tracking the rate of job-creation across the U.S.",
      "In the aftermath, economists expressed concern that Mr. Trump's move could undermine confidence in the accuracy of U.S. economic data \u2014 a benchmark for the global economy. Any further actions by the Trump administration to question the accuracy of the monthly jobs data could sow further doubt about its validity, Gregory Daco, chief economist at strategy consulting firm EY-Parthenon, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "What happened last month",
      "Employers added only 73,000 jobs in July, the government reported last month \u2014 a figure that fell far short of economist forecasts and that led Mr. Trump to express \"shock\"\u00a0over what appeared to be a sudden downturn in hiring. Also troubling was that the Labor Department sharply revised down how many jobs the economy added in May and June, a sign the economy was weaker than previously thought.",
      "Such revisions are common, according to economists. The U.S. has roughly 160 million workers, making it impossible for the Bureau of Labor Statistics to tally each job every month. Instead, Labor Department staff draws on available data to estimate hiring and layoffs, while also revising their estimates for seasonal factors.",
      "Still, the Labor Department's July recalculation of the pace of job growth was noteworthy for its scale, representing the largest two-month downward revision since 1968.",
      "\"The previous report was obviously shocking in the sense of the downward revisions for the previous two months, and really caused a reckoning in the sense of needing to view hiring in a new light \u2014 and obviously not in a positive light,\" Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Indeed, the disappointing numbers were the clearest sign to date this year that the job market could be starting to sputter as the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs and general economic uncertainty weigh on employers.",
      "What to expect from the August job numbers \u2014 and beyond",
      "The August jobs data will provide a crucial measure of whether the labor market is holding up or running out of steam, as recent data suggests. The year started off strong, with an average monthly payroll gain of 123,000 from January to April \u2014 well above the number required to keep the nation's unemployment rate, now at 4.2%, from rising.",
      "However, the job market has stalled in recent months, with an average payroll gain from May to July of only 35,000. For the first time since April of 2021, the U.S. now has more unemployed people, at 7.24 million, than the 7.18 million jobs open around the country, according to labor data released on Wednesday.",
      "\"This is yet another data point underscoring how this job market is frozen, and it's difficult for anyone to get a job right now,\" Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, said in an email. \"This is a turning point for the labor market. It's yet another crack.\"",
      "Economists polled by financial data firm FactSet projected that employers added 80,000 jobs in August, with the unemployment rate expected to hold steady at 4.2%. A figure around or exceeding that level would alleviate fears that the job market is cratering.",
      "Daco, who forecasts a much more moderate gain of 40,000 jobs in August, said in a research note this week that the employment report on Friday is \"likely to confirm that a marked slowdown in labor market conditions is underway.\"",
      "Another important marker to look for in the latest job figures will be whether the Labor Department revises the payroll gains for July, as it did for May and June.",
      "\"Since every month in 2025 has been revised lower so far, the risk is that July job growth will also be marked down,\" Shruti Mishra, a U.S. economist at Bank of America Global Research, said in a report. \"This could point to more sustained labor market weakness than we have been forecasting.\"",
      "Moving forward, Daco predicts payroll gains will average around 30,000 per month through the end of the year and for the nation's jobless rate to reach 4.7% by December.",
      "\"Looking ahead, the labor market slowdown is likely to persist,\" he said.",
      "What could the jobs report mean for a Fed rate cut?",
      "The Federal Reserve has held off on lowering interest rates as it tries to finish the job of extinguishing the raging inflation that scorched consumers during the pandemic and to assess the impact of steeper tariffs on the economy.",
      "Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled last month that there might be an opening for a cut in September as downside risks to employment increase. Another month of weak or flat job growth would reinforce this outlook and likely keep the central bank on track for a cut at the Fed's next policy meeting on Sept. 16-17, according to many economists.",
      "\"The report would have to be significantly stronger than we are forecasting to dissuade the [Fed] from cutting rates,\" Oxford Economics said in a recent report.",

      "A spokesperson for ConocoPhillips confirmed the layoffs on Wednesday, noting that 20% to 25% of the company's employees and contractors would be impacted worldwide. ConocoPhillips currently has a global headcount of about 13,000 \u2014 meaning that the cuts would impact between 2,600 and 3,250 workers.",
      "\"We are always looking at how we can be more efficient with the resources we have,\" a ConocoPhillips' spokesperson said via email, adding that the company expects the \"majority of these reductions\" to take place before the end of 2025.",
      "ConocoPhillips' shares fell 4.3% Wednesday. The Houston-based company's stock now sits at under $95 per share, down nearly 14% from a year ago.",
      "News of the coming layoffs was first reported\u00a0by Reuters, with anonymous sources telling the outlet that CEO Ryan Lance detailed the plans in a video message earlier Wednesday. In that video, Reuters reported, Lance said the company needed \"fewer roles\" while he cited rising costs.",
      "Last month, ConocoPhillips reported second-quarter earnings of $1.97 billion. That beat Wall Street expectations, but was down from the nearly $2.33 billion the company reported for the same period last year.",
      "In its latest earnings, reported on Aug. 7, ConocoPhillips continued to point to cost cutting efforts \u2014 noting that it had identified more than $1 billion in cost reductions and margin optimization. The company also said it had agreed to sell its Anadarko Basin assets for $1.3 billion."

    "story": [
      "Americans are expected to rein in spending this holiday season by the most amount since the pandemic, as they continue to face pressure from high prices and tariffs.",
      "That's according to a new survey released by accounting firm PwC on Wednesday, which predicts Americans this year will reduce holiday spending to $1,552 a person on average, which is 5% less than in 2024. That includes spending on gifts, travel, food and entertainment.",
      "If the predictions come to pass, it would represent the most significant drop in holiday spending since 2020. While consumers are not cutting purchases entirely, they are getting smarter about how they stretch their dollars, according to Alison Furman, PwC's consumer markets industry leader.",
      "\"Inflation is kind of creeping in, and they're seeing it affect their wallets,\" Furman told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "For its report, PwC surveyed 4,000 Americans from Gen Zs to baby boomers over a two-week period from June to July, when tariff-related uncertainty was more pronounced. But any perceived changes in the economy over the next couple of months could alter consumers' attitude toward spending.",
      "\"Economic signals continue to shift and, between now and December, purchasing behavior could evolve in response,\" the report states.",
      "The generation expected to tighten their spending the most is Gen Z. Respondents from this cohort, ages 17 to 28, said they expect to reduce their holiday budgets by 23% \u2014 more than any other generation in the study. That's due in part to the\u00a0tough job market\u00a0facing young Americans, along with rising costs.",
      "Overall, 84% of consumers expect to cut back spending in general over the next six months, according to the report.",
      "A slowdown in spending could spell trouble for retailers who depend on holiday sales to shore up revenue toward the end of the year. Since 2019, holiday sales during the months of November and December have accounted for 19% of total retail revenue for the year, according to a National Retail Federation\u00a0report.",
      "Tariffs, high prices top of mind",
      "The projected pullback in consumer holiday spending underscores Americans' shaky confidence in the state of the economy. Worries over inflation and tariffs have already led shoppers to be more judicious with their spending.",
      "Discretionary spending on categories like indoor and outdoor dining were down in August, according to the U.S. Conference Board's latest consumer confidence index each month. Meanwhile, average 12-month inflation expectations among consumers increased to 6.2%, from 5.7% in July.",
      "Tighter spending",
      "PwC expects consumers to approach holiday shopping \"more deliberately,\" with an eye toward saving money, amid ongoing concerns over tariffs and high prices.",
      "Furman said the potential for tariff-related price increases has already made the consumers \"very conscious of trying to buy things at a discount.\"Case in point: Internet searches for \"discount\" and \"coupon code\" have climbed by 11% over the past year, according to the survey.",
      "With deals in mind, consumers are expected to do a large portion, or 39%, of their total planned holiday gift spending, during the time between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday, according to the PwC report. With heightened traffic expected during that five-day stretch, Furman advises shoppers to start looking early for popular items.",
      "\"If you're interested in very hot items, knowing that they're going to likely be on shelves sooner, to guarantee that you'll get them, you may want to shop for them in those early promotional cycles, versus wait until the five-day frenzy,\" she said.",

    "published": "Wed, 03 Sep 2025 11:04:07 -0400",
    "summary": "Wasted energy is a hidden drain on household electricity but small steps can contribute significantly to lowering costs and emissions.",
    "story": [
      "The lights are off, the house is quiet and nothing seems to be running. But electricity is silently flowing through the plugs in your home. This hidden drain is known as phantom energy.",
      "Also called vampire energy, the wasted electricity comes from leaving devices plugged in when they're not in use. That could range from household items such as phone chargers and microwaves to TVs and gaming consoles.",
      "This wasted electricity accounts for about 5% to 10% of home energy use, depending on factors like the age of the equipment, according to Alexis Abramson, dean of the Columbia Climate School.",
      "\"Phantom energy depends on ... what kind of systems you have and how much they've improved over time,\" said Abramson.",
      "For example, televisions that are connected to the internet and have smart wake features that allow them to interact with phones and other devices can consume up to 40 watts of energy during the hours of the day that the TV would normally be off, according to Matt Malinowski, director of the buildings program at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. That's almost 40 times as much as a regular television.",
      "\"The good news is there have been new, renewed efforts to tackle this,\" said Malinowski.",
      "He said advocates and manufacturers have come up with a voluntary agreement seeking to reduce the amount of energy smart televisions use when they're in standby mode.",
      "Phantom energy contributes to climate change because power drawn by unused devices can increase demand for electricity from sources that release planet-warming emissions. Aidan Charron, associate director of Global Earth Day, said that while the amount may seem small when a person looks at their individual utility bill, the environmental toll of phantom energy is significant when multiplied over homes across the country.",
      "\"Just take a little step of unplugging the things that you're not using,\" said Charron. \"It will save you money and it'll save emissions in the long run.\"",
      "Some of the main culprits when it comes to draining energy are appliances that are constantly connected to electricity, such as those with a clock.",
      "\"Do you really need your microwave to tell you the time, or can you unplug your microwave when you're not using it?\" said Charron.",
      "While unplugging devices may seem burdensome, it significantly contributes to reducing emissions.",
      "Charron recommends starting with small steps like unplugging chargers for phones and other devices once the battery is fully charged. The next step is moving to other appliances such as unplugging an unused lamp.",
      "If unplugging sounds too hard, regularly checking your settings and disabling any extra feature you're not using that could be draining energy help, too. For example, smart televisions often have optional features that can be turned off so the television isn't listening for signals from other devices while in standby mode.",
      "\"If you're not using it, then you're getting no benefit, yet you're paying the price and increased the energy use,\" said Malinowski.",
      "Individuals also tend to take more sustainable actions, such as unplugging devices, once they learn what they can do to decrease their household emissions efficiently. Those actions could contribute to reducing U.S. emissions by about 20% per year, which equals about 450 tons (408 metric tons) of carbon dioxide, according to Jonathan Gilligan, a professor of earth and environmental science at Vanderbilt University.",
      "The choices individuals take in their daily lives all add up, Gilligan said, mainly because of how much the U.S. population contributes to direct greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "\"The question becomes, what can we do to try to address this?\" said Gilligan. \"Phantom power is one part of this.\"",
      "The more individuals decrease their footprint, the more likely it is that others will follow, too, and eventually, those actions may turn to societal norms, according to Gilligan, because individuals don't want to feel like they're being irresponsible.",
      "\"This is a place where psychologists find that this effect is real. If people see that other people are doing actions to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, they want to do that\" said Giligan.",
      "When it comes to daily choices, individuals may think what they're doing isn't really making a big difference. But what they tend to overlook is how they influence others around them by choosing to live a more sustainable life.",
      "The impact may be much stronger than a lot of people realize, Gilligan said.",

    "summary": "The judge rejected the Justice Department's effort to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, concluding the request was a bridge too far.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Tuesday ordered a shake-up of Google's search engine in a crackdown aimed at curbing the corrosive power of an illegal monopoly while rebuffing the U.S. government's attempt to break up the company and impose other restraints.",
      "The 226-page decision made by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington, D.C., will likely ripple across the technological landscape at a time when the industry is being reshaped by breakthroughs in artificial intelligence \u2014 including conversational \"answer engines\" as companies like ChatGPT and Perplexity try to upend Google's long-held position as the internet's main gateway.",
      "The innovations and competition being unleashed by generative artificial intelligence, or \"GenAI,\" have reshaped the judge's approach to remedies in the nearly five-year-old antitrust case.",
      "\"Unlike the typical case where the court's job is to resolve a dispute based on historic facts, here the court is asked to gaze into a crystal ball and look to the future. Not exactly a judge's forte,\" Mehta wrote.",
      "Investors seemed to interpret the ruling as a relatively light slap on the wrist for Google, as the stock price of its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., surged nearly 3% in extended trading.",
      "The judge is trying to rein in Google by prohibiting some of the tactics the company deployed to drive traffic to its search engine and other services.",
      "But Mehta stopped short of banning the multi-billion dollar deals that Google has been making for years to lock in its search engine as the default on smartphones, personal computers and other devices. Those deals, involving payments of more than $26 billion annually, were one of the main issues that prompted the judge to conclude Google's search engine was an illegal monopoly, but he decided banning them in the future would do more harm than good.",
      "Partially because he is allowing the default deals to continue, Mehta is ordering Google to give its current and would-be rivals access to some of its search engine's secret sauce \u2014 the data stockpiled from trillions of queries that it used to help improve the quality of its search results.",
      "The judge also rejected the U.S. Justice Department's effort to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, concluding it was an unwarranted step that \"would be incredibly messy and highly risky.\"",
      "\"Now the Court has imposed limits on how we distribute Google services, and will require us to share Search data with rivals,\" Google said in a statement provided to CBS News following the ruling. \"We have concerns about how these requirements will impact our users and their privacy, and we're reviewing the decision closely. The Court did recognize that divesting Chrome and Android would have gone beyond the case's focus on search distribution, and would have harmed consumers and our partners.\"",
      "\"We proved in court that competition had been frozen in place for two decades in internet search,\" Abigail Slater, assistant attorney general of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, wrote in a social media post. \"Google's tactics have excluded competition, harming consumers and slowing innovation. Today's remedy order agreed with the need to restore competition to the long-monopolized search market, and we are now weighing our options and thinking through whether the ordered relief goes far enough in serving that goal.\"",
      "Allowing the default search deals to continue is more than just a victory for Google. It's also something that Apple, which receives more than $20 billion annually from Google, and the beneficiaries of the payments urged Mehta to maintain.",
      "In hearings earlier this year, Apple warned the judge that banning the contracts would deprive the company of money that it funnels into its own innovative research. The Cupertino, California, company also cautioned that the ban could have the unintended consequence of making Google even more powerful by pocketing the money it had been spending on deals while most consumers will still end up flocking to Google's search engine anyway.",
      "Others, such as the owners of the Firefox search engine, asserted that losing the Google contracts would threaten their future survival by depriving them of essential revenue.",

    "summary": "A digital token offered by the Trump family's World Liberty Financial has started trading. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "A new cryptocurrency issued by the Trump family's World Liberty Financial\u00a0and that started trading this week has boosted the family's wealth on paper by roughly $5 billion despite the digital token sinking in its first two days of being listed on the exchange.",
      "The crypto, called WLFI, reached a high of about 40 cents after launching on Monday, according to data from CoinMarketCap. By Tuesday morning, the value of the token had fallen to as low as about 21 cents, down 48% from its peak, before recovering to about 23 cents in the afternoon.",
      "Even with the decline, the Trump family's stake in WLFI is worth about $5 billion based on its holdings of 22.5 billion WLFI tokens. Mr. Trump and his family aren't yet able to sell their holdings as its founders' tokens remained locked, according to World Liberty Financial.",
      "World Liberty Financial didn't immediately return a request for comment. Here's what to know about the company's token.",
      "Trump's support for crypto",
      "Once an avowed skeptic of cryptocurrency, Mr. Trump has championed the digital asset in his second term, vowing to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the world.\"",
      "World Liberty Financial and the Trump family's other private crypto ventures have raised concerns among some watchdog groups and Democratic lawmakers over potential conflicts of interest.",
      "\"The media's continued attempts to fabricate conflicts of interest are irresponsible and reinforce the public's distrust in what they read,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Neither the president nor his family have ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest.\"",
      "In July, Mr. Trump\u00a0signed the Genius Act, the first major federal law governing cryptocurrencies, into law. The act established federal regulations for \"stablecoins,\" which are viewed as a relatively safe type of cryptocurrency because their value is pegged to fixed assets, like the dollar.",
      "The surging value of World Liberty Financial, whose co-founders include Mr. Trump and his sons Eric, Donald Jr. and Barron, underscores the president's growing interest in cryptocurrency, a focus that spans both personal investments and policy moves during his presidency. Those efforts include\u00a0$TRUMP and $Melania meme coins, which are cryptos whose value is linked to internet trends and which began trading in January.",
      "What is WLFI?",
      "WLFI is a token, or a digital asset, that guarantees its holders the right to vote on governance issues for World Liberty Financial, according to the company.",
      "World Liberty Financial cautions token owners that WLFI isn't an investment, with its terms stating: \"You should not acquire $WLFI as an investment on a speculative basis or otherwise, for a financial purpose or with an expectation of resale for a profit or otherwise.\"",
      "The early swing in WLFI's price isn't unusual for tokens making their market debut, said Nic Puckrin, CEO of Coin Bureau, a provider of crypto and blockchain information.",
      "\"The price action from 40 cents to 21 cents is typical for new token launches,\" Puckrin told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Early hype usually drives initial spikes, followed by a wave of selling as early entrants take profits.\"",
      "He added, \"Compared to other major token debuts, WLFI's decline is relatively moderate, and early backers have still seen strong returns from private sales.\"",
      "World Liberty Financial also offers a stablecoin called USD1, which is pegged to the value of the U.S. dollar. Because stablecoins are linked to fixed assets, they are generally seen as less volatile to other cryptos.",
      "\"WLFI is carving out a unique position by offering token holders real governance rights over the direction of USD1, a dollar-backed stablecoin that is growing rapidly,\" Puckrin said.",
      "That's important because WLFI holders, through their governance votes, can help influence the future development and policies of USD1 and World Liberty Financial's policies, he added. That capacity \"sets it apart in a crowded market,\" he said.",
      "What about insider concentration risk?",
      "The Trump family and other insiders own more than 20% of the WLFI tokens, according to World Liberty Financial's site.",
      "But World Liberty Financial's terms note that no single digital wallet can exercise more than 5% of governance power, which should deter outsized insider influence, Puckrin said.",
      "What's happening with Mr. Trump's other crypto ventures?",
      "In May, the $TRUMP meme coin drew scrutiny when the venture offered its top holders the chance to join Mr. Trump for dinner. Investors spent about $140 million to snap up the coins and secure an invite to the event, data showed at the time.",
      "That sparked concerns from government watchdogs and some Democratic lawmakers that the Trump-branded asset was being linked to gain access to the president.",
      "As investors snapped up the meme coin, the asset's value almost doubled to about $15 in May. Since then, the coin has given up most of the gains and was trading at about $8.30 on Tuesday, according to CoinMarketCap.",
      "Trump Media & Technology Group \u2014 the owner of the Truth Social app \u2014 has expanded into crypto in recent months. In July, it bought about $2 billion in cryptocurrencies\u00a0to refashion the business as an investment firm.",
      "Shares of Trump Media & Technology group have shed about 50% of their value year to date and traded Tuesday at $17.05.",

      "In January, McDonald's introduced the McValue menu, which includes the $5 meal deal, along with a \"buy one, add one for $1\" deal. Earlier this summer, the company also said it would bring back the Snack Wrap, a white-flour tortilla filled with chicken, shredded lettuce and cheese. The item, now available for $2.99, returned to the McDonald's menu in July after a nine-year hiatus.",

      "Vogue has named Chloe Malle to lead its U.S. editorial content, selecting the 39-year-old to succeed Anna Wintour, who has led the magazine for more than three decades.",
      "Malle, the daughter of actor Candice Bergen and the late French director Louis Malle, joined Vogue 14 years ago and currently serves as the editor of Vogue.com and co-host of The Run-Through, a weekly fashion and culture podcast.",
      "\"I'm thrilled to announce that Chloe Malle will be the next Head of Editorial Content for our U.S. title, leading the American magazine and guiding its digital coverage,\" Wintour said in a\u00a0statement posted to Vogue.com.",
      "Wintour, who is widely considered to be the most powerful figure in the fashion industry,\u00a0announced in June she was taking a step back from her editorial duties. The 75-year-old has served as the magazine's editor-in-chief since 1988.",
      "Malle may be stepping into Wintour's low-heeled slingbacks, but she'll report to the original wearer while taking over day-to-day operations at the U.S. edition. In Vogue's online post, Wintour said she is excited to continue working with Malle as \"her mentor but also as her student.\"",
      "\"Fashion and media are both evolving at breakneck speed, and I am so thrilled \u2014 and awed \u2014 to be part of that,\" Malle said in an online\u00a0post\u00a0from Vogue. \"I also feel incredibly fortunate to still have Anna just down the hall as my mentor.\"",
      "Wintour remains at the top of the masthead as global editorial director and the chief content officer for Cond\u00e9 Nast.",

    "published": "Tue, 02 Sep 2025 08:22:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Courts weigh fairness of reimbursement formula as Arkansas jury finds against State Farm.",
    "story": [
      "An Arkansas jury found recently that a major car insurance carrier had shortchanged customers who had been in accidents that left their cars \"totaled,\" and now plaintiffs in other states are pursuing similar cases.",
      "The Arkansas lead plaintiff, Rose Chadwick, said she initially assumed the reimbursement for her \"totaled\" 2011 Hyundai was reasonable compensation, \"because that's what I pay them for, is to be fair with me.\"",
      "But after learning about potential legal action challenging the way insurance carrier State Farm calculated the replacement cost, she decided to bring her case to court. Her lawyers alleged that the company used technology to estimate the amount of buying a replacement. That program factored into the calculation the potential for the car buyer to negotiate a discount from used car dealers \u2014 a haggling discount that Chadwick's attorneys argued was no longer consistent with how modern-day used cars are priced and sold.",
      "\"The computer program that State Farm used to calculate the replacement value of the car, did it systematically unfairly,\" said Chadwick's attorney, Brian Glasser. Glasser says his firm argued that commonly used software systematically low-balled the value of total-loss cars for tens of thousands of drivers across the country.",
      "In an Arkansas federal court in June, a jury agreed \u2014 finding in favor of Chadwick and 37,000 other plaintiffs. The jury determined Chadwick had been underpaid by about $600 for a car worth $4,700.",
      "State Farm is fighting lawsuits on the issue in multiple states, arguing that the system the company used at the time was standard for most automobile insurers. It no longer uses the same program to calculate reimbursement amounts.",
      "\"State Farm always seeks to pay what we owe within the terms of the policy to help our customers recover from a loss,\" the company said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "\"We work with the policyholder to determine the actual cash value of a total loss vehicle considering the age, condition, equipment, mileage of the vehicle at the time of the loss,\" the company said, adding that customers are \"also invited to share additional information and has the option to use a third-party appraisal to help reach agreement on the value of their totaled vehicle.\"",
      "A \"totaled\" car is typically one that has sustained damage that would cost more to repair than the value of the car itself.",
      "Company officials noted that appellate courts in multiple jurisdictions have agreed with their contention that a challenge to the reimbursement process cannot be made en masse, in the form of a class action lawsuit, as it was in Arkansas. The courts have split over whether each reimbursement case is unique, and must be filed separately, or whether all customers whose loss was calculated the same way can file suit together as a class.",
      "Chadwick's case began five years ago, when her daughter borrowed her car for an early morning run to the store when she was struck from behind while going through an intersection.",
      "After learning of the reimbursement issue in a social media post, Chadwick became the lead plaintiff in a class action lawsuit against the insurance giant accusing it of undervaluing and shorting payouts on claims like hers.",
      "\"State Farm moves billions of dollars to people for their broken cars every year and, and insurance companies around America do similar numbers,\" Glasser said. \"So we're talking about these computer programs that calculate the value of your replacement vehicle that affect billions of dollars every year.\"",
      "Attorneys are launching similar cases against several insurance carriers in at least 19 states while regulators in some of those states weigh whether insurers must change how they value total loss cars.",
      "State Farm said customers are not without recourse if they have questions about the estimate the company provides to reimburse a customer whose car was a total loss. Among them, customers are encouraged to ask their insurer how they determined the payout amount, to an agreeable price, and to get an independent appraisal of what the car was worth.",
      "In the end, Chadwick said the dispute was less about the money than about principles.",
      "\"It was like hiding something and you shouldn't hide,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Kraft Heinz is splitting into two companies a decade after they joined in a massive merger that created one of the biggest food conglomerates on the planet.",
      "One of the companies, currently called Global Taste Elevation Co., will include shelf-stable meals and include brands such as Heinz, Philadelphia cream cheese and Kraft Mac & Cheese, Kraft Heinz said Tuesday. The other, currently called North American Grocery Co.,  will include brands such as Oscar Mayer, Kraft Singles and Lunchables. The names of the two companies will be released later.",
      "Kraft Heinz said in May that it was conducting a strategic review of the company, signaling a potential split.",
      "The company's board \"unanimously approved a plan to separate the company into two independent, publicly traded companies through a tax-free spin-off,\" Kraft Heinz said.",
      "In 2015, when they merged, the company wanted to capitalize on its massive scale, but shifting tastes complicated those plans, with households seeking to introduce healthier options at the table. Kraft Heinz and other food producers have shifted offerings to follow that trend.",
      "\"Kraft Heinz's brands are iconic and beloved, but the complexity of our current structure makes it challenging to allocate capital effectively, prioritize initiatives and drive scale in our most promising areas,\" Kraft Heinz Executive Chair Miguel Patricio said in a statement.",
      "Kraft Heinz CEO  Carlos Abrams-Rivera said, \"This move will unleash the power of our brands and unlock the potential of our business. This next step in our transformation is only possible because of the commitment of our 36,000 talented employees who deliver quality and value for consumers every day. We will continue to operate as 'one Kraft Heinz' throughout the separation process.\"",
      "The path to the merger of Kraft and Heinz began in 2013, when billionaire investor Warren Buffett teamed up with Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital to buy H.J. Heinz Co. At the time, the $23 billion deal was the most expensive ever in the food industry.",
      "3G was also behind the formation of Restaurant Brands International \u2014 a merger of Burger King, Tim Hortons and Popeyes \u2014 and Anheuser-Busch InBev. It's known for strict cost controls and so-called zero-based budgeting, which requires all expenses to be justified each quarter.",
      "The deal was intended to help Heinz, which was founded in 1869 in Pittsburgh, expand sales of its condiments and sauces on grocery store shelves. Heinz's new owners also set about cutting costs, laying off hundreds of workers within months.",
      "At the same time Kraft, based in Chicago, sought a partner after a 2011 split from its snack division, which became Mondelez International.",
      "In 2015, Buffett and 3G decided to merge Heinz with Kraft. The merger created the 5th largest food and beverage company in the world, with annual revenue of $28 billion. Buffett and 3G each contributed $5 billion for a special dividend for Kraft shareholders.",
      "But the combined company struggled, despite layoffs of thousands of employees and other cost-cutting measures. Even at the time of the merger, many consumers were shifting away from the kinds of highly processed packaged foods that Kraft sells, like Velveeta cheese and Kool-Aid.",
      "Kraft Heinz also had trouble distinguishing its products from cheaper store brands. At Walmart, a 14-ounce bottle of Heinz ketchup costs $2.98; the same size bottle of Walmart's Great Value brand is 98 cents.",
      "In 2019, Kraft Heinz slashed the value of its Oscar Meyer and Kraft brands by $15.4 billion, citing operational costs and supply chain problems. But many investors blamed the company's leadership, saying its zeal for cost-cutting was hurting brand innovation.",
      "In 2021, Kraft Heinz sold both its Planters nut business and its natural cheese business, vowing to reinvest the money into higher-growth brands like P3 protein snacks and Lunchables.",
      "But the company's net revenue has fallen every year since 2020, when it saw a pandemic-related bump in sales. In April, Kraft Heinz lowered its full-year sales and earnings guidance, citing weaker customer spending in the U.S. and the impact of President Trump's tariffs.",
      "Carlos Abrams-Rivera will continue to serve as CEO of Kraft Heinz and will become CEO of North American Grocery Co. once the separation is complete. Kraft Heinz said its board is working with an executive search firm to identify potential CEO candidates for Global Taste Elevation Co.",
      "Kraft Heinz says it has no plans to change its current headquarter locations in Chicago and Pittsburgh. It currently expects the transaction to close in the second half of 2026.",

    "published": "Mon, 01 Sep 2025 14:29:10 -0400",
    "summary": "The number of immigrant workers has declined from January through the end of July, preliminary Census data shows.",
    "story": [
      "As millions of Americans gather Monday to celebrate Labor Day, federal data shows how President Trump's immigration policies are reshaping the U.S. workforce.",
      "The number of immigrant workers in the U.S. has declined by 1.2 million from January through the end of July, according to preliminary Census Bureau data, analyzed by the Pew Research Center. That figure includes people who are in the country illegally as well as legal residents.",
      "The labor market shakeup comes as the flow of immigrants into the U.S. has slowed significantly under Mr. Trump, who campaigned on a promise to deport millions of immigrants working illegally. He has said he is focusing deportation efforts on \"dangerous criminals,\" but most people detained by ICE have no criminal convictions. At the same time, the number of illegal border crossings has plunged under his policies.",
      "The overall number of people in the U.S. illegally peaked at an estimated 14 million in 2023, according to a Pew Research Center\u00a0estimate. However, the number of unauthorized immigrants has likely declined since then \"due in part to increased deportations and reduced protections under the Trump administration,\" the authors of the Pew Research Center report said.",
      "In an Aug. 28 report, Oxford Economics projects the slowdown will persist through Mr. Trump's presidency, with net immigration falling to an annualized 500,000 by year-end and holding at that level until 2028.",
      "Immigrants make up almost 20% of the U.S. workforce, and data shows 45% of workers in farming, fishing and forestry are immigrants, according to Pew senior researcher Stephanie Kramer. About 30% of all construction workers are immigrants and 24% of service workers are immigrants, she added.",
      "\"It's unclear how much of the decline we've seen since January is due to voluntary departures to pursue other opportunities or avoid deportation, removals, underreporting or other technical issues,\" Kramer said. \"However, we don't believe that the preliminary numbers indicating net-negative migration are so far off that the decline isn't real.\"",
      "To be sure, the loss of immigrant workers reflects a small share of the overall U.S. labor force of more than 171 million workers. But the decline could affect states and sectors that are more dependent on foreign workers, economists say.",
      "Potential implications for the labor market",
      "Immigrants play a key role in alleviating labor shortages, as the majority tend to be ages 25 to 54, Oxford Economics noted. Economists call that demographic \"prime working age\" because they tend to be in their most productive decades of work.",
      "Immigrants are also more willing to migrate to states with higher labor demand.",
      "\"This is critical to ease shortages in regional labor markets, especially as U.S. labor mobility has steadily declined since the 1980s,\" Oxford Economics researchers noted.",
      "However, states with large shares of undocumented residents \u2014 namely Louisiana, Florida and New York \u2014 are starting to see some of the biggest declines in unauthorized migration, the report says.",
      "Experts say the drop in workforce participation could ripple through the labor market, which is already under some strain as employers pull back on hiring. The average monthly payroll gain from May to July was only 35,000, down from an average of 123,000 from for the first four months of the year.",
      "\"The influx across the border from what we can tell is essentially stopped, and that's where we were getting millions and millions of migrants over the last four years,\" said Pia Orrenius, a labor economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. \"That has had a huge impact on the ability to create jobs.\"",
      "Immigrants normally contribute at least 50% of job growth in the U.S., according to Orrenius.",
      "The plunge in unauthorized immigration may also give the impression that the labor force is tighter than it actually is due to the higher ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers, Oxford Economics said. That could muddy the picture of what's going on in the labor market, the authors say.",
      "\"The Fed is highly sensitive to the downside risks to the labor market, but the immigration reversal will continue to complicate the signals from the labor market data,\" they write.",
      "ICE raids take a toll on farms",

    "summary": "President Trump has claimed the authority to bypass Congress and impose sweeping tariffs, but a new ruling throws that in doubt.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has claimed the authority to bypass Congress and impose sweeping tariffs on foreign products, arguing the import duties are\u00a0necessary to strengthen the U.S. economy.",
      "Now a federal appeals court has thrown a roadblock in his path.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled Friday that Mr. Trump went too far when he declared national emergencies to justify tariffs on nearly every country on Earth. The ruling largely upheld a May decision by a federal trade court in New York.",
      "But Friday's 7-4 appeals court decision tossed out a part of that ruling striking down the tariffs immediately, giving his administration time to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. The ruling represents a major setback for Mr. Trump, who has said his trade policies will enrich the U.S. by bringing back manufacturing jobs and contributing billions in new revenue for the federal government.",
      "\"This ruling highlights a serious legal threat to one of the president's most high-profile economic policies,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of financial advisory company deVere Group, in an emailed report.",
      "On Friday, Mr. Trump lashed out against the 7-4 ruling in a\u00a0Truth Social post, calling the appeals court \"Highly Partisan\" and noting that the tariffs are still in effect.",
      "Six of the seven judges who ruled against the tariffs are appointees of Democratic presidents, while the seventh is an appointee of former President George H.W. Bush. Of the four judges who dissented, two were appointed by former President Obama and two by former President George W. Bush.",
      "Here's what could happen next as the legal case proceeds.",
      "How did the dispute arise?",
      "Friday's ruling came as part of a months-long legal challenge over the tariffs brought by Democratic states and small businesses, which are arguing that the president has exceeded his authority in issuing the import duties.",
      "The appeals court's decision is focused on the tariffs Mr. Trump imposed in April on most trading partners, along with earlier levies on China, Mexico and Canada.",
      "Mr. Trump on April 2 \u2014 or Liberation Day, he called it \u2014 imposed so-called reciprocal tariffs of up to 50% on countries with which the U.S. runs a trade deficit and 10% baseline tariffs on almost everybody else.",
      "The president later suspended the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days to give countries time to negotiate trade agreements with the U.S. \u2014 and reduce their barriers to American exports. Some of them did \u2014 including the U.K., Japan and the EU \u2014 and agreed to deals with Mr. Trump to avoid even bigger tariffs.",
      "Countries that didn't comply faced higher tariffs earlier this month. Laos got rocked with a 40% tariff, for instance, and Algeria with a 30% levy. Mr. Trump also kept the baseline tariffs in place.",
      "What is the IEEPA?",
      "Mr. Trump justified the taxes under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, by declaring longstanding U.S. trade deficits \"a national emergency.\"",
      "In February, he'd invoked the law to impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, saying that illegal immigration and drug trafficking amounted to a national emergency and that the three countries needed to do more to stop it.",
      "The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to set taxes, including tariffs. But lawmakers have gradually let presidents assume more power over tariffs \u2014 and Mr. Trump has made the most of it.",
      "Does the ruling apply to all tariffs?",
      "No, the court's ruling doesn't cover all of Mr. Trump tariffs. For instance, his levies on foreign steel, aluminum and autos were imposed under a different regulation after Commerce Department investigations concluded that those imports were threats to U.S. national security.",
      "Nor does it include tariffs that Mr. Trump imposed on China in his first term \u2014 and President Biden kept \u2014 after a government investigation concluded that the Chinese used unfair practices to give their own technology firms an edge over rivals from the U.S. and other Western countries.",
      "The administration had argued that courts had approved then-President Richard Nixon's emergency use of tariffs in the economic chaos that followed his decision to end a policy that linked the U.S. dollar to the price of gold. The Nixon administration successfully cited its authority under the 1917 Trading With Enemy Act, which preceded and supplied some of the legal language later used in IEEPA.",
      "In May, the U.S. Court of International Trade in New York rejected the argument, ruling that Trump's Liberation Day tariffs \"exceed any authority granted to the President'' under the emergency powers law. In reaching its decision, the trade court combined two challenges \u2014 one by five businesses and one by 12 U.S. states \u2014 into a single case.",
      "On Friday, the federal appeals court wrote in its 7-4 ruling that \"it seems unlikely that Congress intended to ... grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs.\"",
      "What happens next?",
      "The president vowed to take the fight to the Supreme Court. \"If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,\" he wrote on his social media platform on Friday.",
      "A dissent from the judges who disagreed with Friday's ruling clears a possible legal path for Mr. Trump, concluding that the 1977 law allowing for emergency actions \"is not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority under the Supreme Court's decisions,\" which have allowed the legislature to grant some tariffing authorities to the president.",
      "The government has argued that if Mr. Trump's tariffs are struck down, it might have to refund some of the import taxes that it's collected, delivering a financial blow to the U.S. Treasury. Revenue from tariffs totaled $159 billion by July, more than double what it was at the same point the year before.",
      "Tariffs are paid by U.S. importers, such as American manufacturers or retailers that rely on foreign-made products. While the U.S. companies typically swallow some of the cost, they pass on much of the added expenses to consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "The Justice Department warned in a legal filing this month that revoking the tariffs could mean \"financial ruin\" for the U.S.",
      "It could also put Mr. Trump on shaky ground in trying to impose tariffs going forward.",
      "\"While existing trade deals may not automatically unravel, the administration could lose a pillar of its negotiating strategy, which may embolden foreign governments to resist future demands, delay implementation of prior commitments or even seek to renegotiate terms,\" Ashley Akers, senior counsel at the Holland & Knight law firm and a former Justice Department trial lawyer, said before the appeals court decision.",
      "Does the Trump administration have other options?",
      "Mr. Trump does have alternative laws for imposing import taxes, but they would limit the speed and severity with which he could act.",
      "For instance, in its decision in May, the trade court noted that Mr. Trump retains more limited power to impose tariffs to address trade deficits under another statute, the Trade Act of 1974. But that law restricts tariffs to 15% and to just 150 days on countries with which the U.S. runs big trade deficits.",
      "The administration could also invoke levies under a different legal authority \u2014 Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 \u2014 as it did with tariffs on foreign steel, aluminum and automobiles. But that requires a Commerce Department investigation and cannot be imposed at the president's sole discretion.",
      "\"Even if the tariffs are struck down, we believe the Trump administration will look for new ways to tax imports or otherwise raise revenue from companies selling into the U.S.,\" noted Green of the deVere Group.",

      "Last month, U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams ordered the state of Florida and federal government to immediately stop expanding the facility and to start dismantling its fences, lights and generators within 60 days. The judge sided with environmental groups and a Native American tribe who argued that Alligator Alcatraz \u2014 located in the middle of the sensitive Florida Everglades \u2014 should have been subject to federal environmental reviews.",
      "But on Thursday, the panel of appellate court judges froze that ruling. The court concluded that state and federal officials are likely to succeed in showing that the site isn't subject to the National Environmental Policy Act, because it is a state-operated facility and Florida has not yet received any federal reimbursement for the cost of running the site.",
      "The majority ruling was written by Judge Barbara Lagoa and joined by Judge Elizabeth Branch, both of whom were nominated in President Trump's first term. Judge Adalberto Jordan, an Obama nominee, dissented.",

    "summary": "The military attorneys would help with a backlog of some 3.7 million immigration cases.",
    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 The Defense Department is considering authorizing up to 600 military attorneys to serve as temporary immigration judges, a defense official confirmed.",
      "Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement that at the request of the Justice Department, the Defense Department is in the process of \"identifying qualified Judge Advocates and civilian attorneys for details to serve as Temporary Immigration Judges.\"",
      "Parnell said the Defense Department attorneys would help with the backlog of cases \"by presiding over immigration hearings.\" The Associated Press first reported the Pentagon's plans.",
      "The immigration courts are struggling with a backlog of more than 3.4 million cases. But the plan to turn possibly hundreds of military lawyers into immigration judges comes after the Trump administration has fired more than two dozen immigration judges nationwide so far this year. Unlike federal district court judges, immigration judges work for the Justice Department.",
      "Judge Advocate General Corps officers are tasked with providing legal support to service members and their families or advising commanders on the legalities of warfare. The defense lawyers would likely need to undergo some training in immigration law, procedure and policy.",
      "CBS News on Thursday obtained an email that the Defense Department sent to military lawyers in the U.S. Army Reserve on Wednesday seeking 100 volunteers to serve as immigration judges in the Justice Department for a period of 179 days.",
      "\"Applicants must demonstrate a record of sound judgment, legal expertise, analytical ability, wisdom, discernment, and impartiality, along with a professional demeanor, a suitable temperament for the role of a TIJ [Temporary Immigration Judge], and strong written and oral communication skills,\" the email reads.",
      "In the email, the Defense Department urged military lawyers to volunteer because they \"will be directly contributing to the resolution of millions of pending immigration cases, reinforcing the Army Reserve's value to the Nation.\"",
      "The Trump administration loosened the job requirements for temporary immigration judges last month, allowing a wider group of government lawyers to handle cases in immigration court. Its new rule, published in the Federal Register in late August, states that the Justice Department \"no longer believes the restriction of [temporary immigration judges] to current Department employees with a threshold level of immigration law experience serves [the Executive Office for Immigration Review's] interests.\"",
      "Previously, only Justice Department lawyers with a decade of immigration law experience or former immigration judges could fill those roles.",
      "The American Immigration Lawyers Association criticized the plan in a statement after the new rule was published.",
      "\"While DoD attorneys may be well suited to handle military matters, immigration law is entirely different and exceptionally complex,\" AILA said. \"It makes as much sense as having a cardiologist do a hip replacement.\"",
      "\"The work of immigration judges has been described as life and death decisions in traffic court conditions,\" the statement continued. \"Expecting fair decisions from judges unfamiliar with the law is absurd. This reckless move guts due process and further undermines the integrity of our immigration court system.\"",
      "The group called on Congress to use its oversight powers \"to defend the rule of law and protect the independence of the immigration judiciary.\"",
      "In Florida, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has already proposed loaning National Guard troops to the federal government for use as immigration judges. He said in May that his office had submitted a proposal to the Trump administration that would activate the nine Florida National Guard members who are Judge Advocate General Corps officers to serve as immigration judges, which legal experts told CBS News is unprecedented.",
      "Typically, when National Guard troops help after a hurricane or secure a protest site, they remain under the command of their state governor, under Title 32 of the U.S. Code. Under DeSantis' plan, the state would relinquish control of these officers to Washington. Title 10 would snap into place, reassigning the JAG officers under the command of the president and defense secretary. This grants them eligibility to serve as federal immigration judges, appointed by the U.S. attorney general.",
      "The Justice Department will pick up the tab for the operation if adopted. It plans to train the officers over six weeks \u2014 a crash course in immigration law, procedure and policy. Each officer would need to pass a written exam before donning the judge's robe.",

The criminal organization, which traces its roots to a Venezuelan prison, is not known for having a big role in global drug trafficking but for its involvement in contract killings, extortions and human smuggling.",

      "U.S. officials have yet to explain how the military determined that those aboard the vessel were Tren de Aragua members. The strike represents a paradigm shift in how the U.S. is willing to combat drug trafficking in the Western Hemisphere and appears to send a combative message to governments in the region as well as drug traffickers.",
      "Tren de Aragua operations spread beyond Venezuela",
      "Tren de Aragua originated more than a decade ago at an infamously lawless prison with hardened criminals in Venezuela's central state of Aragua. The gang has expanded in recent years, recruiting from among the more than 7.7 million Venezuelans who have fled economic turmoil in their homeland and migrated to other Latin American countries or the U.S.",

      "During his 2024 presidential campaign, Mr. Trump described Aurora, Colorado, as a \"war zone\" overrun with members of the gang. The city's police chief rejected that characterization, explaining the gang was tied to organized violent crime concentrated in three apartment complexes in the city.",
      "Aurora Police Chief Todd Chamberlain said earlier this year his department had counted a total of nine confirmed Tren de Aragua members who passed through Aurora in the last two years.",
      "The size of the gang is unclear. Countries with large populations of Venezuelan migrants, including Peru and Colombia, have accused the group of being behind a spree of violence in the region.",
      "Authorities in Chile first identified the gang's operations in 2022. Prosecutors and investigators have said the group initially engaged primarily in human trafficking, organizing unauthorized border crossings and sexual exploitation, but over time, members have expanded their activities to more violent crimes, such as kidnapping, torture, extortion and became more involved in drug trafficking.",
      "While Tren de Argua has dominated ketamine trafficking in Chile, unlike other criminal organizations from Colombia, Central America and Brazil, it has no large-scale involvement in smuggling cocaine across international borders, according to InSight Crime, a think tank that last month published a 64-page report on the gang based on two years of research.",
      "\"We've found no direct participation of TdA in the transnational drug trade, although there are cases of them acting as subcontractors for other drug trafficking organizations,\" said Jeremy McDermott, a Colombia-based co-founder of InSight Crime.",
      "McDermott added that with affiliated cells spread across Latin America, it would not be a huge leap for the gang to one day delve into the drug trade.",
      "Landlocked Bolivia and Colombia, with access to the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea and a border with Venezuela, are the world's top cocaine producers.",
      "Trump designated Tren de Aragua a foreign terrorist organization",
      "On his first day in office, Mr. Trump took steps to designate the gang a foreign terrorist organization alongside several Mexican drug cartels. The Biden administration had sanctioned the gang and offered $12 million in rewards for the arrest of three of its leaders.",
      "Mr. Trump's executive order accused the gang of working closely with top Maduro officials \u2014 most notably the former vice president and one-time governor of Aragua state, Tareck El Aissami \u2014 to infiltrate migration flows, flood the U.S. with cocaine and plot against the country. A U.S. intelligence assessment released earlier this year found minimal contact between the gang and low-level officials in the Venezuelan government but said there was no direct coordination between the gang and the government.",
      "In March, Mr. Trump also declared the group an invading force, invoking an 18th century wartime law that allows the U.S. to deport noncitizens without any legal recourse. Under the Alien Enemies Act, the administration sent more than 250 Venezuelan men to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador, where they remained incommunicado and without access to an attorney until their July deportation to Venezuela.",
      "A\u00a0U.S. appeals court panel this week ruled that Mr. Trump cannot use that law to speed deportations of people his administration accuses of being Tren de Aragua members. A final ruling on the matter, however, will be made by the Supreme Court.",
      "The Trump administration alleged the men deported to the prison were members of the Tren de Aragua gang, but provided little evidence. One justification officials used was that the men had certain kinds of tattoos allegedly signifying gang membership, including crowns, clocks and other symbols. But experts have said tattoos are not reliable markers of affiliation to the gang.",
      "Trump cites the gang in justifying the military strike",
      "The U.S. has not released the names and nationalities of the 11 people killed Tuesday. It also has not offered an estimate of the amount of drugs it says the boat was carrying.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday told reporters the U.S. military will continue lethal strikes on suspected drug trafficking vessels, but he dodged questions on details of the strike, including if the people in the boat were warned before the attack.",
      "But, he said, Mr. Trump \"has a right, under exigent circumstances, to eliminate imminent threats to the United States.\"",
      "\"If you're on a boat full of cocaine or fentanyl or whatever, headed to the United States, you're an immediate threat to the United States,\" he told reporters in Mexico City during a visit to Latin America.",
      "Venezuela's government, which has long minimized the presence of Tren de Aragua in the South American country, limited its reaction to the strike to questioning the veracity of a video showing the attack. Communications Minister Freddy \u00d1\u00e1\u00f1ez suggested it was created using artificial intelligence and described it as an \"almost cartoonish animation, rather than a realistic depiction of an explosion.\"",
      "Hegseth responded that the strike \"was definitely not artificial intelligence,\" adding he watched live footage from Washington as the strike was carried out.",
      "The strike shows that the U.S. government is \"quite literally deadly serious\" in its targeting of drug traffickers, said Ryan Berg, director of the Americas program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank.",
      "But he questioned whether the link to Tren de Aragua has more to do with the \"familiarity\" that Americans now have with the gang.",
      "\"I certainly hope that the U.S. government has the intelligence and we are not shooting first and asking questions later,\" Berg said.",

      "Susan Monarez was fired from the position less than a month after her Senate confirmation. In an opinion piece\u00a0in the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, Monarez said that Kennedy \"pressured me to resign or face termination\" in an Aug. 25 meeting.",
      "\"One of the troubling directives from that meeting more than a week ago: I was told to preapprove the recommendations of a vaccine advisory panel newly filled with people who have publicly expressed antivaccine rhetoric,\" she wrote.",
      "The piece was published shortly before Kennedy testified before the Senate Finance Committee, where he faced tough questioning about his vaccine policies.",
      "\"I did not say that to her,\" Kennedy told Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon. \"I never had a private meeting with her. Other witnesses to every meeting that we have, and all those witnesses will say, I never said that.\"",
      "\"So she's lying today to the American people in the Wall Street Journal?\" Wyden asked.",
      "\"Yes, sir,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Later, Kennedy told Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia that he did not demand Monarez accept the recommendations of the panel without further review from career scientists at the CDC.",
      "\"I told her I didn't want her to have a rule that she's not going to sign onto it,\" Kennedy said when asked whether he told Monarez to accept the recommendations.",
      "At another point in the hearing, Kennedy claimed he asked Monarez to resign \"because I asked her, 'Are you a trustworthy person?' and she said no.\"",
      "In a statement Thursday afternoon, lawyers for Monarez said Kennedy's claims were \"false, and at times, patently ridiculous.\"",
      "\"Dr. Monarez stands by what she said in her op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, would repeat it all under oath and continues to support the vision she outlined at her confirmation hearing that science will control her decisions,\" attorneys Mark Zaid and Abbe Lowell said.",
      "In June, Kennedy removed every member of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, a government panel that makes vaccine recommendations. At the time, he asserted that it \"has become little more than a rubber stamp for any vaccine.\" He then named several members to the panel, including vaccine skeptics, circumventing the usual CDC practice for selecting medical and public health experts.",
      "The newly constituted ACIP is set to meet later this month to consider vaccine recommendations. In her op-ed, Monarez wrote that \"[i]t is imperative that the panel's recommendations aren't rubber-stamped but instead are rigorously and scientifically reviewed before being accepted or rejected.\"",

    "summary": "New York's attorney general is appealing the ruling that slashed President Trump's half-billion-dollar penalty in his civil fraud case.",
    "story": [
      "New York's attorney general moved Thursday to have the state's highest court reinstate President Trump's staggering civil fraud penalty, appealing a lower-court decision that slashed the potential half-billion-dollar fine to $0.",
      "Attorney General Letitia James' office filed a notice of appeal with the state's Court of Appeals, seeking to reverse the mid-level Appellate Division's ruling last month that the penalty violated the U.S. Constitution's ban on excessive fines.",
      "James, a Democrat, had previously said she would appeal.",
      "Mr. Trump declared \"TOTAL VICTORY\" after the Appellate Division, First Department wiped away his fine, but the five-judge panel left other punishments in place and narrowly endorsed a trial court's finding that he committed fraud by padding his wealth on financial paperwork given to banks and insurers.",
      "The president filed his own appeal last week, asking the Court of Appeals to throw out those other punishments, which include a multiyear ban on him and his two eldest sons, Eric and Donald Trump Jr., from holding corporate leadership positions in New York.",
      "Those measures have been on hold during the appellate process and the Appellate Division judges said Mr. Trump can seek a court order to extend the pause pending further appeals. The Court of Appeals is the highest court in the Empire State.",
      "James' appeal is the latest twist in a lawsuit she filed against Mr. Trump in 2022, which alleged that he inflated his net worth by billions of dollars on his financial statements and habitually misled banks and others about the value of prized assets, including golf courses, hotels, Trump Tower and his Mar-a-Lago estate.",
      "After a trial that saw a sometimes testy Mr. Trump take the witness stand, Judge Arthur Engoron ruled last year that James had proven he engaged in a yearslong conspiracy with executives at his company to deceive banks and insurers about his wealth and assets.",
      "Engoron ordered Mr. Trump to pay $355 million \u2014 payback of what the judge deemed \"ill-gotten gains\" from his puffed-up financial statements. That amount soared to more than $527 million, including interest, by the time the Appellate Division ruled.",
      "The five-judge Appellate Division panel was sharply divided on many issues in Mr. Trump's appeal, but a majority said the monetary penalty was \"excessive.\"",

    "summary": "The announcement targeting Los Lobos and Los Choneros came after a lethal U.S. military strike\u200b against a similarly designated gang in Venezuela.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday that the United States is designating two Ecuadorian gangs as foreign terrorist organizations in the Trump administration's latest move against cartels.",
      "The announcement came as Rubio traveled to Ecuador to meet with its leaders in a trip to Latin America this week that has been overshadowed by a U.S. military strike against a similarly designated gang, Tren de Aragua. The strike has raised concerns in the region about whether the Trump administration will step up military activity to combat drug trafficking and illegal migration.",
      "The two new designees, Los Lobos and Los Choneros, are Ecuadorian gangs blamed for much of the violence that began since the COVID-19 pandemic. The designation, Rubio said, brings \"all sorts of options\" for the U.S. government to work in conjunction with the government of Ecuador to crack down on these groups.",
      "That includes the ability to kill them as well as take action against the properties and banking accounts in the U.S. for the group's members and people with ties to the criminal organizations, Rubio said, adding it would also help with intelligence sharing.",
      "Rubio called them \"vicious animals, these terrorists.\"",
      "Criminal gang violence continues unabated following the recapture in June of the country's biggest drug lord,\u00a0Adolfo Mac\u00edas, who leads Los Choneros, after his escape from a maximum-security prison in 2024. In July, the Ecuadoran government extradited Macias to the United States, where he faces multiple drug trafficking and firearms charges.",
      "Last year, the U.S. classified Los Choneros as one of the most violent gangs and affirmed its connection to powerful\u00a0Mexican drug cartels who threaten Ecuador and the surrounding region.",
      "Earlier this year, a leader of Los Lobos was\u00a0arrested at his home in the coastal city of Portoviejo. Carlos D, widely known by his alias El Chino, was the second-in-command of Los Lobos and \"considered a high-value target,\" the armed forces said in a statement.",
      "The U.S. last year declared Los Lobos to be the largest drug trafficking organization in Ecuador.",
      "\"Interdiction doesn't work\"",
      "Rubio's meetings in Quito on Thursday follow talks a day earlier with Mexican leaders that were overshadowed by the U.S. military strike on suspected Tren de Aragua drug runners in the southern Caribbean.",
      "The Trump administration asserts that it targeted a Venezuelan drug-running ship crewed by members of Tren de Aragua. U.S. officials say the vessel's cargo was intended for the United States and that the strike killed 11 people.",
      "Rubio defended the action and offered no justification other than to say the boat posed an \"immediate threat\" to the U.S. and that Trump opted to \"blow it up\" rather than follow what had been standard procedure to stop and board, arrest the crew and seize any contraband on board.",
      "\"Interdiction doesn't work,\" Rubio said Wednesday. \"Instead of interdicting it, on the president's orders, we blew it up. And it'll happen again. Maybe it's happening right now, I don't know, but the point is the president of the United States is going to wage war on narco-terrorist organizations.\"",
      "Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said on Wednesday that U.S. military assets will remain in the region, and that more strikes may be forthcoming.",
      "\"This is a deadly, serious mission for us and it won't stop with just this strike,\" Hegseth told Fox News. \"Anyone else trafficking in those waters who we know is a designated narco-terrorist will face the same fate.\"",
      "The strike got a mixed reaction from leaders around Latin America, where the U.S. history of military intervention and gunboat diplomacy is still fresh. Many, like officials in Mexico, were careful not to outright condemn the attack but stressed the importance of protecting national sovereignty and warning that expanded U.S. military involvement might actually backfire.",
      "Mexico Foreign Affairs Secretary Ram\u00f3n de la Fuente, speaking to reporters alongside Rubio, emphasized his country's preference for \"nonintervention, peaceful solution of conflicts.\"",
      "Ecuador has its own issues with narcotics trafficking and also has been looked to by the Trump administration as a possible destination to deport non-Ecuadorian migrants from the United States. U.S. officials have said they would like to secure an agreement with Ecuador that would have it accept such deportees, but the status of negotiations with Quito was not clear.",
      "Ecuador's president, Daniel Noboa, on Thursday thanked Rubio for the U.S. efforts to \"actually eliminate any terrorist threat.\" Before their meeting, Rubio had said on social media that the U.S. and Ecuador are \"aligned as key partners on ending illegal immigration and combatting transnational crime and terrorism.\"",
      "Surging violence since COVID-19 pandemic",
      "The latest U.N. World Drug Report says various countries in South America, including Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, reported larger cocaine seizures in 2022 than in 2021, but it does not give Venezuela the outsize role that the White House has in recent months.",
      "\"The impact of increased cocaine trafficking has been felt in Ecuador in particular, which has seen a wave of lethal violence in recent years linked to both local and transnational crime groups, most notably from Mexico and the Balkan countries,\" the report says.",
      "Violence has skyrocketed in Ecuador since the COVID-19 pandemic, as drug traffickers expanded operations in the country and took advantage of the nation's banana industry.",
      "The South American country is the world's largest exporter of bananas, shipping about 7.2 million tons a year by sea. Traffickers find containers filled with bananas the perfect vehicle to smuggle their product.",
      "In addition, cartels from Mexico, Colombia and the Balkans have settled in Ecuador because it uses the U.S. dollar and has weak laws and institutions, along with a network of long-established, ruthless gangs that are eager for work.",
      "Ecuador also gained prominence in the global cocaine trade after political changes in Colombia last decade. Coca bush fields in Colombia have been moving closer to the border with Ecuador due to the breakup of criminal groups after the 2016 demobilization of the rebel group Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, better known by its Spanish acronym FARC.",

    "story": [
      "The attorney general for the District of Columbia announced Thursday that the nation's capital is suing the Trump administration over the deployment of National Guard troops within the city's boundaries, alleging the violation amounts to an unconstitutional, \"involuntary military occupation.\"",
      "The suit alleges that President Trump \"has run roughshod over a fundamental tenet of American democracy \u2014 that the military should not be involved in domestic law enforcement.\"",
      "The lawsuit comes as Mr. Trump has declared the use of National Guard troops in D.C. a success, and voiced an interest in expanding his use of military assets to tackle crime in some of the nation's largest cities, including Chicago, Baltimore and New Orleans.",
      "And, it comes on the heels of a similar legal challenge in California meant to blunt that effort. There, a federal judge earlier this week objected to the president's decision in June to deploy troops to Los Angeles, saying the move violated a law known as the Posse Comitatus Act, which sharply limits the use of the military for domestic purposes. The White House has appealed.",
      "\"Deploying the National Guard to engage in law enforcement is not only unnecessary and unwanted, but it is also dangerous and harmful to the District and its residents,\" said D.C. Attorney General Brian L. Schwalb in a statement sent to CBS News.",
      "\"No American city should have the US military \u2014 particularly out-of-state military who are not accountable to the residents and untrained in local law enforcement \u2014 policing its streets,\" Schwalb said. \"It's DC today but could be any other city tomorrow.\"",
      "White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement that Mr. Trump was \"well within his lawful authority to deploy the National Guard in Washington\" and said the lawsuit is an attempt to \"undermine\" the president's operation.",
      "Since mid-August, nearly 2,300 National Guard troops have joined the District's police force and an array of federal agencies in stepping up visible patrols around the city. The action has coincided with a noticeable impact on crime numbers. An analysis by CBS News found that crime was down by almost half during the first 19 days of troop deployments in comparison to the same dates the previous year.",
      "But the actions have come over vocal objections from District officials who said they are depriving them of local autonomy.",
      "\"More than 50 years ago, Congress granted the District the right to self-governance and control over local matters, including maintenance of public safety and order,\" Schwalb said in a statement. \"Congress did not give the President authority to participate in local D.C. law enforcement as he sees fit.\"",
      "The case, filed in federal court, echoes some aspects of the California legal challenge, arguing that law enforcement is not legally the domain of the military. It also argues that the D.C. National Guard troops deployed in the action fall under the command of city officials unless the president declares a genuine national emergency.",
      "Schwalb was elected to the attorney general post by District residents in 2022 and Axios reported this week that he would seek reelection in 2026. The lawsuit comes as the Washington Post reported that House Republicans are contemplating legislation to remove him\u00a0 and replace him with a presidential appointee.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Justice Amy Coney Barrett said that the Supreme Court \"should not be imposing its own values on the American people,\" as the high court faces a longshot bid to revisit its decade-old landmark ruling legalizing same-sex marriage.",
      "In her first television interview since joining the Supreme Court in October 2020, Barrett told CBS News senior correspondent Norah O'Donnell that she wants Americans to \"understand the law,\" which she said is \"not just an opinion poll\" based on the views of the court's nine justices.",
      "\"You know, what the court is trying to do is see what the American people have decided. And sometimes the American people have expressed themselves in the Constitution itself, which is our fundamental law. Sometimes in statutes,\" she said. \"But the court should not be imposing its own values on the American people. That's for the democratic process.\"",
      "Barrett spoke with O'Donnell ahead of the release of her book, \"Listening to the Law: Reflections on the Court and Constitution,\" which hits shelves Sept. 9. At 53, she is the youngest member of the Supreme Court and could serve for decades. Barrett was appointed to the high court by President Trump during his first term, filling the seat held by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg until her death in September 2020, just weeks before the presidential election.",
      "Months after Barrett was confirmed by the Senate and sworn in as a justice, the Supreme Court agreed to decide whether to reverse Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that established the constitutional right to an abortion. The Supreme Court ultimately overturned that ruling in June 2022, leaving decisions about abortion access to the states. Since then, more than 20 states have restricted access to the procedure.",
      "Barrett was in the five-justice majority that voted to overturn Roe, and the decision raised concerns from critics that other precedents grounded in the 14th Amendment's Due Process Clause \u2014 namely those legalizing same-sex marriage and establishing the right to contraception \u2014 would be at risk of falling next.",
      "Bolstering those fears was a concurring opinion authored by Justice Clarence Thomas, which no other justice joined, in which he said the Supreme Court should reconsider those decisions.",
      "But Justice Brett Kavanaugh also addressed precedents involving contraception and gay marriage in his own solo concurring opinion, writing that \"overruling Roe does not mean the overruling of those precedents, and does not threaten or cast doubt on those precedents.\"",
      "Barrett wrote in her book \"the court has held that the rights to marry, engage in sexual intimacy, use birth control, and raise children are fundamental, but the rights to do business, commit suicide, and obtain abortion are not.\"",
      "The Supreme Court has been asked to overturn its 2015 ruling that recognized the constitutional right to same-sex marriage, Obergefell v. Hodges, in a case brought by Kim Davis, a former county clerk in Kentucky who stopped issuing marriage licenses on the heels of that decision 10 years ago.",
      "Davis's appeal faces long odds at the court. Whether to overturn Obergefell is one of three questions raised by Davis in her petition, and it's unclear whether there are four votes to reconsider the decision and five to overturn it.",
      "Still, some Democrats have suggested that the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, could dismantle the constitutional right to same-sex marriage.",
      "\"My prediction is they will do to gay marriage what they did to abortion \u2014 they will send it back to the states,\" former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said during a podcast interview with Jessica Tarlov, a co-host on Fox News' \"The Five.\"",
      "Barrett, though, rebuffed Clinton's prediction.",
      "\"I think people who criticize the court or who are outside say a lot of different things. But again, the point that I make in the book is that we have to tune those things out,\" she said.",

      "The difference in policy perception is connected to differences in approval of RFK Jr's job handling: Those who think he is making vaccines less available overwhelmingly disapprove of his job performance. Those who say he has not changed vaccine policy or made them more available are approving.",

      "Mr. Trump characterized his position as both realistic and optimistic, and said he is closely monitoring how both leaders are handling this crossroads in the negotiations.",
      "\"I've been watching it, I've been seeing it, and I've been talking about it with President Putin and President Zelenskyy,\" Mr. Trump said in a phone interview. \"Something is going to happen, but they are not ready yet. But something is going to happen. We are going to get it done.\"",

      "Mr. Trump also told CBS News on Wednesday that his approach to many diplomatic negotiations, be it with Russia and Ukraine or with other warring nations, is to bring together key leaders into a room and have them broker an agreement in real time, often with his guidance on the transaction \u2014 and to not write off any possibility before that happens.",
      "That approach, he said, demands patience, even when a quick resolution is sought, but he believes it has paid off in other peace agreements this year.",

    "published": "Wed, 03 Sep 2025 17:27:25 -0400",
    "summary": "Florida and other states have required several vaccines for kids attending school for decades. They protect against diseases like measles, polio, chickenpox and hepatitis B.",
    "story": [
      "Governor Ron DeSantis and state Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo have announced that Florida will work to phase out all childhood vaccine mandates in the state, making it the first in the nation to do so. Vaccines protecting against once-common and sometimes deadly childhood diseases like polio and measles have long been required for children at schools across the U.S.",
      "DeSantis also announced on Wednesday the creation of a state-level \"Make America Healthy Again\" commission modeled after similar initiatives pushed at the federal level by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "The vaccine announcement, which Ladapo said would allow people to make their own decisions, drew criticism from physician groups and other health leaders who stress that the vaccines are safe and the most effective way to stop the spread of communicable diseases, especially among schoolchildren.",
      "\"When everyone in a school is vaccinated, it is harder for diseases to spread and easier for everyone to continue learning and having fun,\" Dr. Rana Alissa, chair of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in an email. \"When children are sick and miss school, caregivers also miss work, which not only impacts those families but also the local economy.\"",
      "Dr. Philip Huang, director of the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department in Texas, described the idea of dropping school vaccine requirements as \"insane and stupid.\"",
      "\"People forget the successes that we've seen with these vaccines. Before we had the polio vaccine, there were almost 60,000 cases in the U.S. each year, and almost 14,000 cases of paralytic polio,\" Huang told CBS News. \"Parents waited fearfully every summer to see if it would strike.\"",
      "He noted it was similar for measles, which caused 48,000 hospitalizations and 450 to 500 deaths each year before the vaccine was introduced in the 1960s. Earlier this year, lower vaccination rates in some communities enabled the spread of the biggest measles outbreak in decades.",
      "\"it's so important to get those vaccination levels up so it protects everyone,\" Huang said.",
      "Ladapo likened vaccine mandates to \"slavery\"",
      "Ladapo, who has frequently\u00a0clashed with the medical establishment, cast current vaccine requirements in schools and elsewhere as an \"immoral\" intrusion on people's rights bordering on \"slavery,\" and said they hamper parents' ability to make health decisions for their children.",
      "\"People have a right to make their own decisions, informed decisions,\" Ladapo said at a news conference in Valrico, Florida, in the Tampa area. \"They don't have the right to tell you what to put in your body. Take it away from them.\"",
      "The state Health Department, Ladapo said, can scrap its own rules for some vaccine mandates, but others would require action by the Florida Legislature. He did not specify any particular vaccines but repeated several times the effort would end \"all of them. Every last one of them.\"",
      "Florida would be the first state to eliminate so many vaccine mandates, Ladapo added.",
      "Ladapo said his department will work with lawmakers to make it happen. But the idea received immediate pushback from some officials.",
      "Democratic state Rep. Anna Eskamani, who is running for Orlando mayor, said in a social media post that scrapping vaccines \"is reckless and dangerous\" and could cause outbreaks of preventable disease.",
      "\"This is a public health disaster in the making for the Sunshine State,\" she said on the social platform X.",
      "A prominent expert in the field, Dr. Michael Osterholm of the Vaccine Integrity Project, said the Florida proposal \"flies in the face of a mountain of evidence that clearly shows the benefits of vaccinating kids before they enter school, and it will make the state less safe to visit or live in.\u00a0 Every parent of a child who dies or who is hospitalized with a vaccine-preventable disease will know exactly why.\"",
      "Florida has required vaccines for kids attending school for decades",
      "In Florida, vaccine mandates for child day care facilities and public schools include shots for measles, chickenpox, hepatitis B, Diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTaP), polio and other diseases, according to the state Health Department's website.",
      "Under DeSantis, Florida resisted imposing COVID vaccines on schoolchildren, requiring \"passports\" for places that draw crowds, school closures and mandates that workers get the shots to keep their jobs.",
      "\"I don't think there's another state that's done as much as Florida. We want to stay ahead of the curve,\" the governor said.",
      "The state \"MAHA\" commission would look into such things as allowing informed consent in medical matters, promoting safe and nutritious food, boosting parental rights regarding medical decisions about their children, and eliminating \"medical orthodoxy that is not supported by the data,\" DeSantis said. The commission will be chaired by Lt. Gov. Jay Collins and Florida first lady Casey DeSantis.",
      "\"We're getting government out of the way, getting government out of your lives,\" Collins said.",
      "The commission's work will help inform a large \"medical freedom package\" to be introduced in the Legislature next session, which would address the vaccine mandates required by state law and make permanent the recent state COVID decisions relaxing restrictions, DeSantis said.",
      "\"There will be a broad package,\" the governor said.",
      "Other states coordinating on vaccine planning",
      "Meanwhile, the Democratic governors of Washington, Oregon and California announced Wednesday that\u00a0they've created an alliance\u00a0to coordinate on health and vaccination guidelines,\u00a0 to counter what they call the Trump administration's politicizing of public health decisions.",

      "Mr. Trump said Tuesday that the U.S. had struck the boat\u00a0in international waters after it had departed from Venezuela. The president later\u00a0said on Truth Social\u00a0that 11 people were killed in the strike. He said the attack targeted members of\u00a0Tren de Aragua, a Venezuela-based organized crime group that has been\u00a0designated\u00a0as a foreign terrorist organization by the Trump administration.",
      "Mr. Trump also posted a video that appeared to show a military strike obliterating a small boat in the open sea.",
      "Hegseth told \"Fox & Friends\" on Wednesday morning that he watched the strike live. He said the video was \"definitely not artificial intelligence,\" as Venezuela's Communications Minister Freddy \u00d1\u00e1\u00f1ez claimed in a post on social media. Hegseth said that he could not elaborate on how the operation had been carried out, but said it was a \"precision\" attack.",
      "\"We knew exactly who was in that boat, we knew exactly what they were doing, and we knew exactly who they represented, and that was Tren de Aragua ... trying to poison our country with illicit drugs,\" Hegseth said.",
      "Hegseth did not say how the government identified the boat or those aboard it. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters on Tuesday that he believed the drugs were headed toward Trinidad and Tobago or another country in the Caribbean. Kamla Persad-Bissessar, the prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago, praised the strike in a statement issued late Tuesday, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Hegseth said Wednesday that the strike shows that \"President Trump is willing to go on offense in ways that others have not been\" when dealing with drug smugglers.",
      "\"You want to try to traffic drugs, it's a new day,\" the defense secretary said. \"It's a different day, and so those 11 drug traffickers are no longer with us, sending a very clear signal that this is an activity the United States is not going to tolerate in our hemisphere.\"",
      "Hegseth said that assets will remain in the region, and that further strikes may be forthcoming.",
      "\"This is a deadly, serious mission for us and it won't stop with just this strike,\" he said. \"Anyone else trafficking in those waters who we know is a designated narco-terrorist will face the same fate.\"",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0directed the military\u00a0to target drug cartels in Latin America last month. In August, the U.S. said the Navy would increase its presence near Venezuela and deploy multiple warships as part of an anti-drug cartel mission. Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u00a0called the move\u00a0an \"extravagant, unjustifiable, immoral and absolutely criminal and bloody threat.\" Maduro responded by deploying\u00a0warships and drones to Venezuela's coastline.",
      "The U.S. has not indicated it plans to strike Venezuela directly. When Hegseth was asked Wednesday by Fox News about the possibility of a regime change in the country, he said it was a \"presidential decision.\" The Trump administration has\u00a0accused Maduro's government\u00a0of working with drug cartels and groups like Tren de Aragua to bring illicit substances into the United States.",
      "A U.S. federal court charged Maduro\u00a0with narco-terrorism and drug trafficking\u00a0in 2020, allegations that Maduro has denied. The U.S. is offering a $50 million\u00a0reward for Maduro's arrest.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Congress returns this week from its August recess staring down a deadline to fund the government and avert a possible shutdown by month's end.",
      "But a handful of other GOP priorities \u2014 from cracking down on crime to fast-tracking President Trump's nominees \u2014 have surfaced in recent weeks, along with lingering tensions and partisan disagreements, promising a chaotic return to Washington, and a lengthy to-do list.",
      "Here's what's on lawmakers' agenda as Congress returns:",
      "Government funding fight",
      "A familiar deadline is fast approaching, as Congress must race to keep the government funded by Sept. 30.",
      "While the House and Senate each passed a small number of funding bills before leaving Washington for the August recess, the two chambers have been on different pages when it comes to funding levels. Getting all 12 individual appropriations bills through both chambers is unlikely, meaning lawmakers will almost certainly have to rely on a short-term measure to keep the government funded.",
      "The dynamic isn't unusual. Congress regularly struggles to approve the new funding before the end of the fiscal year, opting instead to push the deadline down the road by keeping the government funded at current levels on a temporary basis. But this time around, the funding fight itself has taken on new meaning.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer came under intense scrutiny from his own party during the last funding fight in March. After pledging to fight the GOP plan, which increased defense spending while decreasing non-defense spending below 2024 levels, he changed course at the eleventh hour. Ultimately, Schumer opted to deliver one of the Democratic votes necessary to propel the partisan measure to passage and prevent a shutdown, arguing that a shutdown risked more damage.",
      "This time around, Democratic leaders have worked to engage on the funding issue well ahead of the deadline. Early last month, Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries called for a \"Big Four\" meeting with their GOP counterparts to discuss funding the government. In a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson, the Democrats said that \"it is clear that the Trump Administration and many within your party are preparing to 'go it alone' and continue to legislate on a solely Republican basis.\"",
      "Still, the letter didn't appear to kickstart a bipartisan effort. And Mr. Trump, asked about meeting with the Democratic leaders last month, said he would do it, while saying it's \"almost a waste of time to meet because they never approve anything.\" The Democrats renewed their call for a meeting between congressional leaders last week, writing that the \"government funding issue must be resolved in a bipartisan way. That is the only viable path forward.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats have bemoaned the White House's efforts to claw back funds already appropriated in what's known as a rescissions package earlier this year, along with a new push by the administration last week to claw back nearly $5 billion in foreign aid funds that Congress already approved. The rarely used maneuver, known as a pocket rescission, is an attempt to rescind funding unilaterally, sparking pushback on Capitol Hill and bipartisan criticism as an \"unlawful\" move.",
      "\"Today's announcement of the Administration's plan to advance an unlawful 'pocket rescission' package is further proof President Trump and Congressional Republicans are hellbent on rejecting bipartisanship and 'going it alone' this fall,\" Schumer said in a statement.",
      "The dynamics put the parties on a collision course heading toward the Sept. 30 deadline.",
      "While Republicans have majorities in the House and Senate, they will need 60 votes in the Senate to keep the government funded, meaning they will need the support of at least seven Democrats.",
      "At the same time, some in the party, including Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin, have encouraged Democrats to let the government shut down to protest Mr. Trump's policies.",
      "\"We cannot be the only one playing by the rules with a hand tied behind our backs,\" Martin said. \"That old playbook, the norms that, you know, used to have guardrails on our democracy and protect all of us in this country \u2014 that doesn't exist anymore. We've got to throw that playbook out the window because the Republicans have.\"",
      "Changes to Senate nomination rules",
      "Senators left Washington after a bruising nominations saga in July. Democrats have slow-walked Mr. Trump's nominees in recent months, putting up procedural hurdles to delay confirmations nearly across the board. Senate Democrats were unable to come to an agreement with the White House in an episode that foreshadowed a larger fight to come.",
      "\"Donald Trump tried to bully us, go around us, threaten us, call us names \u2014 but he got nothing. And he walked away with his tail between his legs,\" Schumer told reporters before leaving for the August recess.",
      "Schumer has railed against the White House for walking away from a deal involving the release of already appropriated funds in exchange for cooperation from Democrats to swiftly approve a group of nominees. Meanwhile, the president called the Democrat's demands \"egregious and unprecedented.\"",
      "Without a deal, Senate Republicans are expected to pursue changes to the nominations process that would allow them to more swiftly confirm the president's nominees upon their return.",
      "Sen. John Barrasso, the No. 2 Senate Republican, urged in an op-ed last week that it's \"time to change Senate confirmation rules\" amid what he described as a \"bitter fight\" over even routine nominations. He said that the Senate GOP is \"considering changes to the Senate rules to end the most egregious delay tactics.\"",
      "\"Senate Republicans are determined to confirm Mr. Trump's qualified nominees one way or another,\" Barrasso wrote.",
      "What the changes look like remains to be seen. Both Democrats and Republicans have made pushes to change the confirmation process in recent years, like by cutting down the time requirements for the nominations and reducing the number of votes needed to a simple majority.",
      "Confirming Trump's nominees for BLS chair and Fed governor",
      "The possible changes to the confirmation process come as a handful of new high-profile nominees are expected to come before the Senate, in addition to the dozens already awaiting votes.",
      "Mr. Trump fired the former Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner last month over a weaker-than-expected July jobs report. He soon announced E.J. Antoni as his nominee to lead the agency. Mr. Trump said in his announcement that Antoni, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, \"will ensure that the Numbers released are HONEST and ACCURATE.\"",
      "But the nominee could face pushback in the Senate, with questions about his experience and comments he's made suggesting the monthly jobs report should be suspended.",
      "The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions is planning to hold a confirmation hearing for Antoni pending completed paperwork, according to a committee spokesperson. The panel includes a handful of Senate Republicans who have pushed back on some of Mr. Trump's most controversial nominees this year: Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, the committee chairman, along with Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and Rand Paul of Kentucky.",
      "Democrats on the committee demanded that the panel hold a full hearing on Antoni's nomination. And Sen. Patty Murray of Washington called Antoni \"an unqualified right-wing extremist who won't think twice about manipulating BLS data.\"",
      "The Senate is also expected to work to confirm Stephen Miran, the chair of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, to fill a vacated seat on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors. Mr. Trump announced the nomination in August after Adriana Kugler stepped down. The Senate Banking Committee is set to hold a confirmation hearing this week. But Democrats on the committee have called for a delay, seeking instead to hold an oversight hearing on Mr. Trump's moves to fire another member of the Fed board.",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump said he had fired another member of the Fed board, Lisa Cook, accusing her of making false statements on mortgage documents. Governors can only be fired \"for cause\" and Cook has refused to resign. She sued the president to block her firing last week.",
      "The push to oust Susan Monarez, the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, could also tee up another Senate confirmation process. The upper chamber confirmed Monarez for the post in late July, though she had been serving as the acting head of the CDC since January. CBS News reported last week that Jim O'Neill, the deputy secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, has been selected to serve as the acting director of the CDC.",
      "Trump seeks crime bill, extension of DC police takeover",
      "Mr. Trump has moved to crack down on crime in the nation's capital by federalizing the District of Columbia's Metropolitan Police Department and deploying the National Guard to the district to assist law enforcement. He signaled in recent weeks that he plans to ask Congress to approve \"long-term extensions\" to maintain control of D.C.'s police, along with other measures to address crime.",
      "In an Aug. 11 executive order, Mr. Trump directed the D.C. mayor to provide the services of D.C. police for federal use \"for the maximum period permitted under section 740 of the Home Rule Act,\" which the president can extend for up to 30 days. Any extension beyond that requires a joint resolution passed by the House and Senate. That could run into trouble in the Senate, where the Republican majority would need the support of at least seven Democrats to move forward.",
      "Mr. Trump also indicated last month that he plans to seek around $2 billion from Congress to renovate the streets of Washington. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said the White House was working on a package \"to improve the safety and quality of life in our nation's capital\" which he and GOP Sen. Katie Britt of Alabama would spearhead.",
      "\"He wants $2.5 billion, I'm going to try to find him the money, to repave the roads, take the graffiti off the building, refurbish the parts and give homeless people some place to go other than a tent on the side of the road,\" Graham said at an event in South Carolina last month.",
      "Mr. Trump has suggested that his crackdown on crime in D.C. could soon extend to other major cities, though he has unique authority in the nation's capital because the district is ultimately controlled by the federal government. Last week, the president wrote in a post on Truth Social about a crime bill, saying he's working with GOP leaders in Congress on the measure, though the details remained unclear.",
      "\"Speaker Mike Johnson, and Leader John Thune, are working with me, and other Republicans, on a Comprehensive Crime Bill,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's what our Country need, and NOW! More to follow.\"",
      "Push for Epstein files",
      "Lawmakers were on recess for weeks, but the calls for access to files in the case of late child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein haven't gone away.",
      "Controversy has swirled around the Epstein files since the Justice Department issued the findings of an internal review in July that found no \"client list\" or evidence that Epstein had blackmailed prominent figures. Epstein, a well-connected financier who was convicted of sex trafficking, died in federal custody in 2019. But renewed interest in the files has prompted members of both parties to call for more transparency, while dividing Mr. Trump's base.",
      "As House Democrats and some Republicans pushed for a floor vote to force the release of the Epstein files in late July, Johnson opted to send the House home early. But some lawmakers are still pressing ahead.",
      "Reps. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, and Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, introduced legislation in July to compel the Justice Department to release the files within 30 days, with plans to force a vote on the measure once lawmakers return from recess. Massie and Khanna are set to host a news conference at the Capitol Wednesday alongside survivors of Epstein's abuse.",
      "The expected moves in Congress come after the administration late last month released transcripts of a two-day interview with Epstein's longtime associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, that was conducted in Florida in July. Meanwhile, the Department of Justice sent some of the files related to Epstein to the House Oversight Committee, which plans to make the records public after redactions have been made.",

      "To earn the full pay package, Tesla would have to reach a market cap of $8.5 trillion \u2014 about eight times its current value \u2014 in 10 years. At that level, the stock awarded to Musk would be worth more than $1 trillion.",
      "Tesla would also need to hit certain operational targets for Musk to collect the full pay package. Those include delivering 20 million vehicles; producing 1 million of the automaker's self-driving \"robotaxis\"; and manufacturing 1 million of the company's humanoid robots, dubbed Optimus, which are currently under development.",
      "The proposed new compensation scheme \"represents a critical next step to keep Musk as CEO at least until 2030,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a report, adding that Tesla is \"heading into one of the most important stages of its growth cycle with the autonomous and robotics future now on the doorstep.\"",
      "The entrepreneur's previous compensation has drawn legal challenges.

      "Last month, U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams ordered the state of Florida and federal government to immediately stop expanding the facility and to start dismantling its fences, lights and generators within 60 days.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/florida-vaccine-mandates-united-states-measles-polio-mmr/",
    "published": "Thu, 04 Sep 2025 16:39:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Students have long been required to receive vaccinations for once-common childhood illnesses like polio and measles. What if that changes?",
    "story": [
      "Florida officials announced that the state will work to phase out all childhood vaccine mandates, becoming the first in the U.S. to do so. Health experts say such a move raises the risk of deadly disease outbreaks.",
      "Students have long been required to receive vaccinations for once-common childhood illnesses like polio and measles. A large majority of Americans believe the government should make vaccines more available and should encourage vaccination against measles, mumps and rubella,\u00a0a CBS News poll found.",
      "In the past few years, the United States has seen rising numbers of families getting vaccine exemptions for non-medical reasons, and vaccination rates have declined. Some states have made it easier to seek such exemptions. Florida's plan to roll back requirements would be the most sweeping change to vaccine regulations by far.",
      "Why do schools have vaccine mandates?",
      "Communities need to maintain high rates of vaccination to prevent outbreaks of disease and achieve what's called herd immunity, public health experts say. Herd immunity helps protect vulnerable members of the population who can't get vaccinated, like those who are too young or immunocompromised. For a disease like measles, the CDC says a herd immunity threshold of 95% is necessary to avoid outbreaks.",
      "School vaccine mandates are an \"important tool\" to maintain herd immunity, said Liz Williams, a senior policy manager with KFF's Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured.",
      "\"It's so important to get those vaccination levels up so it protects everyone,\" Dr. Philip Huang, director of the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department, told CBS News. \"When you make it a requirement, that's where you get the rates up to where we need to protect everyone.\"",
      "Routine childhood vaccinations also keep \"children, families and their communities healthy and thriving,\" Dr. Susan J. Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics,\u00a0said in August.",
      "School vaccination rules vary by state. Most states require students receive vaccinations for polio, chicken pox, diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTaP) and measles, mumps and rubella (MMR), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some states also require vaccination for meningitis and hepatitis B.",
      "\"When everyone in a school is vaccinated, it is harder for diseases to spread and easier for everyone to continue learning and having fun,\" Dr. Rana Alissa, chair of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in an email to The Associated Press on Wednesday. \"When children are sick and miss school, caregivers also miss work, which not only impacts those families but also the local economy.\"",
      "Will other states ban vaccine mandates?",
      "Florida is the first state to announce plans to entirely roll back vaccine mandates, but it's not clear when the changes will take effect. Some of the vaccine requirements can be struck down by the health department, while others will require legislative approval. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said a state \"Make America Healthy Again\" commission will help create a \"medical freedom package\" to be introduced in the state Legislature next session.",
      "Idaho loosened many of its rules on immunizations in a new law that took effect over the summer. The \"Idaho Medical Freedom Act\" prohibits schools, companies and government entities from denying admission or services to a person who has not received a \"medical intervention,\" including vaccines. The law weakens school vaccine mandates, said Williams, but does not go as far as Florida's plan.",
      "Idaho is also one of three states \u2014 along with Montana and Iowa \u2014 that have debated legislation that would limit the use of mRNA vaccines, according to Axios. Louisiana officials have not commented on banning vaccine mandates, but said in February\u00a0that they will stop promoting mass vaccination campaigns.",
      "Parents, across political lines, are overwhelmingly supportive of schools requiring vaccines for measles and polio, according to\u00a0a KFF-Washington Post poll.",
      "States allow for increased vaccine exemptions",
      "At least 10 states have made changes to state-level vaccination requirement policies in the last year, said Williams. Most of those changes will result in more students claiming exemptions from vaccine policies, she said. Areas with higher rates of vaccine exemptions tend to have lower vaccination rates and be at an increased risk for outbreaks, Williams said.",
      "There are two kinds of vaccine exemptions: medical and non-medical exemptions. Non-medical exemptions include those for personal reasons or religious beliefs. All states allow for medical exemptions. California, New York, Maine, Rhode Island and West Virginia do not allow for non-medical exemptions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "The country has already seen a rise in vaccine exemptions in recent years, according to CDC data, and hit a record high last year. During the 2021-2022 school year, 2.2% of students had an exemption for at least one vaccine. Of those, 1.9% were for non-medical reasons. By the 2024-2025 school year, 3.6% students had an exemption for at least one vaccine with 2.4% of those exemptions for non-medical reasons.",
      "Idaho had the highest rate of exemptions during the 2024-2025 school year, at 15.4%, according to CDC data. Nearly all, or 15.1%, of those exemptions are for non-medical reasons. The state with the next highest rate of exemptions is Alaska, at 9.4%.",
      "The rise in exemptions has led to falling vaccination rates overall. CDC data shows that about 92.1% of kindergarteners received the DTaP vaccine, while 92.5% received the MMR and polio vaccines. The numbers are all down slightly from the previous school year, the CDC said.",
      "\"We've seen children's vaccination rates for routine childhood vaccination decline since the pandemic, and we've also seen exemptions to school vaccination increase,\" Williams said. \"It's likely a lot of these state level policy changes are going to continue to contribute to these trends (of) more exemptions and lower vaccination rates.\"",
      "What happens if vaccine rates fall?",
      "If vaccine rates fall below the numbers needed to maintain herd immunity, experts say the U.S. could see more outbreaks of preventable disease.",
      "Earlier this year, a measles outbreak erupted in a community in West Texas with low vaccination rates, leading to the U.S. recording the most cases of the potentially deadly illness in 30 years. Infections were confirmed in at least 39 states, with more than 1,400 cases nationwide. CDC data showed 92% of the people sickened had not received a measles vaccine or were of unknown vaccination status.",
      "Lower vaccination rates have also enabled a number of cases of polio, which had officially been considered eliminated in the U.S. years ago.",
      "\"People forget the successes that we've seen with these vaccines. Before we had the polio vaccine, there were almost 60,000 cases in the U.S. each year, and almost 14,000 cases of paralytic polio,\" Huang, of the Dallas County health department,\u00a0told CBS News. \"Parents waited fearfully every summer to see if it would strike.\"",
      "Worldwide, vaccines have saved 154 million lives, mostly infants, in the past 50 years, according to the World Health Organization. The CDC says that childhood vaccinations prevent about 4 million deaths worldwide each year.",

    "summary": "The U.S. government could have to refund domestic businesses billions in tariffs, should the Supreme Court uphold a recent federal appeals court ruling.",
    "story": [
      "American businesses could be owed tens of billions of dollars in refunds for tariffs they paid on foreign goods.",
      "U.S. Customs and Border Protection has collected more than $200 billion in tariff revenue from American businesses of all sizes from October through August 24, according to agency data. Of that, more than $70 billion comes from payments of country-based tariffs that\u00a0a federal appeals court recently ruled\u00a0President Trump lacked the authority to impose.",
      "Industry-specific tariffs, such as steel and aluminum levies, are unaffected by Friday's ruling.",
      "The court on Friday ruled that President Trump unlawfully invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to impose sweeping tariffs of up to 145% on dozens of U.S. trade partners. Mr. Trump on Wednesday asked the Supreme Court to review the federal appeals court's decision before it takes effect on Oct. 14.",
      "Mr. Trump's appeal means that, for now, there's no guarantee businesses will receive refunds. That spells more uncertainty for enterprises struggling to balance raising prices to cover the cost of levies against potentially turning away customers, according to supply chain experts.",
      "\"From the supply chain perspective, we are seeing a lot of uncertainty, which has been the case since April 2,\" Scott Pruneau, CEO of ITS Logistics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"No one knows how to price their goods, because you can't whipsaw your customers on pricing.\"",
      "If the court's decision stands, the U.S. government could have to return billions in tariff revenue it has collected from businesses.",
      "\"It'd be very challenging\"",
      "But even if the Supreme Court strikes down the tariffs, businesses could still face hurdles in collecting refunds for the levies they've already paid the U.S. government, experts told CBS MoneyWatch. For one, there is no guarantee that whatever kind of refund system the government sets up would be automatic or that the process will be simple.",
      "\"There's been speculation that if ultimately, the Supreme Court overturns the tariffs, then Customs could just issue refunds, but I don't know that it's going to happen that way,\" Felicia Pullam, former executive director of the Office of Trade Relations at U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and the current senior director for geo-commerce at APCO, a global advisory firm, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The easiest way would be for Customs to put a process in place and issue refunds, rather than make companies go and apply,\" she added.",
      "Ultimately, however, if refunds are owed, it would be up to the Trump administration to decide how to administer them. \"It'd be very challenging, but I am confident CBP could handle it.\"",
      "U.S. Customs and Border Protection didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "Requests for refunds",
      "Ted Murphy, co-leader of Sidley Austin's global arbitration, trade and advocacy practice, told CBS MoneyWatch that if the Supreme Court affirms the federal circuit court's ruling that Trump's reliance on IEEPA to impose country-based tariffs was illegal, the government would have to cease collecting tariffs from companies.",
      "When it comes to recouping levies that have already been paid, there are three ways refunds could be administered, Murphy said.",
      "Most simply, the government could provide automatic refunds to businesses for levy amounts paid. \"The government has that information, so it could happen automatically,\" Murphy told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I don't think that's particularly likely, but it is an option.\"",
      "The government could instead decide that only the plaintiffs who filed suit against the tariffs are entitled to refunds, and require additional parties seeking refunds to bring similar legal actions. \"In that case, you'd see tens and tens of thousands of people filing complaints at the Court of International Trade,\" he said.",
      "But the most likely repayment option in Murphy's view would be that the government agrees to refund duties paid by parties who submit requests for reimbursement.",
      "Historical precedent for refunds",
      "There's precedent for the government reimbursing businesses for tariff payments that were later deemed unlawful. In 1998, the Supreme Court struck down a harbor maintenance tax assessed on exports, which had been imposed by the Reagan administration. The government then owed companies more than a billion dollars in refunds, which it required companies to apply for in order to receive.",
      "Dan Anthony, president of Trade Partnership Worldwide, a trade consultancy, echoed Murphy, saying that it is hard to predict how the government might choose to process refunds, should the Supreme Court determine they are owed.",
      "\"It's up to the administration to decide, and that's where it gets very complicated and speculative,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Technically speaking, issuing refunds wouldn't be hard. \"Theoretically, the government could quite quickly figure out who paid what, and refund it to the payer,\" he said. \"But the government could also make it very difficult and force people to make requests.\"",
      "That would create work for companies, but also for the government, which would then have to review requests for refunds from thousands of companies. \"That's infinitely more work for the government, but it's pretty clear the government does not want to give money back, so if you make it a difficult process, then a number of importers are probably not going to pursue it,\" Anthony said.",
      "Large refunds to businesses could weigh on the Treasury's finances, TD Securities analysts noted in a report Thursday. \"Treasury would likely step up bill supply even further to obtain the extra funds, creating little disruption in longer-dated yields, but potentially pressuring funding spreads,\" TD Securities analysts said.",
      "The Trump administration could also turn to other emergency powers to replace the IEEPA tariffs in order to maintain the U.S.' effective tariff rate, the analysts noted.",

    "story": [
      "A mapping tool that aims to provide forecasters and communities with flooding information has expanded to cover 60% of the U.S. population, the National Weather Service announced Thursday. With this development, the experimental tool promises to serve twice as many Americans as it did before.",
      "The Flood Inundation Mapping, or FIM, tool is designed to show Google Earth-like visualizations of flood waters as they are either impacting, or forecasted to impact, neighborhoods across the country, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA. NOAA is the federal parent agency of the Weather Service, which is a primary source of weather forecasts during emergencies, including floods.",
      "The interactive, online tool allows people to learn more about flood forecasts or observations that could affect them, by exploring their regions, cities or neighborhoods. NOAA said the mapping interface updates almost in real time, which will support Weather Service forecasters in issuing flood watches and warnings.",
      "Some local forecast offices have already had access to the tool for two years, while others have had access for one year, depending on where they are. When it launched in 2023, the tool offered flooding information for about 10% of the U.S. population, and it expanded to include 30% last September, according to NOAA.",
      "On social media\u00a0Wednesday, NOAA and the Weather Service shared a simulated image generated by the tool, which showed possible flooding along the Tug Fork River in Warfield, Kentucky, in February.",
      "\"Local emergency teams used those maps to deploy the National Guard with high-water vehicles to affected neighborhoods where they evacuated all the residents before water entered their apartments,\" the agencies said.",
      "Originally, the mapping feature was accessible to forecasting offices in parts of Louisiana, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas, and it later grew to include much larger parts of the Great Lakes, Mid-Atlantic, Mississippi Valley and Pacific Northwest regions. Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands were also covered.",
      "The latest expansion means forecasters can use the map's services in the Great Plains, interior Southeast, Southwest and West Coast. It now covers Hawaii and parts of Alaska, too, including the Cook Inlet, Kenai Peninsula, Copper River and Prince William Sound, where flooding can be especially severe.",
      "\"Flooding is the most frequent severe weather-related threat, and our costliest natural disaster,\" said David Vallee of NOAA's National Water Center, in a statement. \"Expanding our FIM availability has been a game-changer in providing actionable, real-time information to emergency and water resource managers, and will expand the delivery of impact-based decision support services to our core partners who work to keep Americans safe and informed.\"",
      "The mapping tool will be fully activated across the U.S. next year, NOAA said, adding that it will include 110,000 river miles near the Weather Service's river forecast centers, which handle predictions in different regions. It will also cover more than 3.6 million miles of rivers being monitored for the National Water Model, a massive simulation that uses real data to help forecasters make predictions about the flow of rivers and streams throughout the U.S.",
      "Sharpening communications between forecasters, emergency managers and first responders during weather emergencies, like\u00a0the catastrophic floods that struck Texas\u00a0in July, is a subject of national concern, particularly at the peak of the current hurricane season.",

      "\"We're going to build a little model that makes the old one obsolete. Then that model can be replicated across the country,\" Mannix said.",

      "But now, fire officials in Los Angeles County are starting to break from that long-standing message, saying some residents may be able to stay back and fight to protect their homes amid a growing threat.",
      "\"We've always told people that when the evacuation order comes, you must leave,\" L.A. County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone told CBS News. \"We've departed from that narrative. With the proper training, with the proper equipment, and with the proper home hardening and defensible space, you can stay behind and prevent your house from burning down.\"",
      "Marrone's stance may signal a shift in how officials talk about wildfire response.",

      "CBS News' Los Angeles-based correspondent Carter Evans was covering the Palisades Fire on Jan. 7, when it became clear that his family's own home was under threat and firefighters were overwhelmed. Evans and his wife, Lauren, also a reporter, defended their home, drawing on decades of experience covering wildfires.",
      "The couple chased every ember with garden hoses for 14 hours and helped put out spot fires at nearby homes.",
      "For Marrone, these stories point to a hard reality: \"There are not enough firefighters or fire engines to adequately defend every structure.\"",
      "\"And there will never be,\" he added.",
      "Staying behind isn't for everyone \u2014 especially those with health problems or if there's no escape route. To do it safely, L.A. County Fire created a community brigade. Firefighters trained residents like Keegan Gibbs, who lost his home in a wildfire.",

    "story": [
      "Lisbon \u2014 Two days after Portugal's worst-ever electric streetcar crash killed 16 people and left more than 20 others from across the globe injured, forensics teams in Lisbon said Friday that they had identified nearly all of the victims, many of whom were crushed to death when the famed Elevador da Gloria funicular hurtled out of control down a steep hill, derailed and careened into a building.",
      "While names have not yet been disclosed, Portugal's attorney-general said Friday morning that the death toll includes two South Koreans, two Swiss nationals, one French national and five Portuguese citizens.",
      "A U.S. State Department spokesperson confirmed to CBS News on Thursday that one American was also among the 16 people killed, but they did not identify the victim.",
      "\"Our staff in Lisbon and here in the United States are working tirelessly to provide consular assistance to the victim and their family.\u00a0 We extend our condolences to the victims and families of all those affected,\" the official said. \"The Embassy is working closely with local authorities to assist U.S. citizens in the affected area, and continues to monitor the situation closely. Due to privacy considerations, we have no additional details at this time.\"",
      "There is also \"a high possibility,\" based on recovered documents and other evidence, that the victims include two Canadians, one German and one Ukrainian, according to the head of the national investigative police, Lu\u00eds Neves. CBS News' partner network BBC News said Friday that Portuguese police believed three British nationals were also among those killed.",
      "At least 21 other passengers were injured, including people from Portugal, Spain, Israel, Brazil, Italy and France, according to the head of Portugal's National Health Service.",
      "Millions of people ride Lisbon's iconic yellow-and-white funicular cars each year. It's a popular experience for foreign tourists, and the Elevador da Gloria, at almost 140 years old, has long been a big attraction. In 2024, an estimated 29 million foreigners visited Portugal, many passing through the capital and its quiet, cobblestone streets and hills.",
      "But the electric street cars and hillside funiculars are also part of everyday life for many locals.",
      "A Portuguese charity based on the hill near the top of the Elevador da Gloria funicular confirmed Friday that four of its employees were killed in the accident. They were believed to have been commuting from work.",
      "\"We have lost colleagues, friends and the people who we shared our daily lives as well as our mission\", the Santa Casa da Misericordia said in a statement. \"We're in a state of shock.\"",
      "Portugal's President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, Prime Minister Luis Montenegro and Lisbon Mayor Carlos Moedas attended a Mass in the early evening on Thursday near the site of the crash. Speaking to reporters outside the church, Rebelo de Sousa said: \"This is a time of mourning. It's the moment to mourn the dead... pray and think of the dead, and to support their friends and family.\"",
      "The president also called for a clarification of the causes of the accident \"as quickly as possible.\"",
      "After midnight on Friday, and with few onlookers, workers lifted the mangled wreckage of the Elevador da Gloria car that crashed.",
      "As with most funiculars, two carriages linked by a steel cable operate in tandem: One carriage climbs up the hill as the other trundles slowly down. Early Wednesday evening, many people believe that cable snapped, causing the tragedy.",
      "Portuguese media showed officials inspecting the frayed ends of the cable that had connected the cars, which they had pulled up from underground, on Friday. According to a fire brigade official, the car coming down from the top of the hill was not able to slow down, entered a curve in the hill too fast, derailed, and then plowed into the cobblestone pavement and crashed.",
      "Cable and brake failures are two of the most common causes of streetcar accidents.",
      "The president of the Portuguese Order of the Engineers, Almeis Santos, told CBS News the accident appeared to have been caused by the rupture of the cable.",
      "\"It's very strange... for this kind of cable. It's not normal and it's almost impossible to have [a] sudden rupture,\" he said.",
      "Santos said if the cable did snap suddenly, neither the manual nor automatic brakes on the funicular would have been sufficient to hold back the streetcars, which, when loaded with passengers weigh around 20 tons each.",
      "Carris, the company that operates the Elevador da Gloria, has said regular inspections \u2014 including daily checks \u2014 had been carried out as required.",
      "Portugal's Air and Rail Accident Investigation Unit was expected to release a preliminary report on the technical cause of the funicular crash later Friday. In 45 days, Portugal's national police will then issue their report on any potential criminality involved in the crash.",

      "Tren de Aragua originated more than a decade ago at an infamously lawless prison with hardened criminals in Venezuela's central state of Aragua. The gang has expanded in recent years, recruiting from among the more than 7.7 million Venezuelans who have fled economic turmoil in their homeland and migrated to other Latin American countries or the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump and administration officials have consistently blamed the gang for being at the root of the violence and illicit drug dealing that plague some U.S. cities. Mr. Trump has repeated his claim \u2014 contradicted by a declassified U.S. intelligence assessment \u2014 that Tren de Aragua is operating under Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's control.",
      "During his 2024 presidential campaign, Mr. Trump described Aurora, Colorado, as a \"war zone\" overrun with members of the gang. The city's police chief rejected that characterization, explaining the gang was tied to organized violent crime concentrated in three apartment complexes in the city.",
      "Aurora Police Chief Todd Chamberlain said earlier this year his department had counted a total of nine confirmed Tren de Aragua members who passed through Aurora in the last two years.",
      "The size of the gang is unclear. Countries with large populations of Venezuelan migrants, including Peru and Colombia, have accused the group of being behind a spree of violence in the region.",
      "Authorities in Chile first identified the gang's operations in 2022. Prosecutors and investigators have said the group initially engaged primarily in human trafficking, organizing unauthorized border crossings and sexual exploitation, but over time, members have expanded their activities to more violent crimes, such as kidnapping, torture, extortion and became more involved in drug trafficking.",
      "While Tren de Argua has dominated ketamine trafficking in Chile, unlike other criminal organizations from Colombia, Central America and Brazil, it has no large-scale involvement in smuggling cocaine across international borders, according to InSight Crime, a think tank that last month published a 64-page report on the gang based on two years of research.",
      "\"We've found no direct participation of TdA in the transnational drug trade, although there are cases of them acting as subcontractors for other drug trafficking organizations,\" said Jeremy McDermott, a Colombia-based co-founder of InSight Crime.",
      "McDermott added that with affiliated cells spread across Latin America, it would not be a huge leap for the gang to one day delve into the drug trade.",
      "Landlocked Bolivia and Colombia, with access to the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea and a border with Venezuela, are the world's top cocaine producers.",
      "Trump designated Tren de Aragua a foreign terrorist organization",
      "On his first day in office, Mr. Trump took steps to designate the gang a foreign terrorist organization alongside several Mexican drug cartels. The Biden administration had sanctioned the gang and offered $12 million in rewards for the arrest of three of its leaders.",
      "Mr. Trump's executive order accused the gang of working closely with top Maduro officials \u2014 most notably the former vice president and one-time governor of Aragua state, Tareck El Aissami \u2014 to infiltrate migration flows, flood the U.S. with cocaine and plot against the country. A U.S. intelligence assessment released earlier this year found minimal contact between the gang and low-level officials in the Venezuelan government but said there was no direct coordination between the gang and the government.",
      "In March, Mr. Trump also declared the group an invading force, invoking an 18th century wartime law that allows the U.S. to deport noncitizens without any legal recourse. Under the Alien Enemies Act, the administration sent more than 250 Venezuelan men to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador, where they remained incommunicado and without access to an attorney until their July deportation to Venezuela.",
      "A\u00a0U.S. appeals court panel this week ruled that Mr. Trump cannot use that law to speed deportations of people his administration accuses of being Tren de Aragua members. A final ruling on the matter, however, will be made by the Supreme Court.",
      "The Trump administration alleged the men deported to the prison were members of the Tren de Aragua gang, but provided little evidence. One justification officials used was that the men had certain kinds of tattoos allegedly signifying gang membership, including crowns, clocks and other symbols. But experts have said tattoos are not reliable markers of affiliation to the gang.",
      "Trump cites the gang in justifying the military strike",
      "The U.S. has not released the names and nationalities of the 11 people killed Tuesday. It also has not offered an estimate of the amount of drugs it says the boat was carrying.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday told reporters the U.S. military will continue lethal strikes on suspected drug trafficking vessels, but he dodged questions on details of the strike, including if the people in the boat were warned before the attack.",
      "But, he said, Mr. Trump \"has a right, under exigent circumstances, to eliminate imminent threats to the United States.\"",
      "\"If you're on a boat full of cocaine or fentanyl or whatever, headed to the United States, you're an immediate threat to the United States,\" he told reporters in Mexico City during a visit to Latin America.",
      "Venezuela's government, which has long minimized the presence of Tren de Aragua in the South American country, limited its reaction to the strike to questioning the veracity of a video showing the attack. Communications Minister Freddy \u00d1\u00e1\u00f1ez suggested it was created using artificial intelligence and described it as an \"almost cartoonish animation, rather than a realistic depiction of an explosion.\"",
      "Hegseth responded that the strike \"was definitely not artificial intelligence,\" adding he watched live footage from Washington as the strike was carried out.",
      "The strike shows that the U.S. government is \"quite literally deadly serious\" in its targeting of drug traffickers, said Ryan Berg, director of the Americas program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank.",
      "But he questioned whether the link to Tren de Aragua has more to do with the \"familiarity\" that Americans now have with the gang.",
      "\"I certainly hope that the U.S. government has the intelligence and we are not shooting first and asking questions later,\" Berg said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rubio-us-designating-ecuador-gangs-foreign-terrorist-groups/",
    "published": "Thu, 04 Sep 2025 13:56:03 -0400",
    "summary": "The announcement targeting Los Lobos and Los Choneros came after a lethal U.S. military strike\u200b against a similarly designated gang in Venezuela.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday that the United States is designating two Ecuadorian gangs as foreign terrorist organizations in the Trump administration's latest move against cartels.",
      "The announcement came as Rubio traveled to Ecuador to meet with its leaders in a trip to Latin America this week that has been overshadowed by a U.S. military strike against a similarly designated gang, Tren de Aragua. The strike has raised concerns in the region about whether the Trump administration will step up military activity to combat drug trafficking and illegal migration.",
      "The two new designees, Los Lobos and Los Choneros, are Ecuadorian gangs blamed for much of the violence that began since the COVID-19 pandemic. The designation, Rubio said, brings \"all sorts of options\" for the U.S. government to work in conjunction with the government of Ecuador to crack down on these groups.",
      "That includes the ability to kill them as well as take action against the properties and banking accounts in the U.S. for the group's members and people with ties to the criminal organizations, Rubio said, adding it would also help with intelligence sharing.",
      "Rubio called them \"vicious animals, these terrorists.\"",
      "Criminal gang violence continues unabated following the recapture in June of the country's biggest drug lord,\u00a0Adolfo Mac\u00edas, who leads Los Choneros, after his escape from a maximum-security prison in 2024. In July, the Ecuadoran government extradited Macias to the United States, where he faces multiple drug trafficking and firearms charges.",
      "Last year, the U.S. classified Los Choneros as one of the most violent gangs and affirmed its connection to powerful\u00a0Mexican drug cartels who threaten Ecuador and the surrounding region.",
      "Earlier this year, a leader of Los Lobos was\u00a0arrested at his home in the coastal city of Portoviejo. Carlos D, widely known by his alias El Chino, was the second-in-command of Los Lobos and \"considered a high-value target,\" the armed forces said in a statement.",
      "The U.S. last year declared Los Lobos to be the largest drug trafficking organization in Ecuador.",
      "\"Interdiction doesn't work\"",
      "Rubio's meetings in Quito on Thursday follow talks a day earlier with Mexican leaders that were overshadowed by the U.S. military strike on suspected Tren de Aragua drug runners in the southern Caribbean.",
      "The Trump administration asserts that it targeted a Venezuelan drug-running ship crewed by members of Tren de Aragua. U.S. officials say the vessel's cargo was intended for the United States and that the strike killed 11 people.",
      "Rubio defended the action and offered no justification other than to say the boat posed an \"immediate threat\" to the U.S. and that Trump opted to \"blow it up\" rather than follow what had been standard procedure to stop and board, arrest the crew and seize any contraband on board.",
      "\"Interdiction doesn't work,\" Rubio said Wednesday. \"Instead of interdicting it, on the president's orders, we blew it up. And it'll happen again. Maybe it's happening right now, I don't know, but the point is the president of the United States is going to wage war on narco-terrorist organizations.\"",
      "Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said on Wednesday that U.S. military assets will remain in the region, and that more strikes may be forthcoming.",
      "\"This is a deadly, serious mission for us and it won't stop with just this strike,\" Hegseth told Fox News. \"Anyone else trafficking in those waters who we know is a designated narco-terrorist will face the same fate.\"",
      "The strike got a mixed reaction from leaders around Latin America, where the U.S. history of military intervention and gunboat diplomacy is still fresh. Many, like officials in Mexico, were careful not to outright condemn the attack but stressed the importance of protecting national sovereignty and warning that expanded U.S. military involvement might actually backfire.",
      "Mexico Foreign Affairs Secretary Ram\u00f3n de la Fuente, speaking to reporters alongside Rubio, emphasized his country's preference for \"nonintervention, peaceful solution of conflicts.\"",
      "Ecuador has its own issues with narcotics trafficking and also has been looked to by the Trump administration as a possible destination to deport non-Ecuadorian migrants from the United States. U.S. officials have said they would like to secure an agreement with Ecuador that would have it accept such deportees, but the status of negotiations with Quito was not clear.",
      "Ecuador's president, Daniel Noboa, on Thursday thanked Rubio for the U.S. efforts to \"actually eliminate any terrorist threat.\" Before their meeting, Rubio had said on social media that the U.S. and Ecuador are \"aligned as key partners on ending illegal immigration and combatting transnational crime and terrorism.\"",
      "Surging violence since COVID-19 pandemic",
      "The latest U.N. World Drug Report says various countries in South America, including Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, reported larger cocaine seizures in 2022 than in 2021, but it does not give Venezuela the outsize role that the White House has in recent months.",
      "\"The impact of increased cocaine trafficking has been felt in Ecuador in particular, which has seen a wave of lethal violence in recent years linked to both local and transnational crime groups, most notably from Mexico and the Balkan countries,\" the report says.",
      "Violence has skyrocketed in Ecuador since the COVID-19 pandemic, as drug traffickers expanded operations in the country and took advantage of the nation's banana industry.",
      "The South American country is the world's largest exporter of bananas, shipping about 7.2 million tons a year by sea. Traffickers find containers filled with bananas the perfect vehicle to smuggle their product.",
      "In addition, cartels from Mexico, Colombia and the Balkans have settled in Ecuador because it uses the U.S. dollar and has weak laws and institutions, along with a network of long-established, ruthless gangs that are eager for work.",
      "Ecuador also gained prominence in the global cocaine trade after political changes in Colombia last decade. Coca bush fields in Colombia have been moving closer to the border with Ecuador due to the breakup of criminal groups after the 2016 demobilization of the rebel group Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, better known by its Spanish acronym FARC.",
      "Rubio is also visiting the Andean country to argue against its close ties and reliance on China.",

      "The worst-hit villages are in remote parts of the province, and many roads have been blocked by landslides triggered by the temblor. On Wednesday, the Taliban administration's Ministry of Interior shared a video with CBS News showing police and first responders working to clear a path by moving large rocks with their bare hands.",
      "Some rescue workers have walked for miles to reach the affected areas.",
      "Some emergency crews have been flown in by helicopter, but in some affected villages, the rough terrain makes it impossible for helicopters to land, and the Taliban's Minister of Defense said it was sending commandos down by rope to help people.",

      "The earthquake struck mountainous and remote parts of Afghanistan, and there have been significant aftershocks, driving many families to sleep out in the open and far from their homes, most of which were not built to withstand earthquakes despite the region being prone to seismic activity.",
      "The disaster struck as Afghanistan was already struggling through a humanitarian crisis.",
      "The Afghan government, along with international aid organizations, have launched an appeal for donations to help the survivors. According to the Norwegian Refugee Council, local resources in Kunar have been stretched to breaking point.",
      "\"Communities in the valleys have lost almost everything \u2014 their families, homes, livestock, and vital water channels. In the aftermath, makeshift camps are sheltering 50 to 100 women and children per tent, with no access to proper wash facilities,\" the charity said in a statement. \"Families with children are deeply traumatized, with some children having been trapped under rubble for several hours before being rescued.\"",
      "The Taliban's official spokesman shared several bank account numbers seeking private donations, saying any funds would go to help those in need. On Wednesday, Minister of Foreign Affairs Amir Khan Mutaqi called on the country's diplomats abroad to seek aid from their host nation's governments, charitable organizations, and well-wishers.",
      "Suhail Shaheen, the Taliban's ambassador in Qatar, told CBS News the Foreign Minister had instructed Afghan envoys to open condolence books at embassies and to explain the situation and the urgent needs of the quake victims.",

    "story": [
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met Thursday with European leaders in Paris, along with President Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff, to discuss ongoing efforts to broker an end to Russia's war against his country that includes security guarantees for the war-torn nation.",
      "Mr. Trump has been pushing for Russia and Ukraine to strike a deal to end the war sparked by Russia's full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, and the French news agency AFP said the European leaders gathered in Paris held a video conference with the U.S. president right after their meeting on Thursday.",
      "A White House official confirmed that call to CBS News, adding that Mr. Trump had, \"emphasized that Europe must stop purchasing Russian oil that is funding the war \u2014 as Russia received 1.1 billion euros in fuel sales from the EU in one year.\"",

      "Putin joins China's Xi and Kim Jong Un in display of anti-U.S. unity",
      "European nations have reduced their purchases of Russian fossil fuels since the Ukraine war began, but they have not ended. EU nations are working to replace Russian gas and oil in with fuel from other sources, but the continent had become reliant on cheap energy from Moscow over many years, and it will take years for most nations to achieve energy independence from Russia.",
      "European nations led by Britain and France, meanwhile, have been working to secure assurances from the White House that any troops they send to ensure long-term military support for Ukraine once a ceasefire comes into effect will have American backing.",
      "The French presidency shared a video of the meeting on social media that showed Witkoff at the table, and shaking hands and greeting Zelenskyy with a hug. Ukrainian presidential press secretary Serhii Nikiforov Zelenskyy told the AFP that Zelenskyy and Witkoff also held a closed-door meeting.",
      "Witkoff was invited to participate in the so-called \"coalition of the willing\" meeting to discuss aid for Ukraine, including sketching out plans for military support in the event of a ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war, to deter future Russian aggression, officials told AFP.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who lead the group, have insisted that any European \"reassurance\" force in Ukraine needs the backing of the United States.",
      "European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen said earlier this week that \"precise plans\" for post-war international military deployments in Ukraine were being drawn up, adding in an interview with the\u00a0Financial Times\u00a0that there was a \"clear road map\" and that President Trump had agreed to an unspecified \"American presence\" as a \"backstop\" to any European ground force.",
      "Starmer's office said after the meeting in Paris on Thursday that the British prime minister had \"emphasized that the group had an unbreakable pledge to Ukraine, with President Trump's backing, and it was clear they now needed to go even further to apply pressure on (Russian president Vladimir) Putin to secure a cessation of hostilities.\"",
      "While Ukraine has agreed to a proposal by the Trump administration for an immediate ceasefire, Putin has yet to even agree to meet with Zelenskyy on neutral ground, instead suggesting he come to Moscow. Despite Mr. Trump's mounting criticism, Putin has continued pressing his gains in Ukraine, and continued attacking not only military targets, but civilian infrastructure, with devastating effects.",
      "Starmer's office also mentioned a decision by the European coalition to supply long-range missiles to Ukraine \"to further bolster the country's supplies.\"",
      "Macron said ahead of Thursday's meeting that preparatory work on the security guarantees had been done and should now be approved at political level. Like von der Leyen several days ago, however, he did not provide any details.",
      "\"We Europeans are ready to provide security guarantees to Ukraine and the Ukrainians on the day peace is signed,\" Macron said.",
      "It is unclear what members of the coalition are willing to contribute, including troops on the ground.",
      "Andriy Yermak, the Ukrainian president's chief of staff, said Thursday after meeting Witkoff and other national security advisers that the security guarantees \"must be strong and effective \u2014 in the air, at sea, on land and in cyberspace.\"",
      "President Trump has made it clear that he will not deploy American troops to Ukraine as part of any ceasefire arrangement, and members of his administration have previously suggested a U.S. role could be to provide coordination, rather than boots on the ground.",
      "In an interview with the\u00a0Daily Caller\u00a0published over the weekend, Mr. Trump did not rule out using American warplanes to assist European peacekeeping efforts on the ground.",
      "Zelenskyy's government is hoping for continued U.S. intelligence sharing and air support.",
      "Putin has balked at the idea of any Western forces deploying to Ukraine as part of a peace deal.",
      "NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte dismissed that opposition on Thursday, insisting that Ukraine is \"a sovereign country,\" and thus it is \"not for them to decide\" in Moscow what security guarantees are put in place.",
      "But until there is a ceasefire, which Putin would have to agree to, post-war security guarantees will remain purely theoretical, and Ukraine will be forced to continue defending itself to the best of its ability from Russia's relentless attacks.",
      "Rutte, who attended the Paris meeting virtually, said a broad coalition of nations was needed to support Ukraine's defense against Russian aggression, but also to strengthen Europe to deter further military action by Moscow.",
      "Citing European military and intelligence officials who have warned of Russian plans to strike within the decade other European countries, most of them in the U.S.-led military alliance that Rutte currently helms, he said: \"we have to make sure that our deterrence is such that they will never try, knowing that our reaction will be devastating.\"",
      "Rutte also called for the world to \"not be naive about Russia.\"",

    "story": [
      "China's President Xi Jinping and his visiting Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin discussed life-prolonging organ transplants and immortality as they chatted before a massive military parade in Beijing on Wednesday, in comments picked up by state media microphones.",
      "Historic images showed Xi shaking hands and speaking with Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as they walked down a red carpet by Tiananmen Square, in scenes viewed as a challenge to President Trump and the U.S.-led global order that has prevailed for more than a century.",
      "\"These days ... 70 years old,\" Xi mused in Mandarin as he walked beside Putin and Kim, according to video aired by Chinese state broadcaster CCTV. Xi's translator conveyed the remarks to Putin, who is then heard in Russian quoting a line from a Tang dynasty poem: \"In the past, it used to be rare for someone to be older than 70 and these days they say that at 70 one's still a child.\"",
      "Putin then turned toward Xi, speaking while gesturing with his hands, though his words are inaudible on the CCTV feed. The same Chinese translator then relays Putin's remarks to Xi.",
      "\"With the ... development of biotechnology, human organs can be continuously transplanted, people could get younger as they grow older, and may even become immortal,\" Putin said, according to the translator.",
      "Xi then spoke again in Mandarin as the camera cut away: \"Predictions are, in this century, it may be ... possible to live to 150 years old.\"",
      "Putin confirmed the exchange during a news conference later Wednesday.",
      "\"Ah, I think it was when we were going to the parade that the chairman spoke about this,\" he told reporters, referring to Xi.",
      "\"Modern means \u2014 both health improvement and medical means, and then even all kinds of surgical ones related to organ replacement \u2014 allow humanity to hope that active life will continue not as it does today,\" Putin added.",
      "Xi and Putin, along with Kim and Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have been dubbed an \"Axis of Upheaval\" by some Western analysts, and Xi's decision to bring together the leaders of some of the most heavily sanctioned nations in the world this week was clearly calculated.",

      "While Xi's predecessors Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao relinquished power after 10 years in office, he abolished term limits in 2018 and, in 2023, was handed a third term as Chinese president.",
      "Putin was elected to a record fifth six-year term just last year in Russia. Critics dismissed the vote as a patently undemocratic farse, as virtually all of Putin's serious political opponents were barred from running, and many of them were jailed.",
      "Putin has twice used his leverage as Russia's autocratic leader to amend the constitution so that he can theoretically stay in power until he's in his mid-80s. He already is the longest-serving Kremlin leader since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.",
      "China, meanwhile, has historically had one of the lowest rates of organ donation in the world, with a severe shortage of organ donors and a long-standing black-market organ trade. In 2016, about four years into Xi's tenure as leader, surgeons from the World Health Organization gathered in Beijing to try to allay skepticism about whether Chinese hospitals had, as claimed, stopped performing transplants with the organs of executed prisoners.",

      "That approach, he said, demands patience, even when a quick resolution is sought, but he believes it has paid off in other peace agreements this year.",

      "Last month, ahead of his closely watched meeting with Putin in Alaska, Mr. Trump told reporters, \"All I want to do is set the table for the next meeting, which should happen shortly.\"",
      "Beyond the Russia-Ukraine war, Mr. Trump has claimed in recent weeks that he should be credited for ending six or seven wars during this term and that he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts. White House officials have pointed to a list of seven conflicts the president is referencing: Israel and Iran, Rwanda and Democratic Republic of the Congo, Armenia and Azerbaijan, Thailand and Cambodia, India and Pakistan, Egypt and Ethiopia, and Serbia and Kosovo.",

      "Several Trump allies have told CBS News that Mr. Trump maintains that the work done by him and his administration has been crucial in furthering those negotiations.",
      "\"A lot of times, they're fighting each other for so long,\" Mr. Trump told CBS News. \"They're fighting each other so long, they don't even think in terms of peace.

    "story": [
      "An Argentine federal court announced Wednesday that authorities had recovered the long-lost \"Portrait of a Lady,\" an 18th-century work by the Italian painter Giuseppe Ghislandi that was looted by the Nazis in World War II and rediscovered when it appeared in an online real estate listing last month.",
      "Before the presentation of the giant gold-framed portrait on Wednesday in the Argentine coastal city of Mar del Plata, the painting had not been seen publicly in 80 years.",
      "The first-ever color photo of the portrait surfaced in a real estate listing unwittingly posted by one of the daughters of Friedrich Kadgien, the fugitive Nazi officer accused of stealing the painting from one of Europe's most prominent prewar art dealers and collectors.",
      "\"We're doing this simply so that the community to whom we partly owe the discovery of the work ... can see these images,\" federal prosecutor Daniel Adler said during a press conference to display the full-length portrait of Countess Colleoni, her hair ink-black and dress embroidered with pastel flowers.",
      "\"It was people from the community, specifically journalists, who prompted the investigation,\" Adler said.",
      "Dutch journalists made the shocking discovery while investigating Kadgien's past in Argentina, where the high-ranking official fled after the collapse of the Third Reich, and later died in 1978.",
      "News of the find thrilled historians the world over and eventually reached the heirs of the painting's original owner, Dutch-Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker. He died in a shipwreck after fleeing Amsterdam ahead of advancing German troops in May 1940.",
      "His descendants have sought to recover an estimated 1,100 paintings missing since the forced sale of Goudstikker's extensive inventory to Adolf Hitler's right-hand man, Hermann G\u00f6ring, who built up a major art collection during WWII.",
      "The sudden reappearance of \"Portrait of a Lady\" last week was fleeting. Within hours of the story's publication in Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad last Monday, the real estate listing was taken down. Police raided the rustic Mar del Plata home of Patricia Kadgien, the Nazi officer's daughter, but the painting wasn't there.",
      "Authorities earlier this week raided other homes belonging to the Kadgien sisters in Mar del Plata, seizing paintings and engravings that they similarly suspected of having been stolen during the 1940s.",

      "Adler, the prosecutor, told reporters that the couple's lawyer had handed over the painting to authorities earlier Wednesday. He did not specify where the portrait would go next.",
      "An art expert invited to assist with the investigation, Ariel Bassano, said the painting was being \"stored in a special chamber\" for safekeeping.",
      "\"It's in good condition given its age,\" Bassano said, dating the portrait to 1710 and valuing it at roughly $50,000.",

      "A number of other nuclear-capable missiles were rolled down central Beijing's Chang-an (\"Eternal Peace\") Avenue, including the DF-61. Like the DF-5C, it is an intercontinental ballistic missile, but the DF-61 can be fired from a mobile launcher. Little is known about the new weapon, but the previous model has a range of more than 7,500 miles, and it can also carry multiple warheads.",
      "The AP said China's parade also featured the JL-1 and JL-3 nuclear-capable long-range missiles, the first of which is launched from aircraft and the second from vessels at sea.",
      "China wants to \"replace traditional structures\"",
      "\"China not only wants to augment, but replace traditional structures,\" defense analyst Michael Raska told CBS News partner network BBC News, adding that it seems to have taken lessons from Russia's war in Ukraine, where a strategy has been to \"throw drones at the enemy\" to wear down their defenses.",
      "While some countries are concerned about incorporating artificial intelligence into their military systems, China appears to be plowing ahead and \"believe they can control AI,\" Raska told the BBC. \"They are going all the way to integrate it into their systems.\"",
      "The parade showed that China has the resources to build up a significant arsenal, but Raska said the U.S. still maintains the edge operationally.",
      "The U.S. is more agile in battle because it has a \"bottom-up\" culture, where decisions can be made and adapted on the ground in response to evolving situations, Raska said. China, on the other hand, \"can have flashy platforms and systems but they will not move a finger until they receive an order from the top,\" Raska told the BBC.",
      "\"The Chinese think it's technology that creates deterrence. They believe that will deter the U.S.... but at the operational level, there have been instances which show they may not be as good as they say they are,\" Raska said.",

    "story": [
      "An 18-year-old Navy seaman who was killed aboard a U.S. destroyer during World War II has been accounted for more than 80 years after his death, military officials said Tuesday.",
      "U.S. Navy Reserve Seaman 2nd Class Jerome M. Mullaney, 18, was assigned to the destroyer USS Glennon in the summer of 1944, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency said in a news release. The Glennon participated in D-Day on June 6, 1944. Two days after the invasion, it struck an underwater mine off the coast of France. The ship became trapped and could not be towed to safety before it was struck by a German artillery barrage on June 10.",
      "The ship sank after being hit by the German barrage. Mullaney and 24 other sailors were recorded as missing. Mullaney was declared non-recoverable in May 1949, just under five years after the ship's sinking. His name was recorded on the Walls of the Missing at Cambridge American Cemetery in England. He was awarded the Purple Heart, according to an obituary published in late August.",
      "After World War II ended in 1945, the American Graves Registration Command began efforts to recover missing American service members who had died during in combat. The agency conducted dozens of searches off France's coast, the DPAA said. By 1951, the agency had identified the remains of five sailors from the USS Glennon.",
      "In 1957, salvagers in St. Marie du Mont, France pulled pieces of the USS Glennon to shore. The pieces were broken down for scrap. A local resident found human remains in a large section of wreckage from the front portion of the ship, the DPAA said. American officials from the Army mausoleum in Frankfurt, Germany, then took possession of the remains and designated them as X-9296. Efforts to identify the remains failed, and they were interred at the Ardennes American Cemetery in Belgium in March 1959.",
      "In 2021, DPAA historians began new efforts to account for the sailors who died aboard the USS Glennon. In August 2022, the X-9296 remains were exhumed from the Belgian cemetery and transferred to the DPAA's laboratory. Research including dental and anthropological analysis, as well as mitochondrial and Y-chromosome DNA analysis, identified the remains as Mullaney's in March 2025.",
      "Mullaney's obituary said he was one of 10 children. All of his siblings have died, but he has several surviving nieces, nephews and cousins. The obituary said his funeral would be held in his hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania. He was set to be buried near his parents, the obituary said.",
      "A rosette will also be placed next to his name on the Walls of the Missing to indicate he has been accounted for, the DPAA said.",

    "story": [
      "When North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un stepped off his armored train in Beijing to attend celebrations marking 80 years since the end of WWII in Asia, his young daughter Kim Ju Ae surprised the cameras as she appeared then followed alongside him. Believed to be 12 or 13 years old and referred to as \"beloved child\" in North Korean state media, this was her first known trip outside the country.",
      "To casual observers, Kim Ju Ae's appearance Tuesday might be seen as a father-daughter bonding trip. But her arrival in China could be more than that: Kim Jong Un's signal that she is in the mix for future succession plans.",
      "\"Because when North Korea finalizes their successor process, they are used to bringing this successor to China,\" said Park Won-gon, professor of North Korean Studies at Ewha Womans University and director of the Institute of Unification Studies in Seoul. \"Showing them is kind of their tradition.\"",
      "Kim Jong Un's father, Kim Jong Il, brought him to Beijing to present him as a successor when he was believed to be in his mid-20s. Kim Il Sung, the country's founder, did the same for his son Kim Jong Il. The intent was to begin building the next political relationship with Beijing for the future.",
      "In recent years, Kim Ju Ae has appeared with her father at major public events inside North Korea.",
      "One challenge, however, is that Kim Ju Ae is female, and North Korea is a patriarchal society.",
      "\"We are not 100% because Kim Ju Ae is simply a 13-year-old girl and not an adult at all. So it's too early to say that she's (absolutely) going to be the next successor,\" said Park, \"and Kim Ju Ae doesn't have any kind of military experience.\"",
      "As for Kim Jong Un's trip itself, his visit to Beijing is a huge political win on the world stage with his choreographed proximity to China's President Xi Jinping as proof. The two walked stride-by-stride before China's spectacle of a parade then sat side-by-side, and front-and center, over Tiananmen Square as Chinese troops goose-stepped and as new Chinese military hardware rolled down the Avenue of Eternal Peace.",
      "Xi could have picked any leader of the more than two dozen who traveled in for the commemoration \u2014 including Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian, Myanmar's military junta chief Min Aung Hlaing, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi or Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. But it was Kim on his left, and Russia's President Vladimir Putin on his right. And these optics were designed to send a message of unity \u2014 and against Washington and the proverbial West.",
      "\"It's definitely Kim Jong Un's political victory,\" said Park. Xi \"picked Kim Jong Un as the top role and then he is showing his affection to North Korean Kim Jong Un to the world.\"",
      "Kim's biggest win, says Park, is the \"normalized relationship between North Korea and China\" after six years of no face-to-face contact. \"And it will help North Korea in future discussion or dialog with President Trump. I think there is a possibility that Trump would try to meet Kim Jong Un again.\"",

The Metropolitan Police chief has called on Britain's government to \"change or clarify\" the relevant laws after the controversial arrest of Irish comedy writer Graham Linehan over anti-transgender social media posts.",
      "Linehan, who co-created the popular 1990s British sitcom \"Father Ted\" and wrote and created the more contemporary \"The IT Crowd,\" says he was arrested by five armed officers at London's Heathrow Airport on Monday over his social media posts.",
      "On his page on the Substack platform, Linehan said he asserted in one of the X posts in question that trans women being in female-only spaces was a, \"violent, abusive act,\" and added a call for people who see trans women in such spaces to, \"make a scene, call the cops and if all else fails punch him in the balls.\"",

      "Metropolitan Police Chief Sir Mark Rowley has defended the officers who took Linehan into custody at Heathrow, saying in a statement seen by CBS News that the decision to arrest Linehan, \"was made within existing legislation \u2014 which dictates that a threat to punch someone from a protected group could be an offense.\"",
      "But, Rowley added: \"I don't believe we should be policing toxic culture wars debates and officers are currently in an impossible position.\"",

      "\"Where there is ambiguity in terms of intent and harm, policing has been left between a rock and a hard place by successive governments who have given officers no choice but to record such incidents as crimes when they're reported,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Health officials say Israel's growing offensive has killed at least 287 Gazans since international scholars, including Holocaust experts, called the war genocidal.",
    "story": [
      "Israel's expanding military offensive has killed at least 287 people in Gaza in the three days since a group of world-leading genocide scholars declared that Israel is committing genocide in the besieged Palestinian enclave, according to health officials in the Hamas-run territory.",
      "The International Association of Genocide Scholars \u2014 which includes Holocaust experts \u2014 declared in an Aug. 31 resolution that Israel's actions in Gaza since the 22-month war began constitute genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.",
      "As evidence, the group pointed to the killing or maiming of 50,000 children; Israeli leaders characterizing Palestinians in Gaza as \"human animals\" and threatening to \"flatten\" the territory and turn it into hell; and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu endorsing President Trump's plan for the U.S. to\u00a0\"take over\" the strip\u00a0and have all of its inhabitants \"resettled\" elsewhere.",
      "The territory was home to approximately 2.3 million people before the war, which Israel launched in retaliation for the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack orchestrated by Gaza's Hamas rulers. Some 1,200 Israelis were killed in that attack, and 251 others were taken as hostages into Gaza. Israel's leader has said 20 of those captives are still believed to be alive.",
      "Israel's Foreign Ministry dismissed the latest allegation of genocide, saying it was \"entirely based on Hamas' campaign of lies and the laundering of those lies by others.\" Its statement went on to say that it was the Israeli people who were actually subjected to genocide by Hamas with the Oct. 7 terrorist attack.",
      "Numerous leading human rights bodies, including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the Israeli organization B'Tselem and the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Occupied Palestinian Territories, had all previously concluded that Israel's military operation in Gaza amounted to genocide. Israel has rejected all of the accusations, saying they are based on a false Hamas narrative.",
      "Since the scholars group declared a genocide on Aug. 31, the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health has reported at least 287 people killed by Israeli operations, bringing the total death toll to at least 63,746, as well as 161,245 wounded, since Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "Israel has not allowed international journalists to enter Gaza and operate freely since the war began, despite repeated requests from CBS News and other organizations, so it is impossible to verify the health ministry's figures, which do not differentiate between civilian and combatant casualties. The U.N. considers the death toll reported by the ministry the most accurate information available, and Israel, while consistently denying the figures, has not provided its own reports on Palestinians killed during the war.",
      "The U.N. Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities said Wednesday, meanwhile, that at least 21,000 Gazan children had been rendered disabled by Israeli assaults since the war began.",
      "Fear grows along with Israel's offensive in Gaza City",
      "Israel recently declared Gaza City, the biggest population center in the Palestinian territory, a \"dangerous combat zone,\" and its forces have pushed forward with a controversial plan to seize the metropolis, which Israel's leader says is necessary to defeat Hamas.",
      "Parts of the city are already considered \"red zones,\" where Palestinians have been ordered to evacuate ahead of expected heavy fighting.",
      "That has left residents on edge, including many who returned after fleeing the city in the initial stages of the war. With Israeli bulldozers razing the ground in occupied neighborhoods and some Israeli politicians openly supporting the mass relocation of Palestinians from Gaza, many of the city's residents fear that departing now could mean leaving for good.",
      "Moving costs thousands of dollars and finding space in the overcrowded south to pitch a tent feels impossible. But staying behind, many say, could be deadly.",
      "\"The Israeli forces, when they mark any area by red color and they request the people to leave, they really will destroy it,\" Mohammed Alkurdi, who is sheltering in Gaza City along with hundreds of thousands of other Palestinians, told The Associated Press. \"So it's like you decide whether to live or die. It's very simple like that.\"",
      "Since Israel declared the area a combat zone on Friday, a small fraction \u2014 some 14,840 Palestinians of the nearly 1 million that the U.N. estimates are still in Gaza City \u2014 had left their homes as of Monday, most to flee to the south, according to the Site Management Cluster, a joint humanitarian body that coordinates assistance for people in displacement sites.",
      "A fraction of them, about 2,200, have moved to new places within Gaza City after being displaced by Israeli attacks.",
      "Alkurdi, a project manager and consultant, told the AP he could hear Israeli forces from the apartment where he's sheltering as they \"erase the area completely.\"",
      "Zeitoun was once Gaza City's largest neighborhood, filled with markets, schools and clinics. Over the last month, large swaths of it and the neighboring area of Sabra have been flattened, according to satellite photos reviewed by the AP from early August and early September. The photos show entire blocks have been pummeled or bulldozed into empty, sandy lots.",
      "\"It's not something partial like before. It's 100%,\" Alkurdi said. \"The house, I'm telling my friends, it keeps dancing all the day. It keeps dancing, going right and left like an earthquake.\"",
      "Many of the people in the city moved back to the north during a ceasefire in January, hoping to find their homes intact. Alkurdi's home was completely destroyed, so he's now living alone in a western area of the city. His children and wife were able to leave Gaza last year. He said he would flee south if his home fell under an evacuation order.",
      "Netanyahu defended the Gaza City offensive before it began, insisting the Israeli military had \"no choice but to finish the job and complete the defeat of Hamas.\" He has said repeatedly that the objective of the war is to demilitarize the enclave, maintain the Israeli military's \"overriding security control\" over it, and put a non-Israeli civilian administration in charge. He also says it is aimed at freeing the remaining hostages, though many of the captives' families have voiced concern that expanding the offensive into densely packed Gaza City will put them at greater risk.",
      "For Gaza's residents, the operation is already bringing more violence, and the prospect of more upheaval.",
      "Amal Seyam is the general director of the Women's Affairs Center in Gaza. Originally from the Tuffah neighborhood in eastern Gaza City, her home was destroyed by bombardment. For nearly four months, she has been sheltering in the Nasr neighborhood in the city's west, where she stays alongside her colleagues inside the women's center.",
      "Seyam has been displaced five times since the war began \u2014 three times within the city and twice to the south, in Rafah and Khan Younis. Each time, she fled with nothing.",
      "When asked if she would consider leaving Gaza City as Israeli forces advance, Seyam said: \"I will only leave when everyone who needs me here leaves. As long as there's a woman who needs me, I am staying. All of Gaza feels like it's in the red zone now anyway. The bombing is happening meters from us, not kilometers.\"",
      "She paused, her voice breaking into tears.",
      "\"Many people have started packing. Many have already left. Do you know what displacement means? It means moving once again, building your life once again, buying new things, blankets, tents, all over again.\"",

      "The United States will keep assets positioned in the Caribbean and strike anyone \"trafficking in those waters who we know is a designated narco terrorist,\" Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said Wednesday morning, a day after President Trump said the U.S. military had attacked and destroyed a drug-carrying vessel in the region.",
      "Mr. Trump said Tuesday that the U.S. had struck the boat\u00a0in international waters after it had departed from Venezuela. The president later\u00a0said on Truth Social\u00a0that 11 people were killed in the strike. He said the attack targeted members of\u00a0Tren de Aragua, a Venezuela-based organized crime group that has been\u00a0designated\u00a0as a foreign terrorist organization by the Trump administration.",
      "Mr. Trump also posted a video that appeared to show a military strike obliterating a small boat in the open sea.",
      "Hegseth told \"Fox & Friends\" on Wednesday morning that he watched the strike live. He said the video was \"definitely not artificial intelligence,\" as Venezuela's Communications Minister Freddy \u00d1\u00e1\u00f1ez claimed in a post on social media. Hegseth said that he could not elaborate on how the operation had been carried out, but said it was a \"precision\" attack.",
      "\"We knew exactly who was in that boat, we knew exactly what they were doing, and we knew exactly who they represented, and that was Tren de Aragua ... trying to poison our country with illicit drugs,\" Hegseth said.",
      "Hegseth did not say how the government identified the boat or those aboard it. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters on Tuesday that he believed the drugs were headed toward Trinidad and Tobago or another country in the Caribbean. Kamla Persad-Bissessar, the prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago, praised the strike in a statement issued late Tuesday, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Hegseth said Wednesday that the strike shows that \"President Trump is willing to go on offense in ways that others have not been\" when dealing with drug smugglers.",
      "\"You want to try to traffic drugs, it's a new day,\" the defense secretary said. \"It's a different day, and so those 11 drug traffickers are no longer with us, sending a very clear signal that this is an activity the United States is not going to tolerate in our hemisphere.\"",
      "Hegseth said that assets will remain in the region, and that further strikes may be forthcoming.",
      "\"This is a deadly, serious mission for us and it won't stop with just this strike,\" he said. \"Anyone else trafficking in those waters who we know is a designated narco-terrorist will face the same fate.\"",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0directed the military\u00a0to target drug cartels in Latin America last month. In August, the U.S. said the Navy would increase its presence near Venezuela and deploy multiple warships as part of an anti-drug cartel mission. Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u00a0called the move\u00a0an \"extravagant, unjustifiable, immoral and absolutely criminal and bloody threat.\" Maduro responded by deploying\u00a0warships and drones to Venezuela's coastline.",
      "The U.S. has not indicated it plans to strike Venezuela directly. When Hegseth was asked Wednesday by Fox News about the possibility of a regime change in the country, he said it was a \"presidential decision.\" The Trump administration has\u00a0accused Maduro's government\u00a0of working with drug cartels and groups like Tren de Aragua to bring illicit substances into the United States.",
      "A U.S. federal court charged Maduro\u00a0with narco-terrorism and drug trafficking\u00a0in 2020, allegations that Maduro has denied. The U.S. is offering a $50 million\u00a0reward for Maduro's arrest.",
      "\"What we have, there in the Caribbean, is clear demonstration of military might,\" Hegseth said in the \"Fox & Friends\" interview. \"President Trump has shown whether it is southwest border, Houthis, (Operation) Midnight Hammer in Iran, precise power could impact and reshape dynamics around the world and in the region.

      "The 51-year-old explained that the TVA was established by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and it only answers to the president, \"so senators, congressmen, governors, mayors, and definitely the general public has no sway over the TVA at all.\"",
      "He said there\u2019s a long history of the TVA allegedly coming into \"communities and towns and just ransacking these places \u2013 eminent domain, taking everybody's land and building these monstrous projects.

And so, when I learned that's what they were doing, and I actually saw a video of that exact thing happening to an 88-year-old woman in Cheatham County, that's when I decided to enter this fight.\"",
      "The Tennessee Valley Authority is a federally owned corporation that manages flood control, electric power, economic development and conservation.",
      "Last fall, the TVA told FOX 17 in a statement: \"TVA filed condemnation proceedings related to potential transmission lines that TVA may locate on these properties, and the Federal Judge overseeing the cases issued Orders of Possession. These orders immediately authorize TVA to enter the properties for the purpose of conducting surveys. The landowners' objections do not bar TVA's authorization to access the properties pursuant to the court\u2019s orders, nor does authorization hinge on further activity in the lawsuits.\"",

      "As an example, he said when he told Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins the TVA was planning to tear up 6,000 acres of farmland in the county, she was shocked.",
      "\"She goes, \u2018Yeah, I don't think so. And that's my jurisdiction, farming, agriculture.\u2019 And so, she stepped in, good for her, she's a hero,\" he said. \"I mean, she helped save almost 500 houses, five school districts in less than five miles from this plant, the main water source for two towns in that County with a 900-megawatt methane gas plant with 10 acres of lithium battery storage.\u00a0Literally, I mean, you might as well drop a bomb on that county.\"",

      "\"They had given up hope. They're like \u2018There's no way you beat the TVA,\u2019\" he explained, adding that the TVA had allegedly sued more than 100 families because they wouldn\u2019t allow them on their property. But it\u2019s a low-income county and only around half of the residents in the county could even afford attorneys.\"",

Okay, tell us what you've done, what about you? And the whole table, have you ever seen anything like that? I haven't. It's because those people are patriots.

This was the perfect moment to debut this new look! The children's school year is starting, the summer break is behind them, and it\u2019s a natural point to re-engage the public. A noticeable hair refresh not only gives her a personal boost after a tough year, it also makes people tune back in.\"",

      "Rabies is a\u00a0virus that is transmitted to humans by a bite or scratch from a rabid animal, according to the CDC.",

      "The disease is transmitted when feces from bugs infected with the T. cruzi parasite enter a person\u2019s body, typically through a bite wound or contact with the eyes or mouth.",
      "FLESH-EATING PARASITE CASE DETECTED IN US TRAVELER RETURNING FROM CENTRAL AMERICA",
      "\"When the kissing bug takes a blood meal, it will eventually defecate and leave the feces somewhere,\" lead study author Dr. Norman Beatty, assistant professor of medicine at the University of Florida College of Medicine, told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"Sometimes it can \u2018poop\u2019 on our skin or mucous membrane while feeding, and then the parasite enters at that site. The bug\u2019s feces can also end up inside or near a home and then be incidentally ingested or rubbed into the skin or mucous membrane.\"",
      "\"Chagas can lead to fever, fatigue, rash, body aches and lymph node swelling, and later can lead to digestive issues, heart problems and neurological involvement,\" a doctor warned. (iStock)",
      "Transmission in the U.S. can also occur from congenital infection, where a chronically infected mother can transmit the parasite to a fetus, or from organ transplantation, according to Beatty.",
      "Signs and symptoms",
      "The first stage of Chagas disease, called the acute phase, happens shortly after infection. It is followed by the longer-term chronic phase, according to the CDC.",
      "The disease does not always cause illness, but some people can experience symptoms.",
      "\"Chagas can lead to fever, fatigue, rash, body aches and lymph node swelling, and later can lead to digestive issues, heart problems and neurological involvement,\" Siegel warned.",
      "\"What really matters is whether or not the kissing bug has been found invading homes and harbors the parasite.\"",
      "Another hallmark of the disease is eyelid swelling, also known as Roma\u00f1a's sign.",
      "In the chronic phase, about 20% to 30% of people with the infection may experience potentially fatal heart issues or serious digestive problems, the CDC states.",
      "Prevalence of the disease",
      "Approximately 300,000 people are living with Chagas disease who acquired the infection in Latin America and the U.S., according to Beatty.",
      "\"However, the exact number is unknown \u2014 a national prevalence study has never been conducted,\" he told Fox News Digital.",
      "MOSQUITO-BORNE DENGUE FEVER CASES SURGE AT POPULAR US VACATION DESTINATION",
      "The disease is more likely to occur in states where the kissing bug is found close to where people live, which includes parts of California, Arizona, Texas, Louisiana and Florida, according to the expert.",
      "\"What really matters is whether the kissing bug has been found invading homes and harbors the parasite that causes Chagas disease in a particular region,\" he said, adding that researchers are \"just tipping the iceberg\" with their understanding of locally acquired disease in the U.S.",
      "Lab screening tests and treatments are readily available, the researcher said, but clinicians are largely unaware that the disease is being transmitted. (iStock)",
      "\"Unfortunately, most of the United States is unaware of this \u2018silent killer\u2019 and the fact that it is spread by a bug,\" he said.",
      "\"Our first steps are recognizing that this is an endemic infectious disease, building on improved education among the public and healthcare providers, and allocating funding for research and programs to support testing and additional monitoring.\"",
      "COULD CHIKUNGUNYA VIRUS SPREAD TO US? HERE'S WHAT AMERICANS SHOULD KNOW",
      "The expert refers to Chagas as a \"neglected tropical disease.\"",
      "\"Our hope as a team researching Chagas here in the U.S. is that we bring awareness to the fact that this infectious disease is being transmitted here and can be deadly,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"More research and resources are needed so we can help mitigate transmission to at-risk communities, especially those living in rural and agricultural sectors.\"",
      "Screening and treatments",
      "In most circumstances, Beatty said, people are bitten by the bug in their bed or home.",
      "\"From there, a person will reach out with a picture of that bug, and we start the process of testing and educating on how to prevent the insect from getting in the home and deterring it from wanting to be around a human dwelling.\"",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Lab screening tests and treatments are readily available, Beatty said, but clinicians are largely unaware that the disease is being transmitted in certain communities.",
      "There are two antiparasitic drugs approved for the treatment of Chagas disease in the U.S. \u2014 Benznidazole and Lampit (nifurtimox).",
      "In the chronic phase, about 20% to 30% of people with the infection may experience potentially fatal heart issues or serious digestive problems, the CDC states. (iStock)",
      "\"Currently, there is a clinical trial being conducted to assess a new agent for the treatment of Chagas at certain centers in the U.S. and Latin America,\" Beatty said.",
      "There are no vaccines currently available to prevent the disease.",
      "It can be a challenge for patients in rural America to find a provider who understands this disease, Beatty noted.",

      "The hearing came on the heels of a week of turmoil at the CDC, where Kennedy fired former CDC Director Susan Monarez, which led to several senior officials resigning from the agency. Before that, the secretary had cleaned out the federal government\u2019s vaccine recommendation panel and handpicked his own members to serve, and he also moved to cancel $500 million in mRNA vaccine contracts.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., also serves as the chair of the Senate\u2019s health committee and was the decisive vote to confirm Kennedy. He argued that Kennedy\u2019s actions on vaccines appeared to counter his support for Trump\u2019s Operation Warp Speed, a sweeping executive program by the Trump administration at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic that jump-started the production of vaccines.",
      "He noted that both Trump and Kennedy have vowed \"radical transparency\" when it came to the administration\u2019s healthcare agenda, but countered that the secretary\u2019s move to put new members on the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices appeared to be a conflict of interest.",

      "\"Saying I'm anti-vaccine is like saying I'm anti-medicine,\" Kennedy said. \"I\u2019m pro-medicine, but I understand some medicines harm people, some of them have risks, some of them have benefits that outweigh those risks for certain populations, and that\u2019s true with vaccines.\"",
      "Marshall agreed that he was not \"anti-vax either,\" and he listed several vaccines that he believed were good but argued that it was the transparency and approach to vaccines under the HHS and CDC that he was after.",
      "\"What I feel the difference is sometimes my friends across the aisle feel like there\u2019s a one-size-fits-all, that they should be telling parents what to do,\" Marshall said. \"And what you and I are fighting for is that we want to empower parents to make these decisions.\"",

      "Andrew Cuomo challenged his NYC mayoral opponent, Zohran Mamdani, to five different debates across all five New York City boroughs during a press conference Thursday.",
      "The challenge came as the former governor slammed Mamdani at his press conference in Manhattan's Upper West Side for failing \"to give a straight answer\" to reporters' questions and changing his mind \"on everything\" he has said on the campaign trail.",
      "\"When you try to ask [Mamdani] a question, he will simply not answer, and he obfuscates. And, frankly, you guys let him get away with it,\" Cuomo told reporters Thursday. \"I won't let him get away with it. And New Yorkers won't let him get away with it.\"",

Why should I debate Donald Trump\u2019s puppet when I could debate Donald Trump himself?\" Mamdani's campaign told Fox News Digital in a statement. \"If Donald Trump is serious about intervening in the mayoral race, he should come to New York City and debate me directly about why he\u2019s cutting SNAP benefits for hungry New Yorkers to give tax breaks to his wealthy donors.\"",
      "The back-and-forth between Cuomo and Mamdani comes amid speculation that President Donald Trump is weighing whether to offer jobs in his administration to incumbent NYC Mayor Eric Adams and the GOP candidate for NYC mayor, Curtis Sliwa. The move to offer the two candidates a job is reportedly a bid to clear the field for Cuomo, multiple sources with intimate knowledge about the matter have said.",

      "Shortly after launching his independent bid for mayor last month, Cuomo proposed that all the other candidates in the race, with the exclusion of Mamdani, make a pledge to agree that whoever is not leading in the polls by mid-September, would step aside. The aim of the pledge, Cuomo indicated, is to ensure the candidate with the best opportunity to defeat Mamdani runs against him under the most favorable conditions possible.",

      "Mamdani's support for communist ideals has also included proposing in a 2020 social media post to replace a statue of Christopher Columbus with Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, two anarcho-communists executed in Massachusetts in 1927. When asked by Fox News Digital if he had a response to being called a communist, Mamdani declined to answer.",

      "\"Ultimately, it is not language that I use. It is language, I understand there are concerns about, and what I will do is showcase my vision for the city through my words and my actions,\" he said.",

So, being a Muslim and being an immigrant, these are things that already kind of put you in the box of \u2018other.\u2019 And so it's not that far of a jump because whenever you ... stand up to speak up for the rights of others who share the same identity as you, then you're a radical, right?

      "The Health and Human Services Department (HHS) head signaled a dramatic course-correction at the CDC several days before the hearing, which came amid reports of the administration's decision to fire CDC Director Susan Monarez. Monarez's firing spurred backlash among Democrats who complained that the administration's efforts to reform the CDC, including through staff and budget cuts, were politicizing public health and undermining scientific integrity.",
      "\"The people at the CDC who oversaw [the COVID-19 mitigation] process, who put masks on our children, who closed our schools, are the people who will be leaving,\" Kennedy said during his opening remarks, shortly after the hearing was briefly interrupted by a heckler. \"That's why we need bold, competent, and creative new leadership at CDC.

For, sometimes, it carries with it announced or implied criticism of programs that have failed us in the past.

      "Home Wi-Fi networks are the backbone of how most people get online, connecting laptops, phones, smart TVs and more. When properly secured, they offer a convenient and private way to browse the internet, stream content and work from home. But \"private\" doesn't always mean \"safe.\" Wi-Fi security can be easily compromised if you have weak settings or outdated equipment.",

      "Her question points to a bigger concern. Many of us rely on home networks every day without really knowing if they're as secure as they should be.",

      "A user troubleshoots an internet router. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why home Wi-Fi security is important",
      "Your home Wi-Fi is not just a way to get online but also the gateway to your personal and professional life. Everything from online banking to work emails to video calls passes through it. If your network isn't secure, that information could be intercepted or exposed.",
      "One of the biggest misconceptions is that a home network is safe simply because it's private. In reality, hackers often target residential networks because they tend to have weaker defenses than corporate ones.",
      "Someone nearby could connect to your network if your password is weak or your encryption is outdated. This not only slows your internet but also lets them use your connection for illegal activities. Sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers and personal documents can be intercepted if the network is compromised.",
      "11 EASY WAYS TO PROTECT YOUR ONLINE PRIVACY IN 2025",
      "Attackers can use an insecure network to push malicious software onto your devices, sometimes without you even realizing it. Smart devices such as security cameras, thermostats and speakers can be taken over and used for spying or as part of larger cyberattacks.",
      "Even if you trust everyone in your household, your network is still exposed to risks from outside. And with so many devices connected today, including laptops, phones, tablets, TVs and IoT gadgets, there are more entry points for an attacker than ever before. Securing your Wi-Fi closes those doors before someone decides to try them.",
      "A hacker executes cybercrime. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Choose the right router for Wi-Fi protection",
      "Every piece of Wi-Fi security advice ultimately comes back to the same foundation: your router. It is the gatekeeper for your entire home network. If it is old, poorly configured, or missing important updates, even the strongest passwords and best digital habits will not fully protect you.",
      "Investing in a good router is one of the most important steps you can take to secure your home Wi-Fi. A modern, well-supported router gives you stronger encryption, better control over connected devices and regular updates that patch security flaws.",
      "Don't stop at the hardware itself. Check regularly for firmware updates from the manufacturer. Some new routers update automatically, but many require you to log in and install patches manually. Outdated firmware leaves known vulnerabilities wide open.",
      "IS YOUR HOME WI-FI REALLY SAFE? THINK AGAIN",
      "Also, change the default router login password immediately. Most routers ship with basic credentials like \"admin/admin.\" Attackers know this and can easily hijack your settings if you never change them.",
      "If your router supports it, enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA)\u00a0for logins. This extra step makes it much harder for attackers to gain control, even if they steal your password.",
      "If you are not sure where to begin, I have put together a list of some of the best and most secure routers you can buy right now by visiting\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Enable strong Wi-Fi encryption",
      "Encryption ensures that the data flowing across your network is scrambled, making it useless to anyone who tries to intercept it. Without proper encryption, nearby attackers can capture and read your traffic.",
      "The current gold standard is WPA3, which provides the strongest protection. If your router doesn't support it, WPA2 is still considered safe and widely used. Older options like WEP or an open, password-free network are highly insecure and should be avoided at all costs. It's worth logging into your router's settings just to confirm what level of encryption your network is using.",
      "Cables run out of an internet router. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Create a strong Wi-Fi password",
      "Your Wi-Fi password is the digital equivalent of the key to your home. A short or predictable password is like leaving a spare under the doormat, and anyone determined enough can find a way in. Instead, create a long passphrase that combines upper and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. Aim for at least 12 to 16 characters.",
      "Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Check who is connected to your network",
      "Even with a solid password, it's smart to check who is actually connected to your network. Most routers allow you to view a list of active devices. If you spot something you don't recognize, investigate. It could be a neighbor piggybacking on your connection or, in the worst case, an intruder.",
      "It also helps to disable Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS). This feature was designed to make connecting new devices easier, but it has security flaws that attackers can exploit. Some users go further by enabling MAC address filtering, which limits access to specific devices.",
      "To reduce risk even more, set up a\u00a0separate guest network for smart devices and visitors. That way, if one device gets hacked, your laptops and phones remain protected.",
      "And remember, keep all your devices updated. From laptops and phones to smart bulbs and thermostats, every gadget is a potential entry point. A weak link in one device can put your entire network at risk.",
      "IS YOUR PHONE HACKED? HOW TO TELL AND WHAT TO DO",
      "Protect your privacy with a VPN",
      "A Virtual Private Network, or VPN, helps solve one of the biggest issues with online privacy, which is who can see what you're doing. When you connect through a VPN, it creates an encrypted tunnel between your device and the websites or apps you use. Everything that travels through this tunnel is hidden from outsiders, including your internet provider.",
      "A reliable VPN is essential for protecting your online privacy and ensuring a secure, high-speed connection.",
      "For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Don't overlook antivirus protection",
      "While your Wi-Fi settings form the first line of defense, you should also protect the devices connected to your network. Install strong antivirus software to block malware that could spread through downloads, emails, or malicious links. This extra step ensures that even if a threat slips past your router's defenses, your devices stay protected.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "So, to return to Carol's question: Is it safe to browse the internet on your home Wi-Fi? The answer is yes, but only if you take the time to secure it. Strong router settings, proper encryption and a solid password do most of the heavy lifting. Building habits such as checking who is connected, keeping devices updated and using tools like a VPN adds even greater peace of mind.",

      "NAWCAD leaders say Skydweller will fit into the Navy's intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) network. Unlike expensive satellites or large drones such as the Global Hawk, Skydweller offers commanders a cheaper option for persistent monitoring. It can hover over an area in what experts call a \"pseudo-satellite role,\" freeing up more advanced systems for priority missions.",
      "For U.S. Southern Command, Skydweller could help track drug trafficking, border security threats and other maritime challenges. Longer tests are already planned for this summer in the SOUTHCOM region, which covers Latin America and the Caribbean and oversees U.S. military operations in that area.",

      "Future of solar-powered flight for Navy missions",
      "While Skydweller has already logged nearly 220 flight hours, engineers believe it could stay airborne far longer. Weather and range limits kept this recent test at 73 hours, but in theory, the aircraft could remain aloft for weeks.",
      "The Department of Defense sees platforms like Skydweller as vital for future conflicts where fuel resupply may not be possible. Renewable-powered drones could solve logistics headaches, especially in contested environments, which essentially means operating in places where enemies can block supply lines and make traditional refueling too risky.",
      "What this means for you",
      "The Navy's solar drone test is proof that renewable energy can support technologies once thought impossible.

Going straight to the source means your sensitive details don't take unnecessary detours.",
      "When you sell your home, more than just the price gets published. Your name, past addresses and even photos of your home can become part of the public record. Ask your realtor what's automatically disclosed and whether anything can be limited or redacted. It's worth being picky here: the less of your personal footprint that's tied to your property, the better.",
      "Moving is the perfect excuse to purge. But don't just throw out old bills, medical statements, or financial records; shred them. Dumpster-diving for personal data may sound outdated, but it's still a method scammers use. A good shredder ensures your sensitive history doesn't end up in the wrong hands.",
      "It's tempting to post a \"Goodbye, old house!\" photo online, but resist the urge. Publicly announcing a move tells scammers exactly when your home is empty and what your new address might be. Instead, share the news directly with family and close friends. A little less buzz online means a lot more safety offline.",
      "One powerful way to stay ahead of scammers is to freeze your credit. A freeze blocks new credit accounts from being opened in your name, even if criminals have your address or other details. The good news is that you can do this for free with all three major credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion.",
      "It only takes a few minutes online or by phone, and you can lift the freeze anytime if you need to apply for a loan or credit card. By freezing your credit before and after your move, you create a strong barrier that keeps thieves from turning stolen data into financial damage.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Moving should feel like a new beginning, not an invitation for scammers to strike. With a few smart steps, you can stay ahead of data brokers and fraudsters. From shredding documents to freezing your credit, every action adds a layer of protection. By protecting your information before and after your move, you gain peace of mind and start your next chapter on solid ground. The effort is small compared to the security it brings.",

      "'CyberGuy' Kurt Knutsson shares his tips on reducing daily internet usage after an eye-opening poll reveals Americans spend nearly half their day online on 'Fox & Friends.'",
      "Self-driving trucks are moving closer to reality. PlusAI released its first half 2025 performance results, showing how far the company has come toward its goal of launching factory-built autonomous trucks in 2027.",
      "The numbers are clear. Safety case readiness reached 86%, with a goal of 100% by launch. Autonomous miles percentage climbed to 98%. Remote assistance free trips rose to 76%, with a target of more than 90%.",

      "159-YEAR-OLD COMPANY EMBRACES DRIVERLESS TRUCKS",
      "PlusAI reports that its driverless trucks could be ready to hit the road within the next two years. (PlusAI)",
      "Why PlusAI's 2025 results matter for autonomous trucks",
      "Even if you never step into a truck, these results affect your daily life. Every product you buy travels by truck at some point, whether it's groceries, clothing or furniture. The way those trucks operate influences cost, availability and safety on the road.",
      "The trucking industry faces three major challenges. There are not enough long-haul drivers to meet demand. Costs continue to rise due to labor shortages, tariffs and fuel prices. And safety is a concern because human drivers can get tired or distracted.",
      "Autonomous trucks could help address each of these issues. PlusAI's vehicles are already hauling freight on Texas highways today, and they are also undergoing road testing in Sweden. The company has already logged more than 5 million autonomous miles across the United States, Europe and Asia. That real-world experience fuels the AI system with the data it needs to improve.",
      "LUCID JOINS TESLA AND GM WITH HANDS-FREE HIGHWAY DRIVING",
      "The PlusAI Safety Case Framework. Data shows that self-driving trucks will roll out by 2027. (PlusAI)",
      "How PlusAI plans to launch autonomous trucks by 2027",
      "PlusAI has created a roadmap that sets it apart. Instead of retrofitting trucks with autonomous systems, it is working with major manufacturers like TRATON GROUP, Hyundai and IVECO to integrate the technology at the factory. This approach makes scaling production faster and ensures consistency.",
      "The initial launch is planned for the Texas Triangle, a major freight corridor connecting Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin. From there, PlusAI plans to expand into other U.S. routes and eventually Europe.",
      "The company has also committed to publishing regular performance updates as it transitions to a public company. By sharing measurable results, PlusAI builds trust with regulators, the public, and businesses that may one day rely on its trucks to move goods.",
      "\"We have a clear roadmap to the commercial launch of SuperDrive,\" said David Liu, CEO and co-founder of PlusAI. \"By publicly sharing these performance metrics, we are showing our commitment to safety and scalability while bringing partners, customers, and regulators along on this journey.\"",
      "What's next for PlusAI and driverless freight trucks?",
      "PlusAI still has milestones to meet. Safety readiness must rise from 86% to 100%. Remote Assistance Free Trips must surpass 90%. These are ambitious goals, but the progress so far suggests the company can achieve them.",
      "Fleet trials are scheduled to begin later this year, and PlusAI continues testing in both the United States and internationally. Each step adds to the case that driverless trucks will be ready for commercial launch in 2027.",

      "A drone view shows a transport truck entering the United States from Canada, at a Canada-U.S. border crossing in Blaine, Washington, April 2, 2025. (REUTERS/David Ryder)",
      "What this means for you",
      "As a shopper, autonomous trucks could mean faster and more affordable deliveries. As a driver, you may soon share highways with self-driving freight haulers. As a business owner, this technology could reduce logistics costs and ease the impact of driver shortages.",
      "The bigger picture is that autonomous trucks are moving from testing to real use. They are no longer limited to pilot projects. You may see them alongside you on the road sooner than expected.",

      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Transportation is changing quickly. Just as ride-sharing apps transformed how people travel within cities, autonomous trucks may soon reshape how goods move across the country. The difference is that this shift is approaching within just a few years. The progress PlusAI reports today offers a glimpse of that future. If the company continues on this track, driverless trucks could become a normal part of daily life by the end of the decade.",

      "Sheep fit neatly between solar arrays, reaching into nooks that mechanical gear can't. They chew rain or shine. And since sheep run on grass, not gas, their grazing helps reduce carbon emissions. Using these natural lawnmowers better aligns with solar's green mission goals.

There's even a fancy word for it: agrivolatics, or the practice of combining solar energy production with agriculture.\u2028Farmers who jump on board aren't just maintaining the lawn; they're opening up multiple revenue streams. First, ranchers can lease land to solar companies, sign grazing contracts, while still earning from traditional farm products like wool and lamb.",

If he had stuck with cotton, he estimates he would've lost about $200,000 instead. That's a huge swing, and it's a real-world example of how solar grazing is helping revive a sheep industry that had been stuck in neutral for decades.",
      "How sheep improve soil health and boost biodiversity at solar farms",
      "Letting sheep do the mowing isn't just about saving time or money. It actually helps the land. As they move through the fields, sheep naturally break down plant material, aerate the soil and leave behind fertilizing manure. This leads to healthier dirt and better carbon capture.",
      "Companies like Lightsource BP are already seeing those benefits. They manage over 14,000 sheep across solar farms that produce more than 3 gigawatts of power. These sites aren't just power generators, they're also habitats. Flowers that support bees and butterflies are planted among the panels, creating ideal conditions for pollinators. Some farms have even started producing honey thanks to the thriving bee population.",

      "Major solar farms scale up sheep grazing across thousands of acres",
      "This isn't just happening on a small scale. Enel North America recently signed one of the biggest solar grazing deals in the country. They're deploying over 6,000 sheep across eight large solar farms, covering more than 10,000 acres.",
      "At some of those sites, the amount of organic matter in the soil has more than doubled. For solar operators, this approach just makes sense. It cuts operations and maintenance costs, strengthens environmental credibility and builds better relationships with nearby communities.",
      "Investors are paying attention, too. In just two years, the number of solar grazing projects has skyrocketed, especially in places backed by heavy hitters like DE Shaw and Berkshire Hathaway.",
      "Chad Raines opens the gate to a solar panel zone in Haskell, Texas, Dec. 2, 2024. This solar farm has six different solar panel zones on 1,800 acres of land.\u00a0 (REUTERS/Annie Rice)",
      "What solar grazing means for you",
      "If you care about clean energy, sustainable farming or smart land use, solar grazing is worth watching. It shows how innovation doesn't always require high-tech gadgets; sometimes, it just takes some sheep. For farmers and ranchers, this model opens the door to new income by partnering with solar companies. If you own land or work in agriculture, grazing contracts could provide a steady stream of revenue without giving up traditional operations.",
      "For everyone else, this trend offers hope that renewable energy can coexist with rural livelihoods, boost biodiversity and fight climate change, all at once. As solar farms expand across the country, expect to see more flocks doing the work of machines, quietly transforming how we power the planet.",

This approach blends sustainability with practicality. It supports healthier soil, boosts biodiversity and strengthens rural economies, all while helping solar farms operate more efficiently.

      "What jury duty scam victims need to know",
      "Scammers posing as court officials are targeting individuals with false claims about missed jury duty, prompting warnings from law enforcement. The fraud typically begins with a call from a blocked or unknown number, alleging that the recipient has missed jury duty and is facing an arrest warrant. The scammers then demand payment, usually through wire transfers or gift cards.",
      "A key warning sign is being asked to pay money to avoid arrest or legal trouble. It is important never to give money or personal information to unknown callers.",
      "These scams often target older or more vulnerable individuals, although younger people have also reported close calls. In one example, a person received repeated calls from an unidentified number before answering. The caller, claiming to be from a local sheriff's department and equipped with the individual's full name and address, insisted they had failed to appear for jury duty and faced multiple citations.",

      "This might sound obvious, but don't trust any unknown caller, especially if they demand money. Legitimate authorities will never ask for payment over the phone, especially not through gift cards, wire transfers, or cryptocurrency. If someone threatens you with arrest or legal action unless you pay immediately, it's almost certainly a scam. Hang up and call your local court or police department using an official number.",
      "If you receive a suspicious call, take a breath and fact-check. Court summonses are always delivered by mail, not over the phone. Even if the caller has personal information like your name or address, that doesn't make them credible. Scammers often use leaked or publicly available data to appear convincing.",

      "Why AI stuffed animals worry child experts",
      "Pediatricians and psychologists raise red flags about these AI toys. Young children naturally form attachments. If those attachments shift to chatbots, kids may learn to trust machines more than people. Research already shows children ages 3 to 6 sometimes trust robots more than humans, even when the robots give wrong answers. That undermines how kids build empathy, learn to question, and develop critical thinking. There are also privacy concerns. Parents may not realize that these\u00a0\"personalized\" toys are recording conversations. Sensitive information could be stored, analyzed, or misused without families fully knowing.",

That responsiveness can be powerful. It can encourage curiosity, vocabulary growth, and even creativity. But it can also crowd out human interactions, those subtle facial expressions, pauses, and \"nos\" that children need to experience to learn empathy and resilience. Another risk is that AI companions are trained to be overly charming and agreeable. Instead of challenging a child's thinking, these\u00a0\"sycophantic\" toys may simply tell kids what they want to hear. Over time, that could nudge children toward believing comforting lies instead of asking hard questions, a toxic pattern for developing critical thinking.",

      "Now, credit reporting firm TransUnion has confirmed its own major incident, with more than 4.4 million U.S. consumers affected.\u00a0Attackers exploited weaknesses in third-party integrations, not Salesforce itself.

      "Hackers stole 13 million records, exposing data of 4.4 million Americans in the latest TransUnion cyberattack. (Christopher Dilts/Bloomberg)",
      "What you need to know about the TransUnion data breach",
      "TransUnion has disclosed a major data breach that impacted 4,461,511 individuals in the United States, according to a filing with the Maine Attorney General's Office. The incident occurred on July 28, 2025, and was discovered two days later on July 30.",
      "The breach resulted from unauthorized access to a third-party application used in TransUnion's U.S. consumer support operations. The company stressed that its core credit database and credit reports were not compromised.",
      "Although TransUnion characterized the exposed information as \"limited,\" the stolen data is highly sensitive. It includes names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, billing addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, reasons for customer transactions (such as requests for a free credit report), and customer support tickets and messages.",
      "Hackers claim they stole more than 13 million records in total, with about 4.4 million tied to U.S. consumers.",
      "In response, TransUnion is providing all affected individuals with 24 months of free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services.",

      "The breach at TransUnion follows several similar cyberattacks against tech companies, including Google and Cisco, and retail brands, such as Chanel and Adidas.\u00a0 (Mike Kemp/In Pictures)",
      "Hackers target companies through Salesforce apps",
      "The breach appears to be part of a broader wave of Salesforce-related attacks that is hitting organizations across sectors, from tech and finance to retail and aviation. Alongside Google, Farmers Insurance, Allianz Life, Workday, Pandora, Cisco, Chanel and Qantas, brands like Adidas, Louis Vuitton, Dior, Tiffany & Co., Cartier and Air France-KLM have also reported incidents tied to weaknesses in Salesforce-linked applications.",
      "In most cases, attackers exploited malicious third-party integrations or OAuth-connected apps disguised as legitimate Salesforce tools to siphon sensitive records. This technique bypassed traditional login protections and gave intruders long-lasting access to customer relationship management data. The stolen information ranges from basic contact details and business notes to highly sensitive identifiers such as Social Security numbers, dates of birth and driver's license information.",
      "Researchers say these intrusions align with activity from the extortion group ShinyHunters, with some overlap in tactics and infrastructure linked to other threat actors like Scattered Spider. Campaigns tracked under names such as UNC6395 and UNC6040 point to a larger \"extortion-as-a-service\" model, where criminal crews collaborate and share stolen data across underground forums.",
      "TransUnion's response",
      "CyberGuy reached out to TransUnion for a comment and received the following response:",
      "\"TransUnion recently experienced a cyber incident that affected a third-party application serving our U.S. consumer support operations. Upon discovery, we quickly contained the issue, which did not involve our core credit database or include credit reports.",
      "The incident involved unauthorized access to limited personal information for a very small percentage of U.S. consumers. We are working with law enforcement and have engaged third-party cybersecurity experts for an independent forensics review. Additionally, we will notify affected consumers and provide credit monitoring services.\"",
      "As for the gap between when the breach occurred (July 28, 2025) and when it was officially recorded as \"discovered\" (July 30, 2025), a TransUnion spokesperson clarified that the company\u00a0\"identified and contained this event within hours\" of it happening, but that it is common industry practice to designate a later \"date of discovery\" to reflect a more complete assessment following the initial response.",

      "Go through old online accounts, shopping profiles or cloud storage that may still hold sensitive data. Deleting what you no longer use reduces the amount of information that could be stolen in future breaches or sold on dark web forums. You can also get help from a data removal service.",

If you get an email or text claiming to be from TransUnion, your bank or any service asking you to \"verify\" details, don't click on the link. Instead, log in through the official website or call customer service directly.",

Use a password manager to create and store strong, unique passwords for every service. Even if hackers get hold of one, they won't be able to use it elsewhere. Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "Next, see if your passwords have been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "Two-factor authentication (2FA)\u00a0adds a critical extra step beyond just a password. If someone tries to break into your email, banking app or social media account, they'll also need the one-time code from your authenticator app or text message. This makes stolen credentials much less useful.",
      "Hackers often rely on outdated software to spread malware or steal information. Installing the latest updates for your phone, computer and apps ensures security patches are in place, blocking known vulnerabilities that attackers might exploit.",
      "One of the biggest risks after a breach is criminals opening new loans or credit cards in your name. A credit freeze with all three major bureaus, TransUnion, Equifax and Experian, prevents anyone from accessing your credit file without your approval. It's free and can be temporarily lifted if you need to apply for credit.",
      "Watch your bank and credit card statements for unfamiliar charges, no matter how small. Set up transaction alerts where available. You should also pull your free annual credit report to check for unauthorized accounts or inquiries, which could be signs of fraud.",
      "If your Social Security number, driver's license or other sensitive identifiers were exposed, you may want to sign up for an identity theft protection service. These services monitor credit reports, dark web forums and financial activity for signs of misuse. Some also include insurance or recovery assistance if your identity is stolen, giving you added peace of mind beyond basic credit monitoring. If you're one of the affected TransUnion users, make use of the 24 months of free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services. If not, you might get one yourself for the future.",

      "The emails often use well-known brands such as Apple, Netflix, Expedia, or even lawn service companies to make them seem credible. Some also include a \"DocuSign\" link with a security code, creating the illusion that you need to access a file to confirm the transaction.",
      "In reality, neither Apple nor these other companies sends billing receipts through DocuSign. That detail alone is a red flag. Another telltale sign is the sender's address. It may contain odd characters, such as a Cyrillic \"B\" replacing the \"B\" in \"Billing,\" which helps scammers bypass spam filters.",

      "How the DocuSign scam works",

It includes an order ID, a charge amount, and a DocuSign link that supposedly holds a receipt or confirmation file. To make it look even more convincing, some versions add a security code to \"unlock\" the document.",

      "Once you're on the call, the scammer tries to convince you that your account has been compromised or that the payment must be reversed right away. From there, the tactics vary. They might ask for your Apple ID, banking details, or card numbers. They may pressure you to download remote access software so they can \"fix\" the issue on your device.

      "The less information scammers can find about you online, the harder it is for them to craft convincing attacks. Consider removing old accounts you no longer use, limit the personal details you share publicly on social media, and use data removal services when possible.

      "Data breaches are no longer just a problem for the tech industry. They've become a constant across every sector, from airlines to banks to fashion brands, exposing personal data and leaving customers worried about where their information might end up. Insurance companies, sitting on mountains of sensitive details, are no exception. The latest to join the list is Farmers Insurance. The U.S. insurer confirmed that more than 1.1 million customers were affected in a breach linked to the Salesforce attacks that have swept through major organizations this year, stealing customer databases and fueling a growing wave of extortion attempts.",

      "Farmers Insurance has confirmed a data breach impacting more than 1.1 million customers. The incident is tied to the ongoing wave of Salesforce-related cyberattacks that have hit major companies this year.",
      "In a notice published on its website, the U.S. insurance giant said the breach occurred on May 29, 2025, through one of its third-party vendors. Farmers serves over 10 million households nationwide. It offers auto, home, life, and business insurance through a vast network of agents and subsidiaries.",
      "\"On May 30, 2025, one of Farmers' third-party vendors alerted Farmers to suspicious activity involving an unauthorized actor accessing one of the vendor's databases containing Farmers' customer information,\" the company wrote in its advisory.",

      "According to the company, the vendor's monitoring tools detected the intrusion quickly, allowing containment measures to be taken. Farmers said it immediately launched an investigation, notified law enforcement, and worked to determine the scope of the breach.",
      "The investigation revealed that the stolen data included customer names, addresses, dates of birth, and driver's license numbers. In some cases, the last four digits of Social Security numbers. Farmers began notifying affected individuals on Aug. 22, with a filing to the Maine Attorney General's Office confirming that 1,111,386 customers were impacted.",
      "While Farmers did not publicly name the vendor involved, reports indicate that the breach is part of the larger Salesforce data theft campaign carried out by threat actors this year.",

      "The Salesforce data theft campaign",
      "The Salesforce attacks have been ongoing since early 2025. Researchers attributed them to a threat actor cluster tracked as UNC6040/UNC6240. The intrusions typically begin with voice phishing (vishing) calls, where employees are tricked into approving a malicious OAuth application linked to their company's Salesforce instance.",
      "Once connected, attackers siphon customer relationship management (CRM) databases and use the stolen data in extortion attempts. The cybercrime group ShinyHunters has claimed responsibility, according to BleepingComputer. The group claims that the attacks involve overlapping threat groups, including members of the notorious Scattered Spider gang.",
      "Hackers exploited a third-party vendor tied to Salesforce systems to steal 1.1 million Farmers Insurance customer data. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "\"Like we have said repeatedly already, ShinyHunters and Scattered Spider are one and the same,\" a representative told the publication.\u00a0\"They provide us with initial access, and we conduct the dump and exfiltration of the Salesforce CRM instances. Just like we did with Snowflake.\"",

We recently discovered that an unauthorized third party briefly accessed a vendor's system that contained some Farmers' customer information. The incident involved only limited information from certain customers. An investigation-conducted with both internal and external security experts-found no evidence that the exposed data has been misused, nor any indication that Farmers' own systems were compromised.

      "You can't undo the damage once hackers have accessed your data. However, you can limit the fallout by investing in a data removal service. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "After a data breach, attackers often follow up with phishing emails or phone calls. They pretend to be from your insurance company or a support service. Don't click on links in unsolicited messages, and verify any claims through official channels before responding. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Change your passwords for all important accounts. Start with email, financial, and health-related logins. Use strong, unique passwords for each account. Consider using a password manager, which securely stores and generates complex passwords, reducing the risk of password reuse.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "Glass House Farms is not under investigation following raids at sites in Camarillo and Carpinteria. Of the 361 illegal immigrants arrested at both locations on July 10, at least 14 were minors who were rescued from potential exploitation, forced labor, and human trafficking, the Department of Homeland Security said.",

      "The group identified eight locations they said are known brothels, seven of which are in Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s district, while the other is in fellow progressive Rep. Grace Meng\u2019s district. The group flagged at least five street corners where they said sex workers operate.",

      "Berlin swing musician David Hermlin says he is facing cancellation after being excluded from some of Europe\u2019s leading jazz festivals and accused of intimidation at a meeting organized by a pro-Palestinian group.\u00a0The 25-year-old told Fox News Digital his only actions were asking two questions and wearing a yellow pin in solidarity with hostages still held in Gaza.\"I didn\u2019t harass or intimidate anyone. I merely asked two questions I thought were legitimate,\" Hermlin said.",
      "Known on social media as \"Daveetheewave,\" Hermlin has built a reputation not just for his music but for his image.

His yellow ribbon pin, worn neatly on the lapel of that tailored suit, stood out at this year\u2019s festival and became a flashpoint in the controversy.",
      "Hermlin\u2019s experience raises questions about free speech in the entertainment world. He frames his case as part of a broader historical pattern of exclusion.\"What kind of a world is this now that before I can play at a festival, I have to make a political statement?

      "The Herr\u00e4ng Dance Camp in Sweden is considered one of the world\u2019s most recognized swing festivals. At this year\u2019s gathering, a group called Jazz with Palestine held an open meeting. Hermlin was performing as a drummer with another ensemble, not his own orchestra.\u00a0He later learned that organizers not only excluded him from that group\u2019s jam sessions but made it clear they would not consider booking his personal projects, like The Swing Dance Orchestra.\"I went with the sole intention to just listen to their concerns and, if possible, have a dialogue,\" Hermlin explained.",
      "At the Jazz with Palestine meeting, Hermlin asked two questions. He wanted to know where monetary donations would be directed and what the lyrics of the Arabic song used for choreography meant. The exchange later prompted complaints about his \"intimidating presence.\"\"The first question was, if I want to donate some money, where are the donations going?\" Hermlin recalled. \"The second was, what\u2019s the meaning of the Arabic song? They said they didn\u2019t know. I asked, \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to know before filming a choreography?\u2019\"STATE DEPARTMENT PULLS VISAS FOR BRITISH BAND BOB VYLAN, FOLLOWING \u2018DEATH TO THE IDF\u2019 CHANTS AT GLASTONBURY",

      "He said he was stunned when a board member told him some attendees were uncomfortable.",
      "Hermlin also faced criticism for wearing a small yellow lapel pin, which symbolizes solidarity with the 50 hostages still held by Hamas. Festivalgoers suggested the pin was inflammatory or political propaganda. Hermlin rejects that characterization.\"People pointed at my yellow pin and said, \u2018Maybe people are aggressive because of your pin.\" I asked them, \u2019Do you know what it means?' They said no,\" he said. \"This pin is about the hostages. It\u2019s not about the IDF or the government. It\u2019s about empathy.\"",
      "After Herr\u00e4ng, Hermlin said other festivals began dropping him from their lineups while keeping his band. \"I\u2019m the only one being excluded. Not the band, just me,\" he said. \"A festival told me, \u2018don\u2019t take it personally, you\u2019ll get a cancellation fee.\u2019 But how is that not personal?\"",

On its website and social media, the group describes itself as a movement of jazz and swing dancers across Europe that uses music, dance and political action to stand with the Palestinian people.\u00a0Its mission statement says the group raises awareness and funds and that jazz is rooted in the \"fight against racial and colonial oppression.\" The group has recently promoted fundraising efforts for humanitarian groups in Gaza and announced plans for social dance events and educational forums.",
      "Hermlin says the treatment reminds him of both the McCarthy era and his own family\u2019s history in Berlin during the 1930s. He also points to the swing world\u2019s history of exclusion.\u00a0\"It reminds me of the McCarthy era, when artists were pressed to declare if they were communists. If you said yes, you were boycotted,\" he said. \"They did this in front of photos of Norma Miller, Frankie Manning and the Nicholas Brothers, artists excluded in the 1930s. How ironic is that?\"",

      "Trump\u2019s decision to deploy U.S. troops off of the South American nation prompted Maduro on Monday to decry the move as an attempt to seek regime change and said, \"Venezuela is confronting the biggest threat that has been seen on our continent in the last 100 years.\"",
      "The White House faced some international pushback and questions regarding what this strike meant for future U.S. policy when it comes to countering cartels and geopolitics in South America.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio looked to set the record straight during a Wednesday trip to Mexico \u2013 where he was also addressing cross-border arms and narcotics smuggling \u2013 and said, \"The President of the United States is going to wage war on narco-terrorist organizations.\"",
      "Rubio argued the previous policy of seize and apprehend \"doesn\u2019t work.\"",

      "The report by researchers from the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies at Bar-Ilan University, \"Debunking the Genocide Allegations: A Reexamination of the Israel-Hamas War\" (2023-2025), contends that the genocide narrative has been driven by faulty data, uncritical sourcing and a humanitarian system vulnerable to manipulation.",
      "A key element of the genocide accusations is the claim that Israel deliberately starved Gaza\u2019s population. The study argues that \"claims of starvation prior to March 2, 2025, were based on erroneous data, circular citations, and a failure to critically review sources.\" While U.N. officials and rights groups maintained that 500 trucks a day were needed to prevent famine, prewar U.N. figures show Gaza averaged 292 daily in 2022 \u2014 only 73 of them carrying food.",

      "The second factor is \"humanitarian bias\" \u2014 the tendency to exaggerate conditions to prompt action. \"Organizations warn of famine before it happens, relying on dubious facts to change reality. Questioning becomes an immoral act,\" Orbach said.",
      "The genocide allegation also rests on claims that Israel intentionally targeted civilians, but the study acknowledges civilian deaths while finding no evidence of a systematic policy of massacre.",
      "Orbach cited BBC data showing that between May 2024 and January 2025, 550 people were killed in designated safe zones\u2014just 2.1% to 3.5% of total casualties, even though half of Gaza\u2019s population was concentrated there for much of the period.",

    "story": [
      "The federal government will release data Friday morning that experts say is unlikely to allay concerns about a slowdown in the jobs market.",
      "Analysts estimate the U.S. added 75,000 jobs in July, which would be a slight improvement from the 73,000 in June. However, it would put the year-to-date total at 672,000, barring revisions, down from more than 1.1 million during the same period last year.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. economy appears to have stagnated\u201d since July, analysts with Citi said in a note this week. They cited a separate survey from the Federal Reserve released Wednesday that showed little to no increase in economic activity or employment over the past several weeks.",
      "The monthly jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is closely watched by economists to provide a snapshot of the economy. This one will be especially scrutinized: It will be the first since President Donald Trump fired the agency\u2019s head, Erika McEntarfer, over accusations of releasing inaccurate data. It\u2019s a charge that mainstream economists have dismissed while raising grave concerns that McEntarfer's dismissal risks politicizing a nonpartisan statistical agency.",
      "Trump\u2019s choice to replace McEntarfer, E.J. Antoni, has received criticism for misrepresenting data and, before his nomination was announced, called for pausing the monthly jobs report, which economists say would likely disrupt the global economy.",
      "Trump allies have rallied behind the nomination. \u201cE.J. Antoni is one of the sharpest economic minds in the nation \u2014 a fearless truth-teller who grasps that sound economics must serve the interests of American families, not globalist elites,\u201d Kevin Roberts, president of the Heritage Foundation, said in a statement. Antoni is chief economist at the Heritage Foundation. He awaits Senate confirmation.",
      "Other signs of a stagnant job-market piled up ahead of Friday\u2019s report. On Tuesday, the BLS reported hiring and firing rates were essentially unchanged in August from the prior month. It also reported job openings fell in July to the lowest in 10 months, though a separate measure tracked by the jobs site Indeed showed new job openings have been rising gradually since mid-July.",
      "The private payroll provider ADP reported Thursday that just 54,000 jobs were added in August, weaker than estimates. Challenger, Grey and Christmas consultancy said layoff announcements last month had surged 39% from July, while employers announced plans to add just 1,494 jobs in August, the lowest total for the month since Challenger began tracking hiring plans in 2009.",
      "Alongside the impact from federal layoffs and spending cuts, more employers are citing economic and market factors \u2014 including the effect of Trump\u2019s tariffs \u2014 to explain the slowdown in hiring, as well as store closings and bankruptcies, it said.",
      "\u201cSeptember is typically when we begin to see large seasonal hiring announcements, which foretell how retailers expect the holiday season to go. Coming off the lowest August on record for hiring plans, it may be a troubling sign,\u201d Challenger said.",
      "It is also taking longer for people who are unemployed to find work \u2014 about two and a half months at the median, a duration not seen since 2017. More workers are also dropping out of the labor force entirely, something that could be the result of Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown, which may be forcing foreign-born workers from their jobs.",
      "Trump administration officials and their allies have suggested the drop-outs are boosting job growth for native-born Americans, but multiple analysts say the data behind those assertions are merely products of statistical quirks. The unemployment rate for native-born Americans stood at 4.7%, in July, the highest level in eight years.",
      "\u201cIt seems likely that the Trump administration will use Friday\u2019s jobs report to continue to argue that their immigration policies are creating job market opportunities for U.S.-born workers, but this claim is false and based on a misreading of data from the household survey,\u201d Ben Zipperer, senior economist at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, wrote in a blog.",
      "\u201cIf anything, the job market for U.S.-born workers is worse so far in 2025 than it was in preceding years.\u201d"

    "summary": "If a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine ever comes together, the U.S. could take the lead role in monitoring a large buffer zone inside Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 If a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine ever comes together, the United States could take the lead role in monitoring a large buffer zone inside Ukraine envisioned as a way to protect the country from Russia, according to four people familiar with a plan that military officials from Ukraine\u2019s allies, including the United States, have been discussing.",
      "The buffer zone would be a large demilitarized area \u2014 the borders of which have not yet been decided \u2014 inside what is now Ukraine, dividing Russian and Ukrainian territory within the country. In part because of its technological capabilities, the United States would take the lead in watching the buffer zone, using drones and satellites along with other intelligence capabilities, but it would coordinate with other countries that would also monitor.",
      "The zone could then be secured by troops from one or more non-NATO countries, like Saudi Arabia or even Bangladesh, according to the people familiar with the plan. No U.S. troops would be deployed inside Ukraine, they said. Politico previously reported the general idea of a buffer zone.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin would have to agree to any plan for security guarantees for Ukraine, and NATO involvement or even the suggestion of it is a major issue for him, so the planners are taking pains to avoid using NATO forces or anything resembling NATO branding, some of the people familiar with the plan said.",
      "Instead, some of the guarantees would be likely to rely on the troops from non-NATO countries and on a patchwork of bilateral agreements among Ukraine and its allies that would give Ukraine security assurances without involving NATO\u2019s Article V \u2014 an attack on one means an attack on all \u2014 which amounts to a red line for Moscow.",
      "Any plan is only tentative until Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy agree to one, in addition to the leaders of the countries that would be involved in the security guarantees, including President Donald Trump.",
      "This one has been developed in the wake of Trump\u2019s meeting with Putin in Alaska on Aug. 15. That meeting was initially expected to lead to further talks, possibly direct discussions between Putin and Zelenskyy, but progress toward a peace deal has stalled since then. Still, Ukraine\u2019s allies have gone ahead with their work on the potential security guarantees, which would most likely be key to peace.",
      "On Thursday, members of the group of allies, which is informally known as the \u201ccoalition of the willing,\u201d met to potentially formalize aspects of the plan. The meeting was led by France and the United Kingdom, which are also expected to head up the overall effort to provide Ukraine with security after the war\u2019s end.",
      "Zelenskyy wrote on X after the meeting: \u201cWe discussed in detail each country\u2019s readiness to make a contribution to ensuring security on land, at sea, in the air, and in cyberspace. We coordinated positions and reviewed elements of security guarantees.\u201d",
      "Among the challenges involved in the planning are decisions about what kind of Russian incursions would trigger a response from either Ukraine or the monitoring forces and what kind of response would be allowed. one of the sources said. This person said that the rules of engagement still need to be worked out and that they are likely to be contested during any disagreements after a deal and the buffer are in place.",
      "Along with the buffer zone, it would also be important to guarantee that Russia could not choke off Ukraine\u2019s economy. To that point, Turkey would be responsible for ensuring the unimpeded flow of goods and services on the Black Sea by conducting maritime surveillance of and enforcement in the Bosporus and Dardanelles straits. Shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine, Turkey played a part in securing the maritime corridor that was established to get grain out of Ukraine.",
      "At the Pentagon, talks are being led by Air Force Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with a broader discussion also centered on deterrence, training and defense industrial cooperation. On the latter front, the United States is discussing with Ukraine a deal that could be worth around $100 billion, under which Kyiv would be able to buy American weapons, while in exchange the United States would get intellectual property rights for the cutting-edge systems the Ukrainians have been developing, according to a U.S. official.",
      "The week after Trump met with Putin, Caine briefed Trump on four options for the security guarantee and recommended the most forward-leaning approach, this official said.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt did not address the contours of the plan in a statement to NBC News.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is the decision maker,\u201d she wrote. \u201cOut of respect for ongoing diplomatic negotiations, the White House is not going to get ahead of him on these important matters.\u201d",
      "She added: \u201cAnyone anonymously claiming to know what he will or will not support doesn\u2019t know what they are talking about.\u201d",
      "The people familiar with the plan who spoke with NBC News did not say Trump had endorsed or ruled out any of the options."

    "story": [
      "JERUSALEM \u2014 He\u2019s quipped more than once that President Donald Trump misheard Israel\u2019s request for a \u201cMaccabee\u201d \u2014 an ancient Jewish warrior \u2014 and instead sent a \u201cHuckabee.\u201d",
      "But U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee says his devotion to Israel, and conviction that he is carrying out God\u2019s work in the Holy Land, is no joke.",
      "\u201cWe share a value system that is rooted deeply in a biblical understanding of a worldview that says that the individual is important,\u201d the Baptist minister, 70, said of Israel and the U.S. during a wide-ranging interview with NBC News last week. \u201cThat is, in my mind, the very essence of Western civilization. And it is on that platform that both the United States and Israel are built and that puts us in a very, very special relationship.\u201d",
      "Huckabee\u2019s strong ties to Israel were forged during more than 100 visits to the country before his appointment and are grounded in a belief that God commanded Jewish sovereignty over their biblical homeland.",
      "His ambassadorship could end up being deeply consequential. Not only was it a win for the evangelical Christian community, a vital part of Trump\u2019s base, but it was also a boon to Israel\u2019s far-right government as it faces unprecedented criticism for its war in the Gaza Strip. His stances in just over six months in Israel have hewn closely to the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s, even as Trump expresses occasional unease with the close U.S. ally\u2019s conduct.",
      "In July, images of badly emaciated children in Gaza prompted Trump to acknowledge \u201creal starvation\u201d in the enclave \u2014 a break with Netanyahu, who maintained there was no starvation.",
      "The following month, on Aug. 22, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, the world\u2019s leading body on hunger, officially declared famine in part of northern Gaza, including Gaza City. For months before that announcement, international humanitarian organizations had warned that the trickle of aid Israel had allowed into the enclave wasn\u2019t nearly enough to feed its population of 2.1 million."

      "\u201cIt usually starts in language, and that leads into acting, directing, poetry, fiction, writing,\u201d he explains. \u201cSo, it\u2019s really just finding different ways because the form is going to influence the expression. And I find that to be interesting.\u201d",
      "\u2018Life Is a Game\u2019",
      "At 65, Duchovny is celebrating his recent marriage to longtime girlfriend Monique Pendleberry. Prior to Pendleberry, he was married for nearly two decades to T\u00e9a Leoni, with whom he shares two children: West, 26, and Kyd, 23.",
      "When asked what he hopes he\u2019s imparted on his children, Duchovny ponders for a moment before answering, \u201cI think to take away the sense that life is just game, it doesn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d",
      "Not that life is trivial, he clarifies, but rather he hopes his kids take things seriously \u2014 but not too seriously.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a sense in which you want your kids to find their passion,\u201d says Duchovny, who explains that having passion is good, unless it prevents you from keeping an open mind to other possibilities.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always saying, that\u2019s not the world. There\u2019s many different worlds. But, yes, find the thing that turns you on. So, I\u2019m giving them very bad advice, I\u2019m giving contradictory advice.\u201d",

      "In reflecting on his own life, would he do anything differently if he could go back and do it all again?",
      "\u201cWell, I can\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it makes no sense to try and relive, relitigate or redo because you can\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Instead, he prefers to focus on the philosophy behind failure, the subject of his popular podcast, \u201cFail Better,\u201d which he launched in 2024.",
      "In the Q&A podcast, Duchovny interviews newsmakers like Bette Midler, Ben Stiller and Amanda Knox about how perceived failure can actually be the catalyst for opportunity and personal growth.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know when we\u2019re on the right road. Most of the time, we just know we\u2019re on some kind of road and we have some kind of goal,\u201d he says about the concepts of success and failure.",
      "\u201cFailure towards an imperfect goal or a wrong goal or whatever you think you\u2019re going or doing can be a good thing. So, failure and success are really, at this point, I don\u2019t see them as meaningful. They\u2019re just snapshots in time. What could be a success is actually a failure waiting to happen and vice versa.\u201d",
      "On \u2018The X-Files\u2019: \u2018They Really Had a Crystal Ball\u2019",
      "On the subject of success, one of Duchovny\u2019s notable accomplishments is his turn as FBI agent Fox Mulder on the hit show \u201cThe X-Files.\u201d The sci-fi program, which originally ran from 1993-2002 before reboots in 2016 and 2018, launched his career and made the actor a household name.",

      "Known for its spooky UFO and paranormal themes, was there ever an episode that left Duchovny feeling particularly unsettled?",
      "\u201cSometimes I think back, and I said this to (series creator) Chris Carter, 'I think you really were kind of Nostradamus in a way. You really saw a lot of what\u2019s going on, a lot of the conspiratorial thinking and stuff like that happen.' So, it\u2019s not really one episode, but I\u2019m just kind of amazed at that writers room, which included Vince Gilligan, Jim Wong, Darin Morgan, Glen Morgan, Howard Gordon. This was a heavy-hitting writers room, and they really had a crystal ball.\u201d",
      "\u2018I\u2019m Not Content Ever\u2019",
      "In addition to his latest book, Duchovny says he\u2019s also just wrapped a new album, though he\u2019s not sure when it\u2019ll be released.",
      "It\u2019s the fourth for the actor-musician whose other albums include his 2015 debut, \u201cHell or Highwater,\u201d \u201cEvery Third Thought,\u201d released in 2018, as well as the 2021 album \u201cGestureland.\u201d",
      "With so many projects on his plate, it begs the question: Does Duchovny have unfinished business?",
      "\u201cNo,\u201d he says without hesitating. \u201cNo. There\u2019s just more business.\u201d",
      "Even so, it doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s static.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not content ever. It\u2019s good to have a new thing to do or to have a new project because they all have different hurdles. They all have different problems to solve. And that\u2019s when you get creative is when you\u2019re solving problems.\u201d"

This time, we\u2019re different,\u201d Todd Chrisley tells TODAY.com. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone through a lot, and I don\u2019t think that you can go through what we\u2019ve gone through and come back and be the same \u2014 and if you do, you probably should go back.\u201d",

    "summary": "If a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine ever comes together, the U.S. could take the lead role in monitoring a large buffer zone inside Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 If a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine ever comes together, the United States could take the lead role in monitoring a large buffer zone inside Ukraine envisioned as a way to protect the country from Russia, according to four people familiar with a plan that military officials from Ukraine\u2019s allies, including the United States, have been discussing.",
      "The buffer zone would be a large demilitarized area \u2014 the borders of which have not yet been decided \u2014 inside what is now Ukraine, dividing Russian and Ukrainian territory within the country. In part because of its technological capabilities, the United States would take the lead in watching the buffer zone, using drones and satellites along with other intelligence capabilities, but it would coordinate with other countries that would also monitor.",
      "The zone could then be secured by troops from one or more non-NATO countries, like Saudi Arabia or even Bangladesh, according to the people familiar with the plan. No U.S. troops would be deployed inside Ukraine, they said. Politico previously reported the general idea of a buffer zone.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin would have to agree to any plan for security guarantees for Ukraine, and NATO involvement or even the suggestion of it is a major issue for him, so the planners are taking pains to avoid using NATO forces or anything resembling NATO branding, some of the people familiar with the plan said.",
      "Instead, some of the guarantees would be likely to rely on the troops from non-NATO countries and on a patchwork of bilateral agreements among Ukraine and its allies that would give Ukraine security assurances without involving NATO\u2019s Article V \u2014 an attack on one means an attack on all \u2014 which amounts to a red line for Moscow.",
      "Any plan is only tentative until Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy agree to one, in addition to the leaders of the countries that would be involved in the security guarantees, including President Donald Trump.",
      "This one has been developed in the wake of Trump\u2019s meeting with Putin in Alaska on Aug. 15. That meeting was initially expected to lead to further talks, possibly direct discussions between Putin and Zelenskyy, but progress toward a peace deal has stalled since then. Still, Ukraine\u2019s allies have gone ahead with their work on the potential security guarantees, which would most likely be key to peace.",
      "On Thursday, members of the group of allies, which is informally known as the \u201ccoalition of the willing,\u201d met to potentially formalize aspects of the plan. The meeting was led by France and the United Kingdom, which are also expected to head up the overall effort to provide Ukraine with security after the war\u2019s end.",
      "Zelenskyy wrote on X after the meeting: \u201cWe discussed in detail each country\u2019s readiness to make a contribution to ensuring security on land, at sea, in the air, and in cyberspace. We coordinated positions and reviewed elements of security guarantees.\u201d",
      "Among the challenges involved in the planning are decisions about what kind of Russian incursions would trigger a response from either Ukraine or the monitoring forces and what kind of response would be allowed. one of the sources said. This person said that the rules of engagement still need to be worked out and that they are likely to be contested during any disagreements after a deal and the buffer are in place.",
      "Along with the buffer zone, it would also be important to guarantee that Russia could not choke off Ukraine\u2019s economy. To that point, Turkey would be responsible for ensuring the unimpeded flow of goods and services on the Black Sea by conducting maritime surveillance of and enforcement in the Bosporus and Dardanelles straits. Shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine, Turkey played a part in securing the maritime corridor that was established to get grain out of Ukraine.",
      "At the Pentagon, talks are being led by Air Force Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with a broader discussion also centered on deterrence, training and defense industrial cooperation. On the latter front, the United States is discussing with Ukraine a deal that could be worth around $100 billion, under which Kyiv would be able to buy American weapons, while in exchange the United States would get intellectual property rights for the cutting-edge systems the Ukrainians have been developing, according to a U.S. official.",
      "The week after Trump met with Putin, Caine briefed Trump on four options for the security guarantee and recommended the most forward-leaning approach, this official said.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt did not address the contours of the plan in a statement to NBC News.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is the decision maker,\u201d she wrote. \u201cOut of respect for ongoing diplomatic negotiations, the White House is not going to get ahead of him on these important matters.\u201d",
      "She added: \u201cAnyone anonymously claiming to know what he will or will not support doesn\u2019t know what they are talking about.\u201d",
      "The people familiar with the plan who spoke with NBC News did not say Trump had endorsed or ruled out any of the options."

      "Had she done so, Magnus said, she would have known the correct amount was 70,000 pounds rather than the 30,000 she paid.",
      "\"I believe Ms. Rayner has acted with integrity and with a dedicated and exemplary commitment to public service,\" he said.  But he faulted her \"unfortunate failure\" to pay her taxes correctly, particularly given she was minister for housing at the time.",
      "Tax experts say Rayner will likely now face a fine of up to 12,000 pounds from His Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs, Britain\u2019s tax authority.",
      "Starmer under pressure",
      "In a handwritten note, Starmer said he was \"very sad\" that Rayner's tenure had \"ended in this way,\" but said it was \"right\" that she had acted on the conclusion of her ethics report despite knowing it was \"very painful\" for her.",
      "Kemi Badenoch, leader of the opposition Conservative Party, reacted to her resignation by accusing Starmer of having \"no principle, no backbone\" and saying that \"questions remain\" about what he knew, and when.",
      "Just 14 months ago, Starmer won a historic landslide victory against a Conservative Party whose 14-year rule had ended in scandal and widespread public disdain. But polls suggested that his victory owed as much to his opponent\u2019s toxic image as any ringing enthusiasm for his own platform.",
      "Whereas his predecessor as party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, had sought to take Labour back to its leftist roots, Starmer was more in the mold of Tony Blair: relatively progressive social values mixed with economic conservatism that critics say departed little from his right-wing opponents.",
      "That alleged caution has been met with opposition from multiple sides.",
      "Many on the left see him as maddeningly unimaginative in the face of a long-term economic malaise that they say requires radical, progressive action. And the right see him as too soft on immigration, most notably the \u201csmall boats\u201d crisis that continues to see tens of thousands of asylum seekers cross the English Channel each year.",
      "Immigration is now the top priority for voters, polls show, and opinion surveys are now led by Nigel Farage, the friend and ally of American President Donald Trump, who leads the Reform political party.",
      "If he becomes prime minister after the next election scheduled for 2029, Farage has promised to enact a mass deportation scheme removing 600,000 undocumented migrants from Britain.",
      "Rayner\u2019s departure is doubly significant because she also quit from the role of deputy party leader, which is chosen by the party members, rather than Starmer himself.",
      "This means a more outspoken left-wing lawmaker could be voted into the role \u2014 increasing the pressure on Starmer to veer left in search of a solution."

    "summary": "An iconic winged lion that has perched above Venice for centuries, may have originated in China, according to a new study.",
    "story": [
      "For centuries, an iconic winged lion has perched above Venice, a symbol of the \u201cFloating City\u201d that millions of tourists have passed under in St. Mark\u2019s Square.",
      "But scientists now believe that this ancient emblem of the Italian city may in fact have origins a world away.",
      "A study released Thursday found evidence that the statue may have been partially made in China and arrived in northern Italy after a long journey across the medieval Silk Road that may have involved the father of the explorer Marco Polo and the court of the Mongol emperor Kublai Khan.",
      "Historical documents confirm the statue was in Venice by the late 13th century, but its history before that remains murky.",
      "How the lion made its way to Venice \u2014 an economic powerhouse in the medieval world owing to its strategic position close to Europe and the Byzantine Empire \u2014 has long been a mystery.",
      "It was assumed by experts that the statue may have come from ancient Persia or Syria.",
      "By studying copper isotopes taken from samples of the statue, scientists were able to identify that the metal originated from the Yangtze River in eastern-central China, more than 8,000 miles away from where it now stands.",
      "Their findings were published in the archeology journal Antiquity.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a rather extraordinary discovery,\u201d Hannah Skoda, associate professor of medieval history at the University of Oxford, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cAt the same time it is indicative of the sheer extent and intensity of global trading networks, even in this really early period,\u201d which would have made the long journey from China to Italy via the Silk Road possible all those centuries ago,\" Skoda, who was not involved in the study, said in a phone interview.",
      "The study\u2019s conclusion \u201cis striking \u2014 though perhaps not quite as improbable as it might sound,\u201d said Peter Frankopan, professor of global history at Oxford and author of \u201cThe Silk Roads: A New History of the World.\u201d",
      "\u201cDiscoveries like this are not unusual once you start to look carefully at the materials, the motifs and the methods that shaped the cities we think we know,\u201d he said by email.",
      "The statue may not even be a lion at all, the study suggests.",
      "Researchers argue that the figure closely mirrors tomb guardians from the Tang dynasty, which ruled from the 6th to 9th centuries during China\u2019s golden age. These ancient sculptures were known as \u201czhenmushou\u201d and share similar features with the Venice statue such as the position of the ears and the distinctive \u201cbulbous nose,\u201d according to the study.",
      "There are no written records telling us where the statue that now looks down from a Piazzetta column in St. Mark\u2019s came from. The only historical document mentioning it dates to 1293, and researchers have long presumed that the statue had a rich history before it made its way to Venice.",
      "Scientists still don\u2019t have a firm grasp on how exactly the statue traversed such great distances across multiple continents all those years ago. However, the study suggests that Niccolo and Maffeo Polo, Marco Polo\u2019s father and uncle, might have discovered the original statue in the 13th century while visiting the court of Kublai Khan in what is now Beijing.",
      "As traveling merchants, they would have then transported the statue back to their home city of Venice along the famed Silk Road.",
      "Pointing to the fact that the city had not long ago adopted the lion as its emblem, the study suggested that the Polo brothers may have seen a Chinese figure and had the \u201cbrazen idea of readapting the sculpture into a plausible (when viewed from afar) Winged Lion.\u201d",
      "While not enough evidence exists to be sure of this rumored route, experts say the statue\u2019s eastern origins underscore Venice\u2019s longstanding global prowess.",
      "As with so many great trading centers in history, Frankopan said, \u201cthe city\u2019s capacity to absorb and adapt outside influences \u2014 from Byzantine mosaics to Egyptian porphyry \u2026 is what gave it dynamism and resilience.\u201d",
      "In such a global city, he adds, \u201ca Tang dynasty lion fits right in.\u201d"

      "It was unclear whether the conversation was also being translated for Kim, believed to be 41, who was smiling and looking toward the older leaders.",
      "Though they may have just been making conversation, the exchange holds extra weight because both Putin and Xi have indicated an interest in staying in office as long as possible.",
      "Xi, who has been president since 2013, was awarded a rare third term in 2023 after he removed the two-term limit from the constitution five years earlier, breaking with China\u2019s long-standing tradition of changing leaders every decade. In another departure from historical practice, he has not given any sign of who his successor might be.",
      "Putin, who has been president or prime minister of Russia since 2000, won a controversial referendum in 2020 that amended the constitution to allow him to potentially stay in power until 2036. At that point, he would be 83 and Russia\u2019s longest-serving ruler since Peter the Great.",
      "Putin is known for his long-standing interest in longevity, and last year Russian lawmakers established an anti-aging research center called \u201cNew Health Preservation Technologies\u201d after Putin said the nation should focus on preserving the health of its citizens.",
      "Though Xi does not appear to have the same fixation, Chinese leaders tend to enjoy long lives, with Deng Xiaoping living until 92 and his successor, Jiang Zemin, making it to 96.",
      "Organ transplants are a sensitive subject in China, where rights groups say organs may still be harvested from executed prisoners even after the government pledged to end the controversial practice in 2014. China has long struggled with a shortage of donated organs because of cultural taboos, and in 2023 the government issued new rules tightening regulation and promoting public awareness.",
      "There was little discussion of the two leaders\u2019 impromptu exchange on Chinese social media, which is heavily censored.",
      "Putin confirmed the conversation with Xi when reporters asked about it later Wednesday, saying, \u201cOh, I believe the chairman talked about it when we were going to the parade.\u201d",
      "\u201cModern means, both health improvement, and medical means and even all kinds of surgical ones related to organ replacement, allow humanity to hope that active life will continue not as it does today,\u201d he said.",
      "He also appeared to refer to United Nations estimates that by 2050 there will be more than twice as many people over 60 as children under 5.",
      "\u201cThis will have social, political and economic consequences,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should certainly think about this, too, when we talk about life expectancy.\u201d"

      "KCNA confirmed that Kim had left Beijing on his private train Thursday night, saying he was seen off at Beijing Railway Station by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and other senior Chinese officials.",
      "The agency said the North Korean leader\u2019s visit to China was \u201ca historic occasion which further strengthened the political trust and strategic cooperation\u201d between the two countries and \u201cshowed the invariability and invincibility\u201d of their relations, which have overcome \u201call sorts of trials and challenges.\u201d",
      "By stressing the unchanging nature of their relationship despite international shifts, \u201cthe summit also gave North Korea grounds to justify holding on to its nuclear weapons,\u201d Lim said. \u201cWith China voicing support for Pyongyang\u2019s own \u2018core interests,\u2019 Beijing can be seen as tacitly acknowledging North Korea\u2019s status as a nuclear-armed state.\u201d",

      "While Xi and Kim did not mention a possible U.S.-North Korea summit, their references to strengthening cooperation, high-level exchanges and strategic communication \u201csuggest that close consultations between Beijing and Pyongyang are to be expected before any such summit is pursued,\u201d said Yang Moo-jin, distinguished chair professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, South Korea.",
      "He said a U.S.-North Korea summit was unlikely in the near future.",

    "story": [
      "With the United States seemingly content to take a back seat, a high-level meeting in Paris on Thursday will seek to answer the question: Can European powers step up and bring Ukraine and Russia closer to peace?",
      "An actual halt in fighting seems an increasingly distant ambition, with President Donald Trump \u2014 who called into the meeting \u2014 having said that he remained hopeful but that the two sides were clearly \u201cnot ready yet\u201d to make a deal.",
      "\u201cTrump emphasized that Europe must stop purchasing Russian oil that is funding the war,\" a White House official told NBC News on Thursday after Trump spoke to European leaders. The official added that he also told the leaders they had to \u201cplace economic pressure on China for funding Russia\u2019s war efforts.\u201d",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday during a visit to Beijing that he will end the war by force if Ukraine does not agree to his demands. He suggested he would meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but only in Moscow.",
      "With Trump adopting a lesser role after his peace push stalled, European powers hope to plug the diplomatic gap.",
      "They met in Paris early Thursday as part of the informal \u201cCoalition of the Willing\u201d \u2014 nations that say they are prepared to underwrite the \u201csecurity guarantees\u201d Ukraine says it needs to be confident any future ceasefire would hold.",
      "Hosting the talks, French President Emmanuel Macron said Wednesday that after months of planning, \u201cwe are ready as Europeans to offer security guarantees to Ukraine and the Ukrainian people the day a peace deal is signed.\u201d He declined to offer details, saying they were \u201cextremely confidential.\u201d",
      "The meeting included Zelenskyy, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.",
      "During the meeting, Starmer \u201cemphasized that the group had an unbreakable pledge to Ukraine, with President Trump\u2019s backing, and it was clear they now needed to go even further to apply pressure on Putin to secure a cessation of hostilities,\u201d his office said afterward.",
      "Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez was due to attend, but a technical problem forced his plane to turn around, meaning he will join the summit virtually.",
      "After the meeting, the leaders held a 90-minute phone call with Trump, who has said that he is willing to offer American support as a \u201cbackstop\u201d but that the initiative must be led by the Europeans.",
      "Macron said after the meeting that 26 countries, which he did not name, had agreed to send troops to Ukraine after the war ends.",

      "Andrii Yermak, Zelenskyy's powerful chief of staff, said Thursday that he had met with Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, in Paris.",
      "The security guarantees \"must be strong and effective\u2014in the air, at sea, and on land,\" he said in a statement. \"The war launched by Russia must be stopped. President Trump\u2019s principle of \u2018peace through strength\u2019 is exactly the kind of approach that can influence the aggressor.\"",
      "For Trump, the war is proving harder to resolve than his onetime claim that he would be able to fix the situation in 24 hours. He has increasingly expressed disappointment and even anger toward Putin but has repeatedly stopped short of imposing new sanctions against Moscow despite numerous threats.",
      "After his push for a meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy appeared to have fallen apart, Trump conceded Wednesday that there was still a chasm between the two leaders.",
      "\u201cSomething is going to happen, but they are not ready yet. But something is going to happen. We are going to get it done,\u201d Trump said in a phone interview with CBS News.",
      "Since the Kremlin's full-scale invasion in February 2022, Ukraine has been bombed nightly by Russian missiles and drones and repeatedly said it is ready to call a ceasefire. Russia has rejected that, maintaining it will not do so until Ukraine has fulfilled a set of demands that resemble surrender.",
      "However, Kyiv is still deeply wary of a ceasefire, warning Russia could use it to rearm, regroup and launch other attacks on Ukraine and neighboring countries in Europe.",
      "That\u2019s why it and other European powers say the much-vaunted but knotty \u201csecurity guarantees\u201d are essential. They could come in the form of European peacekeeper troops being stationed in Ukraine to uphold the ceasefire, although Russia has summarily rejected that idea so far.",
      "During his high-profile visit to China on Wednesday, Putin gave no signal of shifting from his absolutist demands that Ukraine must surrender and come back into Moscow\u2019s sphere of influence.",
      "He believes he is winning this conflict, throwing thousands of troops' lives into his war machine each week for grinding battlefield gains.",
      "Putin did say that \u201cif common sense prevails, then it is possible to agree on an acceptable option for ending this conflict,\u201d adding that Trump\u2019s \u201csincere desire to find this solution\u201d meant there is \u201ca certain light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d",

      "\u201cThese drug cartels, what they do is they know they\u2019re going to lose 2% of their cargo,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThey bake it into their economics. What will stop them is when you blow them up.\u201d",
      "Additional U.S. military forces",

    "summary": "A federal appeals court ruled that the president does not have the authority to set sweeping tariffs under the emergency-powers law he invoked.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court on Wednesday to quickly decide whether he has the power to impose broad tariffs under a law designed for use during times of emergency.",
      "The Justice Department is appealing a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on Friday that President Donald Trump had exceeded his authority, the filings said.",
      "The filings, shared by the Justice Department and the challengers, have not yet been officially docketed by the Supreme Court.",
      "Jeffrey Schwab, a lawyer for the Liberty Justice Center \u2014 which is representing businesses challenging the tariffs \u2014 said in a statement he was confident the court would rule against Trump.",
      "\u201cThese unlawful tariffs are inflicting serious harm on small businesses and jeopardizing their survival. We hope for a prompt resolution of this case for our clients,\u201d he added.",
      "The appeals court, divided 7-4, said the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which allows the president to regulate imports when there is a national emergency, does not give sweeping powers to impose global tariffs of unspecified duration.",
      "The tariffs are in effect and will remain in place until at least Oct. 14 under the appeals court ruling.",
      "The administration submitted two filings: an appeal and a motion to expedite.",
      "In the latter, Solicitor General D. John Sauer asked the justices to fast-track consideration of the case so oral arguments can be heard as soon as the first week of November. That would require the court to decide by next week whether to hear the case.",
      "The challengers have agreed to that timeline, a Liberty Justice Center spokesman said.",
      "The appeals court's \"erroneous decision has disrupted highly impactful, sensitive, ongoing diplomatic trade negotiations, and cast a pall of legal uncertainty over the President\u2019s efforts to protect our country by preventing an unprecedented economic and foreign-policy crisis,\" Sauer wrote.",
      "The filings included a declaration by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent citing the importance of a quick ruling.",
      "\"Swift review of that decision is necessary to avoid derailing critical ongoing negotiations with our foreign trading partners and threatening broader U.S. strategic interests internationally,\" he wrote.",
      "The high court has a 6-3 conservative majority, including three Trump appointees. Although it has frequently ruled in favor of Trump in the first few months of his term, some legal experts believe it may be more skeptical about his tariff powers.",
      "During the Biden administration, the court was skeptical of the White House\u2019s moves to seek broad powers via laws enacted by Congress that did not explicitly authorize them. In one significant example, the court, endorsing what has been dubbed the \"major questions doctrine,\" ruled against President Joe Biden's plan to forgive student loan debt.",
      "The case under appeal affects two sets of tariffs Trump has imposed. The first are the country-by-country or \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs, which now range from 34% for China to a 10% baseline for the rest of the world. The second is a 25% tariff Trump imposed on some goods from Canada, China and Mexico for what the administration said was their failure to curb the flow of fentanyl.",
      "Other tariffs implemented under other laws, such as 50% steel and aluminum tariffs on all other worldwide trading partners, were implemented under other statutes not at issue in the case.",
      "Even if Trump loses at the Supreme Court, he has other avenues to impose additional tariffs.",
      "V.O.S. Selections Inc., a wine and spirits importer, and Plastic Services and Products, a pipe and fittings company, are among five businesses that sued Trump over his use of the emergency law. Twelve states also challenged the move.",
      "The Court of International Trade initially blocked the tariffs in late May, prompting the Trump administration to appeal.",
      "Trump has long sought to raise revenue by taxing imported goods, which he believes will revitalize manufacturing in the United States. While the tariffs are bringing in billions of dollars in revenue, economists say they are slowing U.S. economic growth, while inflation has also ticked up."

      "At least 15 people were killed and 18 were injured in a crash of a popular funicular railway in Lisbon, Portugal, on Wednesday, according to local authorities.",
      "Portuguese Prime Minister Lu\u00eds Montenegro expressed condolences for the victims in a statement and said an investigation has been launched to determine the cause of the accident.",
      "The mayor of Lisbon, Carlos Moedas, announced three days of mourning \"for the victims of the tragic accident\" on X.",
      "A video posted on social media and verified by NBC News showed a yellow funicular car lying on its side amid scattered debris with the roof cracked open. A separate video verified by NBC News showed people searching through the twisted metal of the wreckage.",
      "The funicular that crashed, the Elevador de Gl\u00f3ria, connects Restauradores Square to the Jardim de S\u00e3o Pedro de Alc\u00e2ntara in the Bairro Alto neighborhood. There are two other funicular railways in the city, according to a site run by the Lisbon Tourism Association.",
      "The commander of the Lisbon fire brigade, Alexandre Rodrigues, told a group of journalists that they were alerted about the derailment at 6:01 p.m. and arrived within three minutes.",
      "The funicular car \"derailed, crashed into the building, and now the causes will have to be analyzed by the competent authorities,\"   he said, noting that there was no confirmation yet of the nationalities of the people killed and injured.",
      "Carris, the company that operates the funicular, said in a statement on Wednesday that \"all maintenance protocols were carried out and complied with\" and that the last repairs were done in 2024.",
      "Manuel Leal, the head of the Federation of Transport and Communications Workers\u2019 Unions (Fectrans) and the Union of Road and Urban Transport Workers of Portugal (STRUP) said on Wednesday that Carris workers had made \"repeated complaints\" about the need for maintenance on the funicular carriages, according to the Portuguese state news agency Lusa.",
      "\"There must be an investigation into the root causes of this accident, not least because workers have been reporting for a long time that the maintenance of these carriages should be the responsibility of Carris workers and not outsourced to external companies, as is the case with the Gl\u00f3ria lift,\u201d he said."

      "The pleasantries, though, came with a twist \u2014 in the very same breath, he accused Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un of conspiring against the United States as the trio gathered at a massive military parade in Beijing on Wednesday.",
      "Though the grand display of missiles and marching troops may have been capped by the release of 80,000 doves into the skies of the Chinese capital, the American president suggested he saw something altogether more sinister behind the spectacle.",
      "\u201cMay President Xi and the wonderful people of China have a great and lasting day of celebration,\u201d Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. \u201cPlease give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America.\u201d",
      "Trump also said he was \u201cvery disappointed in President Putin,\u201d after the Kremlin brushed aside his efforts to arrange a summit with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and continued to unleash intense strikes across Ukraine.",
      "He told The Scott Jennings Radio Show that the U.S. will \u201cbe doing something to help people live,\u201d but did not elaborate.",
      "Putin said Wednesday that he was ready to hold talks with Zelenskyy, if the Ukrainian leader came to Moscow.",

      "\u201cNo one was plotting any conspiracies, no one was plotting anything,\u201d foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov told state television Wednesday. \u201cMoreover, no one even had such a thought.\u201d",

      "Conspiracy or not, the parade and its trio of high-profile attendees served as an unmistakable message to Trump and others watching in the West.",
      "Xi defiantly declared China was \u201cunstoppable\u201d and said that humanity must choose between peace and war as he outlined his alternative to the U.S.-led global order that has been buffeted by added turbulence in the Trump era.",
      "On the surface, the \u201cVictory Day\u201d parade marked the 80th anniversary of Imperial Japan\u2019s surrender at the end of World War II.",
      "In practice, it was a colossal display of strength, showcasing hypersonic missiles, drones, and fighter jets as part of Xi\u2019s push to modernize the military and challenge the West.",
      "A host of countries at odds with the U.S. and its allies were in attendance for this display of unity by the \u201cAxis of Upheaval,\u201d marked by its collective support for Russia as it attacks Ukraine.",
      "No U.S. delegation was present in Beijing, but one notable American seemed to be watching on.",
      "Trump struck a more relaxed tone on The Scott Jennings Radio Show earlier in the day, saying he was \u201cnot concerned at all\u201d about China and Russia possibly forming an axis.",
      "\u201cWe have the strongest military in the world by far,\u201d he said. \u201cThey would never use their military on us, believe me. That would be the worst thing they could ever do.\u201d",
      "China has strived to appear neutral in the war but has provided Russia with a diplomatic and economic lifeline, while Putin thanked Pyongyang on the sidelines of the Beijing gathering for sending troops to fight against Ukraine. Kim promised to do \u201ceverything I can to assist\u201d Moscow.",
      "Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, whose country has provided military support for Russia, was also in Beijing.",
      "The war in Ukraine has been \u201ca key catalyst in pulling together these countries,\u201d said Edward Howell, a lecturer in international relations at the University of Oxford.",
      "\u201cThis axis of authoritarian states is strengthening,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cIt\u2019s not just individual threats coming from North Korea or Russia or China, it\u2019s the links between all three of them.\u201d",
      "And Trump did sound more concerned as he watched on later.",
      "In his Truth Social post, Trump mentioned the \u201cmassive amount of support and \u2018blood\u2019\u201d the U.S. gave China during World War II.",

      "A plane carrying the continent\u2019s top official lost its GPS navigation while midair over the continent\u2019s wary east over the weekend and was forced to land using paper maps. This was the most high-profile case yet, officials and experts said Tuesday, of a Russian strategy that is not only disrupting travel but imperiling lives.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen\u2019s flight landed safely in Bulgaria, just a short distance from Russian territory. But it has given a jolt to European fears over Moscow\u2019s suspected interference with Western signals.",
      "Once a background nuisance, the issue has surged into a mounting security concern \u2014 escalating in step with Moscow\u2019s war in Ukraine \u2014 and has the continent scrambling to adapt.",
      "NATO 'working day and night'",
      "Bulgarian authorities later confirmed that the satellite signal guiding the plane\u2019s navigation system had been neutralized. The European Commission said Bulgaria suspected \u201cblatant interference by Russia.\u201d",

      "He framed the signal interference as part of a much broader campaign spanning the cutting of undersea cables in the Baltic Sea and a cyberattack on Britain\u2019s National Health Service.",
      "The threat from Russia was \u201cincreasing every day,\u201d he said.",
      "The disruption of von der Leyen\u2019s plane has thrust the issue into the spotlight at a time when Europe is already on edge over the war in Ukraine and its spillover effects.",
      "While pilots and ship captains expected occasional outages near Russia\u2019s borders or conflict zones, incidents have surged in recent years.",
      "The Bulgarian Air Traffic Services Authority said there had been a \u201cnoticeable increase\u201d in GPS incidents, including jamming, since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "In June, 13 European Union member states raised the alarm over jamming and spoofing threats disrupting air and sea travel.",
      "According to an E.U. document, Poland logged 2,732 cases of interference in January 2025, up from 1,908 in late 2023. Lithuania recorded 1,185 cases in the same month, more than double the figure from March 2024.",

      "Germany\u2019s top military commander, Gen. Carsten Breuer, said Monday there had been a significant increase in GPS jamming incidents since the war in Ukraine began, adding that he had personally experienced it on two occasions, once over the Baltic Sea and again during a military exercise in Lithuania.",

      "A 'happy propaganda coup'?",
      "Open-source research tracing the origins of interference repeatedly points to two hot spots: Russia\u2019s Kaliningrad exclave, wedged between Poland and Lithuania, and the St. Petersburg area in western Russia. Both regions host a heavy concentration of Russian military units specializing in electronic warfare.",
      "In March 2024, a Royal Air Force plane carrying the U.K.\u2019s then\u2013defense secretary, Grant Shapps, also reported a spoofing incident, where false location data was fed to the aircraft\u2019s navigation systems.",
      "The plane, which had been flying near Kaliningrad, was able to continue its journey safely, but such tactics have in the past caused planes to veer off course.",
      "The incident with von der Leyen\u2019s plane occurred while she was on a four-day tour of E.U. member states that border Russia, Belarus or the Black Sea.",
      "While \u201cincredibly irresponsible,\u201d jamming von der Leyen\u2019s plane wasn\u2019t necessarily a \u201cmalicious action\u201d directed against her specifically, said Thomas Withington, an electronic warfare and air defense expert at the Royal United Services Institute, a think tank in London.",
