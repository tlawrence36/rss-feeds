      "The actor, who would have turned 90 on Dec. 8, had been in and out of a hospital in the financial capital, Mumbai, over the past few weeks.",
      "A senior police official who had spoken to Dharmendra's doctor confirmed the death on condition of anonymity. Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered his condolences, saying the actor's death marks the end of an era in Indian cinema.",
      "\u201cHe was an iconic film personality, a phenomenal actor who brought charm and depth to every role he played. The manner in which he played diverse roles struck a chord with countless people,\u201d Modi said on social media platform X.",
      "Often called Bollywood\u2019s \u201cHe-Man,\u201d Dharmendra combined the old-school heroism of an action star with the tenderness of a romantic lead, making him one of India\u2019s most iconic actors. Though most of his fame came from roles in which he embodied the archetype of a larger-than-life hero \u2014 upright, patriotic and fearless \u2014 his charming performances in romantic hits equally made him popular with the masses.",
      "Dharmendra\u2019s performance in \u201cSholay\u201d (1975) \u2014 Bollywood\u2019s take on the Spaghetti Western and regarded as one of India\u2019s greatest films \u2014 earned him enduring popularity. His roles in other Hindi-language hits, from the romantic comedy \u201cChupke Chupke\u201d (1975) to the action drama \u201cMera Gaon Mera Desh\u201d (1971), made him one of the most recognizable film faces from that era.",
      "His role in Bollywood classic \u201cSholay,\u201d where he played an affable character alongside Amitabh Bachchan, his co-actor in the film, cemented his status as a superstar. The duo\u2019s on-screen partnership also became one of Bollywood\u2019s most iconic pairings.",
      "His on-screen chemistry with actress Hema Malini, whom he later married, became one of Bollywood\u2019s most popular collaborations, as the pair acted together in more than two dozen films. But their union was rooted in scandal. Dharmendra had married Prakash Kaur before his film debut, and went on to have four children with her, including two who would follow in his acting footsteps \u2014 Sunny Deol and Bobby Deol.",
      "Despite his marriage to Malini in 1980, he reportedly never divorced Kaur and continued to live with her. According to local media reports, he briefly converted to Islam before marrying Malini as Indian law disallows Hindus to marry twice, especially if their spouse is alive.",

      "In 2012, Dharmendra was awarded the Padma Bhushan, India\u2019s third-highest civilian honor, in recognition of his contribution to Indian cinema.

Just a year after part one brought droves of audiences to movie theaters around the country, even more people bought opening weekend tickets to see the epic conclusion, \u201cWicked: For Good.\u201d According to studio estimates on Sunday, \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d earned $150 million from North American theaters in its first days in theaters and $226 million globally.",
      "Not only is it the biggest opening ever for a Broadway musical adaptation, unseating the record set by the first film\u2019s $112 million launch, it\u2019s also the second biggest debut of the year behind \u201cA Minecraft Movie\u2019s\u201d $162 million.",
      "\u201cThe results are just fantastic,\u201d said Jim Orr, who heads domestic distribution for Universal. \u201cSome films can deliver a false positive when tickets go on sale early but these results speak for themselves.\"",

By Friday it was playing in 4,115 North American locations and had raked in $68.6 million.

      "As with the first film, women powered opening weekend, making up around 71% of ticket buyers according to PostTrak exit polls. Critics were somewhat mixed on the final chapter, but audiences weren\u2019t: An overwhelming 83% of audiences said it was one they would \u201cdefinitely recommend\u201d to friends. As far as foot traffic is concerned, the box office tracker EntTelligence estimates that about 2 million more people came out for \u201cWicked: For Good's\u201d first weekend than for \u201cWicked's.\"",
      "Jon M. Chu directed both \u201cWicked\u201d films, starring Cynthia Ervio and Ariana Grande. The first film made over $758.7 million worldwide and received 10 Oscar nominations (winning two, for costume and production design ). The question is how high \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d can soar. Combined, the two films cost around $300 million to produce, not including marketing and promotion costs.",
      "\u201cThe first film paved the way,\u201d Orr said. \u201cIt's really become a cultural event I think audiences are going to be flocking to theaters for quite some time to come.\u201d",

Searchlight Pictures opened its Brendan Fraser film \u201cRental Family\u201d in 1,925 theaters where it earned $3.3 million.

      "From her opening lyrics sung over piano and mournful cello, \u201cWho could live between the two/ First love the world and later love God,\u201d Rosal\u00eda announces that this album is a rupture from its Grammy-winning predecessors. \u201cEl mal querer (\u00a8The Bad Loving\u201d in Spanish) and \u201c Motomami \" had established Rosal\u00eda as one of the leading artists in the Spanish music world with her experimental urban beats.",
      "Despite \u2014 or thanks to \u2014 its diversity of styles and song forms, ranging from classical strings, snippets of electronica with a cameo by Bj\u00f6rk, a boys' choir from a thousand-year-old monastery, an aria-like song in Italian, a Portuguese fado and, of course, modern flamenco and hip-hop beats, \u201cLux\u201d is off to a powerful start among listeners. It has four songs in Spotify\u2019s Top 50 global chart for this week, more than any artist, including Taylor Swift.",
      "Madonna has declared herself a fan of \"Lux,\" and composer Andrew Lloyd Webber has lavishly called it the \u201calbum of the decade.\u201d",
      "Rosal\u00eda, 33, has said that after her success in more popular music forms, she let her long-held longing for the spiritual guide her in making \u201cLux.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the end, in an age that seems not to be the age of faith or certainty or truth, there is more need than ever for a faith, or a certainty, or a truth,\" she told reporters in Mexico City last month.",
      "She said that she was guided by the concept that \u201can artist doubts less of his vocation when he works in the service of God than when he works in the service of him or herself.\u201d",
      "Rosal\u00eda apparently has not had a revelatory \u201ccome-to-Jesus\u201d moment common among evangelical believers in America. Like many Spaniards, she grew up in a once staunchly Catholic Spain that has quickly secularized in recent decades, especially among the younger generations, leaving churches mostly to elderly parishioners.",
      "Even her early music flirted with medieval religious poetry, including one video clip from 2017 when she set a poem by 16th-century Spanish poet Saint John of the Cross to music.",
      "While embracing Catholic symbols and expressing a fascination with female saints, Rosal\u00eda seems to eschew strictly organized practice and draws inspiration from other religions, as well. \u201cLux\u201d responds to that diversity of interest, at one point quoting a Sufi poetess.",

      "\u201cLux\u201d can be intimidating for listeners, both due to its elaborate orchestration and smattering of esoteric lyrics that Rosal\u00eda was inspired to write after reading medieval mystical poets and their accounts of undergoing a transformative union with God through deep prayer and meditation.",
      "In the exhilarating \u201cReliquia\u201d (\u201cRelic\u201d in Spanish), Rosal\u00eda compares herself to female saints, listing the parts of her body and life she has left in cities around the world as relics for others\u2019 keeping. Her \u201cMio Cristo Piange Diamanti,\u201d (\"My Christ Weeps Diamonds\" in Italian), brims with the extravagant Baroque image of the jewels dripping from the eyes of the Messiah.",
      "In \u201cDivinize,\u201d Rosal\u00eda sings of the \u201cdivina buidor\u201d (\u201cdivine emptiness\u201d in Catalan), a central concept of medieval mysticism which focused on how the soul must experience abandonment to open a space where God can enter.",
      "Victoria Cirlot, professor of humanities at Barcelona\u2019s Pompeu Fabra University and expert in medieval feminine mystical tradition, liked \u201cLux\u201d for its ability to introduce complex religious concepts to the general public, while noting it is \u201ca minimalist\u201d sample of the mystical tradition.",
      "Cirlot said the moving \u201cLa Yugular\u201d (\u201cThe Jugular\u201d in Spanish) is rich in mystical thought because the throat, the home of the voice and the breath, is associated in many religious traditions as the body\u2019s door to the divine.",
      "But, for Cirlot, it\u2019s the entire package that makes \u201cLux\u201d so impactful.",
      "\u201cRosal\u00eda is not just a great singer; she is a great actress, and her body language is full of these mystical gestures like contorting her face in an expression of ecstasy, of staring into nothing,\u201d Cirlot said. \u201cAnd then we have her amazing voice, which creates a sense of flight.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "\"Wicked: For Good \u2014 The Soundtrack\" offers a fresh take on the original musical's second act",
      "Are you ready for more \u201cWicked\"? \u201cWicked: For Good \u2014 The Soundtrack\" offers a bulked-up take on the music of the original \u201cWicked\u201d musical's second act, grounded in yet-again stellar vocals from Cynthia Erivo as a misunderstood but defiant Elphaba and Ariana Grande as a conflicted but changing Glinda. New songs and lyrics raise the stakes \u2014 even if the music itself is at times weighed down by the plot it helps move along, like the film it accompanies.",
      "The soundtrack opens with \u201cEvery Day More Wicked,\u201d a lengthened-version of a section of the original Act 2 opener \u201cThank Goodness\u201d with new verses about Elphaba's perceived wickedness and Glinda's presumed goodness set to bold orchestration that matches the first film's opening number, \u201cNo One Mourns the Wicked.\" Drum beats and ensemble singers are the world builders here, twisting the melody into a march.",
      "The album's first solo goes to Michelle Yeoh's Madame Morrible, the sorceress at the center of a propaganda campaign against Elphaba \u2014 a choice that works for the plot, but which offsets the power of Erivo and Grande's forthcoming vocals. They are introduced later, through brief interpolations of the Act 1 showstoppers \u201cThe Wizard and I\" and \u201cPopular.\" All of that makes for a dynamic film opener \u2014 but is more fractured in audio form, sans the sumptuous visuals and character reveals that tie those musical references together on screen.",
      "Fortunately, \u201cThank Goodness / I Couldn't Be Happier\u201d quickly follows, bringing Grande center-stage \u2014 and providing a rare-here opportunity for her soprano head-voice to give way to a deeper belt (her passionate tone, like other Glindas before her, turns this almost nonsensical lyric, \"There are bridges you cross you didn\u2019t know you crossed until you've crossed them,\" into a revelation). That's not the last we hear from this capital \u201cG\u201d Good, Glinda. \u201cWonderful,\u201d usually a duet between Elphaba and the Wizard of Oz, is \u2018Galinda-fied,\u2019 with Grande adding welcome harmonies \u2014 and a brief \u201cDefying Gravity\u201d interlude \u2014 to Jeff Goldblum's Wizard romp.",
      "It was always going to be hard for this album to live up to the soundtrack of the first \u201cWicked,\u201d which ended with Erivo\u2019s take on the iconic \u201cDefying Gravity\" battle cry, and saw Grande own the over-the-top glitz of \u201cPopular.\" But that grandness is replicated in key moments: In Grande's operatic soprano, in Erivo and Jonathan Bailey's sensual \u201cAs Long As You're Mine,\" in which Bailey as Fiyero manages to keep up with Erivo's beckoning vocals, and in \u201cNo Good Deed,\" the album's sonic peak.",
      "At 44 minutes and 52 seconds, the soundtrack adds over 15 minutes of music to the runtime of the original Broadway cast recording's second act. That includes two brand new songs written for the film (making them eligible for Oscar consideration), one for Erivo\u2019s Elphaba and one for Grande\u2019s Glinda. In lengthening the shorter second act into a 2 hour and 17 minute long film, director Jon M. Chu stretches some of these songs across scenes, filling them out with dialogue, additional verses from composer and lyricist Stephen Schwartz and additional scoring from composer John Powell. All of that is a double-edged sword (broom? wand?), at times deflating the power of the tight original tracks, at others adding felt emotional stakes ripe for satisfying listening.",
      "For example: Some of the drama of Marissa Bode, Ethan Slater and Erivo's \u201cWicked Witch of the East,\u201d a song performed on Broadway that was also left off the original cast recording, is weakened by which pieces of the interspersed dialogue remain, and which don't, in the soundtrack version of the song. Like the Tin Man, it feels a bit piecemeal.",
      "But the new tracks are highlights, fleshing out the album. Erivo's \u201cNo Place Like Home\u201d pulls on the iconic line said by Dorothy in \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\" providing this Oz-inspired show its take on the theme, like another Oz-inspired show, \u201cThe Wiz,\u201d found before. (\"Home,\" that show's nod to the line, was sung by Erivo at this year's Oscars ceremony). The song is the most inherently political, a timely tale of borders, defiance and community. It starts with Erivo's voice almost isolated, strings swelling behind her, and ends with the first of her transcendent vocal runs, restored to a full open note (after being cut short by the Cowardly Lion on screen) in the album.",
      "That power is felt tenfold in Erivo's take on \u201cNo Good Deed.\" The film may belong to Glinda\u2019s emotional trajectory, but it is Erivo who steals the soundtrack's climax. Drums return as the agony heard in her voice intensifies, the strings crescendoing with her final call.",
      "Glinda's emotional journey may at first be more subtle, but Grande portrays it deftly. Airy and introspective, \u201cGirl in the Bubble\u201d serves as turning point, filling in gaps about Glinda's internal reckoning. Her voice is restrained but emotional, Schwartz's lyrics straightforward with a cheese that feels earned, and thus earnest. This is Glinda after all, not Grande.",
      "Both songs boost the emotional payoff of the character\u2019s finale duet, the fan-beloved tear-jerker \u201cFor Good.\" And it's no surprise, years into their own journey with the characters, that Erivo and Grande nail the chemistry of their character's friendship.",

      "Kahlo vibrantly and unsparingly depicted herself and events from her life, which was upended by a bus accident at 18. She started to paint while bedridden, underwent a series of painful surgeries on her damaged spine and pelvis, then wore casts until her death in 1954 at age 47.",

      "Natalie Paine is a French horn player in New Zealand\u2019s navy who since October has been among 21 military members stationed in Antarctica. There, her melodies drift across the frozen Ross Sea from perhaps the most remote practice room on Earth.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful and very inspiring,\u201d Paine told the Associated Press. \u201cI\u2019ll sit there by the window and I will do my routine and play music in my time off, which is not very often.\u201d",
      "The story of how she arrived in Antarctica is an unlikely one. Paine grew up in the hot, dry climate of Adelaide, Australia, where she dreamed of visiting the frozen continent as a scientist.",
      "She studied music at university instead, putting Antarctica out of her mind. Years later however, as a musician in New Zealand\u2019s navy, Paine learned members of the country\u2019s military were stationed in Antarctica to support the work of scientists.",
      "When she asked, her instructor said any military member could win one of the coveted assignments.",
      "\u201cMy eyes lit up and I was like, what? Even a musician?\u201d Paine said. \u201cHe\u2019s like, heck yeah, why not?\u201d",
      "Her dream was revived but enacting it wasn\u2019t simple. It took four years of unsuccessful applications before Paine landed a posting as a communications operator.",
      "It\u2019s a consuming job, worked in six-day stretches that leave little time for music. Paine monitors radio, phone, email and other communications traffic at New Zealand\u2019s mission at Scott Base, sometimes speaking to people on the ice who haven\u2019t heard other voices for weeks.",
      "In whatever window she can find, Paine squeezes in scales and mouth exercises, going to great lengths not to disturb others on round-the-clock shifts. That means slipping out of the main base to a hut built in 1957 under the leadership of explorer Sir Edmund Hillary as New Zealand established its presence in Antarctica.",
      "While she plays by the window, watching seals on the ice, Paine finds new musical motifs bubbling up.",

      "Her practical dilemmas included finding an instrument suitable for Antarctica \u2014 something hardy, lighter than a brass French horn and less likely to freeze to her hands. The winner, called a jHorn, isn\u2019t elegant.",
      "\u201cIt was designed to be a beginner brass instrument for children,\u201d said Paine. \u201cSo it was like, super compact, super light plastic, very durable, nowhere near as much maintenance required.\u201d",
      "New Zealand\u2019s navy doesn\u2019t have records of another military musician being posted to Antarctica so Paine, who will be there until March, could be the first. Her presence has delighted Scott Base and she has provided live music for ceremonies, such as the changing of the flag, instead of the usual tunes from a speaker.",
      "\u201cI had to have ski gloves on with double layers and hand warmers on the inside to be able to hold the trumpet and still my fingers were freezing,\u201d she said. Paine is, however, likely one of the few musicians to perform a solo Antarctic concert in minus 21 degrees Celsius (minus 6 Fahrenheit).",
      "She said the collective effort between nations to work together on the frozen content had a familiar theme. It reminded her of music.",
      "\u201cMusic is the universal language and it\u2019s something that reminds us that we\u2019re all connected,\u201d she said. \u201cIt brings that connection back to home, back to land and back to the people you\u2019re with as well.\u201d",

The nonfiction prize was given to the Canadian Iranian novelist-journalist Omar El Akkad for his fierce indictment of the contemporary West, \u201cOne Day, Everyone Will Have Always Been Against This.\"",

      "El Akkad said it was \u201cvery difficult to to think in celebratory terms about a book that was written in response to a genocide (in Gaza). It\u2019s difficult to think in celebratory terms when I spent two years seeing what shrapnel does to a child\u2019s body.\u201d",
      "Alameddine's speech, like his novel, combined humor and agony.

      "George Clooney stars in \"Jay Kelly,\" a film by Noah Baumbach that blurs reality and fiction, says Associated Press critic Mark Kennedy",
      "During his glittering career, George Clooney has played a casino thief, a Batman,a chain-gang convict, an assassin and a high-flying layoff artist. This fall, he's stretching even more, playing an utterly charming and gorgeous movie star. Kidding!",
      "Reality and fiction beautifully weave in and out in \u201cJay Kelly,\u201d director Noah Baumbach's love letter to Hollywood that, in other hands, could so easily have become just a love letter to Clooney.",
      "The script by Baumbach and Emily Mortimer finds Clooney \u2014 sorry, Jay Kelly \u2014 in a sort of midlife funk. He's 60, a universally beloved, deeply earnest movie hunk who has worked his way to the top and found, well, artifice.",
      "\u201cMy life doesn't really feel real,\u201d he says at one point, an actor trained in pretending going meta playing an actor trained in pretending. In another scene he muses: \u201cAll my memories are movies.\u201d",
      "A chance meeting with an old acting partner \u2014 a brilliant Billy Crudup, whose character was betrayed by Kelly years ago \u2014 reveals some unpleasant truths. \u201cIs there a person in there? Maybe you don\u2019t actually exist,\u201d he asks the star, sending Kelly on a journey of self-discovery that just so happens to lead to one of Clooney's favorite places, Italy.",
      "Kelly's careful facade \u2014 the stories he tells about himself \u2014 soon gets chipped away. On his way up the hills of Hollywood, he apparently left some personal carnage behind. \u201cJay Kelly\u201d is about those who sacrificed to get him there.",
      "Adam Sandler and Laura Dern play Kelly's long-suffering manager and publicist, respectively, while his resentful adult daughters are portrayed by Grace Edwards and Riley Keough. Kelly, we learn, put career first and that meant walking away from things like his daughters' school recitals and making his staff miss things like their daughters\u2019 school recitals. \u201cHe's not our family or our friend,\u201d Dern's character screams in despair. \u201cWe're not to him what he is to us.\u201d",
      "You'd expect Clooney to not have to shift out of second gear for this, but he gives a soulful performance, charming enough that his Kelly seduces a trainful of strangers in Italy with his aw-shucks charisma and yet also bristles when his oldest daughter makes him confront her abandonment issues.",
      "\u201cDo you know how I knew you didn't want to spend time with me?\u201d his daughter asks him, before answering in a line that will land like a gut punch with any parent: \u201cBecause you didn't spend time with me.\u201d Another killer: \u201cI wish you were the man I thought you were.\u201d",

      "This being a movie about a movie star, Baumbach and Mortimer naturally surround their hero in classic film nods, from Alfred Hitchcock to Federico Fellini, whose visuals become a touchstone, like the sight of a priest licking two ice cream cones. There are jokes made about the Method school of acting and being a Dior ambassador, but this is ultimately about mortality and life choices, with one scene actually ending in a cemetery, a little too on the nose.",
      "Kelly melts into past vignettes like watching his own long-ago breakout drama audition and his kids' joyous household revelry. It reaches for the surreal in a mist-filled forest and finds redemption in, of course, a movie theater. A retrospective montage uses such real Clooney roles like \u201cCombat Academy\u201d and \u201cUp in the Air,\u201d further blurring the line between fact and fiction.",
      "Clooney puts his ego on the line here, even mocking his heroic vibe when he chases a purse snatcher through a field, echoing his action roles. Even that turns out to be less than heroic. There emerges an off-putting, in-his-own-world Jay Gatsby vibe to him, alluded to by his first name and the name of one of his daughters, Daisy.",
      "We see his cluelessness up close when he won't actually listen to his assistants or thoughtlessly tosses away a gift of a neckerchief from a dead colleague's son. He reveals his vanity when he tries to hide his age with a black Sharpie on his eyebrows.",
      "Could the movie have hit harder at the self-involved stars we often worship? Of course. But what makes it powerful is not the Hollywood drama. This is a movie for any of us who have missed a child's school recital, asked an assistant to work late or skipped a family dinner because a client was running behind. It's about time. It's about where we choose to spend our time. First stop: \u201cJay Kelly.\u201d",
      "\u201cJay Kelly,\u201d a Netflix release in theaters now that starts streaming Dec. 5, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for language. Running time: 131 minutes. Three and half stars out of four.",

      "What is \u201cwe mode,\u201d and how can you tap into it to improve your life",
      "With a runway of smoking-hot coals laid out before them, residents in San Pedro Manrique, Spain, steel themselves as thousands of onlookers cheer them on. The crowd roars when they walk across the fire, sometimes carrying another person on their back.",
      "Although the walkers and the crowd perform very different roles during the annual June ritual, they report similar feelings: an ineffable feeling of togetherness, as if the entire group becomes one, said Dimitris Xygalatas, a cognitive anthropologist at the University of Connecticut, who witnessed the Spanish ritual years ago as a researcher.",
      "He has experienced similar feelings in a stadium while chanting and cheering together with 30,000 fans of his hometown soccer team. Both are instances of collective effervescence, said Xygalatas, author of \u201cRituals: How Seemingly Senseless Acts Make Life Worth Living.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s that feeling that happens when people engage together in a meaningful activity that sparks positive emotions. Such as when you get goose bumps at a concert, feel the rush of adrenaline in group exercise classes or get swept up in religious festivals.",
      "Recently, collective effervescence has been referred to as \u201cwe mode,\u201d and it\u2019s something that can be cultivated to improve your life, said Kelly McGonigal, a Stanford University health psychologist.",
      "\u201cWhen you are connected through shared positive emotion, expressions often act as this aerosolized joy, where you catch other people\u2019s smiles, laughter, their physical expressions,\u201d McGonigal said. \u201cIt becomes contagious.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe mode\u201d has also been called physiological synchrony, and McGonigal calls it \u201ccollective joy.\u201d The concept was documented more than a century ago by French sociologist Emile Durkheim, who described cultural effervescence after studying aboriginal Australian societies.",
      "Xygalatas\u2019 research has focused on measuring it in various group activities. To quantify \u201cautonomic responses,\u201d he has fitted people with heart monitors and electrodes and extracted thousands of stills from videos to analyze facial expressions.",
      "He found that people\u2019s physiological responses synchronize during exciting events. The heartbeats of sports fans who attend a game, for instance, sync up, while those of fans watching the same game on TV don\u2019t. Fans at the game also have higher levels of endorphins, which have been linked to bonding, he said.",
      "On a basic level, collective rituals involve meeting and connecting with people, which is a key to psychological well-being, Xygalatas noted.",
      "\u201cIf we all dress alike and we move alike and we feel alike, we express the same emotions that trigger mechanisms in our brain,\u201d Xygalatas said. \u201cThere\u2019s a fundamental need for synchrony.\u201d",

      "The message is hammered over and over, in news conferences, hearings and executive orders: President Donald Trump and his health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., say they want the government to follow \u201cgold standard\u201d science.",
      "Scientists say the problem is that they are often doing just the opposite by relying on preliminary studies, fringe science or just hunches to make claims, cast doubt on proven treatments or even set policy.",
      "This week, the nation's top public health agency changed its website to contradict the scientific conclusion that vaccines do not cause autism. The move shocked health experts nationwide.",
      "Dr. Daniel Jernigan, who resigned from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in August, told reporters Wednesday that Kennedy seems to be \u201cgoing from evidence-based decision making to decision-based evidence making.\u201d",
      "It was the latest example of the Trump administration's challenge to established science.",
      "In September, the Republican president gave out medical advice based on weak or no evidence. Speaking directly to pregnant women and to parents, he told them not to take acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol. He repeatedly made the fraudulent and long-disproven link between autism and vaccines, saying his assessment was based on a hunch.",
      "\u201cI have always had very strong feelings about autism and how it happened and where it came from,\u201d he said.",
      "At a two-day meeting this fall, Kennedy\u2019s handpicked vaccine advisers to the CDC raised questions about vaccinating babies against hepatitis B, an inoculation long shown to reduce disease and death drastically.",
      "\u201cThe discussion that has been brought up regarding safety is not based on evidence other than case reports and anecdotes,\u201d said Dr. Flor Munoz, a pediatric infectious disease expert at Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children\u2019s Hospital.",
      "During the country's worst year for measles in more than three decades, Kennedy cast doubt on the measles vaccine while championing unproven treatments and alleging that the unvaccinated children who died were \u201calready sick.\u201d",
      "Scientists say the process of getting medicines and vaccines to market and recommended in the United States has, until now, typically relied on gold standard science. The process is so rigorous and transparent that much of the rest of the world follows the lead of American regulators, giving the OK to treatments only after U.S. approval.",
      "The gold standard can differ because science and medicine is complicated and everything cannot be tested the same way. That term simply refers to the best possible evidence that can be gathered.",
      "\u201cIt completely depends on what question you\u2019re trying to answer,\u201d said Dr. Jake Scott, an infectious disease physician and Stanford University researcher.",
      "There are many different types of studies. The most rigorous is the randomized clinical trial.",
      "It randomly creates two groups of subjects that are identical in every way except for the drug, treatment or other question being tested. Many are \u201cblinded studies,\u201d meaning neither the subjects nor the researchers know who is in which group. This helps eliminate bias.",
      "It is not always possible or ethical to conduct these tests. This is sometimes the case with vaccine trials, \u201cbecause we have so much data showing how safe and effective they are, it would be unethical to withhold vaccines from a particular group,\u201d said Jessica Steier, a public health scientist and founder of the Unbiased Science podcast.",
      "Studying the long-term effect of a behavior can be impossible. For example, scientists could not possibly study the long-term benefit of exercise by having one group not exercise for years.",
      "Instead, researchers must conduct observational studies, where they follow participants and track their health and behavior without manipulating any variables. Such studies helped scientists discover that fluoride reduces cavities, and later lab studies showed how fluoride strengthens tooth enamel.",
      "But the studies have limitations because they can often only prove correlation, not causation. For example, some observational studies have raised the possibility of a link between autism risk and using acetaminophen during pregnancy, but more have not found a connection. The big problem is that those kinds of studies cannot determine if the painkiller really made any difference or if it was the fever or other health problem that prompted the need for the pill.",
      "Scientists can learn even more when they see how something affects a large number of people in their daily lives.",
      "That real-world evidence can be valuable to prove how well something works \u2014 and when there are rare side effects that could never be detected in trials.",
      "Such evidence on vaccines has proved useful in both ways. Scientists now know there can be rare side effects with some vaccines and can alert doctors to be on the lookout. The data has proved that vaccines provide extraordinary protection from disease. For example, measles was eliminated in the U.S. but it still pops up among unvaccinated groups.",

      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. flu season is starting slowly, and it's unclear if it will be as bad as last winter's, but some health experts are worried as U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data posted Friday shows a new version of the virus has emerged.",
      "An early analysis suggests current vaccines may still be somewhat effective against the new version of the flu, which has been the main driver of recent infections, CDC data shows.",
      "Some scientists and medical professionals are more worried about disappointing vaccination rates, a main reason why flu hospitalizations and deaths were unusually bad during last year's flu season \u2014 one of the deadliest this century.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re going to see a really severe season,\" said Asefeh Faraz Covelli of the George Washington University School of Nursing.",
      "Last winter, the overall flu hospitalization rate was the highest seen since the H1N1 flu pandemic 15 years ago. Flu was the underlying or a contributing cause of more than 18,000 deaths, and one seven-day stretch early this year saw more than 1,800 deaths \u2014 the highest one-week spike in at least a decade. Child flu deaths also were far higher than usual.",
      "CDC data posted Friday showed low flu activity so far, with only one state \u2014 Louisiana \u2014 reporting moderate activity. Most of the reported infections have been in children, said the CDC's Alicia Budd, who tracks flu infections for the Atlanta-based agency.",
      "Most also have been a new version of the type A H3N2 virus that historically has caused the most hospitalizations and deaths in older people. That type is responsible for most flu infections so far this year, and more than half have been a new subclade K variant that is different from the strain this year's flu shots were built to fight.",
      "A preliminary analysis from the United Kingdom suggests the shots do provide at least partial protection, although it will take some time for scientists to know exactly how effective they are. Experts say any protection that softens the blow of a flu infection is important to get.",
      "Flu seasons tend to get bad between December and February, and illnesses likely will accelerate as people travel and gather for Thanksgiving, Covelli said.",

Over two million fewer flu shots were given at U.S. pharmacies through the end of October compared to last year, according to data from IQVIA, a health information and research company.",
      "But the latest CDC data indicates that for children, the vaccination rate this year is about the same as it was at this point last fall, at 34%. And the vaccination rate for adults is up a few percentage points to about 37%, according to the CDC data, which relies on survey information.",

      "Indonesia has remained largely polio-free as the highly contagious disease was declared eliminated in the country in 2014. But eight years later, an outbreak emerged in the country's conservative Aceh province, prompted by a dangerous combination of consistently low routine immunization and unhealthy environmental conditions. In 2021, only 50.9% of infants born in Aceh received polio vaccination.",

The government has also been prioritizing COVID-19 vaccinations since they became available.",
      "Over the next two years, cases appeared in the provinces of Banten, West Java, Central Java, East Java, North Maluku, Central Papua, Highland Papua and South Papua, prompting the mass immunization and information drive. Nearly 60 million additional doses of polio vaccine were administered to children during the response.",
      "The last confirmed polio case was in South Papua province on June 2024. Since then, no poliovirus has been detected in children or in the environment, prompting WHO to declare the outbreak over on Wednesday.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr. spent a recent Wednesday showered in praise from the vice president and health technology CEOs at a glitzy \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d event in Washington, designed to celebrate the health secretary\u2019s successes and the movement he has built.",
      "Yet online, a different narrative of his tenure was playing out as a small but vocal group of Kennedy\u2019s supporters and former employees assailed top Trump administration advisers, claiming they were sabotaging him and redirecting MAHA away from its original goals.",
      "\u201cMAHA is not MAHA anymore,\u201d Gray Delany, a former Department of Health and Human Services official ousted in August, said in a podcast interview that day. \u201cI\u2019m not there, but what I\u2019ve heard of what\u2019s happening today is not the MAHA that we signed up for.\u201d",
      "The criticisms, which grew loud enough that the health secretary took to social media to defend his colleagues two days later, exposed the cracks that are beginning to form within his coalition as it amasses power and broadens in scope.",
      "Several of the environmental advocates and vaccine skeptics who helped propel Kennedy into politics have become impatient with what they view as inadequate action on their priorities. They\u2019re also wary that the Health Department appears willing to collaborate with pharmaceutical companies, tech firms and other big corporations whose motives they don\u2019t trust.",
      "The fissures pose a threat to the cohesion of a movement that has given President Donald Trump an important ally and Republicans access to a new group of voters. They come as cracks have developed in Trump's own Make America Great Again movement over issues like the Epstein files and the White House's focus on global diplomacy.",
      "In the wider public, MAHA has enjoyed soaring popularity. About two-thirds of Americans said they supported the \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d initiative from the federal government, according to an Ipsos poll from June.",
      "\u201cMAHA\u2019s growth is a sign of its success,\u201d said HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon. \u201cSecretary Kennedy is leading a broad coalition to make Americans healthier, guided by transparency, accountability and measurable results. The movement\u2019s meaning hasn\u2019t changed and it\u2019s stronger than ever.\u201d",
      "Public health researchers say the genius that fuels Kennedy\u2019s movement \u2014 the universal appeal of making Americans healthier \u2014 can also cause conflicts by inviting competing interests.",
      "\u201cThis is a tale as old as time in politics,\u201d said Matt Motta, a professor at Boston University School of Public Health. \u201cThe bigger your tent is, the harder it can be to make everyone happy.\u201d",
      "Kennedy, a longtime environmental lawyer and anti-vaccine activist who helped lead the crusade against COVID-19 shots during the pandemic, has taken many steps to curtail vaccines this year. He pulled $500 million for their development, ousted and replaced every member of a federal vaccine advisory committee and pledged to overhaul a federal program for compensating Americans injured by shots. He also has repeatedly spread false and misleading information about vaccines while in office.",
      "As recently as this week, in a move that thrilled Kennedy's anti-vaccine base, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed its website to contradict the longtime scientific conclusion that vaccines do not cause autism.",
      "But many of Kennedy's supporters in what they call the \u201chealth freedom\u201d movement say it\u2019s not enough. Some want punishments for companies that profited from vaccine and mask requirements during the pandemic. Others want mRNA-based COVID-19 shots pulled from the shelves, despite scientific consensus that they have saved millions of lives.",
      "In their attacks on the administration last week, a few MAHA influencers and two fired HHS employees suggested White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and Kennedy\u2019s close adviser, Stefanie Spear, were conspiring to limit Kennedy\u2019s ability to restrict vaccines and crack down on pharmaceutical companies.",
      "Some Kennedy supporters latched on to the claims and pointed to Wiles\u2019 career history at a lobbying firm that has worked with Pfizer as evidence she\u2019s trying to undermine him. They also shared years-old social media posts from Spear criticizing Trump.",
      "Kennedy defended his colleagues in two posts on X, saying the MAHA movement has \u201cno better friend in Washington\u201d than Wiles and that Spear has become a Trump loyalist.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s focus on our extraordinary achievements to date and the monumental work that still needs to be done,\u201d Kennedy wrote. \u201cLet\u2019s build our coalition instead of splintering it.\u201d",
      "Since the \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d slogan debuted on the campaign trail last year, Kennedy and Trump have widened the MAHA tent considerably by inviting anyone into the fold who has concerns about Americans\u2019 health, nutrition and chronic disease.",

      "Several of Kennedy\u2019s core supporters said they see the government as a deeply entrenched bureaucracy that won\u2019t be easy to reform, even as they hope he'll be able to remove toxins from food and the environment and further restrict vaccines. Kennedy, at an appearance with western governors Thursday, said he doesn't intend to take away people's access to vaccines.",

      "Encephalitis means the brain is inflamed and symptoms can vary from mild to life-threatening. Infections are a common cause, typically requiring treatment of the underlying virus or bacteria. But when that's ruled out, an autoimmune cause has to be considered, Horng said, especially when symptoms arise suddenly.",

      "As Alexander's treatment began, other symptoms ramped up. She has little clear memory of the monthlong hospital stay: \u201cThey said I would just wake up screaming. What I could remember, it was like a nightmare, like the devil trying to catch me.\u201d",
      "Later Alexander would ask about her 9-year-old daughter and when she could go home \u2014 only to forget the answer and ask again.",
      "Alexander feels lucky she was diagnosed quickly, and she got the ovarian cyst removed. But it took over a year to fully recover and return to work full time.",
      "In San Carlos, California, in early 2020, it was taking months to determine what caused Morrill's sudden memory problem. He remembered facts and spoke eloquently but was losing recall of personal events, a weird combination that prompted Dr. Michael Cohen, a neurologist at Sutter Health, to send him for more specialized testing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very unusual, I mean extremely unusual, to just complain of a problem with autobiographical memory,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cOne has to think about unusual disorders.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile Morrill\u2019s wife, Karen, thought she\u2019d detected subtle seizures \u2014 and one finally happened in front of another doctor, helping spur a spinal tap and diagnosis of LGI1-antibody encephalitis.",
      "It\u2019s a type most common in men over age 50. Those rogue antibodies disrupt how neurons signal each other, and MRI scans showed they\u2019d targeted a key memory center.",
      "By then Morrill, who\u2019d spent retirement guiding kayak tours, could no longer safely get on the water. He\u2019d quit reading and as his treatments changed, he\u2019d get agitated with scary delusions.",
      "\u201cI lost total mental capacity and fell apart,\u201d Morrill describes it.",
      "He used haiku to make sense of the incomprehensible, and months into treatment finally wondered if the \u201cmeds coursing through me\u201d really were \u201cdousing the fire. Rays of hope?\u201d",
      "The nonprofit Autoimmune Encephalitis Alliance lists about two dozen antibodies \u2014 and counting \u2014 known to play a role in these brain illnesses so far.",
      "Clinical trials, offered at major medical centers around the country, are testing two drugs now used for other autoimmune diseases to see if tamping down antibody production can ease encephalitis.",
      "More awareness of these rare diseases is critical, said North Carolina's Alexander, who sought out fellow patients. \u201cThat's a terrible feeling, feeling like you're alone.\u201d",
      "As for Morrill, five years later he still grieves decades of lost memories: family gatherings, a year spent studying in Scotland, the travel with his wife.",
      "But he\u2019s making new memories with grandkids, is back outdoors \u2014 and leads an AE Alliance support group, using his haiku to illustrate the journey from his \u201cunraveling\u201d to \u201cthe present is what I have, daybreaks and sunsets\u201d to, finally, \u201cI can sustain hope.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m reentering some real time of fun, joy,\u201d Morrill said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t shooting for that. I just wanted to be alive.\u201d",

      "She and fellow members of South Africa's anti-immigrant group Operation Dudula \u2014 which means \u201cto get rid of by force\u201d \u2014 are dressed in military-style fatigues as they block the entrance and demand to see patients' identity documents. Mothers carrying children and others who are sick are turned away and told to go to private hospitals, which unlike public ones aren't free.",
      "Similar scenes have played out at government-run clinics across South Africa's most populous province, Gauteng, as healthcare becomes the new battleground in the country's long and painful debate over immigration.",
      "The Johannesburg High Court has ordered Operation Dudula to stop harassing migrants. The group says it will appeal.",
      "\u201cIn our operations we are saying, \u2018Put South Africans first,\u2019\" Nkwanyana told The Associated Press. \u201cThe problem we have is that the influx of foreigners is too much and the medication is not enough.\u201d",
      "Africa\u2019s most developed economy, which hosts world leaders this week for the Group of 20 summit, attracts migrants from neighboring Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Lesotho and as far away as Nigeria and Ethiopia.",
      "In the year ending March 31, the Department of Home Affairs deported 46,898 migrants who had entered South Africa without documentation, an 18% increase from the previous year.",
      "Operation Dudula emerged a few years ago, and its visibility has grown as mostly young Black South Africans take part. It's not clear how many members the group has. Its actions have included closing down foreign-owned shops and blocking the children of foreigners from entering public schools.",
      "Operation Dudula members assert that migrants entering without documents are taking jobs from South Africans, who face one of the world's highest unemployment rates at over 31%.",
      "South Africa has seen sometimes deadly waves of such sentiment. In 2008, 68 people were killed in attacks on foreigners across the country.",
      "But the focus on denying them health care is new, along with Operation Dudula's organized structure. The group has regional leaders and participates in news conferences and debates, and it has hinted at forming a political group.",
      "South Africa's government has condemned Operation Dudula's actions and insists that the law guarantees health care for everyone, including foreigners in the country illegally.",
      "\u201cWe are healthcare professionals. We don't turn patients away because they don't have documentation,\u201d Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi has said.",
      "He and others have met multiple times with Operation Dudula and the government has posted security at public clinics, but police are overstretched in a country where the crime rate is high.",
      "\u201cThey cannot wait at a clinic just in case something happens. They have a lot of other work to do,\u201d national police commissioner Fanie Masemola has said.",
      "In August, three Operation Dudula members were arrested after going into a maternity ward in Soweto and demanding that patients produce identity documents. Nurses called police. They have since been released on bail.",
      "The South African Human Rights Commission, which has sharply criticized Operation Dudula's actions, has said South Africa is following a global rise in anti-immigrant sentiment.",

      "SNAP food benefits are flowing again after a pause during the federal government shutdown",
      "After a disruptive U.S. government shutdown, federal SNAP food assistance is again flowing to low-income households. But in the months ahead, many participants will have to abide by new work requirements.",
      "The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program provides monthly benefits \u2014 averaging around $190 per person \u2014 to about 42 million people nationwide. During the first couple weeks of November, many of those recipients missed their regular allotments as President Donald Trump's administration battled in court over whether tap into reserves to fund the program while the government was shut down.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about SNAP:",
      "For the first part of the month, the situation was chaotic after the federal government said SNAP would not be funded because of the government shutdown.",
      "Some states replenished the electronic benefit cards used in the program either fully or partially, using their own funds or federal dollars that were part of court orders. Others didn't.",
      "Most states boosted food charities, but lines were long and some shelves were empty.",
      "As soon as the government reopened on Nov. 12, many states rushed to get out benefits.",
      "By Tuesday, all states either had loaded full November benefits onto people\u2019s electronic spending cards or were working on it, according to an Associated Press review. Participants should receive December SNAP benefits according to their normal schedule.",
      "A massive tax and spending bill signed into law in July by Trump expanded requirements for many adult SNAP recipients to work, volunteer or participate in job training for at least 80 hours a month. Those who don\u2019t are limited to three months of benefits in a three-year period.",
      "The work requirements previously applied to adults ages 18 through 54 who are physically and mentally able and don\u2019t have dependents. The new law also applies those requirements to those ages 55 through 64 and to parents without children younger than 14. It repeals work exemptions for homeless individuals, veterans and young adults aging out of foster care. And it limits the ability of states to waive work requirements in areas lacking jobs.",
      "The Trump administration waived the work requirements in November, but the three-month clock on work-free SNAP benefits will be in full force in December.",

      "In the aftermath of the shutdown, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, whose department administers SNAP, has cast doubt on the program. Rollins has said it is rife with fraud, including deceased people receiving benefits and some people receiving multiple benefits.",
      "Rollins suggested that everyone who receives SNAP be required to reapply. But it\u2019s not clear whether Rollins was suggesting an additional requirement or referring to the current one that mandates people to periodically recertify their income and other information.",
      "An Agriculture Department spokesperson didn't clarify but instead said in a statement that the standard recertification processes for households is part of a plan to eliminate fraud, abuse and waste.",
      "Under federal law, most households must report their income and basic information every four to six months and be fully recertified for SNAP at least every 12 months. Full recertification can occur every 24 months for households where all adults are age 60 and above or have disabilities.",
      "But states can require more frequent eligibility verifications. Last year, 27 states required at least some households to be fully recertified every four to six months, depending on their household circumstances, according to a USDA report.",

      "BANGKOK -- Myanmar\u2019s military government has begun broadcasting extensive video on state television of its crackdown on online scam centers, showing buildings being bulldozed and over 1,000 foreigners detained.",
      "Myanmar is notorious for hosting cyberscam operations that target people all over the world. They usually involve gaining a person's confidence with romantic ploys and luring them into bogus investment schemes. The U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime has estimated that such activities generate just under $40 billion in annual revenue for criminal gangs.",
      "The unusual length and detail of the reports beginning late last week on MRTV television appear to reflect the military government\u2019s desire to publicize its efforts after months of bad publicity and international pressure. It is already ostracized by many nations for seizing power from Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government in 2021 and brutally fighting opponents.",

      "There were other crackdowns earlier this year. Monday\u2019s reports said a total of 12,586 foreigners have been detained since the end of January and 9,978 of them were deported to their home countries through Thailand. Some foreigners, from African nations and elsewhere, have reported being tricked into working at the centers and being blocked from leaving them.",
      "The reports said authorities confiscated 2,893 computers, 21,750 mobile phones, 101 Starlink satellite communications devices, 21 internet routers and a large quantity of other equipment used to carry out online fraud and gambling activities at Shwe Kokko.",

      "Dodik was ousted in August, after a Bosnian court convicted him of disobeying the orders of the international High Representative for Bosnia, sentenced him to a year in prison and banned him from holding any public office for six years. He has since paid a fine to avoid jail and stepped aside as president while staying at the helm of his governing Party of Independent Social Democrats.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- A 33-year-old South Korean man was sentenced to life in prison Monday for running an online blackmail ring that sexually exploited or abused 261 victims, including more than a dozen minors he raped or assaulted, over a four-year period before his arrest in January.",

      "Starting around August 2020, Kim targeted women who posted sexually suggestive content on social media, and men attempting to join secret Telegram chat rooms for sharing digitally-manipulated sexual images of acquaintances. He threatened to expose them and coerced them into recruiting new victims, forming a pyramid-like blackmail ring on the app that produced and shared manipulated sexual images of their targets, most of whom were minors, according to details of the crimes revealed in court.",

He created roughly 1,700 sexually exploitative images or videos targeting about 70 victims, disseminating around 260 of them online to threaten those who refused to cooperate, and also attempted to blackmail some of the victims\u2019 family members and work colleagues, the court said.",
      "The other defendants, including five minors, knew that the victims they recruited through threats involving video and images would face the same sexual exploitation they had endured, but carried out the acts anyway to prevent their own images from being circulated, the court said.",

      "Pope Leo XIV is set to embark on his first trip abroad with a visit to Turkey, marking a key event in Catholic and Orthodox Christianity",
      "HEYBELIADA, Turkey -- As Pope Leo XIV prepares to embark on his first trip abroad with a visit to Turkey to mark a key event that shaped the foundations of Catholic and Orthodox Christianity, there has been a surge of renewed optimism over the possible reopening of a Greek Orthodox religious seminary that has been closed since 1971.",
      "The Halki Theological School has become a symbol of Orthodox heritage and a focal point in the push for religious freedoms in Turkey.",
      "Located on Heybeliada Island, off the coast of Istanbul, the seminary once trained generations of Greek Orthodox patriarchs and clergy. They include Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, the spiritual leader of some 300 million Orthodox Christians worldwide.",
      "Turkey closed the school under laws restricting private higher education, and despite repeated appeals from international religious leaders and human rights advocates \u2014 as well as subsequent legal changes that allowed private universities to flourish \u2014 it has remained shut ever since.",
      "Momentum for reopening it appeared to grow after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan discussed the issue with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House in September. Erdogan said Turkey would \u201cdo our part\u201d regarding its reopening. Erdogan had previously linked the move to reciprocal measures from Greece to improve the rights of Muslims there.",
      "The school, which was founded in 1844, stands surrounded by scaffolding as renovation work continues. Inside, one floor that serves as the clergy quarters and two classrooms have already been completed, standing ready to welcome students once the seminary reopens.",
      "During his visit to Turkey, starting on Thursday, Leo is scheduled to meet Erdogan and join Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew in commemorating the 1,700th anniversary of the Council of Nicaea, in a pilgrimage honoring Christianity\u2019s theological roots. He will then travel to Lebanon for the second leg of his trip.",
      "Turkey is now \u201cready to make the big step forward for the benefit of Turkey, for the benefit of the minorities and for the benefit of religious and minority rights in this country\u201d by reopening the seminary, Archbishop Elpidophoros, head of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America, told The Associated Press in a video interview from his base in New York.",
      "A committee of representatives from the Istanbul-based Greek Orthodox Patriarchate and the Turkish government has begun discussions on the reopening, Elpidophoros said, expressing optimism that the school could welcome students again by the start of the next academic year.",
      "\u201cKeeping this school closed after more than 50 years is a political and diplomatic anachronism that doesn\u2019t help our country,\u201d said the Istanbul-born archbishop. \u201cWe have so many private universities and private schools in Turkey, so keeping only Halki closed doesn\u2019t help Turkey, doesn\u2019t help anyone.\u201d",
      "The fate of the seminary has long been viewed as a test of predominantly Muslim Turkey\u2019s treatment of religious minorities, including the country\u2019s Christian population, estimated at 200,000 to 370,000 out of nearly 86 million.",
      "Since coming to power in 2002, Erdogan\u2019s government has enacted reforms to improve the rights of religious groups, including opening places of worship and returning some property that was confiscated \u2014 but problems linger.",
      "Although the Constitution guarantees freedom of religion, only Armenians, Greeks and Jews \u2014 non-Muslim minorities who were recognized under a 1923 peace treaty that established modern Turkey's borders \u2014 are allowed to operate places of worship and schools. Other Christian groups lack formal recognition and often face obstacles in registering churches or religious associations.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is set to increase pressure on Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro by designating the Cartel de los Soles as a foreign terrorist organization",
      "CARACAS, Venezuela -- President Donald Trump's administration is set to ramp up pressure on Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro on Monday by designating the Cartel de los Soles as a foreign terrorist organization. But the entity that the U.S. government alleges is led by Maduro is not a cartel per se.",
      "The designation is the latest measure in the Trump administration's escalating campaign to combat drug trafficking into the U.S. In previewing the step about a week ago, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio accused Cartel de los Soles, or Cartel of the Suns, of being \u201cresponsible for terrorist violence\u201d in the Western Hemisphere.",
      "The move planned Monday comes as Trump evaluates whether to take military action against Venezuela, which Trump has not ruled out despite bringing up the possibility of talks with Maduro. Land strikes or other actions would be a major expansion of the monthslong operation that has included a massive military buildup in the Caribbean Sea and striking boats accused of trafficking drugs, killing more than 80 people.",
      "Venezuelans began using the term Cartel de los Soles in the 1990s to refer to high-ranking military officers who had grown rich from drug-running. As corruption later expanded nationwide, first under the late President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and then under Maduro, its use loosely expanded to police and government officials as well as activities like illegal mining and fuel trafficking. The \u201csuns\u201d in the name refer to the epaulettes affixed to the uniforms of high-ranking military officers.",
      "The umbrella term was elevated to a Maduro-led drug-trafficking organization in 2020, when the U.S. Justice Department in Trump's first term announced the indictment of Venezuela\u2019s leader and his inner circle on narcoterrorism and other charges.",
      "\u201cIt is not a group,\u201d said Adam Isaacson, director for defense oversight at the Washington Office on Latin America organization. \u201cIt\u2019s not like a group that people would ever identify themselves as members. They don\u2019t have regular meetings. They don\u2019t have a hierarchy.\u201d",
      "Up until this year, the label of foreign terrorist organization had been reserved for groups like the Islamic State or al-Qaida that use violence for political ends. The Trump administration applied it in February to eight Latin American criminal organizations involved in drug trafficking, migrant smuggling and other activities.",
      "The administration blames such designated groups for operating the boats it is striking but rarely identifies the organizations and has not provided any evidence. It says the attacks , which began off the coast of Venezuela and later expanded to the eastern Pacific Ocean, are meant to stop narcotics from flowing to American cities.",
      "But many \u2014 including Maduro himself \u2014 see the military moves as an effort to end the ruling party's 26-year hold on power.",
      "Since the arrival of U.S. military vessels and troops to the Caribbean months ago, Venezuela\u2019s U.S.-backed political opposition also has reignited its perennial promise of removing Maduro from office, fueling speculation over the purpose of what the Trump administration has called a counterdrug operation.",
      "Trump, like his predecessor, does not recognize Maduro as Venezuela's president.",
      "Maduro is on his third term in office after ruling-party loyalists declared him the winner of last year's presidential election despite credible evidence that the opposition's candidate defeated him by a more than 2-to-1 margin. He and senior officials have been repeatedly accused of human rights violations of real and perceived government opponents, including in the aftermath of the July 2024 election.",
      "Maduro\u2019s government in a statement Monday categorically denied the existence of the cartel, describing the Trump administration\u2019s accusation as a \u201cridiculous fabrication\u201d meant to \u201cjustify an illegitimate and illegal intervention against Venezuela.\u201d",
      "U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said last week that the upcoming designation of Cartel de los Soles will provide a \u201cwhole bunch of new options to the United States\u201d for dealing with Maduro. But Hegseth, speaking in an interview with conservative news outlet OAN, did not provide details on what those options are and declined to say whether the U.S. military planned to strike land targets inside Venezuela.",

But as Trump considers an array of military and non-military options, including covert action by the CIA, for next steps, there is strong belief inside the administration that Maduro\u2019s rule \u201cis not sustainable,\u201d according to a senior administration official who was not authorized to comment publicly on the sensitive matter.",
      "The official added that Trump has been keenly listening to his intelligence team, which has reported to him that chatter picked up inside Venezuela indicates growing anxiety from Maduro and other high-level Venezuelan officials as the U.S. strikes continue. Trump, the official said, is \u201cvery content and satisfied\u201d for the moment with the strikes' impact.",
      "All the while, pleas from Maduro and others close to the Venezuelan leader to speak directly to the administration, relayed through various intermediaries and channels, seem to be more frantic, the official said. But Trump has not sanctioned any intermediaries to speak to Maduro on behalf of the U.S. administration.",
      "The 2020 indictment accused Maduro, Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello and Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez, among others, of conspiring with Colombian rebels and members of the Venezuelan military for several years \u201cto flood the United States with cocaine\u201d and use the drug trade as a \u201cweapon against America.\u201d Colombia is the world's top cocaine producer.",
      "Before laying down weapons as part of a 2016 peace deal, members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, regularly used the porous border region with Venezuela as a safe haven and hub for U.S.-bound cocaine shipments \u2014 often with the support or at least consent of Venezuelan security forces. Dissidents continued the work. Colombia's National Liberation Army guerrilla is also involved in the illegal trade.",
      "Maduro has denied the charges. The U.S. Justice Department this year doubled to $50 million the reward for information that leads to Maduro\u2019s arrest.",
      "Maduro has insisted that the U.S. is building a false drug-trafficking narrative to try to force him from office. He and other government officials have repeatedly cited a United Nations report that they say shows traffickers attempt to move only 5% of the cocaine produced in Colombia through Venezuela.",
      "The U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on the Cartel de los Soles in July, saying Maduro and his top allies had bent the power of the Venezuelan government, military and intelligence services to assist the cartel in trafficking narcotics to the U.S.",
      "U.S. authorities also alleged Maduro\u2019s cartel gave material support to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and the Sinaloa cartel, both of which were among the organizations that the U.S. designated as foreign terror organizations in February.",

      "Massive corruption has been blamed for substandard or non-existent flood control projects in the poverty-stricken Southeast Asian country long prone to deadly floods and extreme weather. Two Philippine presidents, including Marcos\u2019 late father, were overthrown in peaceful public revolts due to alleged plunder and misrule.",
      "The initial batch of more than a dozen suspects, including Zaldy Co, a former member of the House of Representatives, and government public works engineers, were indicted by the Sandiganbayan, a special anti-corruption court, in the first of what is expected to be dozens of criminal graft and corruption lawsuits that Marcos promised would lock up implicated senators, House members and wealthy construction company owners by Christmas.",
      "The first corruption case involved irregularities in flood control projects in Oriental Mindoro province, including a river dike worth 289 million pesos ($4.8 million), that were undertaken by Sunwest Corp., a construction firm that officials say is owned by Co\u2019s family.",
      "Marcos said one suspect was arrested and six others surrendered over the weekend to police. The arrested suspect was found in a house in suburban Quezon city in the capital region where an unspecified number of people who were trying to help hide the suspect were also arrested, he said.",
      "\u201cMy advice to the remaining suspects is for all of you to surrender, don\u2019t wait to be pursued,\u201d Marcos said in an early Monday post on his Facebook account. \u201cThis will continue, we will not stop.\u201d",

Former Senate President Chiz Escudero has also been accused of pocketing kickbacks and has stepped down from his post but strongly denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Aides have defended Marcos from allegations linking him to the irregularities, saying that he first raised alarm over them in July in his annual state of the nation address before Congress.",
      "At least 9,855 flood control projects worth more than 545 billion pesos ($9 billion) that were supposed to have been undertaken since Marcos took office in mid-2022 are under investigation. In September, Finance Secretary Ralph Recto told legislators that up to 118.5 billion pesos ($2 billion) for flood control projects may have been lost to corruption since 2023.",

      "Bird flu and another disease have shrunk the U.S. turkey population to a 40-year low this year",
      "CHELSEA, Mich. -- Old Brick Farm, where Larry Doll raises chickens, turkeys and ducks, was fortunate this Thanksgiving season.",
      "Doll's small farm west of Detroit had no cases of bird flu, despite an ongoing outbreak that killed more than 2 million U.S. turkeys in the last three months alone. He also avoided another disease, avian metapneumovirus, which causes turkeys to lay fewer eggs.",
      "\u201cI try to keep the operation as clean as possible, and not bringing other animals in from other farms helps mitigate that risk as well,\u201d said Doll, whose farm has been in his family for five generations.",
      "But Doll still saw the impact as those diseases shrank the U.S. turkey flock to a 40-year low this year. The hatchery where he gets his turkey chicks had fewer available this year. He plans to order another 100 hatchlings soon, even though they won\u2019t arrive until July.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t get your order in early, you\u2019re not going to get it,\u201d he said.",
      "The shrinking population is expected to cause wholesale turkey prices to rise 44% this year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Despite the increase, many stores are offering discounted or even free turkeys to soften the potential blow to Thanksgiving meal budgets. But even if the bird is cheaper than last year, the ingredients to prepare the rest of the holiday feast may not be. Tariffs on imported steel, for example, have increased prices for canned goods.",
      "As of Nov. 17, a basket of 11 Thanksgiving staples \u2014 including a 10-pound frozen turkey, 10 Russet potatoes, a box of stuffing and cans of corn, green beans and cranberry sauce \u2013 cost $58.81, or 4.1% more than last year, according to Datasembly, a market research company that surveys weekly prices at 150,000 U.S. stores. That\u2019s higher than the average price increase for food eaten at home, which rose 2.7% in September, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "Datasembly showed a 2% decline in the retail price of a 10-pound turkey as of Nov. 17. Pricing out Thanksgiving meals isn\u2019t an exact science, and the firm's tally differed from other estimates.",
      "The American Farm Bureau Federation, which uses volunteer shoppers in all 50 states to survey prices, reported that Thanksgiving dinner for 10 would cost $55.16 this year, or 5% less than last year. The Wells Fargo Agri-Food Institute, using NielsenIQ data from September, estimated that feeding 10 people on Thursday using store-brand products would cost $80 this year, which is 2% to 3% lower than last year's estimate.",
      "Grocery chains are also offering deals to attract shoppers. Discount grocer Aldi is advertising a $40 meal for 10 with 21 items. Kroger said shoppers could feed 10 people for under $50 with its menu of store-brand products.",
      "Earlier this month, President Donald Trump touted Walmart\u2019s Thanksgiving meal basket, which he said was 25% cheaper than last year. But that was because Walmart included a different assortment and fewer products overall this year.",
      "\u201cWe're seeing some promotions being implemented in an effort to draw customers into the store,\u201d David Ortega, a professor of food economics and policy at Michigan State University, said.",
      "That's despite a sharp increase in wholesale turkey prices since August. In the second week of November, frozen 8-16 pound hens were averaging $1.77 per pound, up 81% from the same period last year, according to Mark Jordan, the executive director of Leap Market Analytics, which closely follows the poultry and livestock markets.",

      "Avian viruses are the main culprit. But another reason for turkey\u2019s higher wholesale prices has been an increase in consumer demand as other meats have gotten more expensive, Jordan said. Beef prices were up 14% in September compared to last year, for example.",
      "\u201cFor a big chunk of the population, they look at steak cuts and say, \u2018I can\u2019t or I don\u2019t want to pay $30 a pound,\u2019\u201d Jordan said.",
      "That\u2019s the case for Paul Nadeau, a retired consultant from Austin, Texas, who plans to smoke a turkey this week. Nadeau said he usually smokes a brisket over Thanksgiving weekend, but the beef brisket he buys would now cost more than $100. Turkey prices are also up at his local H-E-B supermarket, he said, but not by as much.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know of anything that\u2019s down in price since last year except for eggs,\u201d Nadeau said.",
      "Trump\u2019s tariffs on imported steel and aluminum are also raising prices. Farok Contractor, a distinguished professor of management and global business at the Rutgers Business School, said customers are paying 10 cents to 40 cents more per can when companies pass on the full cost of tariffs.",
      "Tariffs may be partly to blame for the increased cost of jellied cranberry sauce, which was up 38% from last year in Datasembly\u2019s survey. But weather was also a factor. U.S. cranberry production is expected to be down 9% this year, hurt by drought conditions in Massachusetts, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "In Illinois, where most of the country\u2019s canning pumpkins are grown, dry weather actually helped pumpkins avoid diseases that are more prevalent in wet conditions, said Raghela Scavuzzo, an associate director of food systems development at the Illinois Farm Bureau and the executive director of the Illinois Specialty Growers Association. Datasembly found that a 30-ounce can of pumpkin pie mix cost 5% less than last year.",
      "Back at Old Brick Farm, which has been in his family since 1864, Doll walked among his turkeys the week before Thanksgiving, patting their heads as they waddled between their warm barn and an open pasture. In a few days, he planned to deliver them to an Amish butcher.",
      "Doll sold all 92 turkeys he raised this year, with customers paying $6.50 per pound for what many tell him is the best turkey they've ever tasted. He enjoys a little profit, he said, and the good feeling of supplying a holiday meal.",
      "\u201cI just love it, to think that, you know, not only are we providing them food, but the centerpiece of their Thanksgiving dinner,\u201d he said.",

      "Chinese companies are rushing to deploy low-flying vehicles and drones for various uses as the country finds innovative ways to drive its economy",
      "HONG KONG -- An unmanned, oval-shaped craft from flying taxi maker EHang hovers, whirring noisily like a mini-helicopter over a riverside innovation zone on the outskirts of the southern Chinese business hub of Guangzhou, part of a trial of a mini-flying taxi that once might have been found only in sci-fi films.",
      "In nearby Shenzhen, food-delivery drones already are part of daily life and a novelty attraction for tourists, even if such services cost more. In the waterfront park surrounded by high-rises, Polish tourist Karolina Trzcia\u0144ska and her friends ordered bubble tea and lemon tea by phone, just to give it a try. Their drinks arrived via a drone buzzing through the drizzle about 30 minutes later.",
      "\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019m seeing something like this, so it was super fun to see the food being delivered by the drone,\" she said.",
      "Such businesses are growing quickly with support from the government, though the take off of the so-called \u201clow-altitude economy\u201d faces obstacles such as strict airspace controls and battery limitations.",
      "Activities in airspace below 1,000 meters (about 3,280 feet) accounted for business turnover worth 506 billion yuan ($70 billion) in 2023, about 0.4% of China\u2019s economy. By 2035, it's expected to hit 3.5 trillion yuan (about $490 billion), said Zhang Xiaolan, a researcher at the State Information Center, a think tank affiliated with China's main planning agency.",

      "China\u2019s Civil Aviation Administration has granted certificates allowing EHang to offer commercial passenger services with its pilotless eVTOL, a low-altitude aircraft that can reach speeds of 130 kph (81 mph) with a maximum range of 30 kilometers (19 miles).",
      "EHang hasn\u2019t launched commercial routes, but its vice president, He Tianxing, says it aims to start with aerial sightseeing services. The company has been building takeoff and landing sites in 20 Chinese cities over the past two years. He expects aircraft of various companies will be flying multiple routes, possibly after five years.",

      "The biggest challenge for developing eVTOL aircraft is maintaining longer flights and overcoming battery capacity limitations, said Guo Liming, co-founder of Shenzhen-based Skyevtol, whose single-seat manned eVTOL aircraft, priced at around $100,000, can only fly 20 to 30 minutes before it must be charged.",
      "It also has not all been smooth skies.",

      "At least five families say their babies were treated for infant botulism after consuming ByHeart formula months before a current outbreak was detected",
      "As health officials investigate more than 30 cases of infant botulism linked to ByHeart baby formula since August, parents who say their children were sickened with the same illness months before the current outbreak are demanding answers, too.",
      "California public health officials confirmed late Friday that six babies in that state who consumed ByHeart formula were treated for botulism between November 2024 and June 2025, up to nine months before the outbreak that has sickened at least 31 babies in 15 states.",
      "At the time, there was \u201cnot enough evidence to immediately suspect a common source,\" the California Department of Public Health said in a statement.",
      "Even now, \"we cannot connect any pre-August 1 cases to the current outbreak,\u201d officials said.",
      "Parents of at least five babies said that their infants were treated for the rare and potentially deadly disease after drinking ByHeart formula in late 2024 and early 2025, according to reports shared with The Associated Press by Bill Marler, a Seattle food safety lawyer representing the families.",
      "Amy Mazziotti, 43, of Burbank, California, said her then-5-month-old son, Hank, fell ill and was treated for botulism in March, weeks after he began drinking bottles filled with ByHeart formula.",
      "Katie Connolly, 37, of Lafayette, California, said her daughter, M.C., then 8 months old, was hospitalized in April and treated for botulism after being fed ByHeart formula in hopes of helping the baby sleep.",
      "For months, neither mother had any idea where the infections could have originated. Such illnesses in babies typically are caused by spores spread in the environment or by contaminated honey.",
      "Then ByHeart recalled all of its products nationwide on Nov. 11 in connection with growing cases of infant botulism.",
      "As soon as she heard it was ByHeart, Mazziotti said she thought: \u201cThis cannot be a coincidence.\u201d",
      "ByHeart officials this week confirmed that laboratory tests of previously unopened formula found that some samples were contaminated with the type of bacteria that leads to infant botulism.",
      "Marler said at least three other cases that predate the outbreak involved babies who drank ByHeart and were treated for botulism, according to their families. One consumed ByHeart formula in December 2024. The other two were sickened later in the spring, he said.",
      "An official with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said federal investigators were aware of reports of earlier illnesses but that efforts are focused now on understanding the unusual surge of dozens of infections documented since Aug. 1.",
      "\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re not necessarily part of this,\u201d said Dr. Jennifer Cope, a CDC scientist leading the probe. \u201cIt\u2019s just that right now, we\u2019re focusing on this large increase.\u201d",
      "Because so much time has passed and because parents of babies who got sick earlier may not have recorded lot numbers of product or kept empty cans of formula, \u201cit will make it harder to definitively link them\u201d to the outbreak, Cope said.",

      "Before this outbreak, no powdered infant formula in the U.S. had tested positive for the type of bacteria that leads to botulism, California health officials said. The number of cases also were within an expected range. A test of a can of open formula fed to a sick baby in the spring did not detect the bacterium.",
      "Then, beginning in August and through October, more cases were identified on the East Coast involving a type of toxin rarely detected in the region, officials said. More cases were seen in very young infants and more cases involved ByHeart formula, which accounts for less than 1 percent of infant formula sold in the U.S.",
      "Earlier this month, after a sample from a can of ByHeart formula fed to a sick infant tested positive for the germ that leads to illness, officials notified the CDC, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the public.",
      "Less than 200 cases of infant botulism are reported in the U.S. each year. The disease is caused when babies ingest spores that germinate in the gut and produce a toxin. The bacterium that leads to illness is ubiquitous in the environment, including soil and water, so the source is often unknown.",
      "Officials at the California Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program track reports of botulism and the distribution of the only treatment for the illness, an IV medication called BabyBIG.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to back down from some tariffs is being celebrated by tea importers, who say the levies have been devastating this year",
      "NEW YORK -- A tax on tea once sparked rebellion. This time, it\u2019s just causing headaches.",
      "Importers of the prized leaves have watched costs climb, orders stall and margins shrink under the weight of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs. Now, even after Trump has given them a reprieve, tea traders say it won\u2019t immediately undo the damage.",
      "\u201cIt took a while to work its way through the system, these tariffs, and it will take a while for it to work its way out of the system,\u201d says Bruce Richardson, a celebrated tea master, tea historian and purveyor of teas at his shop, Elmwood Inn Fine Teas, in Danville, Kentucky. \u201cThat tariffed tea is still working its way out of our warehouses.\u201d",
      "While a handful of bigger firms are behind the biggest supermarket brands, the premium tea market is largely the work of smaller businesses, from family farms to specialty importers to a web of little tea shops, tea rooms and tea cafes across the U.S. Amid an onslaught of tariffs, they have become showcases for the levies\u2019 effects.",
      "On their shelves, selection has narrowed, with some teas now missing because they\u2019re no longer viable products to stock with steep levies on top. In their warehouses, managers are consumed with uncertainty and operational headaches, including calculating what a blend really costs, with ingredients from multiple countries on a roller coaster of tariffs. And in backrooms where the wafting scent of fresh tea permeates, owners have been forced to put off job postings, raises, advertising and other investments so they can have cash available to pay duties when their containers arrive at U.S. ports.",
      "\u201cIf I were to add up all the money I\u2019ve spent on tariffs that weren\u2019t there a year ago, it could equal a new employee,\u201d says Hartley Johnson, who owns the Mark T. Wendell Tea Company in Acton, Massachusetts.",
      "Johnson\u2019s prices used to stay static for a year or longer. He ate the tariff costs before being forced to respond. His most popular tea, a smoky Taiwanese one called Hu-Kwa, has steadily risen from $26 to $46 a pound.",
      "He knows some customers are reconsidering.",
      "\u201cWhere is that tipping point?\u201d Johnson asks. \u201cI\u2019m kind of finding that tipping point is happening now.\u201d",
      "Though Trump backed off some tariffs on agricultural products last week, many in the tea trade are wary of celebrating too soon and caution tea drinkers shouldn\u2019t either. Much of next year\u2019s supply has already been imported and tariffed and the full impact of those duties may not have fully spilled downhill.",
      "Meantime, other tariff-driven price hikes persist. All sorts of other products tea businesses import, from teapots to infusers, remain subject to levies, and costs for some American-made items, like tins for packaging, have spiked because they rely on foreign materials.",
      "\u201cThe canisters, the bamboo boxes, the matcha whisks, everything that we import, everything that we sell has been affected by tariffs,\u201d says Gilbert Tsang, owner of MEM Tea Imports in Wakefield, Massachusetts.",
      "Though globally, tea reigns supreme, imbibed more than anything but water, it has long been overshadowed by coffee in the U.S. Still, tea is entwined in American history from the very beginning, even before colonists angry with tariffs dumped tons of it in Boston Harbor.",
      "Boston may run on Dunkin\u2019 today, but it was born on tea.",
      "The 1773 revolt that became known as the Boston Tea Party rose out of the British Parliament\u2019s implementation of tea tariffs on colonists, who rejected taxation without representation in government. After an independent United States was born, one of the new government\u2019s first major acts, the Tariff Act of 1789, ironically set in law import taxes on a range of products including tea. In time, though, trade policy came to include carve-outs for many products Americans rely on but don\u2019t produce.",

In that single month, American businesses and consumers paid more than $6 million in tea import taxes, amassing in just 31 days more tariffs than any previous full year on record.",
      "\u201cAll over again, taxation without representation,\u201d says Richardson, an adviser to the Boston Tea Party Ships & Museum. \u201cOur wants and needs and our voices are not being represented because Congress is avoiding the issue by simply allowing the president to act like George III.\u201d",
      "All told, tea importers paid about $19.6 million in tariffs in the first seven months of 2025, nearly seven times as much as the same period last year.",
      "It\u2019s all been confounding to those steeped in the world of tea, on which the U.S. depends on foreign countries for nearly all of the billions of pounds Americans brew each year.

      "Protesters gathered outside a new space at the talks, the industry-sponsored \u201cAgrizone,\u201d to call for a transition toward a more grassroots food system, even as hundreds of lobbyists for big agriculture companies are attending the talks.",
      "Though agriculture contributes about a third of Earth-warming emissions worldwide, most of the money dedicated to fighting climate change goes to causes other than agriculture, according to the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization.",
      "The FAO didn't offer any single answer as to how that spending should be shifted, or on what foods people should be eating.",
      "\u201cAll the countries are coming together. I don\u2019t think we can impose on them one specific worldview,\u201d said Kaveh Zahedi, director of the organization's Office of Climate Change, Biodiversity and Environment.",
      "Research has generally shown that a plant-based diet can be better for health and the planet. But many people in poverty around the world who are hardest hit by climate change depend on animal sources of protein for survival. People in higher-income countries have more options for a healthy diet without meat. But those people still tend to contribute more to climate change with their dietary choices.",
      "\"We have to be very, very aware and conscious of those nuances, those differences that exist,\u201d Zahedi said.",
      "When world leaders gather every year to try to address climate change, they spend much of their time in a giant, artificial world that typically gets built up just for the conference.",
      "One corner of COP30, as this year's conference is known, featured the alternative universe of AgriZone, where visitors could step into a world of immersive videos and exhibits with live plants and food products. Those included a research farm that Brazilian national agricultural research corporation Embrapa built to showcase what they call low-carbon farming methods for raising cattle, and growing crops like corn and soy as well as ways to integrate cover crops like legumes or trees like teak and eucalyptus.",
      "Ana Euler, executive director of innovation, business and technology transfer at Embrapa, said her industry can offer solutions needed especially in the Global South where climate change is hitting hardest.",
      "\"We need to be part of the discussions in terms of climate funds,\" Euler said. \"We researchers, we speak loud, but nobody listens.\u201d",
      "AgriZone was averaging about 2,000 visitors a day during COP30's two-week run, said Gabriel Faria, an Embrapa spokesman. That included tours for Queen Mary of Denmark, COP President Andr\u00e9 Corr\u00eaa do Lago and other Brazilian state and local officials.",

      "On a humid evening at COP30's opening, a group of activists gathered on the grassy center of a busy roundabout in front of the AgriZone to call for food systems that prioritize good working conditions and sustainability and for industry lobbyists to not be allowed at the talks.",
      "Those with the most sway are \"not the smallholder food producers, ... not the peasants, and ... definitely not all these people in the Global South that are experiencing the brunt of the crisis,\" said Pang Delgra, an activist with the Asian People\u2019s Movement on Debt and Development who was among the protesters. \u201cIt\u2019s this industrial agriculture and corporate lobbyists that are shifting the narrative inside COPs.\u201d",

      "CHICAGO -- The massive Border Patrol presence on a recent Saturday morning in Chicago's Little Village neighborhood didn't faze Ofelia Herrera even though she and her husband are in the United States illegally.",
      "She waited for agents to move a few blocks away, then opened their stand serving Mexican-style corn on the cob and \u201caguas frescas\u201d flavored with cucumber, pineapple and strawberry in the heart of the Mexican immigrant community, just as they've done for 18 years. Sirens blared through a chaotic day as Chicago police responded to a Border Patrol call for help and confronted demonstrators.",
      "Herrera, 47, and Rafael Hernandez, 44, have refused to alter their routines during an immigration enforcement blitz in Chicago that has caused many without legal status to stay home since it began in early September. Even some U.S. citizens of Latino heritage are afraid to go outside.",
      "The couple says working not only pays the bills but helps avoid depression, making them stand out from others gripped by fear in Chicago's immigrant communities.",
      "\u201cThe only thing you can do is have faith in God and not be afraid,\u201d Herrera said in an interview at the couple's South Side house, already bedecked with Christmas decorations just days after Halloween. \u201cFear gives way to depression and other things. At the end of the day, they don't deport you to Mexico but you are sick with depression and other things because you didn't have faith in God.\u201d",
      "Hernandez agreed. \"We know people who have fallen into depression. They don't leave the house. It's very sad.\u201d",
      "The couple's Little Village food stand, adorned with American flags, is in a bustling area the Border Patrol has visited often. The two-lane commercial drag is lined with family-owned restaurants serving birria and chilaquiles, and clothing stores with displays of Mexican sports team jerseys and white dresses for quincea\u00f1era parties \u2014 a coming-of-age celebration for 15-year-old girls in Latino families.",
      "Vendors sell sliced fruit and pottery from parked vehicles. Strains of ranchera music from cars and shops add to the festive atmosphere, drawing Mexican immigrant visitors from across Chicago and beyond. A family from Waterloo, Iowa, nibbled corn smothered in mayonnaise, cotija cheese, lime and chili powder at the couple's stand under a cold drizzle.",
      "Many of the couple\u2019s friends haven\u2019t ventured outside in more than two months. That fear has sparked a grassroots effort to buy out street vendors, allowing them to go home early and avoid public exposure.",
      "Sidewalk traffic on 26th Street is livelier than many commercial areas in Chicago, even with the immigration crackdown. It is lined with barber shops, groceries and other businesses that have signs in Spanish and English demanding immigration authorities stay away unless they have a court warrant.",
      "The couple knows people who were arrested by heavily armed agents asking about their legal status \u2014 an egg vendor here, a tamale vendor there. They described the sting of tear gas unleashed by agents on demonstrators at a shopping center parking lot last month.",
      "Many immigrants, even some with legal status, are loathe to speak with reporters, especially if identified by name, fearful it may lead to deportation. Herrera and Hernandez say they are eager to share their story to foster understanding of how the Trump administration's push for mass deportations is playing out.",
      "Herrera crossed the border in 2004, followed later by her two children who are now adults living in Chicago. Hernandez made the journey in 2005. Both paid smugglers thousands of dollars for dayslong treks through the Arizona desert. Acquaintances enticed them to head to Chicago, the second-highest U.S. destination for Mexican immigrants after Los Angeles.",

      "From 3 p.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays they serve tacos and burritos from a yellow truck in the dirt driveway of their home in Englewood, a predominantly Black neighborhood and one of Chicago's poorest. Once home to a thriving shopping district, parts of the neighborhood have fallen into disrepair with boarded-up houses. Crime is persistent.",

      "The couple's sales have plunged about 75% since the Trump administration began \u201cOperation Midway Blitz\u201d in Chicago on Sept. 8, Herrera said. Like almost everyone they know, their phones constantly alert them to warnings about where immigration officers are making arrests and to stay away.",

      "U.S. authorities say they are making criminals a priority but that anyone in the country illegally is subject to arrest. That includes street vendors, according to Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol official who led enforcement blitzes in Los Angeles, Chicago and, now, Charlotte, North Carolina.",
      "\u201cThose folks undercutting American businesses, is that right?\u201d Bovino, a frequent presence in Chicago's Little Village, said in a recent interview. \u201cAbsolutely not. That's why we have immigration laws in the first place.\u201d",
      "The couple's memories of how the COVID-19 pandemic kept them inside are a reminder to stay active, allowing only small adjustments. They recently headed to Little Village to buy supplies for their business when word came on social networks that Bovino was in the area making arrests. They decided to shop in another neighborhood.",

      "BUDAPEST, Hungary -- The Hungarian service of Radio Free Europe, Szabad Eur\u00f3pa, ceased its operations on Friday after the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump announced it would no longer fund the pro-democracy news outlet.",
      "Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, which is funded by the U.S. government, was first established during the Cold War to provide news and information to people living within the Soviet Union and behind the Iron Curtain. Its programs are aired in 27 languages in 23 countries across Eastern Europe, Central Asia and the Middle East.",
      "The Hungarian service was terminated in 1993 but reintroduced in 2020 after the United States Agency for Global Media, an independent federal agency, and the U.S. Congress approved its relaunching in response to Hungary's steep decline in media freedom under Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n.",

      "\u201cWe thank you for the trust, interest and support we have received from our audience,\u201d the statement reads, adding that its articles will still be available online.",
      "The shuttering of Szabad Eur\u00f3pa came as the Trump administration has made major cuts to international broadcasters like Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Voice of America, as well as domestic public broadcasters PBS and NPR.",
      "Kari Lake, the failed Arizona gubernatorial and U.S. Senate candidate whom Trump named a senior adviser to the U.S. Agency for Global Media, informed Congress in a letter earlier this month that the agency would no longer fund Szabad Eur\u00f3pa, writing that its operations in Hungary were \u201cnot aligned with U.S. national interests\u201d and that they \u201cundermined\u201d Trump's foreign policy.",

      "\u201cRental Family,\u201d a moving drama from Searchlight Pictures starring Brendan Fraser, is sure to spark interest in Japan\u2019s real-life industry",
      "TOKYO -- Ryuichi Ichinokawa's life could be right out of the movie \u201cRental Family\u201d as the founder nearly two decades ago of the Heart Project business in Japan, which he bills as a surrogate attendance service complete with furnishing of extras and family members.",
      "He has hired dozens of people to act like reporters with cameras and voice recorders, taking notes and milling with real journalists to fill up an otherwise rather vacant event. He has posed as the boyfriend of a woman who needs to discuss legal paperwork with her former spouse. And he has gone to a hospital as a stand-in husband for a woman getting fertility treatments.",
      "\u201cI am being of service to people. I hope they will be happy,\u201d said Ichinokawa, a dapper elderly man who asked The Associated Press to not be photographed lest his identity become public.",
      "\u201cRental Family,\u201d a moving drama from Searchlight Pictures starring Brendan Fraser, is sure to spark interest in Japan's real-life industry. The film, which opens in theaters Friday, centers on Phillip, an American actor who is recruited by a Tokyo \u201crental family\u201d agency in need of a \u201ctoken white guy.\u201d His recurring jobs range from playing video games with a loner to portraying a little girl's long absentee father. It isn't long before Phillip starts to become emotionally invested in what were supposed to be superficial relationships. The film's Japanese supporting cast also bring to life the intense highs and lows of assuming a role in a stranger's life.",
      "In reality, these niche businesses highlight how deeply people in Japan experience loneliness or worry about keeping up appearances. Outsiders may cringe at the idea of paying amateur actors to be fake family members or friends. But users say they find these services comforting and even healing.",
      "The film's director, Mitsuyo Miyazaki whose professional name is Hikari, was born in Japan yet knew little about the concept. Once she learned about it, she couldn't stop thinking about what a unique story it could inspire. So Hikari started researching and found hundreds of companies in Japan that offer rental families or similar services. She spoke with several people in that world.",
      "\u201cI kind of started tackling those questions, and interviewed them on what are the necessities of the business that needs to happen in Japan. And then that\u2019s how I kind of built stories,\u201d Hikari said.",
      "Even at a time when people seek company through Artificial Intelligence, she thinks hiring of actors to fill emotional voids will always be in demand.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think they will disappear, honestly, it might just probably expand,\u201d she said.",
      "In Ichinokawa's experience, most people who ask for the service have a certain social status to protect. He has organized visits to a bar for a hostess who wants to impress her employer with lots of clientele. Similar to the movie, Ichinokawa has gone to school events with a single mother and her child, acting as a friendly uncle.",
      "Sometimes Ichinokawa takes extra steps to ensure the facade. If required, he will print fake business cards \u2014 which are routinely exchanged at Japanese gatherings.",
      "Some parts are easy, like being a wedding guest who just sits and eats. But it\u2019s often stressful work. You're coached to avoid uttering the wrong name or background information. You might have to be prepared to talk about childhood memories you have no clue about. Ichinokawa used to scribble names on his hand. He also pores over notes in advance. If he's really desperate, he excuses himself to the restroom.",
      "Payment for getting rented out varies. For Heart Project, the relatively easy roles can make 9,800 yen ($63) for a couple of hours. For the more elaborate parts, the client dishes out 20,000 yen ($130) to 30,000 yen ($190) per person.",
      "Ichinokawa's rule is that you only play a role once. To do it more than once is setting yourself up for failure. And he has never failed in his mission, he added proudly.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t feel I am acting. I really get angry if that\u2019s what the situation requires,\u201d he said.",
      "Japan has long grappled with loneliness, high suicide rates and a stigma surrounding mental illness. After a 2011 earthquake and tsunami, the country examined how the disasters were affecting mental health, said Miwa Yasui, a professor at the University of Chicago whose research includes the influence of culture on mental health.",

      "Japanese people isolated physically are prone to feeling it internally, said Chikako Ozawa-de Silva, author of \u201cThe Anatomy of Loneliness: Suicide, Social Connection and the Search for Relational Meaning in Contemporary Japan.\"",
      "\u201cWhen people feel they\u2019re not loved, they are not accepted, they\u2019re now seeing they\u2019re not heard. The sense of \u2018I don\u2019t matter\u2019 is a form of loneliness,\u201d said Ozawa-de Silva, who is also a professor at Emory University.",
      "This can lead to \u201chikikomori,\u201d where people withdraw socially and become shut-ins for months or even years.",
      "Japanese culture's collectivist nature also contributes to hiding mental health challenges. Children are taught the principle of \u201cminna no tame ni\" or for the sake of everybody, Yasui said. As adults, there is pressure to maintain harmony and make sure the needs of others \u2014 work or family \u2014 are met.",
      "\u201cWithin Asian cultures, there\u2019s a concept of loss of face,\u201d Yasui said. \u201cIf you lose that, that actually has significant implications.\u201d",
      "In Ozawa-de Silva's opinion, renting actors for surface-level intimacy is putting a \u201cBand-Aid\" on a deeper problem.",
      "\u201cI'm not against that,\u201d Ozawa-de Silva said. \u201cIf people can buy time by renting a family, while pursuing much better long-term solutions, I think the rental family could be a very, very beneficial thing.\u201d",
      "While someone with a Western mindset might find renting actors bizarre, many Japanese people find it reassuring. Much of the written feedback Ichinokawa gets expresses relief or appreciation: \u201cThank you for today. You really interacted with us like a real mother. My boyfriend kept saying, \u2018What a great mom.\u2019\u201d From a male client: \u201cPlease relay my regards to the person who played the role of my wife and tell her she was a superb wife.\u201d",
      "The film, which will be released in February in Japan, uses the rental family concept to remind people that human nature's need for connection is not something you can suppress.",
      "\u201cWhen you help somebody and if they feel like you\u2019re being supportive, that makes you feel good,\u201d Hikari said. \u201cAnd a family member doesn\u2019t have to be alway blood-related.\u201d",

      "JOHANNESBURG -- Leaders from the Group of 20 countries will meet for a summit in South Africa this weekend without any U.S. representatives after President Donald Trump announced a boycott over his widely rejected claims that the host country is persecuting its Afrikaner white minority.",
      "Trump's decision to pull the United States \u2014 and himself \u2014 out of the talks in Johannesburg is likely to undermine the first G20 leaders' meeting in Africa, as well as South Africa's aim to push for progress on issues affecting poor countries, such as the impact of climate change, the cost of green energy transition and spiraling sovereign debt levels.",
      "Chinese leader Xi Jinping also won't attend as he cuts back on international travel, meaning the heads of the world's two biggest economies will skip a meeting meant to bring developed and developing countries together to tackle pressing global issues.",
      "The G20 is a group of 19 countries that includes the richest but also the top developing economies in the world. The European Union and the African Union, which joined in 2023, are also members, making it now a group of 21.",
      "It was formed in 1999 and unlike the Group of Seven, which only includes the richest democracies, it offers some developing countries a forum to raise their problems.",
      "Its focus is the global economy and international development, though it has no charter or permanent secretariat \u2014 unlike organizations such as the United Nations. It also doesn't issue binding decisions and critics say there's no meaningful mechanism for it to put words into action.",
      "The G20 often struggles to reach real consensus because of the different interests of the big powers like the U.S., China and Russia, as well as those of Western European nations.",
      "The leaders of the United Nations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund typically attend G20 summits as guests.",
      "Trump has claimed that white Afrikaner farmers in South Africa are being killed and that their land is being seized, calling it a disgrace that South Africa is hosting the summit and saying it should be thrown out of the G20.",
      "The South African government and others, including some Afrikaners themselves, have rejected Trump's claims of racial persecution as misinformation.",
      "South Africa has been a target for Trump since he returned to office at the start of the year, with his administration casting the country as anti-American because of its diplomatic ties with China, Russia and Iran.",
      "The U.S. will take over the rotating presidency of the G20 from South Africa and while the world's biggest economy will boycott the talks, a representative from the U.S. Embassy in South Africa will attend a formal handover ceremony at the end of the summit, a White House official said.",
      "The country holding the G20 presidency gets to set the agenda for the annual summit.",
      "South Africa wants climate change and disaster relief, financing green energy transition, easing debt levels for poor countries and addressing global inequality to be priorities for the two-day meeting.",

      "Google will confront the U.S. government's latest attempt to topple its internet empire in federal court on Friday as a judge considers how to prevent the abusive tactics that culminated in parts of its digital ad network being branded as an illegal monopoly.",
      "The courtroom showdown in Alexandria, Virginia, will pit lawyers from Google and the U.S. Department of Justice against each other in closing proceedings focused on the complex technology that distributes millions of digital ads across the internet each day.",
      "After a lengthy trial last year, U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema ruled in April that pieces of Google's ad technology had been rigged in a way that made it an illegal monopoly. That set up another 11-day trial earlier this fall to help Brinkema determine how to remedy its anti-competitive practices.",
      "Friday's closing arguments will give both Google and the Justice Department a final chance to sway Brinkema before she issues a ruling that probably won't come until early next year.",
      "The Justice Department wants Brinkema to force Google to sell some of the ad technology that it has spent nearly 20 years assembling, contending a breakup is the only way to rein in a company that the agency's lawyers condemned as a \u201crecidivist monopolist\u201d in filings leading up to Friday's hearing.",
      "The condemnation refers not only to Google's practices in digital advertising but also to the illegal monopoly that it unleashed through its dominant search engine. Federal prosecutors also sought a breakup in the search monopoly case, but the judge handling that issue rejected a proposal that would have required Google to sell its popular Chrome web browser.",
      "Although Google is still being ordered to make reforms that it's resisting, the outcome in the search monopoly case has been widely seen as a proverbial slap on the wrist. The belief that Google got off easy in the search case is the main reason the market value of its parent company Alphabet surged by about $950 billion, or 37%, to nearly $3.5 trillion since U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta's decision came out in early September.",
      "That setback hasn't discouraged the Justice Department from arguing for a breakup of an ad tech system that handles 55 million requests per second, according to estimates provided by Google in court filings.",

      "\u201cThis is technology that absolutely has to keep working for consumers,\u201d Google argues in documents leading up to Friday's hearing. The company's lawyers blasted the Justice Department's proposal as a package of \u201clegally unprecedented and unsupported divestitures.\u201d",
      "Besides arguing that its own proposed changes will bring more price transparency and foster more competition, Google is also citing market upheaval triggered by artificial intelligence as another reason for the judge to proceed cautiously with her decision.",
      "In his decision in the search monopoly case, Mehta reasoned that AI was already posing more competition to Google.",
      "But the Justice Department urged the judge to focus on the testimony from a litany of trial witnesses who outlined why Google shouldn't be trusted to change its devious behavior.",

      "India was limited to 201 runs in its first-innings response to South Africa\u2019s 489 on day three. The Proteas then extended their lead by opting not to enforce the follow-on as Aiden Markram (12) and Ryan Rickelton (13) put on 26-0 in eight overs before stumps.",
      "Jansen\u2019s burst was the third-best bowling figures for a South African pacer in India, and the fourth best for a left-arm pacer overall. It combined with Simon Harmer\u2019s 3-64 to collapse the top of the Indian order in a heap on either side of tea.",

I think the spinners did a good job early on and I am lucky to cash in. We thought we were going to field for at least two days. I took off steam last evening (after missing a test hundred), and today was as about doing a job for my team.\u201d",

      "Harmer followed by dismissing Jaiswal in the 33rd over with a delivery that bounced a little more than the opener expected with Jansen taking a low catch at backward point. Sai Sudharsan then never appeared comfortable against spin, and was caught at midwicket two overs later playing a rash stroke to Harmer.",

      "The Kansas City Chiefs saved their season",
      "The Kansas City Chiefs saved their season. The Philadelphia Eagles gave critics more fuel. The Los Angeles Rams made a dominant statement.",
      "There are more questions than answers Sunday in the NFL.",
      "Patrick Mahomes did just enough to rally the Chiefs to a 23-20 overtime victory over the Indianapolis Colts. Kansas City\u2019s dominant defense gave him the opportunity.",
      "Defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo\u2019s unit forced the Colts to go three-and-out on their final four possessions. The Chiefs shut down the NFL\u2019s leading rusher, holding Jonathan Taylor to 58 yards on 16 carries. Colts coach Shane Steichen inexplicably gave Taylor the ball only once on the last three drives of regulation.",
      "Mahomes threw for 352 yards but didn\u2019t have any touchdowns. He looked skittish at times under pressure, rushing his reads and hurrying his passes.",
      "The Chiefs (6-5) couldn\u2019t afford another loss as they fight to make the playoffs after winning nine straight AFC West titles, reaching eight consecutive conference championship games and winning three Super Bowls.",
      "They\u2019ve got a long way to go and a tough game at Dallas (5-5-1) coming up on Thanksgiving Day. Mahomes and the offense need to get in sync for Kansas City to have a shot.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re still not where we want to be at but this was big,\u201d Mahomes said. \u201cGetting that win against a really good football team and kind of proving it to (ourselves) that we can play this kind of football game where it\u2019s not always pretty. I think now we just have to build off that momentum. It\u2019s going to be a short week. We\u2019re playing a good team in the Cowboys, and they can score some points and they have a lot of great players. It\u2019s about rebounding fast, trying to be better, even better this next week going into a big environment, big game and trying to get that win.\u201d",
      "The Colts (8-3) have gone from 7-1 to a team that is going to have to battle to win the AFC South. They\u2019ll face division rivals Jacksonville (7-4) and Houston (6-5) four times over the remaining six games. Their other two opponents are Seattle (8-3) and San Francisco (7-4).",
      "Steichen trusted Daniel Jones to win the game in Kansas City, electing to put the ball in his hands down the stretch instead of giving it to Taylor to protect a lead. Jones couldn\u2019t deliver. He was 3 for 9 for 17 yards on the final four possessions.",
      "\u201cI felt there was a lot of stuff that I wanted to get called that I felt good about in the pass game and we just weren\u2019t efficient doing it and it starts with me,\u201d Steichen said.",
      "The reigning Super Bowl champions built a 21-0 lead in Dallas and looked like they were on their way to snapping Dak Prescott\u2019s 18-game winning streak at home against NFC East opponents.",
      "Jalen Hurts was connecting with A.J. Brown and it seemed Philadelphia would quiet some of the drama surrounding the two superstars.",
      "But the offense regressed, giving Prescott and the Cowboys an opportunity to come back and win 24-21.",
      "The Eagles (8-3) have a comfortable lead over Dallas (5-5-1) and are in position to become the first repeat champion in the division in two decades. But Philadelphia fell behind the Rams (9-2) in the race for the No. 1 seed.",
      "A sluggish offense isn\u2019t playing up to its standard. Saquon Barkley ran for only 22 yards on 10 carries, and the passing attack just hasn\u2019t found its rhythm.",

      "Las Vegas Raiders offensive coordinator Chip Kelly has been fired after another poor offensive performance",
      "LAS VEGAS -- Las Vegas Raiders offensive coordinator Chip Kelly was fired Sunday night after yet another rough offensive performance.",
      "Kelly\u2019s dismissal came less than four hours after the Raiders were beaten 24-10 by Cleveland. Las Vegas allowed the Browns to sack Geno Smith 10 times and fell to 2-9.",
      "\u201cI spoke with Chip Kelly earlier this evening and informed him of his release as offensive coordinator of the Raiders,\u201d coach Pete Carroll said in a statement. \u201cI would like to thank Chip for his service and wish him all the best in the future.\u201d",
      "Carroll did not immediately name a new coordinator.",
      "This is the second time he has fired a coordinator this month. Special teams coordinator Tom McMahon was let go on Nov. 7, and Derius Swinton II took over on an interim basis.",
      "Kelly was the biggest-name assistant hired by Carroll, who's in his first year coaching the Raiders after leading the Seattle Seahawks for 14 seasons. He reportedly received a $6 million contract, the highest for an NFL offensive coordinator, which helped entice him to leave Ohio State, where he helped the Buckeyes win the national championship as offensive coordinator last season.",
      "But Kelly never lived up to the hype, nor the contract, and the Raiders' offensive numbers bear that out.",
      "Through Sunday's games, Las Vegas was tied for last in the NFL with 15 points per game, second worst with 3.54 yards per rush and 3.7 sacks allowed per game, third worst with 4.59 yards per play and fifth worst with an 82.3 passer rating.",
      "And Kelly's offense regressed as the season went on. The Raiders scored 16 points or fewer in four of the past five games and 10 points or fewer in three of those.",
      "Smith has thrown 13 interceptions, tied with Miami's Tua Tagovailoa for the most in the league. Ashton Jeanty, drafted sixth overall with the hopes of boosting the NFL's worst rushing game, has rushed for 604 yards, averaging 3.6 per carry.",
      "Many of those struggles can be traced to the offensive line, which is missing injured starters Kolton Miller and Jackson Powers-Johnson but has not performed well even when healthy. The Raiders didn't make improving the line a major offseason priority, and the two players they drafted in the third round, Caleb Rogers and Charles Grant, have mostly remained spectators.",

He and Carroll were questioned about their game plan in Monday night's 33-16 loss to Dallas, in which the Raiders called 32 pass plays and three runs in the first half.",
      "In a sign that Kelly's time with the Raiders was running out, fans repeatedly booed the offense against the Browns. Las Vegas punted eight times, turned it over on downs twice and lost a fumble.",
      "Kelly went 46-7 in four seasons as the head coach at Oregon before spending four years as an NFL head coach, three with Philadelphia and one with San Francisco. He returned to the college ranks as UCLA's coach from 2018-23 before spending last year at Ohio State as a coordinator under Ryan Day.",

      "Communications Minister Fahmi Fadzil said Sunday the Cabinet approved the move as part of a broader effort to shield young people from online harm like cyberbullying, scams and sexual exploitation. He said the government is studying approaches taken by Australia and other countries, and the potential use of electronic checks with identity cards or passports to verify users\u2019 ages. He did not say when exactly the ban will be enforced.",

      "Since January, major social media and messaging platforms with at least 8 million users in Malaysia are required to obtain a licence as part of a broader tightening of state oversight over digital platforms. Licensed platforms must implement age verification, content-safety measures and transparency rules, reflecting the government\u2019s push for a safer digital space.",

      "HONG KONG -- An unmanned, oval-shaped craft from flying taxi maker EHang hovers, whirring noisily like a mini-helicopter over a riverside innovation zone on the outskirts of the southern Chinese business hub of Guangzhou, part of a trial of a mini-flying taxi that once might have been found only in sci-fi films.",

In the waterfront park surrounded by high-rises, Polish tourist Karolina Trzcia\u0144ska and her friends ordered bubble tea and lemon tea by phone, just to give it a try.

      "Other big players in Guangdong include EHang, logistics company SF Express\u2019s drone arm Phoenix Wings, and automaker XPENG\u2019s flying car unit ARIDGE.",

      "China\u2019s Civil Aviation Administration has granted certificates allowing EHang to offer commercial passenger services with its pilotless eVTOL, a low-altitude aircraft that can reach speeds of 130 kph (81 mph) with a maximum range of 30 kilometers (19 miles).",

      "It also has not all been smooth skies.",

Having invested over $600 million, the company said it has more than 7,000 global orders for its \u201cLand Aircraft Carrier\u201d and has begun preparing for mass production.",
      "A trial run of sightseeing flights in Dunhuang, a key ancient Silk Road destination famous for its Buddhist caves and dunes, is planned for next July.",
      "It's unclear how quickly such aircraft might begin carrying paid passengers regularly. Some companies elsewhere have burned through their funding before reaching the commercial launch stage. In Germany, air taxi makers Lilium and Volocopter filed for bankruptcy, though the latter was later bought by Diamond Aircraft Group, a subsidiary of a Chinese firm.",
      "After years of commercialization, drone applications are not that widespread in China.",
      "Even though the country leads in drone technology and manufacturing, policy constraints including limited airspace access, may mean overseas markets are more promising, said Frank Zhou, managing director at GBA Low Altitude Technology Co., which provides technological software to clients.",
      "\u201cPerhaps for some Southeast Asian countries, if I introduce these applications to them, their demand could explode,\u201d he said.",
      "Less than one-third of China's low-altitude airspace was accessible for general aviation use in 2023 and there were problems with uneven distribution and a lack of internet connectivity, Zhang, the State Information Center researcher, said in a report. The number of registered general aviation aerodromes in China, excluding private airports, was just about a tenth of those in the U.S., she said.",
      "Chinese policymakers are gradually working to close the gap. The military generally commands use of most Chinese airspace but has pledged to simplify approval procedures and shorten review times in Shenzhen and five other provinces.",
      "Proposed revisions of the civil aviation law include a chapter on development and promotion of civilian activities, addressing low-altitude airspace allocation and supervision.",
      "It's still early days, said Gary Ng, a senior economist at Natixis Corporate and Investment Banking.",
      "He expects progress toward commercialization to materialize around 2030, with passenger-carrying eVTOLs for tourism or industrial purposes starting before flying taxi services. Some of the aerial products could become key exports, he said.",
      "China is a latecomer to the industry but now leads in developing small drones and low-altitude airspace investments, said Chen Wen-hua, director at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University\u2019s Research Centre for Low Altitude Economy.",
      "One advantage is the ruling Communist Party's ability to mobilize regulators, industry players and universities to work toward the same goal, he said. But development of the technologies involved and safety concerns and public acceptance will determine how quickly different applications of drones and low-flying vehicles are adopted.",
      "The future for the low altitude economy is bright, Chen said, \u201chowever, the road leading to that bright future might be treacherous.\u201d",

      "Negotiators at the United Nations climate talks are deciding on a final deal that lacks a plan to phase out fossil fuels",
      "BELEM, Brazil -- Negotiators at the United Nations climate talks will soon decide on a newly forged final deal released on Saturday that does not include a plan to wean the world from the coal, oil and gas that is heating the planet.",
      "While guidelines wanted by 80 nations for a fossil fuel phase-out are not in the document called \u201cUniting humanity in a global mobilization against climate change,\u201d the Brazilian presidency has promised it will join Colombia in coming up with an independent road map that's not needed to be approved by all 190 nations.",
      "\u201cWhile far from what's needed, the outcome in Belem is meaningful progress,\u201d said former German special climate envoy Jennifer Morgan, who is now a fellow at Tufts University.",
      "The conference leaders are aiming for an early afternoon meeting with all nations to approve the deal. Some nations could try to scuttle it if they prefer no deal to what they consider a feeble agreement, but Morgan said she doubted that any country will block the agreement. It was crafted after more than 12 hours of late night and early morning meetings in COP30 President Andr\u00e9 Corr\u00eaa do Lago's office.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a weak outcome,\" said former Philippine negotiator Jasper Inventor, now at Greenpeace International.",
      "A fossil fuel transition plan will be in a separate proposal issued later by do Lago's team that won't carry the same weight as a deal accepted by nations at the conference.",
      "In the text, instead of a transition plan away from fossil fuels, the agreement \u201cacknowledges that the global transition toward low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development is irreversible and the trend of the future,\u201d and says \u201cthe (2015) Paris Agreement is working and resolves to go further and faster.\u201d",
      "The annual talks this year are held in Belem, a Brazilian city on the edge of the Amazon rainforest. They were scheduled to wrap up Friday, but negotiators blew past that deadline and worked through the night.",
      "Some of the biggest issues include how to distribute $300 billion a year \u2014 a sum previously agreed upon \u2014 in financial aid for vulnerable countries hit hardest by climate change, getting countries to toughen up their national plans to reduce Earth-warming emissions and dealing with climate trade barriers. Poorer nations have requested a tripling of financial aid for adapting to extreme weather and other climate change harms. While that's in the deal, the deadline has been moved back five years to 2035.",
      "Also included in the agreement is the final result of the Action Agenda, which was a list of initiatives aimed at making progress on past deals. That included: a promise of $1 trillion for improving energy grids and infrastructure; ramping up the production of biofuels; industrial decarbonization plans in developing countries; $5.5 billion toward a fund to pay countries to keep their forests standing; and other pledges of funding, including from the private sector, for projects in areas like farming and adaptation.",
      "Whatever deal is proposed still needs a consensus approval from what\u2019s left of the nearly 200 nations that came to the two-week conference. Some delegates, observers and others had to leave Saturday morning when the cruise ships lodging them set sail.",

It was roundly criticized by the European Union, small island nations and Latin American countries as too weak on fossil fuels and pushing nations to sharpen their new climate-fighting plans. But other countries including Saudi Arabia pushed back against the call to transition away from fossil fuels.",
      "\u201cOil producing nations are trying to hold on, to really stop the decline of fossil fuels,\u201d Morgan said.",
      "Brazil President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva had pushed for a stronger plan to move away from fossil fuels, as did more than 80 countries. But the earlier proposal by do Lago \u2014 a Lula appointee \u2014 didn\u2019t even mention the words \u201cfossil fuel.\u201d",
      "Agreements coming out of COP30 technically have to be approved by consensus. But in the past, individual countries' objections have been overlooked by the chair in the rush to gavel everything to the end.",
      "One of the points that negotiators will highlight is language sprinkled in the document that won\u2019t be an explicit road map away from fossil fuels, but will refer back to previous agreements to maintain momentum and \"live and fight another day,\u201d said Alden Meyer, a veteran analyst for the European think-tank E3G.",

    "story": [
      "Researchers have completed a full accounting of water uses and losses in the Rio Grande-Bravo basin as it faces severe shortages throughout its range in the United States and Mexico",
      "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- One of North America's longest rivers, the Rio Grande \u2014 or Rio Bravo as it's called in Mexico \u2014 has a history as deep as it is long. Indigenous people have tapped it for countless generations, and it was a key artery for Spanish conquistadors centuries ago.",
      "Today, the Rio Grande-Bravo water basin is in crisis.",
      "Research published Thursday says the situation arguably is worse than challenges facing the Colorado River, another vital lifeline for western U.S. states that have yet to chart a course for how best to manage that dwindling resource.",
      "Without rapid and large-scale action on both sides of the border, the researchers warn that unsustainable use threatens water security for millions of people who rely on the binational basin. They say more prevalent drying along the Rio Grande and persistent shortages could have catastrophic consequences for farmers, cities and ecosystems.",
      "The study done by World Wildlife Fund, Sustainable Waters and a team of university researchers provides a full accounting of the consumptive uses as well as evaporation and other losses within the Rio Grande-Bravo basin. It helps to paint the most complete \u2014 and most alarming \u2014 picture yet of why the river system is in trouble.",
      "The basin provides drinking water to 15 million people in the U.S. and Mexico and irrigates nearly 2 million acres of cropland in the two countries.",
      "The research shows only 48% of the water consumed directly or indirectly within the basin is replenished naturally. The other 52% is unsustainable, meaning reservoirs, aquifers and the river itself will be overdrawn.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty daunting, challenging reality when half of our water isn\u2019t necessarily going to be reliable for the future,\" said Brian Richter, president of Sustainable Waters and a senior fellow with the World Wildlife Fund. \u201cSo we have to really address that.\"",
      "By breaking down the balance sheet, the researchers are hopeful policymakers and regulators can determine where water use can be reduced and how to balance supply with demand.",
      "Warnings of what was to come first cropped up in the late 19th century when irrigation in Colorado\u2019s San Luis Valley began to dry the snowmelt-fed river, resulting in diminished flows as far south as El Paso, Texas. Now, some stretches of the river run dry for months at a time. The Big Bend area and even Albuquerque have seen dry cracked mud replace the river more often in recent years.",
      "Irrigating crops by far is the largest direct use of water in the basin at 87%, according to the study. Meanwhile, losses to evaporation and uptake by vegetation along the river account for more than half of overall consumption in the basin, a factor that can't be dismissed as reservoir storage shrinks.",
      "The irrigation season has become shorter, with canals drying up as early as June in some cases, despite a growing season in the U.S. and Mexico that typically lasts through October.",
      "In central New Mexico, farmers got a boost with summer rains. However, farmers along the Texas portion of the Pecos River and in the Rio Conchos basin of Mexico \u2014 both tributaries within the basin \u2014 did not receive any surface water supplies.",
      "\u201cA key part of this is really connecting the urban populations to what\u2019s going on out on these farms. These farmers are really struggling. A lot of them are on the brink of bankruptcy,\" Richter said, linking water shortages to shrinking farms, smaller profits and less ability to afford labor and equipment.",

      "The analysis found that between 2000-2019, water shortages contributed to the loss of 18% of farmland in the headwaters in Colorado, 36% along the Rio Grande in New Mexico and 49% in the Pecos River tributary in New Mexico and Texas.",
      "With fewer farms, less water went to irrigation in the U.S. However, researchers said irrigation in the Mexican portion of the basin has increased greatly.",
      "The World Wildlife Fund and Sustainable Waters are working with researchers at the University of New Mexico to survey farmers on solutions to the water crisis.",
      "Jason Casuga, the chief engineer and CEO of the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District, said he is not surprised by the findings and was particularly interested in the data on how much water is lost to riparian areas along the river. He talked about his crews clearing thick walls of thirsty invasive salt cedar trees, describing it as an unnatural ecosystem that stemmed from human efforts to manage the river with levees and reservoirs.",
      "While cities and farmers try to conserve, Casuga said there are few rules placed on consumption by riparian areas.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re willing to accept hundreds and hundreds of acres of invasive species choking out native species. And I'm hoping a study like this will cause people to think and ask those kinds of questions because I think our bosque is worth fighting for. As a culture in New Mexico, agriculture is worth fighting for,\u201d he said.",
      "The responses to overuse and depletion are as varied as the jurisdictions through which the river flows, said Enrique Prunes, a co-author of the study and the manager of the World Wildlife Fund's Rio Grande Program.",
      "He pointed to Colorado, where water managers have threatened to shut off groundwater wells if the aquifer that supports irrigated farms cannot be stabilized. There, farmers who pump groundwater pay fees that are used to incentivize other farmers to fallow their fields.",
      "New Mexico's fallowing program is voluntary, but changes could be in store if the U.S. Supreme Court signs off on proposed settlements stemming from a long-running dispute with Texas and the federal government over management of the Rio Grande and groundwater use. New Mexico has acknowledged it will have to curb groundwater pumping.",
      "New Mexico is behind in its water deliveries to Texas under an interstate compact, while Mexico owes water to the U.S. under a 1944 binational treaty. Researchers said meeting those obligations won't get easier.",
      "Prunes said policymakers must also consider the environment when crafting solutions.",
      "\u201cRebalancing the system also means maintaining those basic functions that the river and the aquifers and the groundwater-dependent ecosystems have,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the indicator of resilience to a future of less water.\u201d",

      "The U.S. Border Patrol is monitoring millions of American drivers nationwide in a secretive program to identify and detain people whose travel patterns it deems suspicious",
      "The U.S. Border Patrol is monitoring millions of American drivers nationwide in a secretive program to identify and detain people whose travel patterns it deems suspicious, The Associated Press has found.",
      "The predictive intelligence program has resulted in people being stopped, searched and in some cases arrested. A network of cameras scans and records vehicle license plate information, and an algorithm flags vehicles deemed suspicious based on where they came from, where they were going and which route they took. Federal agents in turn may then flag local law enforcement.",
      "Suddenly, drivers find themselves pulled over \u2014 often for reasons cited such as speeding, failure to signal, the wrong window tint or even a dangling air freshener blocking the view. They are then aggressively questioned and searched, with no inkling that the roads they drove put them on law enforcement\u2019s radar.",
      "Once limited to policing the nation\u2019s boundaries, the Border Patrol has built a surveillance system stretching into the country\u2019s interior that can monitor ordinary Americans\u2019 daily actions and connections for anomalies instead of simply targeting wanted suspects. Started about a decade ago to fight illegal border-related activities and the trafficking of both drugs and people, it has expanded over the past five years.",
      "The Border Patrol has recently grown even more powerful through collaborations with other agencies, drawing information from license plate readers nationwide run by the Drug Enforcement Administration, private companies and, increasingly, local law enforcement programs funded through federal grants. Texas law enforcement agencies have asked Border Patrol to use facial recognition to identify drivers, documents show.",
      "This active role beyond the borders is part of the quiet transformation of its parent agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, into something more akin to a domestic intelligence operation. Under the Trump administration\u2019s heightened immigration enforcement efforts, CBP is now poised to get more than $2.7 billion to build out border surveillance systems such as the license plate reader program by layering in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies.",
      "The result is a mass surveillance network with a particularly American focus: cars.",
      "This investigation, the first to reveal details of how the program works on America\u2019s roads, is based on interviews with eight former government officials with direct knowledge of the program who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak to the media, as well as dozens of federal, state and local officials, attorneys and privacy experts. The AP also reviewed thousands of pages of court and government documents, state grant and law enforcement data, and arrest reports.",
      "The Border Patrol has for years hidden details of its license plate reader program, trying to keep any mention of the program out of court documents and police reports, former officials say, even going so far as to propose dropping charges rather than risk revealing any details about the placement and use of their covert license plate readers. Readers are often disguised along highways in traffic safety equipment like drums and barrels.",
      "The Border Patrol has defined its own criteria for which drivers\u2019 behavior should be deemed suspicious or tied to drug or human trafficking, stopping people for anything from driving on backcountry roads, being in a rental car or making short trips to the border region. The agency\u2019s network of cameras now extends along the southern border in Texas, Arizona and California, and also monitors drivers traveling near the U.S.-Canada border.",
      "And it reaches far into the interior, impacting residents of big metropolitan areas and people driving to and from large cities such as Chicago and Detroit, as well as from Los Angeles, San Antonio, and Houston to and from the Mexican border region. In one example, AP found the agency has placed at least four cameras in the greater Phoenix area over the years, one of which was more than 120 miles (193 kilometers) from the Mexican frontier, beyond the agency\u2019s usual jurisdiction of 100 miles (161 kilometers) from a land or sea border. The AP also identified several camera locations in metropolitan Detroit, as well as one placed near the Michigan-Indiana border to capture traffic headed towards Chicago or Gary, Indiana, or other nearby destinations.",
      "Border Patrol\u2019s parent agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said they use license plate readers to help identify threats and disrupt criminal networks and are \"governed by a stringent, multi-layered policy framework, as well as federal law and constitutional protections, to ensure the technology is applied responsibly and for clearly defined security purposes.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor national security reasons, we do not detail the specific operational applications,\u201d the agency said. While the U.S. Border Patrol primarily operates within 100 miles of the border, it is legally allowed \u201cto operate anywhere in the United States,\u201d the agency added.",
      "While collecting license plates from cars on public roads has generally been upheld by courts, some legal scholars see the growth of large digital surveillance networks such as Border Patrol\u2019s as raising constitutional questions. Courts have started to recognize that \u201clarge-scale surveillance technology that\u2019s capturing everyone and everywhere at every time\u201d might be unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment, which protects people from unreasonable searches, said Andrew Ferguson, a law professor at George Washington University.",
      "Today, predictive surveillance is embedded into America\u2019s roadways. Mass surveillance techniques are also used in a range of other countries, from authoritarian governments such as China to, increasingly, democracies in the U.K. and Europe in the name of national security and public safety.",
      "\u201cThey are collecting mass amounts of information about who people are, where they go, what they do, and who they know \u2026 engaging in dragnet surveillance of Americans on the streets, on the highways, in their cities, in their communities,\u201d Nicole Ozer, the executive director of the Center for Constitutional Democracy at UC Law San Francisco, said in response to the AP\u2019s findings. \u201cThese surveillance systems do not make communities safer.\u201d",
      "In February, Lorenzo Gutierrez Lugo, a driver for a small trucking company that specializes in transporting furniture, clothing and other belongings to families in Mexico, was driving south to the border city of Brownsville, Texas, carrying packages from immigrant communities in South Carolina\u2019s low country.",
      "Gutierrez Lugo was pulled over by a local police officer in Kingsville, a small Texas city near Corpus Christi that lies about 100 miles from the Mexican border. The officer, Richard Beltran, cited the truck\u2019s speed of 50 mph (80 kph) in a 45 mph (72 kph) zone as the reason for the stop.",
      "But speeding was a pretext: Border Patrol had requested the stop and said the black Dodge pickup with a white trailer could contain contraband, according to police and court records. U.S. Route 77 passes through Kingsville, a route that state and federal authorities scrutinize for trafficking of drugs, money and people.",
      "Gutierrez Lugo, who through a lawyer declined to comment, was interrogated about the route he drove, based on license plate reader data, per the police report and court records. He consented to a search of his car by Beltran and Border Patrol agents, who eventually arrived to assist.",
      "They unearthed no contraband. But Beltran arrested Gutierrez Lugo on suspicion of money laundering and engaging in organized criminal activity because he was carrying thousands of dollars in cash \u2014 money his supervisor said came directly from customers in local Latino communities, who are accustomed to paying in cash. No criminal charges were ultimately brought against Gutierrez Lugo and an effort by prosecutors to seize the cash, vehicle and trailer as contraband was eventually dropped.",
      "Luis Barrios owns the trucking company, Paqueter\u00eda El Guero, that employed the driver. He told AP he hires people with work authorization in the United States and was taken aback by the treatment of his employee and his trailer.",
      "\u201cWe did everything right and had nothing to hide, and that was ultimately what they found,\u201d said Barrios, who estimates he spent $20,000 in legal fees to clear his driver\u2019s name and get the trailer out of impound.",
      "Border Patrol agents and local police have many names for these kinds of stops: \u201cwhisper,\u201d \u201cintel\u201d or \u201cwall\u201d stops. Those stops are meant to conceal \u2014 or wall off \u2014 that the true reason for the stop is a tip from federal agents sitting miles away, watching data feeds showing who\u2019s traveling on America\u2019s roads and predicting who is \u201csuspicious,\u201d according to documents and people interviewed by the AP.",
      "In 2022, a man from Houston had his car searched from top to bottom by Texas sheriff\u2019s deputies outside San Antonio after they got a similar tipoff from Border Patrol agents about the driver, Alek Schott.",
      "Federal agents observed that Schott had made an overnight trip from Houston to Carrizo Springs, Texas, and back, court records show. They knew he stayed overnight in a hotel about 80 miles (129 kilometers) from the U.S.-Mexico border. They knew that in the morning Schott met a female colleague there before they drove together to a business meeting.",
      "At Border Patrol\u2019s request, Schott was pulled over by Bexar County sheriff\u2019s deputies. The deputies held Schott by the side of the road for more than an hour, searched his car and found nothing.",
      "\u201cThe beautiful thing about the Texas Traffic Code is there\u2019s thousands of things you can stop a vehicle for,\u201d said Joel Babb, the sheriff\u2019s deputy who stopped Schott\u2019s car, in a deposition in a lawsuit Schott filed alleging violations of his constitutional rights.",
      "According to testimony and documents released as part of Schott\u2019s lawsuit, Babb was on a group chat with federal agents called Northwest Highway. Babb deleted the WhatsApp chat off his phone but Schott\u2019s lawyers were able to recover some of the text messages.",
      "Through a public records act request, the AP also obtained more than 70 pages of the Northwest Highway group chats from June and July of this year from a Texas county that had at least one sheriff\u2019s deputy active in the chat. The AP was able to associate numerous phone numbers in both sets of documents with Border Patrol agents and Texas law enforcement officials.",
      "The chat logs show Border Patrol agents and Texas sheriffs deputies trading tips about vehicles\u2019 travel patterns \u2014 based on suspicions about little more than someone taking a quick trip to the border region and back. The chats show how thoroughly Texas highways are surveilled by this federal-local partnership and how much detailed information is informally shared.",
      "In one exchange a law enforcement official included a photo of someone\u2019s driver\u2019s license and told the group the person, who they identified using an abbreviation for someone in the country illegally, was headed westbound. \u201cNeed BP?,\u201d responded a group member whose number was labeled \u201cbp Intel.\u201d \u201cYes sir,\u201d the official answered, and a Border Patrol agent was en route.",
      "Border Patrol agents and local law enforcement shared information about U.S. citizens\u2019 social media profiles and home addresses with each other after stopping them on the road. Chats show Border Patrol was also able to determine whether vehicles were rentals and whether drivers worked for rideshare services.",
      "In Schott\u2019s case, Babb testified that federal agents \u201cactually watch travel patterns on the highway\u201d through license plate scans and other surveillance technologies. He added: \u201cI just know that they have a lot of toys over there on the federal side.\u201d",
      "After finding nothing in Schott\u2019s car, Babb said \u201cnine times out of 10, this is what happens,\u201d a phrase Schott\u2019s lawyers claimed in court filings shows the sheriff\u2019s department finds nothing suspicious in most of its searches. Babb did not respond to multiple requests for comment from AP.",

      "Today, the deserts, forests and mountains of the nation\u2019s land borders are dotted with checkpoints and increasingly, surveillance towers, Predator drones, thermal cameras and license plate readers, both covert and overt.",
      "Border Patrol's parent agency got authorization to run a domestic license plate reader program in 2017, according to a Department of Homeland Security policy document. At the time, the agency said that it might use hidden license plate readers \u201dfor a set period of time while CBP is conducting an investigation of an area of interest or smuggling route. Once the investigation is complete, or the illicit activity has stopped in that area, the covert cameras are removed,\u201d the document states.",
      "But that\u2019s not how the program has operated in practice, according to interviews, police reports and court documents. License plate readers have become a major \u2014 and in some places permanent \u2014 fixture of the border region.",
      "In a budget request to Congress in fiscal year 2024, CBP said that its Conveyance Monitoring and Predictive Recognition System, or CMPRS, \u201ccollects license plate images and matches the processed images against established hot lists to assist \u2026 in identifying travel patterns indicative of illegal border related activities.\u201d Several new developer jobs have been posted seeking applicants to help modernize its license plate surveillance system in recent months. Numerous Border Patrol sectors now have special intelligence units that can analyze license plate reader data, and tie commercial license plate readers to its national network, according to documents and interviews.",
      "Border Patrol worked with other law enforcement agencies in Southern California about a decade ago to develop pattern recognition, said a former CBP official who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. Over time, the agency learned to develop what it calls \u201cpatterns of life\u201d of vehicle movements by sifting through the license plate data and determining \u201cabnormal\u201d routes, evaluating if drivers were purposely avoiding official checkpoints. Some cameras can take photos of a vehicle\u2019s plates as well as its driver\u2019s face, the official said.",
      "Another former Border Patrol official compared it to a more technologically sophisticated version of what agents used to do in the field \u2014 develop hunches based on experience about which vehicles or routes smugglers might use, find a legal basis for the stop like speeding and pull drivers over for questioning.",
      "The cameras take pictures of vehicle license plates. Then, the photos are \u201cread\u201d by the system, which automatically detects and distills the images into numbers and letters, tied to a geographic location, former CBP officials said. The AP could not determine how precisely the system's algorithm defines a quick turnaround or an odd route. Over time, the agency has amassed databases replete with images of license plates, and the system\u2019s algorithm can flag an unusual \u201cpattern of life\u201d for human inspection.",
      "The Border Patrol also has access to a nationwide network of plate readers run by the Drug Enforcement Administration, documents show, and was authorized in 2020 to access license plate reader systems sold by private companies. In documents obtained by the AP, a Border Patrol official boasted about being able to see that a vehicle that had traveled to \u201cDallas, Little Rock, Arkansas and Atlanta\u201d before ending up south of San Antonio.",
      "Documents show that Border Patrol or CBP has in the past had access to data from at least three private sector vendors: Rekor, Vigilant Solutions and Flock Safety.",
      "Through Flock alone, Border Patrol for a time had access to at least 1,600 license plate readers across 22 states, and some counties have reported looking up license plates on behalf of CBP even in states like California and Illinois that ban sharing data with federal immigration authorities, according to an AP analysis of police disclosures. A Flock spokesperson told AP the company \u201cfor now\u201d had paused its pilot programs with CBP and a separate DHS agency, Homeland Security Investigations, and declined to discuss the type or volume of data shared with either federal agency, other than to say agencies could search for vehicles wanted in conjunction with a crime. No agencies currently list Border Patrol as receiving Flock data. Vigilant and Rekor did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Where Border Patrol places its cameras is a closely guarded secret. However, through public records requests, the AP obtained dozens of permits the agency filed with Arizona and Michigan for permission to place cameras on state-owned land. The permits show the agency frequently disguises its cameras by concealing them in traffic equipment like the yellow and orange barrels that dot American roadways, or by labeling them as jobsite equipment. An AP photographer in October visited the locations identified in more than two dozen permit applications in Arizona, finding that most of the Border Patrol\u2019s hidden equipment remains in place today. Spokespeople for the Arizona and Michigan departments of transportation said they approve permits based on whether they follow state and federal rules and are not privy to details on how license plate readers are used.",
      "Texas, California, and other border states did not provide documents in response to the AP\u2019s public records requests.",
      "CBP\u2019s attorneys and personnel instructed local cities and counties in both Arizona and Texas to withhold records from the AP that might have revealed details about the program\u2019s operations, even though they were requested under state open records laws, according to emails and legal briefs filed with state governments. For example, CBP claimed records requested by the AP in Texas \u201cwould permit private citizens to anticipate weaknesses in a police department, avoid detection, jeopardize officer safety, and generally undermine police efforts.\u201d Michigan redacted the exact locations of Border Patrol equipment, but the AP was able to determine general locations from the name of the county.",
      "One page of the group chats obtained by the AP shows that a participant enabled WhatsApp\u2019s disappearing messages feature to ensure communications were deleted automatically.",
      "The Border Patrol\u2019s license plate reader program is just one part of a steady transformation of its parent agency, CBP, in the years since 9/11 into an intelligence operation whose reach extends far beyond borders, according to interviews with former officials.",
      "CBP has quietly amassed access to far more information from ports of entry, airports and intelligence centers than other local, state and federal law enforcement agencies. And like a domestic spy agency, CBP has mostly hidden its role in the dissemination of intelligence on purely domestic travel through its use of whisper stops.",
      "Border Patrol has also extended the reach of its license plate surveillance program by paying for local law enforcement to run plate readers on their behalf.",
      "A federal grant program called Operation Stonegarden, which has existed in some form for nearly two decades, has handed out hundreds of millions of dollars to buy automated license plate readers, camera-equipped drones and other surveillance gear for local police and sheriffs agencies. Stonegarden grant funds also pay for local law enforcement overtime, which deputizes local officers to work on Border Patrol enforcement priorities. Under President Donald Trump, the Republican-led Congress this year allocated $450 million for Stonegarden to be handed out over the next four fiscal years. In the previous four fiscal years, the program gave out $342 million.",
      "In Cochise County, Arizona, Sheriff Mark Dannels said Stonegarden grants, which have been used to buy plate readers and pay for overtime, have let his deputies merge their mission with Border Patrol\u2019s to prioritize border security.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re sharing our authorities, we can put some consequences behind, or deterrence behind, \u2018Don\u2019t come here,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "In 2021, the Ward County, Texas, sheriff sought grant funding from DHS to buy a \u201ccovert, mobile, License Plate Reader\u201d to pipe data to Border Patrol\u2019s Big Bend Sector Intelligence Unit. The sheriff's department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Other documents AP obtained show that Border Patrol connects locally owned and operated license plate readers bought through Stonegarden grants to its computer systems, vastly increasing the federal agency\u2019s surveillance network.",
      "How many people have been caught up in the Border Patrol\u2019s dragnet is unknown. One former Border Patrol agent who worked on the license plate reader pattern detection program in California said the program had an 85% success rate of discovering contraband once he learned to identify patterns that looked suspicious. But another former official in a different Border Patrol sector said he was unaware of successful interdictions based solely on license plate patterns.",
      "In Trump\u2019s second term, Border Patrol has extended its reach and power as border crossings have slowed to historic lows and freed up agents for operations in the heartland. Border Patrol Sector Chief Gregory Bovino, for example, was tapped to direct hundreds of agents from multiple DHS agencies in the administration\u2019s immigration sweeps across Los Angeles, more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) from his office in El Centro, California. Bovino later was elevated to lead the aggressive immigration crackdown in Chicago. Numerous Border Patrol officials have also been tapped to replace ICE leadership.",
      "The result has been more encounters between the agency and the general public than ever before.",
      "\u201cWe took Alek\u2019s case because it was a clear-cut example of an unconstitutional traffic stop,\u201d said Christie Hebert, who works at the nonprofit public interest law firm Institute for Justice and represents Schott. \u201dWhat we found was something much larger \u2014 a system of mass surveillance that threatens people\u2019s freedom of movement.\u201d",
      "AP found numerous other examples similar to what Schott and the delivery driver experienced in reviewing court records in border communities and along known smuggling routes in Texas and California. Several police reports and court records the AP examined cite \u201csuspicious\u201d travel patterns or vague tipoffs from the Border Patrol or other unnamed law enforcement agencies. In another federal court document filed in California, a Border Patrol agent acknowledged \u201cconducting targeted analysis on vehicles exhibiting suspicious travel patterns\u201d as the reason he singled out a Nissan Altima traveling near San Diego.",
      "In cases reviewed by the AP, local law enforcement sometimes tried to conceal the role the Border Patrol plays in passing along intelligence. Babb, the deputy who stopped Schott, testified he typically uses the phrase \u201csubsequent to prior knowledge\u201d when describing whisper stops in his police reports to acknowledge that the tip came from another law enforcement agency without revealing too much in written documents he writes memorializing motorist encounters.",
      "Once they pull over a vehicle deemed suspicious, officers often aggressively question drivers about their travels, their belongings, their jobs, how they know the passengers in the car, and much more, police records and bodyworn camera footage obtained by the AP show. One Texas officer demanded details from a man about where he met his current sexual partner. Often drivers, such as the one working for the South Carolina moving company, were arrested on suspicion of money laundering merely for carrying a few thousand dollars worth of cash, with no apparent connection to illegal activity. Prosecutors filed lawsuits to try to seize money or vehicles on the suspicion they were linked to trafficking.",
      "Schott warns that for every success story touted by Border Patrol, there are far more innocent people who don\u2019t realize they\u2019ve become ensnared in a technology-driven enforcement operation.",
      "\u201cI assume for every one person like me, who\u2019s actually standing up, there\u2019s a thousand people who just don\u2019t have the means or the time or, you know, they just leave frustrated and angry. They don\u2019t have the ability to move forward and hold anyone accountable,\u201d Schott said. \u201cI think there\u2019s thousands of people getting treated this way.\u201d",

      "Morrill went for a bike ride with friends along the California coast, stopping for lunch, and they noticed nothing wrong. Neither did Morrill until his wife asked how it went \u2014 and he'd forgotten. Morrill would get worse before he got better. \u201cUnhinged\u201d and \u201cfighting to see light,\u201d he wrote as delusions set in and holes in his memory grew.",
      "Of all the ways our immune system can run amok and damage the body instead of protecting it, autoimmune encephalitis is one of the most unfathomable. Seemingly healthy people abruptly spiral with confusion, memory loss, seizures, even psychosis.",
      "But doctors are getting better at identifying it, thanks to discoveries of a growing list of the rogue antibodies responsible that, if found in blood and spinal fluid, aid diagnosis. Every year new culprit antibodies are being uncovered, said Dr. Sam Horng, a neurologist at Mount Sinai Health System in New York who has cared for patients with multiple forms of this mysterious disease.",
      "And while treatment today involves general ways to fight the inflammation, two major clinical trials are underway aiming for more targeted therapy.",
      "Still, it's tricky. Symptoms can be mistaken for psychiatric or other neurologic disorders, delaying proper treatment.",
      "\u201cWhen someone\u2019s having new changes in their mental status, they\u2019re worsening and if there\u2019s sort of like a bizarre quality to it, that\u2019s something that kind of tips our suspicion,\u201d Horng said. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to miss a treatable condition.\u201d",
      "With early diagnosis and care, some patients fully recover. Others like Morrill recover normal daily functioning but grapple with some lasting damage \u2014 in his case, lost decades of \u201cautobiographical\u201d memories. This 72-year-old literature major can still spout facts and figures learned long ago, and he makes new memories every day.

      "Encephalitis means the brain is inflamed and symptoms can vary from mild to life-threatening. Infections are a common cause, typically requiring treatment of the underlying virus or bacteria. But when that's ruled out, an autoimmune cause has to be considered, Horng said, especially when symptoms arise suddenly.",
      "The umbrella term autoimmune encephalitis covers a group of diseases with weird-sounding names based on the antibody fueling it, such as anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis.",
      "While they're not new diseases, that one got a name in 2007 when Dr. Josep Dalmau, then at the University of Pennsylvania, discovered the first culprit antibody, sparking a hunt for more.",
      "That anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis tends to strike younger women and, one of the bizarre factors, it\u2019s sometimes triggered by an ovarian \u201cdermoid\u201d cyst.",
      "How? That type of cyst has similarities to some brain tissue, Horng explained. The immune system can develop antibodies recognizing certain proteins from the growth. If those antibodies get into the brain, they can mistakenly target NMDA receptors on healthy brain cells, sparking personality and behavior changes that can include hallucinations.",
      "Different antibodies create different problems depending if they mostly hit memory and mood areas in the brain, or sensory and movement regions.",
      "Altogether, \u201cfacets of personhood seem to be impaired,\" Horng said.",
      "Therapies include filtering harmful antibodies out of patients' blood, infusing healthy ones, and high-dose steroids to calm inflammation.",
      "Those cyst-related antibodies stealthily attacked Kiara Alexander in Charlotte, North Carolina, who\u2019d never heard of the brain illness.

      "You wouldn't copy and paste information from a textbook or someone else's essay and pass it off as your own. The same principle applies to chatbot replies.",
      "\u201cAI can help you understand concepts or generate ideas, but it should never replace your own thinking and effort,\u201d the University of Chicago says in its guidance on using generative AI. \u201cAlways produce original work, and use AI tools for guidance and clarity, not for doing the work for you.\u201d",

      "California high school English teacher Casey Cuny advises his students to use ChatGPT to quiz themselves ahead of tests.",
      "He tells them to upload class notes, study guides and any other materials used in class, such as slideshows, to the chatbot, and then tell it which textbook and chapter the test will focus on.",
      "Then, students should prompt the chatbot to: \u201cQuiz me one question at a time based on all the material cited, and after that create a teaching plan for everything I got wrong.\u201d",
      "Cuny posts AI guidance in the form of a traffic light on a classroom screen. Green-lighted uses include brainstorming, asking for feedback on a presentation or doing research. Red lighted, or prohibited AI use: Asking an AI tool to write a thesis statement, a rough draft or revise an essay. A yellow light is when a student is unsure if AI use is allowed, in which case he tells them to come and ask him.",

      "Children\u2019s and consumer advocacy groups are urging parents not to buy AI-powered toys during the holiday season",
      "They\u2019re cute, even cuddly, and promise learning and companionship \u2014 but artificial intelligence toys are not safe for kids, according to children\u2019s and consumer advocacy groups urging parents not to buy them during the holiday season.",
      "These toys, marketed to kids as young as 2 years old, are generally powered by AI models that have already been shown to harm children and teenagers, such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, according to an advisory published Thursday by the children\u2019s advocacy group Fairplay and signed by more than 150 organizations and individual experts such as child psychiatrists and educators.",
      "\u201cThe serious harms that AI chatbots have inflicted on children are well-documented, including fostering obsessive use, having explicit sexual conversations, and encouraging unsafe behaviors, violence against others, and self-harm,\u201d Fairplay said.",
      "AI toys, made by companies such as Curio Interactive and Keyi Technologies, are often marketed as educational, but Fairplay says they can displace important creative and learning activities. They promise friendship but also disrupt children\u2019s relationships and resilience, the group said.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s different about young children is that their brains are being wired for the first time and developmentally it is natural for them to be trustful, for them to seek relationships with kind and friendly characters,\u201d said Rachel Franz, director of Fairplay\u2019s Young Children Thrive Offline Program. Because of this, she added, the amount of trust young children are putting in these toys can exacerbate the harms seen with older children.",
      "Fairplay, a 25-year-old organization formerly known as the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, has been warning about AI toys for more than 10 years. They just weren\u2019t as advanced as they are today. A decade ago, during an emerging fad of internet-connected toys and AI speech recognition, the group helped lead a backlash against Mattel\u2019s talking Hello Barbie doll that it said was recording and analyzing children\u2019s conversations.",
      "\u201cEverything has been released with no regulation and no research, so it gives us extra pause when all of a sudden we see more and more manufacturers, including Mattel, who recently partnered with OpenAI, potentially putting out these products,\u201d Franz said.",
      "It\u2019s the second big seasonal warning against AI toys since consumer advocates at U.S. PIRG last week called out the trend in its annual \u201c Trouble in Toyland \u201d report that typically looks at a range of product hazards, such as high-powered magnets and button-sized batteries that young children can swallow. This year, the organization tested four toys that use AI chatbots.",
      "\u201cWe found some of these toys will talk in-depth about sexually explicit topics, will offer advice on where a child can find matches or knives, act dismayed when you say you have to leave, and have limited or no parental controls,\u201d the report said.",
      "Dr. Dana Suskind, a pediatric surgeon and social scientist who studies early brain development, said young children don't have the conceptual tools to understand what an AI companion is. While kids have always bonded with toys through imaginative play, when they do this they use their imagination to create both sides of a pretend conversation, \u201cpracticing creativity, language, and problem-solving,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cAn AI toy collapses that work. It answers instantly, smoothly, and often better than a human would. We don\u2019t yet know the developmental consequences of outsourcing that imaginative labor to an artificial agent\u2014but it\u2019s very plausible that it undercuts the kind of creativity and executive function that traditional pretend play builds,\u201d Suskind said.",

      "\"After reviewing the U.S. PIRG Education Fund\u2019s findings, we are actively working with our team to address any concerns, while continuously overseeing content and interactions to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for children.\u201d",
      "Another company, Miko, said it uses its own conversational AI model rather than relying on general large language model systems such as ChatGPT in order to make its product \u2014 an interactive AI robot \u2014 safe for children.",
      "\u201cWe are always expanding our internal testing, strengthening our filters, and introducing new capabilities that detect and block sensitive or unexpected topics,\" said CEO Sneh Vaswani. \u201cThese new features complement our existing controls that allow parents and caregivers to identify specific topics they\u2019d like to restrict from conversation. We will continue to invest in setting the highest standards for safe, secure and responsible AI integration for Miko products.\u201d",
      "Miko\u2019s products are sold by major retailers such as Walmart and Costco and have been promoted by the families of social media \u201ckidfluencers\u201d whose YouTube videos have millions of views. On its website, it markets its robots as \u201cArtificial Intelligence. Genuine friendship.\u201d",
      "Ritvik Sharma, the company's senior vice president of growth, said Miko actually \u201cencourages kids to interact more with their friends, to interact more with the peers, with the family members etc. It\u2019s not made for them to feel attached to the device only.\u201d",
      "Still, Suskind and children's advocates say analog toys are a better bet for the holidays.",
      "\"Kids need lots of real human interaction. Play should support that, not take its place. The biggest thing to consider isn\u2019t only what the toy does; it\u2019s what it replaces. A simple block set or a teddy bear that doesn\u2019t talk back forces a child to invent stories, experiment, and work through problems. AI toys often do that thinking for them,\" she said. \u201cHere\u2019s the brutal irony: when parents ask me how to prepare their child for an AI world, unlimited AI access is actually the worst preparation possible.\u201d",

      "President Nikos Christodoulides said that the first quantity of natural gas that could be exported abroad will come from the so-called Cronos deposit, which is operated by a consortium made up of Italian company Eni and French firm TotalEnergies.",
      "Christodoulides told an energy conference that the consortium would make its final decision to move ahead with the project next year, with Cronos gas potentially reaching a processing plant in the Egyptian port city of Damietta for liquefaction and transportation to European markets by ship in 2027.",
      "\u201cCyprus is part of the energy solutions for energy security in the eastern Mediterranean and like I said, it\u2019s an important objective to align your interests with those of powerful states and to act as an alternative energy corridor for Europe,\u201d Christodoulides said.",
      "Speaking at the same conference, Cypriot Energy Minister George Pananastasiou said that natural gas from the Cronos deposit could reach markets the quickest, because it can be connected to infrastructure already in place conveying gas from Egypt\u2019s huge Zor deposit around 80 kilometers (50 miles) away.",
      "Papanastasiou said that a late 2027 target date for Cronos gas to reach market is \u201coptimistic but doable.\u201d",

      "The processed gas will reach a facility near Egypt\u2019s Port Said and will either be utilized for domestic Egyptian consumption or liquefied for export to Europe, depending on what will be decided in further consultations between Cyprus and the deposit\u2019s operator, a partnership between Chevron, Shell and Israeli company NewMed Energy.",
      "Christodoulides said that he would travel to Lebanon next week to exclusively discuss Cyprus\u2019 energy plans. Cyprus shares maritime borders with Lebanon, but the Lebanese government hasn\u2019t fully ratified an agreement delineating the exclusive economic zones of the two countries. That has prevented Cyprus from opening up areas abutting Lebanese waters for hydrocarbons exploration.",
      "The Cypriot president said that there\u2019s \u201cinterest from energy giants\u201d to license more areas \u2014 or blocks \u2014 from within Cypriot waters. ExxonMobil and partners QatarEnergy also hold hydrocarbon exploration licenses for two blocks off Cyprus\u2019 southern coast.",

      "A museum dedicated to the Shroud of Turin has opened at the Christ Cathedral campus in Garden Grove, California",
      "GARDEN GROVE, Calif. -- An interactive museum dedicated to the Shroud of Turin, which some say was Jesus\u2019 burial cloth, opens its doors to the public Wednesday at the Christ Cathedral campus in Southern California.",
      "\u201cThe Shroud of Turin: An Immersive Experience,\u201d a $5-million exhibit in Garden Grove featuring 360-degree projection room theaters, Shroud of Turin replicas, interactive kiosks, and a life-size sculpture of Christ, was conceived over a span of three years and funded through private donations.",
      "The content was created primarily by Othonia, Inc., a Rome-based group dedicated to the examination of the shroud, one of the most studied artifacts in history. The original \u2014 a 14-foot-long, 3.5-foot-wide (4.3-meter-long, 1 meter-wide) cloth \u2014 is kept in a bulletproof, climate-controlled case housed in the Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist in Turin, Italy.",
      "The California museum \u2014 covering 10,000 square feet (930 square meters) \u2014 contains a life-size laminated visual of the shroud stretched over a wall. It shows the faint image of a man with wounds similar to those of Christ.",
      "The Vatican has called the cloth a powerful symbol of Christ\u2019s suffering while making no claim to its authenticity. Many experts stand by carbon-dating of scraps of the cloth that put it in the 13th or 14th century, but many faithful \u2014 some accomplished scientists among them \u2014 say the results might have been skewed by contamination, calling for larger samples to be analyzed. Many insist that the cloth contains pollen from Jerusalem and is woven in a pattern that was unique to the first century.",
      "The cloth, considered a relic by many Christians, was most recently on display in the spring of 2015. While the shroud may never leave Turin, the new exhibit will remain at least through 2030 on the Christ Cathedral campus, next to the famous glass tower and sanctuary erected by televangelist Robert H. Schuller that is now home to the Catholic Diocese of Orange.",
      "The Most Rev. Timothy Freyer, an auxiliary bishop at the diocese, said he hopes the exhibit will reinforce for visitors the power of God\u2019s love for all.",
      "\u201cMy hope is that people of faith will have stronger faith, people who are doubting will come to belief and people with no faith will begin the questioning process and then come to faith,\u201d he said.",
      "One of the highlights of the immersive experience is a re-creation of Christ\u2019s resurrection on Easter morning, with museum visitors sitting in the tomb and watching the shrouded body disappear in a flash of light. The exhibit also features replicas of the spear believed to have pierced Christ\u2019s chest and the helmet of thorns placed on his head.",
      "Philip Rizzo, a parishioner at St. Bonaventure Catholic Church in Huntington Beach who was part of a group that got a preview, said seeing these items up close created a powerful visual representation of Christ\u2019s suffering and sacrifice. Also, he said, witnessing the extensive scientific research conducted on the cloth makes the artifact more relatable.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re tangible beings, not just spirit and light,\u201d Rizzo said. \u201cScience really helps make that connection.\u201d",
      "While some scientists have criticized the eagerness of Christians to authenticate the cloth, the new exhibit had its origins in such curiosity. Its main proponent was August Accetta, a gynecologist who opened up the Shroud Center of Southern California in 1998 and has studied the cloth's mystery for over three decades.",
      "Accetta said it was the Shroud of Turin that converted him from agnostic to Catholic. His Shroud fascination continued after meeting John Jackson, a nuclear physicist, who in 1978 led a 40-person team of scientists as part of the Shroud of Turin Research Project. Their study determined that the cloth was not a manufactured work of art, but contained human bloodstains and that no known physical, chemical or biological process could adequately explain how the image on the Shroud was formed.",
      "Accetta believes, as some other scientists do, that the image was created by a burst of radiation and that a massive amount of energy is required to create the image without burning the cloth.",
      "\u201cOn the shroud, you see four centimeters of anatomically correct information encoded in two microns, which is about half the thickness of a strand of hair,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t even begin to understand that, let alone reproduce it.\u201d",
      "To him, the only explanation \u2014 as the interactive exhibit illustrates \u2014 is that the body of Christ became light and the shroud simply collapsed, leaving the fine imprint of his face on the white linen.",

The stains should be smeared and fragmented if that were the case, he said. Like Accetta, Spitzer says the etching on the cloth was likely caused by particle radiation.",
      "\u201cAnd then one 10,000th of a second after the discharge begins, whap! These blood stains are transferred perfectly onto the cloth,\u201d Spitzer said. \"The only explanation is that body has to disappear. I mean \u2014 like Frodo\u2019s ring \u2014 it\u2019s gone.\u201d",

      "Nora Creech, director of Othonia in the U.S., said the Rome-based organization was founded by the Rev. Hector Guerra, who dreamed of creating 100 exhibits globally. He built the first flagship exhibit in Jerusalem and others in Rome, Poland, Mexico and the U.S. This latest one is the first to feature an immersive experience, which was created by a California-based studio.",
      "Creech said they decided to begin the movielike immersive experience with Christ\u2019s life story from birth to crucifixion and end with the resurrection and the message that \u201cJesus is still with us today.\u201d",
      "\u201cOne of the quotes in the movie is that the cross received Jesus alive and turned him over to the shroud, dead. The shroud received Jesus dead and turned him over to us alive in the Eucharist,\u201d she said.",
      "Rudy Dicthtl, one of the scientists who formed the 1978 research team, still remembers every moment spent touching and holding the cloth in his hands. He said he and the other scientists walked into the project with the understanding that they would leave the moment they saw the cloth was a forgery or a manufactured piece of art. Their research found that it was not.",
      "\u201cWe saw the cloth as something that had the potential to be the burial cloth of Christ,\u201d he said.",
      "Dichtl, a Catholic, said as a scientist he acknowledges there is limited evidence in science to conclusively say the cloth was the one that covered the body of Christ.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s very worrying because it\u2019s a hot spot with lots of boat traffic,\u2019\u2019 said Guido Pietroluongo, a veterinarian at the University of Padua\u2019s emergency response team for stranded dolphins, whales and porpoises, known by the acronym CERT.",
      "St. Mark\u2019s Basin, the shallow expanse of water in front of St. Mark\u2019s Square connecting to both the Giudecca and Grand Canals, is heavily trafficked by ferries, vaporetti buses, water taxis, and private boats.",

It was the first time they had noted injuries to the dolphin, and his wounds are expected to fully heal. But experts are worried about his continued safety in such proximity to human activity.",
      "They don't plan any immediate action, and are hoping that colder seasonal temperatures will lure him, and his fish prey, out of the lagoon toward warmer waters, Pietroluongo said.",

      "The European Union is considering stricter scrutiny for Amazon and Microsoft's cloud businesses",
      "LONDON -- The cloud businesses of Amazon and Microsoft could face stricter scrutiny from European Union regulators, who are looking into whether they should fall under the bloc's dragnet on Big Tech companies.",
      "The bloc's executive Commission said Tuesday that it's assessing whether Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure should be classified as \u201cgatekeepers\u201d under the EU's Digital Markets Act.",
      "The sweeping rule book is designed to rein in the market power of tech companies with a list of do's and don'ts, under threat of hefty penalties.",
      "Gatekeepers face extra obligations under the DMA and regulators have already given the label to other parts of the two companies, such as Amazon Marketplace and Microsoft's LinkedIn. The designation is based partly on user numbers, which makes it harder to apply to cloud computing providers.",
      "The Commission said it will look at whether Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure \u201cact as important gateways between businesses and consumers\u201d despite not meeting the thresholds. Market research indicates that cloud service providers like AWS and Azure hold \u201cvery strong positions in relation to businesses and consumers,\u201d it said.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re confident that when the European Commission considers the facts, it will recognize what we all see,\" Amazon Web Services said in a statement. \"The cloud computing sector is extremely dynamic, with companies enjoying lots of choice, unprecedented innovation opportunity, and low costs, and that designating cloud providers as gatekeepers isn\u2019t worth the risks of stifling invention or raising costs for European companies.\u201d",
      "Microsoft said Europe's cloud sector is innovative and highly competitive. \"We stand ready to contribute to the European Commission\u2019s market inquiry,\u201d it said.",

      "The moves come as the popular gaming platform continues to face criticism and lawsuits over child safety and a growing number of states and countries are implementing age verification laws.",
      "The company had previously announced the age estimation tool, which is provided by a company called Persona, in July. It requires players to take a video selfie that will be used to estimate their age. Roblox says the videos are deleted after the age check is processed. Users are not required to submit a face scan to use the platform, only if they want to chat with other users.",
      "Roblox doesn\u2019t allow kids under 13 to chat with other users outside of games unless they have explicit parental permission \u2014 and unlike different platforms, it does not encrypt private chat conversations, so it can monitor and moderate them.",
      "While some experts have expressed caution about the reliability of facial age estimation tools, Matt Kaufman, chief safety officer at Roblox, said that between the ages of about five to 25, the system can accurately estimate a person's age within one or two years.",
      "\u201cBut of course, there\u2019s always people who may be well outside of a traditional bell curve. And in those cases, if you disagree with the estimate that comes back, then you can provide an ID or use parental consent in order to correct that,\u201d he said.",

      "Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine says he regrets his initial support for legalizing sports betting",
      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- If Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine could turn back time, he would not have signed the law that legalized sports betting in his state.",
      "With two Cleveland Guardians pitchers and an Ohio-born guard for the Miami Heat snared in separate betting-related criminal probes, the second-term Republican says he now \u201cabsolutely\u201d regrets unleashing this unbridled new industry on Ohioans with his 2021 signature.",
      "\u201cLook, we\u2019ve always had gambling, we\u2019re always going to have gambling,\u201d DeWine told The Associated Press last week. \u201cBut just the power of these companies and the deep, deep, deep pockets they have to advertise and do everything they can to get someone to place that bet is really different once you have legalization of them.\u201d",
      "His comments reflect a reckoning that's unfolding across sports and politics as sports betting becomes more ingrained across much of the U.S. The wave of legalization in recent years unleashed a massive industry centered around betting and, more recently, a wave of investigations and arrests tied to allegations of rigged games. It's a dynamic that DeWine says he doesn't think lawmakers fully anticipated.",
      "\u201cOhio shouldn't have done it,\u201d he said.",
      "DeWine recently emerged as a key player in the negotiations between Major League Baseball and its authorized gaming operators that resulted in the capping of prop bets on individual pitches at $200 and excluding them from parlays. The deal was announced earlier this month, a day after Guardians pitchers Luis Ortiz and Emmanuel Clase were indicted and accused of rigging pitches at the behest of gamblers. Both have pleaded not guilty.",
      "\u201cGov. DeWine really did a huge service, I think \u2014 to us, certainly, I can\u2019t speak for any of the other sports \u2014 in terms of kind of bringing forward the need to do something in this area,\u201d MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred told reporters last week.",
      "And DeWine doesn't plan to stop there. Shortly after Ortiz and Clase were first placed on paid leave this summer, he announced he'd be asking the commissioners and players' unions of all the major U.S. sports leagues to ban prop bets \u2014 sometimes called micro-betting \u2014 like those implicated in the Guardians scandal. While that goal has not yet been achieved \u2014 micro-betting is critical to the business strategy in an industry with over $11 billion in revenue in the U.S. this year \u2014 DeWine said limits put in place for baseball are a good first step.",
      "\u201cIt needs to be holistic, it needs to be universal,\u201d he told the AP. \u201cThey\u2019re just playing with fire. I mean, they are just asking for more and more trouble, their failure to address this.\u201d",
      "DeWine's recent sentiments mark a notable position shift after he pledged to \u2014 and then did \u2014 sign a legalization law that was sweeping in scope. The legislation allowed adults 21 and older to place sports bets online, at casinos, at racinos and at stand-alone betting kiosks in bars, restaurants and professional sports facilities. Wagering was permitted under the bill on professional sports teams, motor sports, Olympic events, golf, tennis and even major college sports, including Ohio State football.",
      "It was clear in the run-up to DeWine\u2019s re-election in 2022 that the gambling industry was intensely interested in what was transpiring in the state.",
      "An AP investigation that year found that casino operators, slot machine makers, gaming technology companies, sports interests or their lobbyists donated nearly $1 million in 2021 and 2022 to the nonprofit Republican Governors Association, which supported pro-DeWine committees through its campaign arm. Entities and individuals with ties to the industry also donated more than $22,000 directly to DeWine's campaign, according to campaign finance reports.",
      "A review of more recent campaign filings finds that industry largesse has continued to flow to Ohio politicians with sway over gaming's future.",
      "Lobbyists and a PAC with ties to Jack Casino, DraftKings, FanDuel, MGM, Gamewise, Hard Rock, Underdog, Rush Street or Caesars have donated about $130,000 to Ohio state legislators in the past three years, records show \u2014 about a third of that directed to top House and Senate leaders. Then-Republican Lt. Gov. Jon Husted, who was positioning as DeWine's likely gubernatorial successor, had received about $9,000 from industry-connected entities and individuals before being appointed to the U.S. Senate.",
      "At least one powerful state lawmaker, Republican House Finance Chairman Brian Stewart, had vowed to introduce legislation protecting prop bets prior to professional baseball's crackdown.",
      "\u201cI think that prop bets are a significant part of sports betting in the state of Ohio,\u201d Stewart told cleveland.com in August. \u201cIt\u2019s something that clearly a lot of Ohioans have taken part in and enjoy, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s something that we should eliminate entirely.\u201d",

      "Amid such pushback, DeWine and others now view voluntary buy-in from leagues, players' unions and sportsbooks as a superior approach to pursuing gambling restrictions on a state-by-state basis, where the authority lies.",
      "Matt Schuler, executive director of the Ohio Casino Control Commission, said the baseball deal DeWine helped broker has shown it can be done.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s using the bully pulpit and he\u2019s able to connect with the right people in that way,\u201d Schuler said of DeWine. \u201cNo one thought that everyone could get on the same page, but now they did because everyone realizes the risk. The bets are small, but the risk is big, and so, having observed gaming and regulated it for about 14 years, this is impressive.\u201d",
      "DeWine said his concerns with sports gambling began almost as soon as Ohio's law took effect in 2023. Very quickly, his office began receiving reports that gamblers were threatening members of the University of Dayton basketball team.",
      "So he contacted NCAA President Charlie Baker, whom he knew from Baker's time as governor of Massachusetts, and learned that he shared DeWine's concern. He got Baker to write a letter requesting the removal of collegiate prop bets from the list of legal wagers that sportsbooks operating in Ohio could place, which allowed DeWine to usher the change through the casino commission.",
      "After the Guardians case emerged this summer, DeWine approached Manfred with the same idea. They hadn't both been governors, but DeWine did have one cache going in: his family's long-time ownership of North Carolina's Asheville Tourists. DeWine said Manfred asked him to hold off on pushing unilateral action in Ohio, in hopes of getting the parties to agree to a new national rule.",
      "\u201cI would have preferred to have completely done away with the micro-prop bets, but this is the area that he was able to settle on with them, and I was pleased with that,\u201d DeWine said. \u201cAnd so, I think that\u2019s progress.\u201d",
      "DeWine, who faces term limits next year, said he would be happy to sign a repeal of Ohio's sports betting law at this point, but he's certain there's not enough support for that at the Ohio Statehouse.",

      "DeWine, an avid baseball fan, particularly of his hometown Cincinnati Reds, said he believes \u201cthese sports are playing with dynamite here and the integrity of the sports is at stake.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo, you try to do what you can do, and you try and warn people, and try to take action like we did with collegiate, and you try take action like what we\u2019re doing with baseball,\u201d he said. \"But we\u2019ve got to keep pushing these other sports to do it, too.\u201d",

      "Beast Philanthropy, the charitable organization started by MrBeast founder Jimmy Donaldson, and the Rockefeller Foundation are announcing a strategic partnership",
      "NEW YORK -- One of the most storied American philanthropies is teaming up with the internet's biggest creator to instill young people with a concern for what they call the world's \u201cmost vulnerable\u201d populations.",
      "Beast Philanthropy, the charitable organization started by MrBeast founder Jimmy Donaldson, and the Rockefeller Foundation announced a strategic partnership Monday. The idea is to pair Donaldson's unique ability to capture youth attention spans with the foundation's 112-year history of using its resources and technology to tackle global problems.",
      "Speaking together ahead of a Nov. 21 video shoot at MrBeast's Greenville, North Carolina, studio, the partners complimented the respective strengths they hope to exchange with each other.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve spent my entire life making YouTube videos. They\u2019ve spent their entire lives helping people,\" Donaldson told The Associated Press. \"Obviously, they have a team who\u2019s way more experienced than me in helping people, but being able to pull on their knowledge and wisdom is amazing.\u201d",
      "\u201cI just want to download their brains into our team\u2019s brains,\" he added.",
      "Dr. Rajiv Shah, the president of the Rockefeller Foundation, said the philanthropic sector has long failed to capture \u201cthe hearts and minds of hundreds of millions of young people.\u201d He said MrBeast can help them engage young people, inspire hope and communicate their work more accessibly.",
      "Most people have a natural desire to help others, according to Shah, but we teach ourselves that world problems are \u201ctoo big and too complicated\u201d to solve. He pointed to MrBeast's video in Zambia, where they provided a village with solar-powered electricity and clean water wells.",
      "\"What Jimmy\u2019s already done is show that you can change that dramatically,\u201d Shah said. \"If we can get people believing that they can make a difference through this collaboration, we will have achieved something really unique and really special.\u201d",
      "The move signals Donaldson's continued attempts to evolve an organization with sprawling interests that include an entertainment studio, food brands, his own James Patterson book deal and, most recently, a limited time theme park in Saudi Arabia. He brought on venture capitalist Jeff Housenbold as CEO last year and then hired more new executives as a series of controversies threatened his ambitions ahead of his Amazon Prime reality game show 's release.",
      "It's an unlikely marriage to some. The Rockefeller Foundation is a pillar of civil society established with wealth amassed by the 19th-century oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller during the Gilded Age whereas the 27-year-old Donaldson represents the 21st century \u201cinfluencer\u201d economy where entire media empires can emerge from content creators' viral stunts and the online buzz they generate.",
      "Shah acknowledged that the Rockefeller Foundation rarely does corporate partnerships. But he said that spending time with Donaldson and his mother, as well as watching his philanthropically minded videos, communicated the YouTube megastar's \u201cpersonal commitment to philanthropy\u201d and the \u201csense of enthusiasm one can experience when you help others.\u201d",

      "The exact issues they plan to tackle together are still being hammered out and there is no shared grantmaking to announce yet. But Shah mentioned that the Rockefeller Foundation has a long history of combatting child hunger and noted Beast Philanthropy\u2019s video on a school meal program.",
      "Already, though, they have started working to combat child labor in the cocoa industry.",

He hopes to provide farmers with living incomes, create stable economic conditions so children can go to school instead of farms and use his YouTube channel to rally consumers around fair-trade practices.",

      "A task force ordered by President Donald Trump to combat crime in Memphis, Tennessee, has made thousands of arrests",
      "MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- A task force ordered by President Donald Trump to combat crime in Memphis, Tennessee, has made thousands of arrests, compounding strains on the busy local court system and an already overcrowded jail in ways that concerned officials say will last months or even years as cases play out.",
      "Since late September, hundreds of federal, state and local law enforcement personnel tied to the Memphis Safe Task Force have made traffic stops, served warrants and searched for fugitives in the city of about 610,000 people. More than 2,800 people have been arrested and more than 28,000 traffic citations have been issued, data provided by the task force and Memphis police shows.",
      "The task force, which includes National Guard troops, is supported by Republican Gov. Bill Lee and others who hope the surge reduces crime in a city that has grappled with violent crime, including nearly 300 homicides last year and nearly 400 in 2023.",
      "From 2018 to 2024, homicides in Memphis increased 33% and aggravated assaults rose 41%, according to AH Datalytics, which tracks crimes across the country using local law enforcement data for its Real-Time Crime Index. But AH Datalytics reported those numbers were down 20% during the first nine months of this year, even before the task force got to work.",
      "Opponents of the task force in majority-Black Memphis say it targets minorities and intimidates law-abiding Latinos, some of whom have skipped work and changed social habits, such as avoiding going to church or restaurants, fearing they will be harassed and unfairly detained. Statistics released at the end of October showed 319 arrests so far on administrative warrants, which deal with immigration-related issues.",
      "The effects have rippled beyond the streets, into the aging criminal courthouse and the troubled jail. Officials are concerned about long waits in traffic court causing people to miss work and packed criminal court dockets forcing inmates to spend extra days waiting for bail hearings.",
      "\u201cThe human cost of it is astounding,\" said Josh Spickler, executive director for Just City, a Memphis-based organization that advocates for fairness in the criminal justice system.",
      "The mayor of Shelby County, which includes Memphis, has requested more judges to hear cases that could span months or years. County officials are discussing opening court at night and on weekends, a move that would help manage the caseload but cost more.",
      "Meanwhile, Shelby County Jail inmates are being moved to other facilities because of overcrowding, officials say. Inmates at jail intake are sleeping in chairs, and jail officials are asking county commissioners for funding to help address problems, such as a corrections employees shortage.",
      "These issues raise concerns from activists and officials about safety in a jail that has seen 65 deaths since 2019, according to Just City. Court case backlogs mean defendants and crime victims could spend an unfair amount of time dealing with the criminal justice system, said Steve Mulroy, the county's district attorney.",
      "\u201cThe task force deployment probably could have used more planning,\u201d said Mulroy, a Democrat whose office is cooperating with the task force. \u201cMore thought could have been put into the downstream effects of the increased arrest numbers.\u201d",
      "There were hundreds more jail bookings and bail settings during the first several weeks of the task force\u2019s operation than during the comparable period last year, an increase of about 40% in each category, according to county statistics.",
      "The jail, which has a regular capacity of 2,400, had an average daily population of 3,195 inmates in September, the most recent month when statistics were available. County officials said that number was expected to rise for October.",
      "As of mid-November, 250 overflow jail detainees were being housed at other facilities, compared with 80 in November 2024. Some of those are outside Shelby County, which makes it harder for lawyers and relatives to visit and increases the cost of bringing defendants to Memphis for hearings.",
      "In a letter to commissioners, Chief Jailer Kirk Fields has requested at least $1.5 million in emergency funds, noting that more inmates means more expenses for food, clothing, bedding and linens.",
      "One issue is whether there are enough judges to hear cases, especially after lawmakers eliminated two judgeships during last year's session.",

      "Bird flu and another disease have shrunk the U.S. turkey population to a 40-year low this year",
      "CHELSEA, Mich. -- Old Brick Farm, where Larry Doll raises chickens, turkeys and ducks, was fortunate this Thanksgiving season.",
      "Doll's small farm west of Detroit had no cases of bird flu, despite an ongoing outbreak that killed more than 2 million U.S. turkeys in the last three months alone. He also avoided another disease, avian metapneumovirus, which causes turkeys to lay fewer eggs.",
      "\u201cI try to keep the operation as clean as possible, and not bringing other animals in from other farms helps mitigate that risk as well,\u201d said Doll, whose farm has been in his family for five generations.",
      "But Doll still saw the impact as those diseases shrank the U.S. turkey flock to a 40-year low this year. The hatchery where he gets his turkey chicks had fewer available this year. He plans to order another 100 hatchlings soon, even though they won\u2019t arrive until July.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t get your order in early, you\u2019re not going to get it,\u201d he said.",
      "The shrinking population is expected to cause wholesale turkey prices to rise 44% this year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Despite the increase, many stores are offering discounted or even free turkeys to soften the potential blow to Thanksgiving meal budgets. But even if the bird is cheaper than last year, the ingredients to prepare the rest of the holiday feast may not be. Tariffs on imported steel, for example, have increased prices for canned goods.",
      "As of Nov. 17, a basket of 11 Thanksgiving staples \u2014 including a 10-pound frozen turkey, 10 Russet potatoes, a box of stuffing and cans of corn, green beans and cranberry sauce \u2013 cost $58.81, or 4.1% more than last year, according to Datasembly, a market research company that surveys weekly prices at 150,000 U.S. stores. That\u2019s higher than the average price increase for food eaten at home, which rose 2.7% in September, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "Datasembly showed a 2% decline in the retail price of a 10-pound turkey as of Nov. 17. Pricing out Thanksgiving meals isn\u2019t an exact science, and the firm's tally differed from other estimates.",
      "The American Farm Bureau Federation, which uses volunteer shoppers in all 50 states to survey prices, reported that Thanksgiving dinner for 10 would cost $55.16 this year, or 5% less than last year. The Wells Fargo Agri-Food Institute, using NielsenIQ data from September, estimated that feeding 10 people on Thursday using store-brand products would cost $80 this year, which is 2% to 3% lower than last year's estimate.",
      "Grocery chains are also offering deals to attract shoppers. Discount grocer Aldi is advertising a $40 meal for 10 with 21 items. Kroger said shoppers could feed 10 people for under $50 with its menu of store-brand products.",
      "Earlier this month, President Donald Trump touted Walmart\u2019s Thanksgiving meal basket, which he said was 25% cheaper than last year. But that was because Walmart included a different assortment and fewer products overall this year.",
      "\u201cWe're seeing some promotions being implemented in an effort to draw customers into the store,\u201d David Ortega, a professor of food economics and policy at Michigan State University, said.",
      "That's despite a sharp increase in wholesale turkey prices since August. In the second week of November, frozen 8-16 pound hens were averaging $1.77 per pound, up 81% from the same period last year, according to Mark Jordan, the executive director of Leap Market Analytics, which closely follows the poultry and livestock markets.",

      "That\u2019s the case for Paul Nadeau, a retired consultant from Austin, Texas, who plans to smoke a turkey this week. Nadeau said he usually smokes a brisket over Thanksgiving weekend, but the beef brisket he buys would now cost more than $100. Turkey prices are also up at his local H-E-B supermarket, he said, but not by as much.",

Farok Contractor, a distinguished professor of management and global business at the Rutgers Business School, said customers are paying 10 cents to 40 cents more per can when companies pass on the full cost of tariffs.",
      "Tariffs may be partly to blame for the increased cost of jellied cranberry sauce, which was up 38% from last year in Datasembly\u2019s survey. But weather was also a factor. U.S. cranberry production is expected to be down 9% this year, hurt by drought conditions in Massachusetts, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "In Illinois, where most of the country\u2019s canning pumpkins are grown, dry weather actually helped pumpkins avoid diseases that are more prevalent in wet conditions, said Raghela Scavuzzo, an associate director of food systems development at the Illinois Farm Bureau and the executive director of the Illinois Specialty Growers Association. Datasembly found that a 30-ounce can of pumpkin pie mix cost 5% less than last year.",
      "Back at Old Brick Farm, which has been in his family since 1864, Doll walked among his turkeys the week before Thanksgiving, patting their heads as they waddled between their warm barn and an open pasture. In a few days, he planned to deliver them to an Amish butcher.",
      "Doll sold all 92 turkeys he raised this year, with customers paying $6.50 per pound for what many tell him is the best turkey they've ever tasted. He enjoys a little profit, he said, and the good feeling of supplying a holiday meal.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is promoting efforts to work with Nigeria\u2019s government to counter violence against Christians",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's administration is promoting efforts to work with Nigeria's government to counter violence against Christians, signaling a broader strategy since he ordered preparations for possible military action and warned that the United States could go in \u201cguns-a-blazing\u201d to wipe out Islamic militants.",
      "A State Department official said this past week that plans involve much more than just the potential use of military force, describing an expansive approach that includes diplomatic tools, such as potential sanctions, but also assistance programs and intelligence sharing with the Nigerian government.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also met with Nigeria\u2019s national security adviser to discuss ways to stop the violence, posting photos on social media of the two of them shaking hands and smiling. It contrasted with Trump\u2019s threats this month to stop all assistance to Nigeria if its government \u201ccontinues to allow the killing of Christians.\u201d",
      "The efforts may support Trump\u2019s pledge to avoid more involvement in foreign conflicts and come as the U.S. security footprint has diminished in Africa, where military partnerships have either been scaled down or canceled. American forces likely would have to be drawn from other parts of the world for any military intervention in Nigeria.",
      "Still, the Republican president has kept up the pressure as Nigeria faced a series of attacks on schools and churches in violence that experts and residents say targets both Christians and Muslims.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really angry about it,\u201d the president said Friday when asked about the new violence on the \u201cBrian Kilmeade Show\u201d on Fox News Radio. He alleged that Nigeria's government has \u201cdone nothing\u201d and said \u201cwhat\u2019s happening in Nigeria is a disgrace.\u201d",

      "Following his meeting Thursday with Nigerian national security adviser Mallam Nuhu Ribadu, Hegseth on Friday posted on social media that the Pentagon is \u201cworking aggressively with Nigeria to end the persecution of Christians by jihadist terrorists.\u201d",
      "\u201cHegseth emphasized the need for Nigeria to demonstrate commitment and take both urgent and enduring action to stop violence against Christians and conveyed the Department\u2019s desire to work by, with, and through Nigeria to deter and degrade terrorists that threaten the United States,\u201d the Pentagon said in a statement.",
      "Jonathan Pratt, who leads the State Department's Bureau of African Affairs, told lawmakers Thursday that \u201cpossible Department of War engagement\u201d is part of the larger plan, while the issue has been discussed by the National Security Council, an arm of the White House that advises the president on national security and foreign policy.",
      "But Pratt described a wide-ranging approach at a congressional hearing about Trump\u2019s recent designation of Nigeria as \u201ca country of particular concern\u201d over religious freedom, which opens the door for sanctions.",
      "\u201cThis would span from security to policing to economic,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to look at all of these tools and have a comprehensive strategy to get the best result possible.\u201d",
      "The violence in Nigeria is far more complex than Trump has portrayed, with militant Islamist groups like Boko Haram killing both Christians and Muslims. At the same time, mainly Muslim herders and mostly Christian farmers have been fighting over land and water. Armed bandits who are motivated more by money than religion also are carrying out abductions for ransom, with schools being a popular target.",
      "In two mass abductions at schools this past week, students were kidnapped from a Catholic school Friday and others taken days earlier from a school in a Muslim-majority town. In a separate attack, gunmen killed two people at a church and abducted several worshippers.",
      "The situation has drawn increasing global attention. Rapper Nicki Minaj spoke at a U.N. event organized by the U.S., saying \u201cno group should ever be persecuted for practicing their religion.\u201d",
      "If the Trump administration did decide to organize an intervention, the departure of U.S. forces from neighboring Niger and their forced eviction from a French base near Chad\u2019s capital last year have left fewer resources in the region.",

      "In the mid-20th century, comic books groups grew in popularity",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- On a recent day at Sacramento native Lecho Lopez's comic shop in the city, his 5-year-old nephew read his first word aloud: \u201cbad.\u201d It was from a graphic novel.",
      "There was irony in that being his first word, because Lopez credits comic books with many positive things in his life. That's why he supports repealing a city ordinance dating back to 1949 that bars the distribution of many comic books to kids and teens. It's not enforced today.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a silly law,\u201d said Lopez, who has a red-and-black tattoo of the Superman logo on his forearm, in an interview at his store, JLA Comics. \u201cA lot of good things come out of comic books.\"",
      "A City Council committee unanimously voted this week to advance the repeal and designate the third week of September as \u201cSacramento Comic Book Week.\u201d It now heads to the full council for a vote. The ban applies to comic books prominently featuring an account of crime that show images of illegal acts such as arson, murder or rape.",
      "In the mid-20th century, as comic books were on the rise, fears spread over their impact on children, with some arguing they could lead to illiteracy or inspire violent crime. The industry decided to regulate itself, and local governments \u2014 from Los Angeles County to Lafayette, Louisiana \u2014 passed bans to shield certain comics from young people. While some cities like Sacramento still have those laws on the books, they are rarely if ever enforced.",
      "Now, proponents of repealing the Sacramento law say it\u2019s necessary to reflect the value of comics and help protect against a modern wave of book bans.",
      "Comic book author Eben Burgoon, who started a petition to overturn Sacramento's ban, said comics \u201chave this really valuable ability to speak truth to power.\u201d",
      "\"These antiquated laws kind of set up this jeopardy where bad actors could work hard to make this medium imperiled,\u201d he said at a hearing Tuesday held by the city council\u2019s Law and Legislation Committee.",
      "Sacramento is a great place to devote a week to celebrating comics, Burgoon said. The city has a \u201cwonderful\u201d comic book community, he said, and hosts CrockerCon, a comics showcase at a local art museum, every year.",
      "Sam Helmick, president of the American Library Association, said \u201cthere is no good reason\u201d to have a ban such as Sacramento's on the books, saying it \u201cflies in the face of modern First Amendment norms.\u201d",
      "The movement to censor comics decades ago was not an aberration in U.S. history, said Jeff Trexler, interim director of the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund, which fights to protect the free-speech rights of people who read or make comics.",
      "New York, for example, created a commission in the 1920s dedicated to reviewing films to determine whether they should be licensed for public viewing, based on whether they were \u201cobscene\u201d or \u201csacrilegious\u201d and could \u201ccorrupt morals\u201d or \u201cincite crime,\" according to the state archives.",

      "The California Supreme Court ruled in 1959 that a Los Angeles County policy banning the sale of so-called \u201ccrime\u201d comic books to minors was unconstitutional because it was too broad. Sacramento's ban probably doesn't pass muster for the same reason, Trexler said.",
      "There\u2019s not a lot of recent research on whether there\u2019s a link between comic books and violent behavior, said Christopher Ferguson, a professor of psychology at Stetson University in Florida. But, he said, similar research into television and video games has not shown a link to \u201cclinically relevant changes in youth aggression or violent behavior.\u201d",
      "Leafing through comics like EC Comics' \u201cEpitaphs from the Abyss\" and DC's and Marvel's collaboration \"Batman/Deadpool,\" Lopez showed an Associated Press reporter images of characters smashing the windshield of a car, smacking someone across the face and attacking Batman using bows and arrows \u2014 the kinds of scenes that might be regulated if Sacramento's ban were enforced.",
      "But comics with plot lines that include violence can contain positive messages, said Benjamin Morse, a media studies lecturer at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.",
      "\u201cSpider-Man is a very mature concept,\" said Morse, who became an \u201cX-Men\u201d fan as a kid and later worked at Marvel for 10 years. \"It\u2019s a kid who\u2019s lost his parents, his uncle dies to violence and he vows to basically be responsible.\u201d",

But it was \u201cKingdom Come,\u201d a comic featuring DC's Justice League, that changed his life at a young age, with its \u201chyper-realistic\u201d art that looked like nothing he'd ever seen before, he said.",

      "Storms that battered Alaska\u2019s western coast this fall have brought renewed attention to low-lying Indigenous villages left increasingly vulnerable by climate change",
      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- Storms that battered Alaska's western coast this fall have brought renewed attention to low-lying Indigenous villages left increasingly vulnerable by climate change \u2014 and revived questions about their sustainability in a region being reshaped by frequent flooding, thawing permafrost and landscape-devouring erosion.",
      "The onset of winter has slowed emergency repair and cleanup work after two October storms, including the remnants of Typhoon Halong, slammed dozens of communities. Some residents from the hardest-hit villages, Kipnuk and Kwigillingok, could be displaced for months and worry what their futures hold.",
      "Kwigillingok already was pursuing relocation before the latest storm, but that can take decades, with no centralized coordination and little funding. Moves by the Trump administration to cut grants aimed at better protecting communities against climate threats have added another layer of uncertainty.",
      "Still, the hope is to try to buy villages time to evaluate next steps by reinforcing rebuilt infrastructure or putting in place pilings so homes can be elevated, said Bryan Fisher, the state's emergency management director.",
      "\u201cWhere we can support that increased resilience to buy that time, we\u2019re going to do that,\u201d he said.",
      "Alaska is warming faster than the global average. A report released last year by the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium found 144 Native communities face threats from erosion, flooding, thawing permafrost or a combination.",
      "Coastal populations are particularly vulnerable, climate scientist John Walsh said. Less Arctic sea ice means more open water, allowing storm-driven waves to do damage. Thawing permafrost invites more rapid coastal erosion. Waves hitting permafrost bounce like water off a concrete wall, he said, but when permafrost thaws, the loose soil washes away more easily.",
      "Wind and storm surge from the remnants of Halong consumed dozens of feet of shoreline in Quinhagak, disturbing a culturally significant archaeological site. Quinhagak, like Kipnuk and Kwigillingok, is near the Bering Sea.",
      "Just four times since 1970 has an ex-typhoon hit the Bering Sea coast north of the Pribilof Islands, said Rick Thoman, a climate specialist with the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Preparedness. Three of those have been since 2022, starting with the remnants of Merbok that year.",
      "The damage caused by ex-typhoon Halong was the worst Fisher said he has seen in his roughly 30 years in emergency management. About 700 homes were destroyed or severely damaged, estimates suggest. Some washed away with people inside and were carried for miles. Kipnuk and Kwigillingok \u2014 no strangers to flooding and home to around 1,100 people \u2014 were devastated. One person died, and two remain missing.",
      "At-risk communities can reinforce existing infrastructure or fortify shoreline; move infrastructure to higher ground in what is known as managed retreat; or relocate entirely. The needs are enormous \u2014 $4.3 billion over 50 years to protect infrastructure in Native communities from climate threats, according to the health consortium report, though that estimate dates to 2020. A lack of resources and coordination has impeded progress, the report found.",
      "Simply announcing plans to relocate can leave a community ineligible for funding for new infrastructure at their existing site, and government policies can limit investments at a new site if people aren't living there yet, the report said.",
      "It took decades and an estimated $160 million for the roughly 300 residents of Newtok in western Alaska to move 9 miles (14.5 kilometers) to their new village of Mertarvik. Newtok was one of the first Alaska Native communities to fully relocate, but others are considering or pursuing it. In Washington and Louisiana, climate change has been a driving force behind relocation efforts by some tribes.",
      "But many villages, including Kipnuk and Kwigillingok, \u201cdon't have that kind of time,\u201d said Sheryl Musgrove, director of the Alaska Climate Justice Program at the Alaska Institute for Justice. The two are among 10 tribal communities her group has been working with as they navigate climate-adaptation decisions.",

      "WASHINGTON -- With his new 28-point plan to end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, President Donald Trump is resurfacing his argument that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy doesn't \u201chave the cards\u201d to continue on the battlefield and must come to a settlement that heavily tilts in Moscow's favor.",
      "Trump, who has demonstrated low regard for Zelenskyy dating back to his first term, said Friday he expects the Ukrainian leader to respond to his administration's new plan to end the war by next Thursday.",
      "\u201cWe think we have a way of getting peace,\u201d Trump told reporters in an Oval Office appearance. \u201cHe\u2019s going to have to approve it.\u201d",

      "Zelenskyy has not spoken with Trump since the plan became public this week, but has said he expects to talk to the Republican president in coming days. It's likely to be another in a series of tough conversations the two leaders have had over the years.",

      "Trump made Biden's support for Ukraine a central issue in his successful 2024 campaign, saying the conflict had cost U.S. taxpayers too much money and vowing he would quickly bring the war to an end.",
      "Then early this year in a disastrous Oval Office meeting, Trump and Vice President JD Vance tore into Zelenskyy for what they said was insufficient gratitude for the more than $180 billion the U.S. had appropriated for military aid and other assistance to Kyiv since the start of the war. That episode led to a temporary suspension of U.S. assistance to Ukraine.",
      "And now with the new proposal, Trump is pressing Zelenskyy to agree to concessions of land to Moscow, a massive reduction in the size of Ukraine\u2019s army, and agreement from Europe to assert that Ukraine will never be admitted into the NATO military alliance.",
      "\u201cNow Ukraine may find itself facing a very difficult choice: either loss of dignity, or the risk of losing a key partner,\u201d Zelenskyy said in a video address Friday.",
      "At the center of Trump's plan is the call on Ukraine to concede the entirety of its eastern Donbas region, even though a vast swath of that land remains in Ukrainian control. Analysts at the independent Institute for the Study of War have estimated it would take several years for the Russian military to completely seize the territory, based on its current rate of advances.",

      "It's unclear how much patience Trump has for further negotiation. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday that Trump's new plan reflects \u201cthe realities of the situation\u201d and offers the \u201cbest win-win scenario, where both parties gain more than they must give.\u201d",

      "The Justice Department is on the clock to release files relating to Jeffrey Epstein after President Donald Trump signed a measure passed by Congress",
      "WASHINGTON -- What began as a campaign-trail promise to release the Jeffrey Epstein files has become one of the most fraught tests of President Donald Trump\u2019s second term \u2014 opening a rift in his political coalition and raising the stakes for an administration now under intense pressure to produce documents that may fall far short of public expectations.",
      "The issue came to a head this week. After months of efforts by the Trump administration to quash it, both chambers of Congress passed a measure forcing the release of the Epstein files with near-anonymous support. Trump, who changed course days before the vote to bless the effort, signed the legislation Wednesday, starting a 30-day window for the Justice Department to deliver the records.",
      "Expectations are sky-high, fueled by years of conspiracy theories promoted by many now in Trump\u2019s orbit. Yet with some claims \u2014 such as a rumored \u201cclient list\u201d of prominent men linked to Epstein \u2014 already deemed nonexistent by federal officials, the anti-establishment coalition Trump built in part by elevating those theories is showing cracks that may widen with the anticipated release.",
      "\u201cWatching this actually turn into a fight has ripped MAGA apart,\u201d Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said this week, flanked by Epstein survivors ahead of the House vote.",
      "\u201cThe only thing that will speak to the powerful, courageous women behind me is when action is actually taken to release these files,\u201d said Greene, who announced late Friday that she will resign from Congress in January. \u201cAnd the American people won\u2019t tolerate any other bulls\u2014-.\u201d",
      "Epstein\u2019s abuse and 2019 death in a New York jail cell have generated conspiracy theories for years, especially on the political right.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump expressed openness to releasing the investigative documents, nodding to anti-establishment demands to open up the government\u2019s files on other high-profile cases like the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.",
      "But once Trump was back in office, divulging records from the federal investigations \u2014 as well as satisfying the appetites of conspiracy theorists \u2013 became less appealing. Attorney General Pam Bondi raised expectations of a full release, only to reverse course over the summer. Her attempt to close the book on the Epstein saga outraged many on the right.",
      "It was the first sign of a rift in Trump\u2019s coalition, and Democrats took notice.",
      "In Congress, they began looking for ways to force Republicans to take votes on releasing the Epstein files. Eventually, they found traction with two tracks: initiating an investigation in the House Oversight Committee and putting full support behind a rarely successful petition that maneuvers around the House speaker\u2019s control of which bills see the floor.",
      "The Democratic effort \u2014 joined by a few key Republicans, including Greene \u2014 culminated last week in passage of the bill with overwhelming support from both chambers of Congress. It was a sign that the Epstein files had risen from the realm of obscure conspiracy theorists to a political force that neither political party could deny.",
      "Still, it\u2019s not clear whether the complete files will be released \u2014 or that the public interest in them will ever be satisfied.",
      "At a Tuesday press conference ahead of the House vote, the bill\u2019s sponsors \u2014 Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie \u2014 joined Greene and several Epstein survivors in warning the administration not to hold anything back.",
      "\u201cThe real test will be whether the Department of Justice releases the files, or whether it all remains tied up in investigations,\u201d Greene said, adding that whether a list of names is released \u201cwill be the real test.\u201d",

      "Trump has signed legislation compelling the Justice Department to release the files on Jeffrey Epstein",
      "For Marina Lacerda, the upcoming publication of U.S. government files on Jeffrey Epstein represent more than an opportunity for justice: Lacerda says she was just 14 when Epstein started sexually abusing her at his New York mansion, but she struggles to recall much of what happened because it is such a dark period in her life.",
      "Now, she\u2019s hoping that the files will reveal more about the trauma that distorted so much of her adolescence.",
      "\u201cI feel that the government and the FBI knows more than I do, and that scares me, because it\u2019s my life, it\u2019s my past,\u201d she told The Associated Press.",
      "President Donald Trump signed legislation Wednesday that will force the Justice Department to release documents from its voluminous files on Epstein.",
      "\u201cWe have waited long enough. We\u2019ve fought long enough,\u201d Lacerda said.",
      "It isn't clear yet how much new information will be in the files, gathered over two decades of investigations into Epstein's alleged sexual abuse of many girls and women.",
      "Some of his accusers expect the files to provide a level of transparency they had hardly allowed themselves to believe would materialize, but the release of the documents will be a more complicated moment for others.",
      "The FBI and police in Palm Beach, Florida, began investigating Epstein in the mid-2000s after several underage girls said he had paid them for sex acts. He pleaded guilty in 2008 to charges including procuring a minor for prostitution, but a secret deal with the U.S. attorney in Florida allowed him to avoid a federal prosecution. He served little more than a year in custody.",
      "Jena-Lisa Jones says she was abused by Epstein in Palm Beach, in 2002, when she was 14. She did not report the abuse to the police at the time, but she later became one of many accusers to sue the multimillionaire.",
      "The Miami Herald published a series of articles about Epstein in 2018 that exposed new details about how the federal prosecution was shelved. A year later, federal prosecutors in New York, where Epstein owned a mansion, revived the case and charged him with sex-trafficking",
      "Jones said she was interviewed during that federal investigation and was prepared to testify in court.",
      "\u201cIt was very important for me to have my moment, for him to see my face and hear my words, and me have that control and power back,\u201d Jones said.",
      "But that day never came.",
      "Epstein killed himself in a federal jail cell in New York City in August 2019.",
      "In lieu of her day in court, Jones and others are hoping for a public reckoning with the publication of the government files on Epstein.",
      "While the government only ever charged two people \u2014 Epstein and his longtime confidante Ghislaine Maxwell \u2014 in connection with the alleged abuse, at least one of Epstein's accusers has claimed she was instructed to have sex with other rich and powerful men.",
      "Jones didn't make similar claims but said she believes the documents could map out a \u201cbroad scheme\u201d involving others.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m hoping they\u2019re shaking a little bit and that they have what\u2019s coming for them,\u201d Jones said.",

      "The first time she massaged Epstein, he told her to remove her shirt, she said.",
      "Lacerda said she was soon spending so much time working for Epstein that she dropped out of school. The sexual abuse persisted until she turned 17, when Epstein informed her that she was \u201ctoo old,\u201d she said.",
      "Lacerda wondered whether the files might include videos and photographs of her and other victims at Epstein\u2019s properties.",
      "\u201cI need to know \u2014 for my healing process and for the adult in me \u2014 what I did as a child,\u201d Lacerda said. \u201cIt will be re-traumatizing, but it\u2019s transparency \u2014 and I need it,\u201d she said.",
      "For Lacerda, the elation around the upcoming release of the files gave way to familiar feelings for many women who survive abuse: fear and paranoia.",

      "The abrupt change in the political momentum made her uneasy. She wondered if the documents would be doctored or redacted to protect people connected to Epstein.",

      "\u201cI guess it really comes from the trauma I\u2019ve endured, because this is kind of what Jeffrey Epstein did to us. You know, he wasn\u2019t transparent. He played these manipulation tactics,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s triggering for anybody who\u2019s been in that situation.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia has announced she will resign from Congress on January 5, 2026",
      "ATLANTA -- It all happened so fast. Less than a week after President Donald Trump denounced Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia Republican announced that she would resign from Congress on Jan. 5.",
      "Greene's departure will cap five tumultuous years in Congress. She was first an outsider, then briefly at the center of power during House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's reign. Trump's return to the White House could have heralded a new era of clout in Washington, but Greene's simmering discontent led to a split with the president.",
      "Here's a look at Greene's background and some of the most notable episodes in her tumultuous five-year career in Congress.",
      "Greene had little involvement in politics before Trump ran for president. She and her husband had bought a commercial contracting company from Greene's father. Greene later opened a CrossFit gym in suburban Atlanta. But during the 2016 campaign, she started posting stories and videos online.",
      "Her initial commentary was a stew of conspiracy theories. Greene suggested a 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas was a coordinated attack to spur support for new gun restrictions. In 2018, she endorsed the idea that the U.S. government perpetrated the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. In a video filmed at the U.S. Capitol in 2018, she claimed Reps. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., both Muslim women, weren\u2019t \u201cofficial\u201d members of Congress because they used Qurans rather than Bibles in their swearing-in ceremonies.",
      "In 2020, Greene jumped into politics by joining a crowded Republican primary in a competitive congressional district in suburban Atlanta, where she lived. But after the incumbent in northwest Georgia's strongly Republican 14th District announced his retirement, Greene shifted her candidacy there.",
      "During her campaign, Greene openly sympathized with QAnon, a conspiracy theory involving a global cabal of Satan-worshipping cannibals, including U.S. government leaders, that operates a child sex trafficking ring. She eventually distanced herself, saying she got \u201csucked into some of the things I had seen on the internet.\u201d",
      "Greene won the Republican nomination in a runoff and then cruised to election when Democrat Kevin Van Ausdal dropped out of the race.",
      "Some of Greene's most inflammatory rhetoric wasn't publicized until after she was elected, like a 2018 claim that California wildfires were ignited by a laser beam from space controlled by the Rothschild banking family.",
      "The claim was often summarized as \u201cJewish space lasers\u201d because the family has been the subject of antisemitic claims over the years. Greene later said she didn't know the Rothschilds were Jewish.",
      "A Democratic-led House kicked Greene off both her committees just weeks into her first term, saying she'd earned the punishment by spreading by hateful and violent conspiracy theories. Eleven Republicans backed the ejections.",

      "When Republicans won the House majority in 2022, she lined up with McCarthy, the California Republican who became House speaker. McCarthy returned Greene to committee assignments and enlisted her as a close adviser.",
      "Greene has often been at the center of drama with Democrats, including bickering with Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas and heckling President Joe Biden as a \u201cliar\u201d during one of his State of the Union speeches.",
      "While Trump ran for a second term, Greene was a constant cheerleader, often appearing alongside him at rallies in Georgia and elsewhere.",
      "But they soon drifted apart. Greene\u2019s discontent dates back at least to May, when she announced she wouldn\u2019t run for the Senate against Democratic incumbent Jon Ossoff. Trump later claimed that he had sent Greene a poll showing that she \u201cdidn't have a chance\u201d in the race.",
      "Greene also passed on running for Georgia governor, attacking a political \u201cgood ole boy\u201d system and alleging it was endangering Republican control of the state.",
      "She started taking positions contrary to Trump. Greene described Israel's actions in Gaza as a \u201cgenocide\u201d against Palestinians, and she backed the release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein. She also criticized Republican leadership over the recent federal government shutdown, saying they needed a better plan to ease the sting of expiring health insurance subsidies.",
      "Greene referred to herself as \u201cAmerica first, America only,\u201d suggesting that Trump was too focused on foreign affairs. As her criticism escalated, Trump became fed up and said he would endorse a primary challenger.",
      "After years of support, he declared, Greene was a \u201ctraitor.\u201d A week later, she announced her resignation.",

      "Federal prosecutors say Luigi Mangione\u2019s death penalty case in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson should carry on unimpeded",
      "NEW YORK -- Prosecutors said Friday that Luigi Mangione\u2019s death penalty case in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson should carry on unimpeded, urging a judge to reject a defense push to dismiss charges and rule out capital punishment over Attorney General Pam Bondi\u2019s public statements suggesting Mangione deserves execution.",
      "The U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan also asked U.S. District Judge Margaret Garnett to deny the defense\u2019s bid to suppress certain evidence collected during the arrest last year, including a 9 mm handgun, a notebook in which authorities say Mangione described his intent to \u201cwack\u201d an insurance executive and statements he made to police.",
      "\u201cPretrial publicity, even when intense, is not itself a constitutional defect,\" prosecutors wrote in a 121-page court filing, citing prior rulings from the Supreme Court and the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.",
      "As for the evidence, which Mangione\u2019s lawyers contend was collected without a warrant and without him being read his rights, prosecutors said police officers were justified in searching the suspect\u2019s backpack to make sure there were no dangerous items. His statements to officers, they said, were made voluntarily and before he was taken into police custody.",
      "Rather than dismissing the case outright or barring the government from seeking the death penalty, prosecutors argued, the defense\u2019s concerns can best be alleviated by carefully questioning prospective jurors about their knowledge of the case and ensuring Mangione\u2019s rights are respected at trial.",
      "\u201cWhat the defendant recasts as a constitutional crisis is merely a repackaging of arguments\u201d rejected in previous cases, prosecutors said. \u201cNone warrants dismissal of the indictment or categorical preclusion of a congressionally authorized punishment.\u201d",
      "Mangione, 27, has pleaded not guilty to state and federal murder charges.",
      "In September a judge threw out state terrorism charges against him but kept the rest of that case \u2014 including an intentional murder charge \u2014 in place.

      "SEATTLE -- U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell on Friday demanded answers from BP about a leak that has forced the shutdown of a major Pacific Northwest fuel pipeline, threatening the fuel supply for jets at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport as well as a possible increase in gasoline prices heading into a busy Thanksgiving travel weekend.",
      "The 400-mile-long (644-kilometer-long) Olympic Pipeline is the backbone of the region's system for moving gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and other petroleum products from refineries near the Canadian border to distribution terminals in the Pacific Northwest west of the Cascades, including major population centers in Washington and Oregon.",

      "Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson declared an emergency earlier this week, waiving some safety restrictions on truck drivers to allow more jet fuel to be hauled to the airport by road, and his office said Friday that measure was working to help more fuel reach the airport. Cantwell noted that it takes 90 trucks per day to deliver half the fuel the airport uses.",
      "Major air carriers said Friday the shutdown has not so far disrupted travel at the airport, which is expected to see some 900,000 travelers over the Thanksgiving holiday, according to Cantwell.",

    "story": [
      "Reggae music icon Jimmy Cliff, who's unique tone, lyricism and breakthrough role on the silver screen helped make the music of his native Jamaica part of popular culture across the globe, has died at the age of 81, his family said in a statement shared Monday on social media.",
      "\"It's with profound sadness that I share that my husband, Jimmy Cliff, has crossed over due to a seizure followed by pneumonia,\" Latifa Chambers said in a statement posted on Cliff's Instagram account. \"I am thankful for his family, friends, fellow artists and coworkers who have shared his journey with him. To all his fans around the world, please know that your support was his strength throughout his whole career \u2026 Jimmy, my darling, may you rest in peace. I will follow your wishes.\"",
      "The couple's children Lilty and Aken also signed the statement.",
      "Cliff was one of Jamaican music's early international stars, emerging as reggae evolved from the sounds of ska and rocksteady in the 1960s and early 1970s. His starring role in the enduring classic movie \"The Harder They Come,\" an entirely Jamaican production, in 1972 cemented his legacy as not only a musician, but a cultural phenom.",
      "Cliff played Ivanhoe \"Ivan\" Martin,  an aspiring singer who came up against the harsh realities of a music business run by self-interested producers, at the expense of artists, and the abundant traps for young Jamaicans trying to survive amid an epidemic of violent gang crime that swept the nation.",
      "\"Ivanhoe was a real-life character for Jamaicans,\" Cliff told Variety magazine in a 2022 interview to mark the 50th anniversary of the movie's release. \"When I was a little boy, I used to hear about him as being a bad man. A real bad man. No one in Jamaica, at that time, had guns. But he had guns and shot a policeman, so he was someone to be feared. However, being a hero was the manner in which [director] Perry [Henzel] wanted to make his name \u2014 an anti-hero in the way that Hollywood turns its bad guys into heroes.\"",
      "The messages in the movie, just like his music, were timeless.",
      "The title track from \"The Harder They Come,\" along with familiar hits including \"Many Rivers to Cross\" and \"You Can Get It If You Really Want,\" spoke to the struggles of Jamaicans at the time, but they have continued to resonate with audiences around the world since he wrote them.",
      "Cliff, along with other icons such as Bob Marley and Toots Hibbert helped give the music and culture of their relatively small Caribbean nation a global impact that endures today, and far exceeds Jamaica's size in terms of population economy.",
      "His animated onstage presence and high-pitched tone were unmistakable. Cliff released his last single, \"Human Touch,\"   only four years ago. According to The Associated Press, Cliff was nominated for Grammy awards seven times and he won twice, taking best reggae album in 1986 with \"Cliff Hanger,\" and again in 2012 with \"Rebirth.\"",
      "In a tribute posted on his own social media accounts early Monday morning, Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness called Cliff \"a true cultural giant whose music carried the heart of our nation to the world.\"",
      "\"Jimmy Cliff told our story with honesty and soul,\" Holness said. \"His music lifted people through hard times, inspired generations, and helped to shape the global respect that Jamaican culture enjoys today.  We give thanks for his life, his contribution, and the pride he brought to Jamaica ... Walk good, Jimmy Cliff. Your legacy lives on in every corner of our island and in the hearts of the Jamaican people.\"",

    "summary": "Lea Michele, the \"Glee\" star who made her Broadway debut in \"Les Miserables\" at age eight, is now back in the same Broadway theater starring in \"Chess: The Musical.\"",
    "story": [
      "In 1965, the original musical \"Funny Girl\" was playing at Broadway's Winter Garden Theatre, starring someone who knew her way around a song. That same year, a guy named Joe Allen opened a place a few blocks away. It was the place to be for Broadway stars like Al Pacino and a host of others. Plus, they served a mean cheeseburger.",
      "The cheeseburgers are still there, and so are Broadway's elite. Lea Michele has been coming here since her Broadway debut in the 1990s. \"I just love this place so much,\" she said.",
      "And what would she eat? \"A burger. I mean, it's always so good, so good here, oh my God,\" she said.",
      "But when we met her at Joe Allen's, she wasn't in a burger mood, because she had a show to do. Lea Michele is currently starring in the musical \"Chess.\" In the show, she plays a brilliant strategist for two world champion chess players (played by Aaron Tveit and Nicholas Christopher).",
      "\"Chess\" is a love triangle, a spectacle, and a chance for the stars to raise the roof at the Imperial Theatre \u2013 the same place where Michele made her Broadway debut in 1995 in \"Les Miserables,\" at the age of eight.",
      "Her parents weren't show biz people \u2013 Dad owned a deli \u2013 and before she auditioned, they had no clue their daughter could sing. \"And as we were leaving, I turned to my Mom and I was like, 'I'm gonna get this. I think I'm gonna get this,'\" Michele recalled. \"And she said, 'Things like that don't happen to people like us.'\"",
      "In this case, Mom was wrong: Michele got the part, and went on to even greater heights in the musical \"Spring Awakening,\" and later became a household name in the hit TV show \"Glee.\"",
      "She hit a few bumps along the way, among them a difficult pregnancy with her first child in 2020, and flak on social media that she acted like a diva back in the \"Glee\" days. But things looked up in 2023, when she was asked to step into the shoes of her idol Barbra Streisand, and take over a struggling revival of \"Funny Girl.\"",
      "She said, \"I think that we all grow as we get older. It's hard being in an industry where there is such a spotlight on these phases and times in your life.\"",
      "And what was the pressure like to take over \"Funny Girl\"? It was the first time that I was really sort of in the spotlight after everything that had happened to me personally,\" Michele said. \"I wanted to finally show everyone that I could play this part, and play her really well.\"",
      "Long story short, Michele killed it, and turned a sinking show into a hit, despite suffering a miscarriage during her run. And when she was approached about doing \"Chess,\" she told producers that having another baby came first.\u00a0 \"And so my husband and I ended up doing IVF, which was in its own right very intense and challenging,\" she said. \"But you know, we got pregnant and had our daughter, who is wonderful and wild. And then they, you know, said, 'Would you like to do the show?' 'Absolutely!'\"",
      "Now, the 39-year-old mother of two is back at the Imperial Theatre, where it all began, serving up another knockout performance with a side of gratitude.",
      "I asked, \"What do you think that eight-year-old girl would think, back in that same theatre?\"",
      "\"I think that she'd be so proud, and she would just say, 'Thank you,' 'cause that's all she wanted,\" Michele said. \"And it's still what I want. My love for what I do was definitely reignited during 'Funny Girl.' And I'm very grateful for that. But I'm so happy to be here, and to be home.\"",

    "summary": "Rapper Prakazrel \"Pras\" Michel of the Fugees has been sentenced to 14 years in prison for a case in which he was convicted of illegally funneling millions of dollars in foreign contributions to the 2012 Obama campaign.",
    "story": [
      "Grammy-winning rapper Prakazrel \"Pras\" Michel of the Fugees was sentenced on Thursday to 14 years in prison for a case in which he was convicted of illegally funneling millions of dollars in foreign contributions to former President Barack Obama's 2012 reelection campaign.",
      "Michel, 52, declined to address the court before U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly sentenced him.",
      "In April 2023, a federal jury convicted Michel of 10 counts, including conspiracy and acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign government. The trial in Washington, D.C., included testimony from actor Leonardo DiCaprio and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.",
      "Justice Department prosecutors said federal sentencing guidelines recommended a life sentence for Michel, whom they said \"betrayed his country for money\" and \"lied unapologetically and unrelentingly to carry out his schemes.\"",
      "\"His sentence should reflect the breadth and depth of his crimes, his indifference to the risks to his country, and the magnitude of his greed,\" they wrote.",
      "Defense attorney Peter Zeidenberg said his client's 14-year sentence is \"completely disproportionate to the offense.\" Michel will appeal his conviction and sentence, according to his lawyer.",
      "Zeidenberg had recommended a three-year prison sentence. A life sentence would be an \"absurdly high\" punishment for Michel, given that it is typically reserved for deadly terrorists and drug cartel leaders, Michel's attorneys said in a court filing.",
      "\"The Government's position is one that would cause Inspector Javert to recoil and, if anything, simply illustrates just how easily the Guidelines can be manipulated to produce absurd results, and how poorly equipped they are, at least on this occasion, to determine a fair and just sentence,\" they wrote.",
      "Michel, a Brooklyn native whose parents immigrated to the U.S. from Haiti, was a founding member of the Fugees along with childhood friends Lauryn Hill and Wyclef Jean. Their hip-hop band won two Grammy Awards and sold tens of millions of albums.",
      "Michel obtained more than $120 million from Malaysian billionaire Low Taek Jho \u2014 also known as Jho Low \u2014 and steered some of that money through straw donors to Obama's campaign.",
      "Michel said during trial that he viewed Low's payments as \"free money,\" and accepted the millions over the course of nine months to help Low secure a photo op with Obama. He said under oath at the time that no one told him such payments toward political donations could have been unlawful or violations of campaign finance laws.",
      "The Justice Department also charged Michel with serving as an unregistered foreign agent for China, alleging that in 2017 he sought to sway the Trump administration to halt its probe into Low and to extradite a Chinese government target living in the U.S. That individual, dissident Miles Guo, was charged in New York in a billion-dollar fraud case and is still in custody.",
      "Low, who has lived in China, was one of the primary financiers of \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" a movie starring DiCaprio. Low is a fugitive but has maintained his innocence.",
      "\"Low's motivation for giving Mr. Michel money to donate was not so that he could achieve some policy objective. Instead, Low simply wanted to obtain a photograph with himself and then-President Obama,\" Michel's attorneys wrote.",
      "In August 2024, the judge rejected Michel's request for a new trial based in part on his defense attorney's use of a generative artificial intelligence program during his closing of the trial's arguments. The judges said that and other trial errors didn't amount to a serious miscarriage of justice.",

      "As an artist, Lily Allen stands firm by her belief that heartbreak can be a gift. After all, it helped lead to her latest album, \"West End Girl.\"",
      "\"You know, while I was writing it, I wasn't really sure that it was going to see the light of day,\" Allen told CBS News special correspondent Anthony Mason in an interview for \"CBS Mornings\" that aired Thursday, describing the music as \"an act of desperation.\" The studio album, released in late October, was written during the breakup of her nearly 4-year marriage to \"Stranger Things\" actor David Harbour.",
      "The theme of what's been described as Allen's epic \"breakup album\" centers around tales of a deceptive partner, which the singer says is based partly on truth and partly on fantasy.",
      "Harbour has not directly addressed his breakup with Allen or commented on her \"West End Girl\" album. But in an interview with Esquire UK, published around the album's release, Harbour discussed the importance of accepting your mistakes. \"I'd change everything or nothing. If you accept your past, you accept it completely, even the pain, the mistakes... It's all part of the journey, the growth, the wisdom, the empathy, and the connection, and if you change one thing, you change everything,\" he told the magazine at the time, adding that his work is about being honest.",
      "New album says \"everything that I needed to say\"",
      "But Allen said it was a \"nightmare\" holding onto the album and stunted her healing process. She felt a sense of relief and peace when she finally was able to share her words with the world.",
      "\"Since I've put it out, it's felt completely and utterly liberating. It was kind of hellish having it in the background,\" Allen said. \"I don't know. I just feel like I couldn't \u2013 it said everything that I needed to say. And I felt like I couldn't really like get on with my life until I'd said it.\"",
      "Her newly released music quickly lit up social media, with fans reacting to it on TikTok.",
      "Allen wrote most of the record within the span of 10 days at the end of last year. She was excited to complete the album, but at the same time her personal life was falling into pieces.",
      "After spending Christmas with her two daughters whom she shares with ex-husband Sam Cooper, Allen decided to check herself into a treatment facility.",
      "\"I knew the things I was feeling were too intense,\" Allen explained her decision to seek professional help at the time following her separation. As a recovering alcoholic, Allen said she's not afraid of working on herself and knew she needed some quiet time.",
      "A cathartic release",
      "The Brooklyn townhouse that Allen and Harbour gave Architectural Digest a tour of in 2023 is now listed for around $8 million. The pair bought the home in early 2021 shortly after they got married.",
      "Allen said her music was cathartic \u2013 for herself and her children.",
      "\"All of the pain that, you know, that I've been through in the past year, they've been through too,\" Allen said. \" But you know, one thing that I wanted to do was to show my kids that, you know, you can use that pain and harness it and turn it into something else. And I think I've done that.\"",
      "Now, Allen is preparing for her 2026 tour \u2013 her first since she got sober in 2019.",
      "The singer said she's planning her touring schedule around her girls' holidays so they'll be able to come and bring their friends.",
      "\"I can't wait to have them there. It's like, it's gonna be... It's as much for them as it is for me,\" Allen said, adding that she feels like she's living her best life after a year of healing.",

      "Baby play yards sold on Amazon by Anna Queen are being recalled due to the \"risk of serious injury or death from suffocation and entrapment hazards,\" the Consumer Product Safety Commission says.",
      "The play yards \"violate the mandatory standard for\u00a0play yards,\" the agency says, pointing out that \"infants can become entrapped under the mattress or between the side of the play yard and the mattress, posing a risk of serious injury or deadly suffocation hazard.\"",
      "According to the CPSC, \u00a0the play yards \"have black fabric sides and mesh panels bordered in gray. The top rails are covered with white fabric with a multi-colored print with bear faces, paws and the word 'bear.'\"",
      "The agency says the play yards \"include a mattress with the same bear print.\"",
      "In particular, the CPSC notes, \"'Model: P700' and 'Production Date: 202503' are printed on the packaging and on a removeable tag included with the play yard.\"",
      "If you have one, you should \"immediately stop using the recalled play yards and contact Anna Queen for a full refund,\" the agency stresses. \"Consumers should disassemble the fabric cover from the play yard frame, cut up the cover and mattress pad and email a photo of the destroyed play yard to\u00a0tingerservice@outlook.com\u00a0to obtain a full refund. Consumers should then dispose of the destroyed play yard.\"",

    "summary": "Those prioritizing economy say Trump is not spending enough time on it, as ratings of economy, his handling of inflation slip.",
    "story": [
      "The situation around Venezuela has Americans asking to know more.",
      "Across party lines, big majorities say the administration needs to explain what the U.S. intends regarding any action, and that it has not done so clearly yet.",
      "Meanwhile, what Americans hear from the White House about inflation is, they say, not what they're actually feeling at home: rising prices and worsening economic views.",
      "In the meantime, Americans do not think of Venezuela as a major threat to the US. Instead, more see a minor one, and they are largely opposed to potential military action.",
      "So, the idea of potential U.S. military action in Venezuela meets with widespread disapproval. It doesn't get overwhelming backing from Republicans either.",
      "Three in four Americans also say Trump would need congressional approval before taking military action in Venezuela, including just over half of Republicans.",
      "Just one in five Americans have heard a lot about the U.S. military buildup in the first place. That may be another expression of that sense of limited information about the purpose.",
      "The current military attacks on boats suspected of bringing drugs find division \u2014 just over half approve, driven by nearly universal support among Republicans \u2014 though Americans overall overwhelmingly say they should see the evidence that there are drugs.",
      "However, most Americans don't think U.S. military action in Venezuela would change the amount of drugs coming into the U.S.",
      "Looking more closely within the president's GOP base: MAGA Republicans are actually more supportive of potential military action than non-MAGA ones.",
      "For context, that is similar to what we've seen over time on many issues, including foreign policy, in which that part of the base is largely deferential to the president. (As one example, MAGA was also supportive of the bombing in Iran months ago.) Most of them say the president has explained things, and in turn, are more apt to see any action in Venezuela as decreasing the amount of drugs entering the U.S.",
      "But many who are opposed to military action, including those within the GOP ranks, may also be seeing this in terms of issue priorities. They're a little more likely to judge the administration on what it does about the economy than those in favor. And most who judge him on the economy think he isn't spending enough time on it.",
      "Here's what Americans say about the economy",
      "There's a disconnect between how Americans hear the White House describing the economy, and what they're feeling themselves.",
      "Most Americans say Trump describes things with prices and inflation as better than they really are.",
      "(This includes four in 10 Republicans who say this about Trump. They are also among those more likely to say prices are going up.)",
      "This comes as ratings for the overall economy continue to be low \u2014 as they've been for years \u2014 ticking down this week to their lowest mark in 2025.",
      "Prices, more generally, are still seen by most as going up.",
      "As we head into the holiday season, that economic dissatisfaction includes the majority of Americans who feel President Trump's policies are making the cost of food and groceries, specifically, go up.",
      "So, that disconnect appears to continue to weigh on the president's ratings.",
      "There are many ways Americans judge a president. For those who say they judge Mr. Trump most on what he does about the economy and inflation, they overwhelmingly say he isn't spending enough time on that.",
      "That, in turn, has continued to push his approval on handling the economy and inflation down over the course of several months. That trend continues this week, with assessments of the overall economy, and his ratings for handling the economy and inflation, hitting lows for the year.",
      "More than two-thirds disapprove of his handling of inflation.",
      "He does especially poorly on handling the economy among people who mainly judge him on that.",
      "Among independents, his ratings for handling the economy, and his ratings overall, have also hit lows for the year. That has continued to push his approval rating overall lower over time too, now down to their low point for his second term after a steady decline over recent months.",
      "The president does a little better on his handling of immigration, backed by continued large support from the GOP base, as has been the case for months.",
      "The decline in the president's overall approval ratings connects to people's economic priorities in this way: even among those who voted for him in 2024, disapproval today is more likely to come when people are judging him mostly on the economy.",
      "Deportation",
      "The administration's deportation program continues to split the country, but support is underpinned by strong approval from Republicans.",
      "Most \u2014 particularly those outside the GOP base \u2014 continue to feel that ICE is detaining more people than necessary.",
      "But the deportation program is seen by many as more undermining than strengthening the economy.",
      "One possible reason: a third of the country (who tend to live in cities and suburbs) say it is impacting their community for the worse, and they feel people in their area are staying home more as a result of the program.",
      "Epstein files",
      "Americans across party lines think it is important to see the Epstein files released.",
      "Americans overwhelmingly believe they will contain damaging information about powerful people. Most say it's too soon to know if what's in them is true. On balance, though, more think that information will be true rather than false.",
      "Republicans are more satisfied with how the Trump administration is handling the Epstein case than they were in the summer. (The survey was conducted just after Trump said Congress should vote to release the files, which they did shortly thereafter.) Today, most others are not satisfied.",
      "However, the president's Republican base says issues surrounding the files are not important to how they judge him. Nearly two-thirds of Republicans say this doesn't affect how they evaluate Trump overall. (Independents and Democrats, though, give it comparably more importance in this regard.)",
      "This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,489 U.S. adults interviewed between November 19-21, 2025. The sample was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as 2024 presidential vote.

    "summary": "In the Midcoast Maine town of Camden, the Villager Cafe helps support a weekly newspaper, the Midcoast Villager \u2013 dishing up sustainable journalism while sustaining the community.",
    "story": [
      "Those sinful-looking blueberry pancakes, and that nice, noisy foamy latte \u2013 would you believe they are rescuing journalism, in and around Camden, Maine, at least?",
      "Here in lobster country, at the Villager Cafe, customers can have their breakfast or lunch with a side of news, a weekly newspaper called the Midcoast Villager. \"I was just reading about the SNAP benefits and different food pantries in the area,\" said one cafe customer.",
      "The cafe subsidizes the paper; the newsroom is one floor up. Throw in the rent from all the other tenants in the building, along with revenue from the Inn at Camden Place next door (same ownership), and it all helps.",
      "\"From the business standpoint, it achieves a sustainability,\" said Reade Brower. At one time, Brower owned almost all of Maine's newspapers, before selling most of them off. In September 2024, he merged four weeklies into the Midcoast Villager. The cafe opened this past April, but not just to make money.",
      "\"The accountability issues and local sports and all that stuff is important to a lot of people,\" he said. \"I don't think that's enough to sell and keep newspapers alive right now. I think it has to revolve around community. And what better way to serve community than to invite people here for food and to mix all this stuff together?\"",
      "How often do you see the owner of a newspaper, and members of his staff, hanging out with readers over breakfast?",
      "Kathleen Capetta helps Brower run what they both see as an experiment in rebuilding trust in news. \"We're present, we're visible, we're real,\" she said. \"We're not behind a screen.\"",
      "And would that experiment work if the food weren't good? \"Absolutely not, no!\" Capetta laughed.",
      "\"It's good, classic diner food, but a little bit elevated, which is I think kind of like our paper,\" said deputy editor Alex Seitz-Wald. He is the face of the newspaper when he parks himself in the cafe on Friday mornings, to hear complaints, story tips, whatever. \"Having a place where people can vent, or can say something, and have it be heard, I think is really valuable,\" he said.",
      "Seitz-Wald was an NBC politics reporter in Washington, D.C., for a decade before taking a chance \u2013 and a pay cut \u2013 to work for the Midcoast Villager, a start-up in a field where two newspapers die every week.",
      "How's the Villager doing? Circulation revenue, we're told, is 40% above what all four papers it replaced took in \u2013 so, promising.",
      "\"I'm quite glad that I still have a newspaper to work for,\" said Glenn Billington. A local news lifer, he's the optimistic ad salesman and columnist for the Midcoast Villager, just as he was for one of its now-defunct predecessors.",
      "The mascot on the paper's masthead is Vern, who is the epitome of Midcoast Maine. \"He sure is,\" said Billington. \"Look at his sou'wester. He's got the hat that you wear when the wind blows from the southwest and it brings rain. And he's got the telescope. Vern's looking at the future of newspapers.\"",
      "What one sees at the Villager Cafe is old-fashioned \u2013 people sitting down at tables, eating and talking and looking at each other eye-to-eye. Or as Brower put it, \"You're picking up what we're putting down.\"",

    "summary": "The new dummy, known as THOR-05F, contains female-specific proportions, according\u200b to the Transportation Department.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Transportation introduced a new female crash dummy as it seeks to step up safety for women, who face a higher injury risk in car crashes than men.",
      "The U.S. government has used a dummy model for decades that is based almost entirely on male proportions.",
      "The new dummy, known as THOR-05F, is more human-like and contains female-specific proportions, according to the Transportation Department. The new model could potentially replace the Hybrid III dummy, which has previously been utilized for crash testing.",
      "\"Advances in technology now make it possible to more accurately account for the biological differences between male and female anatomy in crash testing,\" the Department of Transportation said in a statement Thursday.",
      "Women are 73% more likely to be injured in a head-on crash, and they are 17% more likely to be killed in a car crash, than men.",
      "Transportation officials will consider using the new dummy in the government's vehicle crash test five-star ratings once a final rule is adopted, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Thursday in a news release.",
      "The department also noted that THOR-05F will be available to manufacturers to build models and to the automotive industry, which can begin testing the model in their vehicles.",
      "The road to THOR-05F",
      "The standard crash test dummy used in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration five-star vehicle testing was developed in 1978 and was modeled after a 5-foot-9 (175-centimeter), 171-pound (78-kilogram) man.",
      "The female dummy is smaller and has a rubber jacket to represent breasts. It's routinely tested in the passenger or back seat but seldom in the driver's seat, even though the majority of licensed drivers are women.",
      "But the change is not guaranteed to happen. Some American automakers have been skeptical and a group representing auto insurers has already said it thinks the current crash test dummies are fine.",
      "The new female dummy endorsed by the department more accurately reflects differences between men and women, including the shape of the neck, collarbone, pelvis, and legs. It's outfitted with more than 150 sensors, the department said.",
      "Maria Weston Kuhn, a law student at New York University, started lobbying members of Congress to pass a law requiring the new female dummy after surviving a 2019 crash in Ireland in which her seat belt slid off her hips and ruptured her intestines. She welcomed Duffy's support but said she won't celebrate until NHTSA incorporates the new model into its testing \u2014 a step that has been delayed numerous times.",
      "\"I fear that with this announcement everybody will throw up their hands and say we've won,\" Kuhn said Friday. \"But we are far from crossing the finish line.\"",
      "Some American automakers have been skeptical, arguing the new model may exaggerate injury risks and undercut the value of some safety features such as seat belts and airbags.",
      "Despite Duffy's announcement, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a research arm funded by auto insurers, continues to advocate for the current line of dummies used to represent women and has seen dramatic improvements in safety as a result, spokesperson Joe Young said.",
      "\"Certainly, we are going to continue to monitor the new tools and perhaps do some additional research,\" Young said. \"But for now, our researchers are content and confident that the dummies we're using are doing a good job.\"",
      "Lawmakers and transportation secretaries from the past two presidential administrations have expressed support for new crash test rules and safety requirements, but developments have been slow.",
      "U.S. Sens. Deb Fischer, a Republican from Nebraska, and Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat from Illinois, both released statements welcoming the female crash test dummy announcement.",
      "\"Any progress here is good because there's simply no good reason why women are more likely to be injured or die in car crashes,\" Duckworth said.",
      "Fischer introduced legislation, the She Drives Act, that would require the most advanced testing devices available, including a female crash test dummy. Duckworth is a co-sponsor.",
      "\"It's far past time to make these testing standards permanent, which will help save thousands of lives and make America's roads safer for all drivers,\" Fischer said.",

    "story": [
      "Bitcoin continued to slide on Friday, extending a weeks-long slump that has wiped out nearly $800 billion in value since the cryptocurrency hit its 2025 peak last month. The downturn has stripped away all of bitcoin's gains this year \u2014 and raised questions about where it might go from here.",
      "Since closing at almost $125,000 on Oct. 6, its highest price this year, bitcoin has shed about one-third of its value. On Friday, bitcoin sank below $82,000 before rebounding slightly to $83,509 before noon EDT, according to CoinGecko, a cryptocurrency data aggregator.",
      "The cryptocurrency, which is trading at its lowest level since April, is now on track for its worst monthly performance since 2022, when a spate of corporate collapses sparked turbulence in the crypto sector, Bloomberg\u00a0reported\u00a0Friday.",
      "The precipitous drop comes as Wall Street grapples with unease over whether there's a bubble in artificial technology and tech stocks, prompting a shift away from assets that are viewed as carrying more risk, analysts say.

    "published": "Fri, 21 Nov 2025 13:15:47 -0500",
    "summary": "The agency's \"Golden Age of Travel\" campaign aims to restore civility to air travel. Experts say they have doubts.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Transportation on Wednesday unveiled a campaign aimed at bringing more civility to air travel, urging Americans to dress \"with respect\" and remember simple courtesies like saying \"please\" and \"thank you\" to flight attendants. Travel experts say they're skeptical it will make much difference.",
      "The new plan \u2014 called \"The Golden Age of Travel Starts With You\"\u00a0\u2014 is meant to \"jumpstart a nationwide conversation around how we can all restore courtesy and class to air travel,\" the agency said.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is rolling out the civility campaign in part as a response to what the agency called a record rise in unruly passenger incidents, including altercations with other travelers and airline staff. The issue isn't new, with U.S. Federal Aviation Administration data showing that incidents with unruly passengers peaked in 2021, although reports remain roughly double their pre-pandemic level.",
      "The Transportation Department didn't define what it meant by \"dressing with respect.\" In a Wednesday social media post, Duffy wrote, \"Dress up to go to the airport, help a stranger out, and be in a good mood.\"",
      "Duffy said he's encouraging air travelers to ask themselves the following five questions to ensure civility:",
      "Are you helping a pregnant woman or the elderly with placing their bags in the overhead bin?Are you dressing with respect?Are you keeping control of your children and helping them through the airport?Are you saying thank you to your flight attendants?Are you saying please and thank you in general?",
      "Are you helping a pregnant woman or the elderly with placing their bags in the overhead bin?",
      "Are you dressing with respect?",
      "Are you keeping control of your children and helping them through the airport?",
      "Are you saying thank you to your flight attendants?",
      "Are you saying please and thank you in general?",
      "Can dressing better improve economy class?",
      "Travel experts are skeptical that the Transportation Department's call to dress up for the airport will result in meaningful changes. Most travelers now prize comfort over formality, especially given the typically tight seating in economy and the likelihood of delays.",
      "In response to Duffy's social media post, some users chimed in with their own ideas \u2014 from widening cramped economy seats to making security checkpoints friendlier for travelers. While some agreed that a little more civility would be welcome, others noted that comfortable clothes make flying more tolerable in such tight quarters.",
      "A few decades ago, when Americans typically dressed up to fly, the travel experience looked a whole lot different.",
      "\"Economy class was actually nice. Now, everyone is wedged together on planes,\" Chris Elliott, a travel expert and consumer advocate, told CBS News.",
      "Sarah Silbert, a strategist at the flight search engine Points Path, said the clothing guideline isn't enforceable and isn't likely to shift traveler behavior.",
      "\"It's more of a soft nudge about travel etiquette,\" she told CBS News. \"Given how cramped and stressful flying can be for most people now, it's easy to see why a message about 'dressing up' will draw pushback.\"",
      "Travelers' interpretations may also vary significantly, experts added.",
      "\"Do I imagine anyone would be able to agree on what the dress code is? No,\" Daniel Green, co-founder of Faye Travel Insurance, told CBS News. He added that he doesn't think there should be a dress code for travelers, either.",
      "\"At the end of the day, I think this is just a well-intentioned messaging campaign about behaving well in public that will likely have no practical or tangible implications for people,\" he said.",
      "Changes in air travel",
      "The rise in unruly passengers stems from several issues, including alcohol, drugs and mental health issues, as well as stress from dealing with crowded airports and problems like flight delays, according to Transport Security International, a travel publication.",
      "Scott Keyes, founder of the flight-deals site Going.com, noted that the \"golden age of travel\" was hardly golden for most Americans. Airfare was so expensive that flying was largely limited to the wealthy. Because flying is more affordable today, air travel has become a more democratized experience, he added.",
      "\"Many more people are traveling today. You see people from all walks of life getting on planes, and this campaign harkens back to a time when air travel was only for the elite,\" he told CBS News.",
      "He also objects to the notion that the \"golden age\" of flying provided a better passenger experience than today's flights.",
      "\"There are many ways in which it was an objectively worse experience. The flights took longer, they didn't have Wi-Fi, and there was cigarette smoke wafting through cabins,\" he said.",
      "Even so, he said he doubts the Transportation Department's civility push will inspire anyone to start dressing to the nines.",
      "\"If you think it's a good thing that most of society today can afford to buy tickets and travel, then you have to accept that people are going to behave how they're going to behave,\" Keyes said. \"I don't think I would want to live in a society that had dress recommendations to be on an airplane.\"",

      "Amazon has started issuing payments to eligible Prime members as part of a $2.5 billion settlement over federal allegations that it misled customers.",
      "The online retailer\u00a0agreed to the payouts in September\u00a0to resolve a 2023 Federal Trade Commission\u00a0lawsuit that accused Amazon of misleading customers into enrolling in Prime and making it hard for them to cancel their membership.",
      "Under the settlement, Amazon agreed to offer $1.5 billion in refunds to customers. However, the e-commerce company neither admitted nor denied the FTC's allegations. In a\u00a0statement\u00a0at the time, the company said that \"Amazon and our executives have always followed the law.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the Amazon refund, including how to determine if you qualify for the payment.",

      "Amazon is issuing settlement refunds to eligible Prime Members, starting with automatic payments issued between Nov. 12 and Dec. 24 (see below for more details on how payments are being made).",
      "\"Our settlement required Amazon to pay those people who clearly qualify without them having to do anything,\" Christopher Bissex, deputy director of public affairs at the FTC, told CBS News. \"So those people are getting the automatic payments.\"",

      "The FTC also said these customers must have used no more than three \"Amazon Prime Benefits\" in a 12-month period.",
      "How do I get my payment?",

    "story": [
      "Los Angeles \u2014 A vintage blue VW bus that became an unlikely symbol of resilience after it survived a California wildfire made its public debut this week, shiny and like-new after Volkswagen spent months restoring the damaged vehicle.",
      "The bus went viral in January when an Associated Press photographer captured it looking surprisingly unharmed by the deadly Palisades Fire, a spot of blue and white dwarfed by the charred remains of a Malibu neighborhood. Volkswagen saw the accompanying AP story and reached out to the owner, Megan Weinraub. Upon closer inspection, VW technicians discovered that while the bus had survived, it had smoke damage and blistered paint, rust and a window busted by the heat.",
      "In its restoration, the 1977 Type 2 Microbus named Azul - Spanish for the color blue - again brought people together as technicians consulted the broader community of VW enthusiasts in a shared mission to revive what was a quirky middle-aged vehicle.",
      "\"It melted and Volkswagen saved it,\" Weinraub said Thursday at the LA Auto Show, standing with the bus's previous owner, Preston Martin. \"It was a giant relief because it wasn't my first priority with everything going on.\"",
      "While Weinraub calls the microbus \"Azul,\" it became known as the \"Magic bus\" on social media, CBS News Los Angeles points out.",
      "\"I was lucky and grateful to have the opportunity for them to restore it because I wouldn't have been able to restore it myself,\" she told the station.",
      "Weintraub and Martin still can't believe the bus they wrote off as a goner is now ready to take them on another surfing adventure. The last time they saw the pre-burned Azul was two days before the Palisades Fire broke out, when they parked the bus near Weinraub's apartment after surfing.",
      "Mark J. Terrill, the AP photographer who captured the original image, was on hand when Weinraub and Martin saw the bus for the first time after its restoration in late October.",
      "Volkswagen hauled the microbus to its Oxnard facility west of Los Angeles where it houses historic VW vehicles. Vehicle technicians Farlan Robertson and Gunnar Wynarski sourced hard-to-find parts, got creative and reached out to a lot of people.",
      "\"At the bottom of it it was to try to take the vehicle that everyone else saw and do what we could to improve upon it, but not change it,\" said Robertson, \"to actually have it come out and be the revived, resurrected vehicle returned to its former glory.\"",

    "story": [
      "A Treasury Department analysis indicates that new U.S. sanctions on Russian oil producers have sent prices there tumbling, choking off a key revenue source that Russia has used to fund its war in Ukraine, the department said.",
      "One key benchmark for Russian oil prices \u2014 Urals crude \u2014 had fallen by at least 21% since a set of new sanctions were announced last month, a Treasury official said Thursday. The official also pointed to a decrease in the amount of oil departing from Russia to unknown destinations and said transaction volume has decreased.",
      "The sanctions, announced Oct. 22, target Russian oil giants Lukoil and Rosneft. They represent the first direct actions against Russia of the second Trump administration and some of the most aggressive since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022. Since the announcement, nearly a dozen major Indian and Chinese purchasers of Russian oil have stated intentions to pause their purchases of Russian oil deliveries for December, Treasury has said.",
      "A November 17 memo from the Treasury's Sanctions Economic Analysis Division assessed that the \"sanctions on Russian energy firms Lukoil and Rosneft are having their intended effect of dampening Russian revenues by lowering the price of Russian oil and therefore the country's ability to fund its war effort against Ukraine.\"",
      "The memo said that several grades of Russian oil are trading at multi-year lows, and are \"well below all other international prices.\"",
      "The memo also indicated that sanctions are \"likely to have a long-term negative impact on the quantity of Russian oil sold.\"",
      "The sanctions set a Friday, Nov. 21, deadline for companies to wind down dealings with Rosneft and Lukoil. Nearly three dozen entities are petitioning Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control for additional time to wind down operations, which would take them beyond the original deadline. That is not unusual, as companies work to comply with U.S. sanctions.",
      "Treasury has issued some extensions already for certain transactions involving Lukoil's retail service stations and contracts for the sale of the firm's international assets until Dec. 13. A separate waiver for deals pertaining to Lukoil's entities in Bulgaria was extended through April 29, according to a CBS review of the licenses.",
      "A Treasury official also said Thursday that many Chinese and Indian entities \u2014 including banks and refineries \u2014 are conscious of the sanctions and are \"risk averse, do recognize the importance of the relationships with the West, and are moving to comply.\"",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last month the sanctions on Russia's largest oil companies were driven by President Vladimir Putin's \"refusal to end this senseless war.\" Treasury said the companies have helped to \"fund the Kremlin's war machine.\"",
      "Last month on CBS News' \"Face the Nation,\" Bessent told moderator Margaret Brennan that the latest actions could cut Russia's oil revenue 20% or 30%. A Treasury official said the impacts are still being assessed, but that \"it is clear that there will be revenue impacts\" from the sanctions.",
      "The oil price plunge comes as President Trump presses Russia and Ukraine to reach a ceasefire. At various points, he has expressed frustration with the leaders of both countries.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 16:47:44 -0500",
    "summary": "Criminals are targeting shoppers with fake websites, bogus charities and other fraudulent pitches, according to insights from Visa.",
    "story": [
      "The holiday shopping season is creating fresh openings for scammers looking to snag consumers' payment data, according to Visa's 2025 Holiday Threats Report.",
      "Artificial intelligence is also helping criminals move faster and reach more victims, according to Visa's scam disruption team. AI tools can generate authentic-sounding text for fake websites that look legitimate but are designed to steal your information.",
      "\"Just as regular consumers are excited for shopping season, scammers are also excited, because it gives them opportunities to capitalize on these feelings, and illicitly gather payment data, or other personal information from unsuspecting victims,\" Michael Jabbara, global head of fraud services at Visa, told CBS News.",
      "Here are five of the most common types of scams to watch for this holiday season, according to Visa.",
      "Fake retail websites",
      "Websites that appear authentic but have been constructed for the sole purpose of scamming customers are proliferating, according to Visa. These sites can closely mimic popular companies, duping shoppers into handing over credit card information.",
      "Sometimes they ship shoddy goods to customers, but in other cases, they don't bother sending anything.",
      "Jabbara said it can be difficult to distinguish between legitimate and copycat sites, and that it's wise to do extra research if your gut instinct says something is awry.",
      "\"Scammers do this for a living and are very good at it. You don't want to underestimate them,\" Jabbara said. \"If a consumer has a feeling that a deal is too good to be true, or a website looks fishy, do some validation.\"",
      "That can include looking at online reviews of the site or going directly to the business's site by typing in its URL, versus clicking on a social media site. For example, open a web browser and type in Gap.com, as opposed to clicking a link in a digital ad promoting T-shirts.",
      "Package delivery scams",
      "Scam artists are sending consumers texts claiming there is a \"delivery problem\" with an online order they probably didn't place. Criminals posing as package delivery services like UPS or FedEx tell consumers they must turn over their credit card information to receive a phony delivery.",
      "This type of scam proliferates around the holidays, when consumers make more online purchases and shippers deal with higher-than-normal volumes of packages, Visa notes.",
      "Criminals may sell and trade your personal information on the dark web, or enroll you in recurring billing cycles you never signed up for. Some consumers might not catch these issues if they don't pay close attention to their credit card statements, according to Visa.",
      "\"They input your payment information into a form and monetize it on different channels,\" Jabbara said.",
      "Jabbara advises that consumers never click on links from unknown senders.",
      "Paying for seasonal work",
      "Fake job offers also crop up during the holidays, when many Americans are trying to earn extra cash to cover gift-giving and travel. Scammers take advantage of that financial pressure.",
      "Visa advises job seekers to apply only through a company's official channels and to avoid any role that requires upfront payments.",
      "\"We see 'job offers' that tell workers they have to pay a fee to apply, or for a background check,\" Jabbara said. \"That is a surefire sign of a scam.\"",
      "Consumers should also verify that any company they're applying to is legitimate, he added.",
      "Travel-related fraud",
      "Scammers are also creating fake travel sites and sending phishing emails targeting people with holiday travel plans.",
      "Make sure to make reservations through trusted travel sites, and if a deal appears to be too good to be true, it probably is. Looking at reviews can help determine if a site is legitimate, Jabbara advises.",
      "Charity scams",
      "The year-end giving season also attracts scammers who exploit people's generosity by setting up phony charities.",
      "Fraudsters may build convincing websites or approach people in person with tap-to-donate schemes, Visa said. As with other scams, it's wise to confirm a charity's legitimacy before donating.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 15:10:43 -0500",
    "summary": "The government's latest jobs data could affect whether Federal Reserve officials continue their push to ease borrowing costs.",
    "story": [
      "Just a few weeks ago, a December interest rate cut was viewed as practically a done deal by many economists. Now, with fresh government data showing solid U.S.\u00a0job growth in September, many forecasters think the Federal Reserve is likely to hold off lowering borrowing costs when policy makers meet next month.",
      "The probability of a Federal Reserve rate cut now stands at 22%, down from a likelihood of 97% as of mid-October, according to economists polled by financial data company FactSet. CME Fedwatch, a tool that forecasts rate cuts based on changes in the 30-Day Fed Funds futures prices, gives slightly better odds of a reduction, at about 41%.",
      "Translation: Wall Street economists and traders alike expect the Fed to leave rates unchanged at its next two-day meeting on Dec. 9-10. That would amount to a pause in the central bank's recent move to lower lending rates, coming after two consecutive cuts in September and October.",
      "The shift in expectations for future Fed rate cuts follows a six-week blackout in federal economic data because of the\u00a0government shutdown, a hiatus that hindered the central bank's ability to assess key economic trends. Last month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that a December rate cut wasn't a \"foregone conclusion,\" pointing to signs that the job market remains on firm ground.",
      "The Fed is more likely to lower its benchmark federal funds rate \u2014 or what banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 if officials conclude that the job market and broader economic growth are in danger of stalling. But Thursday's jobs data showed that employers continued to hire at a healthy clip in September.",
      "\"Given that today's numbers were not a bad as feared, in conjunction with hawkish statements from the Fed recently, it does appear that the Fed will skip a cut in December,\" Preston Caldwell, chief U.S. economist at Morningstar, said in an email.",
      "He added, \"But with the negative trend in labor markets remaining in place, we'd expect the Fed to resume cutting in their next meeting in January 2026, if they don't cut this December.\"",
      "The federal funds rate is currently sitting in a range of 3.75% to 4%.",
      "A move by the Fed to dial back rate cuts in 2026 could keep borrowing costs for homes and cars elevated. Pricier mortgages and auto loans are also reinforcing the feeling among many Americans, reflected in sentiment polls, that the cost of living remains too high.",
      "Mixed economic picture",
      "The Federal Reserve's so-called dual mandate requires monetary policymakers to keep both inflation and unemployment in check. The central bank cited the slowing labor market when it twice trimmed borrowing costs this fall.",
      "But the latest payroll gains released Thursday showed that employers hired 119,000 people in September \u2014 more than double what most economists had forecast. The nation's unemployment rate ticked up from 4.3% to 4.4%, the highest level since October of 2021. The increase in the jobless rate suggests more people are re-entering the workforce to search for a job, economists said.",
      "At the same time, inflation has edged up, climbing at an annual rate of 3% in September. That puts pressure on the Fed to keep price increases from spiraling higher, with some policymakers expressing concern over persistent inflation.",
      "The mixed economic picture is complicated by the absence of more recent official data. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said\u00a0this week that it will fold some October jobs data into its November report, which is set for release after the Fed's next meeting, on Dec. 16.",
      "\"September's payroll numbers may have surprised to the upside, but in terms of the Fed's December interest rate decision, October is what mattered,\" Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, said in an email. \"With that data now delayed until after the FOMC meeting, the Fed's rate-cut path has more question marks.\"",
      "She added, \"Overall, the available economic data has supported a December cut, but given the Fed's cautious bent, it may choose to wait until it has more numbers in hand.\"",

      "Employers across the U.S. added 119,000 jobs in September, marking a pickup after previous employment data had shown a slowdown in hiring. The report marks the first official job tally since the\u00a0government shutdown ended last week, ending a six-week blackout on labor data.",
      "The numbers",
      "Economists had forecast payroll gains of 50,000 jobs in September, according to a poll by FactSet.",
      "The unemployment rate rose 4.4% in September, up from 4.3% in August and the highest level since Oct. 2021. With robust job growth in September, that suggests more people are re-entering the workforce to search for a job, economists said.",

      "Although job growth has weakened, \"it is not collapsing,\" added Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.",
      "The hiring numbers will shape Federal Reserve officials' decision on whether to cut interest rates at their next meeting in December. Art Hogan, chief market strategist at investment firm B.

    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 10:22:48 -0500",
    "summary": "Government documents show that federal regulators rarely warn plans that their networks of health providers are so skimpy they violate legal requirements.",
    "story": [
      "Along with the occasional aches and pains, growing older can bring surprise setbacks and serious diseases. Longtime relationships with doctors people trust often make even bad news more tolerable. Losing that support \u2014 especially during a health crisis \u2014 can be terrifying. That's why little-known federal requirements are supposed to protect people with privately run Medicare Advantage coverage when contract disputes lead their health care providers and insurers to part ways.",
      "But government documents obtained by KFF Health News show the agency overseeing Medicare Advantage does little to enforce long-standing rules intended to ensure about 35 million plan members can see doctors in the first place.",
      "In response to a Freedom of Information Act request covering the past decade, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services produced letters it sent to only five insurers from 2016 to 2022 after seven of their plans failed to meet provider network adequacy requirements \u2014 lapses that could, in some cases, harm patient care.",
      "Agency officials said some plans lacked enough primary care clinicians, specialists, or hospitals, according to the letters. And they warned that failure to meet the requirements could result in a freeze on marketing and enrollment, fines, or closure of the plan.",
      "CMS declined to detail why it found so few plans with network violations over the 10 years. \"The number of identified violations reflects the outcomes of targeted reviews, not a comprehensive audit of all plans in all years,\" said Catherine Howden, a CMS spokesperson.",
      "Officials in states with Advantage network violations say CMS didn't notify them, including directors of the government-funded State Health Insurance Assistance Program, which helps people navigate Medicare.",
      "\"It's hard for me to believe that only seven Medicare Advantage plans violated network rules,\" said David Lipschutz, a co-director of the Center for Medicare Advocacy, a nonprofit group. \"We often hear from folks \u2014 particularly in more rural areas \u2014 who have to travel significant distances in order to find contracted providers.\"",
      "Medicare Advantage is an increasingly popular alternative to the government-run Medicare program, which covers adults 65 and older and some people with disabilities. Of the 63 million Americans who were eligible to join Advantage plans instead of traditional Medicare, 54% did so for this year. The plans usually offer lower out-of-pocket costs and extra benefits, like coverage for vision, dental, and hearing care, but typically require their members to stick to select networks of doctors, hospitals, and other providers. Last year, the federal government paid Advantage plans an estimated $494 billion to care for patients.",
      "Traditional Medicare, by comparison, has no network and is accepted by nearly all doctors and hospitals in the nation.",
      "Conflicts between Medicare Advantage plans and the doctors, hospitals, and other providers that serve their members are common. Just this year, at least 38 hospital systems serving all or parts of 23 states have cut ties with at least 11 Advantage plans after failing to agree on payment and other issues, according to a review of news releases and press reports. Over the past three years, separations between Advantage plans and health systems have increased 66%, said FTI Consulting, which tracks reports of the disputes.",
      "After March, Medicare Advantage beneficiaries are generally locked into their plans for the year until the annual open enrollment period happening now through Dec. 7, for coverage beginning Jan. 1. But hospitals, doctors, pharmacies, and other health providers can leave plans anytime.",
      "When providers and insurers separate, Advantage members can lose access to longtime doctors or preferred hospitals in the middle of the year. In response, CMS sometimes gives Advantage customers a little-known escape hatch called a \"special enrollment period\" to change plans or enroll in traditional Medicare midyear.",
      "How CMS decides who gets an SEP is a mystery even to well-versed state insurance regulators and U.S. senators who oversee federal health programs. Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, the senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, and Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) cited previous KFF Health News reporting on Medicare Advantage in an Oct. 30 letter asking CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz for an explanation.",
      "\"Despite the serious impacts of SEPs on enrollees and the market, the process of SEP determinations is opaque, leaving enrollees and state regulators in the dark,\" they wrote.",
      "\"Seniors deserve to know their Medicare plan isn't going to pull the rug out from under them halfway through the year,\" Wyden told KFF Health News.",
      "\"Help us\"",
      "Oz spoke to Medicare Advantage insurers Oct. 15 at a conference organized by the Better Medicare Alliance, a trade group, and encouraged them to help CMS police fraud in the program.",
      "\"Be our early-warning system,\" he told them. \"Tell us about problems you're witnessing. Help us figure out better ways of addressing it.\"",
      "When he finished speaking, he took a seat in the audience next to the president and chief executive of the group, Mary Beth Donahue, and smiled for photos.",
      "In six letters KFF Health News obtained, CMS officials told five insurers that their network adequacy violations could affect Advantage members' access to care. Five letters listed the number or types of medical specialists or facilities missing from the networks. In three cases, CMS noted that plans could request exceptions to the rules but didn't. In one letter, CMS requested the plan allow members to receive out-of-network care at no additional cost. Four letters required specific steps to address deficiencies, including submitting evidence that more clinicians were added to networks.",
      "Three letters required a \"corrective action plan,\" set deadlines for fixing problems, and warned that failure to comply with the rules could result in enrollment and marketing suspensions, fines, or forced plan closure. The other three letters were a \"notice of non-compliance,\" which urged insurers to comply with legal requirements.",
      "Although CMS regards the letters as the first step in its enforcement process, the agency did not provide information about whether these violations were resolved or if they resulted in penalties.",
      "The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, a group created by Congress to monitor the program, said in a June 2024 report that \"CMS has the authority to impose intermediate sanctions or civil monetary penalties for noncompliance with network adequacy standards, but it has never done so.\"",
      "One of the network adequacy violation letters went to Vitality Health Plan of California in November 2020. That came after five hospitals and 13 nursing homes in one county and four hospitals in another all left the insurer's network, according to the letter from Timothy Roe, then-director of CMS' Division of Compliance, Surveillance, and Marketing. Two months before sending its letter, CMS granted Vitality plan members a special enrollment period.",
      "Beneficiaries welcomed the opportunity, said Marcelo Espiritu, program manager of the Santa Clara County office of California's Health Insurance Counseling & Advocacy Program. But Espiritu didn't know at the time that Vitality's depleted network violated CMS requirements, which Roe said put \"the health of Vitality's beneficiaries at risk.\"",
      "\"By not having enough network providers, beneficiaries may not be able to receive necessary services timely, or at all,\" Roe wrote.",
      "That's information patients need to know, Espiritu said.",
      "\"People would not be able to receive promised benefits and there would be delays in care and a lot of frustration in trying to find a new plan,\" he said. \"We would certainly warn people about the plan and remove it from our materials.\"",
      "Representatives from Commonwealth Care Alliance, which acquired Vitality in 2022, did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Network minimums",
      "Federal law requires Medicare Advantage plans to include in their networks a minimum of 29 types of health care providers and 14 kinds of facilities that members can access within certain distances and travel times. The rules, which vary depending on a county's population and density, also limit how long patients should wait for appointments. The agency checks compliance every three years, or more often if it receives complaints.",
      "Networks can vary widely even within a county because the provider minimums apply to the insurer, not each plan it sells, according to a report from KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. The company can offer the same network to members of multiple plans in one or more counties or create a separate network for each plan.",
      "In Arizona's Maricopa County, KFF researchers found, UnitedHealthcare offered 12 plans with 12 different networks in 2022. Depending on the plan, the company's customers had access to 37% to 61% of the physicians in the area available to traditional Medicare enrollees.",
      "In early 2016, CMS allowed 900 people in an Advantage plan in Illinois run by Harmony, then a WellCare subsidiary, to leave after the Christie Clinic, a large medical practice, left its provider network. The WellCare plan continued to operate without the clinic. But in June 2016, CMS told the plan in one of the letters KFF Health News obtained that losing the Christie Clinic meant the remaining provider network violated federal requirements.",
      "It was \"a significant network change with substantial enrollee impact,\" the letter said.",
      "Claudia Lennhoff, executive director at Champaign County Health Care Consumers, a government-funded Medicare counseling service that helped the WellCare members, said her group didn't know about the letter at the time.",
      "\"Not disclosing such information is a violation of trust,\" Lennhoff said. \"It could lead someone to make a decision that will be harmful to them, or that they will deeply regret.\"",
      "Centene Corp. bought WellCare in 2020, and representatives for the St. Louis-based company declined to comment on events that occurred before the acquisition.",
      "Two violation letters KFF Health News obtained from CMS went to Provider Partners Health Plan of Ohio in 2019 and 2022. The Ohio Department of Insurance was unaware of the violations, spokesperson Todd Walker said. He said CMS also did not notify the Ohio Senior Health Insurance Information Program, the state's free counseling service.",
      "Rick Grindrod, CEO and president of Provider Partners Health Plans, which is based in Maryland, said that after CMS reviewed its 2019 network, \"we proactively reduced our service area and deferred enrollment in the plan until 2021.\"",
      "But Grindrod said the plan enrolled only a small number of members in one county in 2021 and decided to withdraw from the Ohio market entirely at the end of that year.",
      "After Provider Partners withdrew from Ohio, CMS sent it another letter in March 2022 saying its network in 2021 had gaps in four counties for four types of providers and facilities. CMS asked the plan to comply with network rules by adding more providers.",
      "\"We believe CMS' network adequacy standards are generally clear and appropriate for ensuring beneficiary access,\" Grindrod said. \"While the standards are not difficult to understand, as a provider-sponsored plan with a small footprint, we sometimes face challenges securing contracts with large systems that prioritize larger Medicare Advantage plans.\"",
      "In 2021, CMS also sent a violation letter to North Carolina's Liberty Advantage. CMS didn't tell the state's free counseling service, the Seniors' Health Insurance Information Program, about the letter, said its director, Melinda Munden.",
      "Liberty representatives did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "CMS sent a letter in 2016 to CareSource about network deficiencies in some of its Medicare Advantage plans sold in Kentucky and Indiana. The agency asked the company to fix the problems, including by reimbursing any members billed for services from doctors who were not in the plans' networks.",
      "\"In response to the 2016 violations, we promptly implemented a Corrective Action Plan, which included a thorough review of our provider network to ensure adequacy standards were met,\" said Vicki McDonald, a CareSource spokesperson. \"CMS approved our plan, and no further action was required.\"",
      "KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF \u2014 the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.",

      "Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said Wednesday he is resigning from the board of OpenAI and leaving a number of other roles after last week's release of emails between him and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "\"In line with my announcement to step away from my public commitments, I have also decided to resign from the board of OpenAI,\" Summers said in a statement.",
      "\"I am grateful for the opportunity to have served, excited about the potential of the company and look forward to following their progress,\" he said.",
      "On Wednesday night, Summers went on leave from teaching at Harvard University, with his spokesperson, Steven Goldberg, saying in a statement: \"Mr. Summers has decided it's in the best interest of the Center for him to go on leave from his role as Director as Harvard undertakes its review. His co-teachers will complete the remaining three class sessions of the courses he has been teaching with them this semester, and he is not scheduled to teach next semester.\" A Harvard spokesperson said Summers \"communicated his decision\" to the university.",
      "Summers said earlier this week that he will be stepping back from \"public commitments\" after dozens of messages between him and Epstein were included in a trove of documents from Epstein's estate that was released by the House Oversight Committee last week.",

      "Summers joined the OpenAI board in 2023.",
      "The emails showed Summers and Epstein communicated regularly during the last years of Epstein's life, even as the accused sex trafficker's public infamy and notoriety grew. Many of the messages were from the late 2010s, well after Epstein pleaded guilty to prostitution charges in Florida, but before he was charged with sex trafficking in federal court and taken into custody in July 2019.",
      "The exchanges between Summers and Epstein include one in which they appeared to banter about a woman Summers knew in London, with Epstein seeming to offer him advice.",
      "There is no evidence of illegal conduct on the part of Summers.",
      "Summers, who served as Treasury Secretary in the Clinton administration, was a key economic adviser in the Obama administration. The former president of Harvard University, Summers was teaching two classes at the school.",
      "In a statement on Wednesday, Harvard said it is \"conducting a review of information concerning individuals at Harvard included in the newly released Jeffrey Epstein documents to evaluate what actions may be warranted.\"",
      "On Tuesday, both the House and Senate voted overwhelmingly to require the Justice Department to release its files related to Epstein, sending the bill to President Trump's desk. Mr. Trump called on the Justice Department last week to investigate Epstein's relationships with Summers, former President Bill Clinton and other high-profile Democrats.",

      "Impending layoff notices across much of the U.S. surged in October, highlighting signs of stress in the job market.",
      "Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland shows that 39,006 Americans last month in 21 states received a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, or WARN, notice informing them of an upcoming layoff. U.S. labor law requires employers to provide these written warnings 60 days ahead of plant closings or mass layoffs.",
      "It represents one of the highest numbers of WARN notices since Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland researchers started tracking the data in January 2006, although the tally remains below the spikes recorded during the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 pandemic.",

The record-long\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0has also delayed two months' worth of federal jobs data, creating a blind spot in assessing U.S. employment conditions.",
      "Despite the lack of official government data, some other measures point to a cooling U.S. labor market. For example, outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas recently said that layoffs last month\u00a0soared to their highest October level in 22 years, while\u00a0ADP data\u00a0released Tuesday shows U.S. companies shed an average of 2,500 jobs per week in the four weeks ending Nov. 1.",
      "Some experts warn that the latest layoffs may be only an early sign of broader cutbacks yet to come.

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Monday said it would end yet another Temporary Protected Status immigration program, this time for nearly 4,000 immigrants from Myanmar, a country in Southeast Asia engulfed in civil war over the past several years.",
      "The announcement is the latest move by President Trump's administration to curtail humanitarian immigration programs, which it has argued have been exploited by bad actors and extended for too long, despite the intended temporary nature of the TPS policy. The administration has also said TPS encourages illegal immigration, since some of those who've benefited from the policy entered the U.S. illegally.",
      "As part of its immigration crackdown, the Trump administration has moved to revoke TPS protections for hundreds of thousands of migrants from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Syria, Sudan and Venezuela, making many of them eligible for arrest and deportation. Pro-immigrant advocates have called the campaign the largest de-documentation effort in modern U.S. history.",
      "Created by Congress in 1990, TPS has allowed Democratic and Republican administrations to offer temporary work permits and deportation protections to immigrants from countries facing armed conflict, an environmental disaster or another emergency that makes their return unsafe. The program was greatly expanded under former President Joe Biden.",
      "Since 2021, when the country's military staged a coup, Myanmar has been plagued by armed conflict and political instability. Armed militias scattered throughout the country have fought the country's military, which has a long history of persecuting minority groups, including members of the Rohingya Muslim community. The United Nations said earlier this year that the military had killed roughly 6,500 civilians as of March and that the violence had displaced more than 3.5 million people.",
      "While it acknowledged that Myanmar \"continues to face humanitarian challenges,\" the Department of Homeland Security argued in an official notice that ending the country's TPS program was warranted because there have been \"improvements\" in \"governance and stability\" there.",
      "The DHS notice, signed by Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, also said that continuing the TPS policy for Myanmar was at odds with national U.S. interests. The department cited concerns about the ability to properly vet people from Myanmar and the risk of them overstaying their visas, and said a number of TPS holders from that country were subject to national security or immigration fraud investigations.",
      "Federal government figures indicate there are currently 3,969 people enrolled in the Myanmar TPS program. Unless a court intervenes, the program will expire in late January.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-vaccine-safety-aluminum-ingredients/",
    "published": "Mon, 24 Nov 2025 05:00:05 -0500",
    "summary": "HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claims that the aluminum ingredients in vaccines cause a variety of harmful reactions, from allergies to autism. Scientists say that's wrong and warn of risks if they're removed.",
    "story": [
      "As the federal government prepares for the next meeting of its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has intensified his attacks on aluminum vaccine components used in many shots to boost the body's immune response.",
      "Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist before seeking public office, claims that aluminum adjuvants are neurotoxic and tied to autism, asthma, autoimmune disease, and food allergies.",
      "But science and medicine advances a different view. Strong recommendations that parents introduce peanut-containing foods to infants early, for instance, have led to a drop in the incidence rate of peanut allergies.",
      "Since taking office, Kennedy has ordered reviews of vaccine ingredients, citing aluminum as a top concern. A discussion of \"adjuvants and contaminants\" is on the vaccine advisory panel's draft agenda.",
      "A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0webpage that for years has assured the public vaccines do not cause autism was updated Nov. 19 with new language stating that studies have not definitively ruled out a link between vaccines and autism.",
      "He has also targeted scientists who have published studies showing aluminum adjuvants are safe. In August, Kennedy denounced a large Danish study finding no link between aluminum in vaccines and childhood disease, calling it a \"deceitful propaganda stunt\" and demanding its retraction. The Annals of Internal Medicine rejected the claim and refused to retract the study.",
      "And, regarding the upcoming advisory panel meeting, HHS spokesperson Emily HIlliard said ACIP \"is independently reviewing the full body of evidence on adjuvants and other vaccine components to ensure the highest safety standards.\"",
      "The stakes are high because Kennedy's push to cast doubt on aluminum isn't just about the ingredient itself. It's part of a broader strategy to foster uncertainty about vaccine safety and lay the groundwork to challenge the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, which drug manufacturers say is essential to ensure a stable market for shots.",
      "But researchers across infectious diseases, immunology, pediatrics, and epidemiology say the data is clear: Aluminum adjuvants are safe.",
      "\"Aluminum is the third most common element on the Earth's surface,\" said Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrician and director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. \"So we're all exposed to aluminum all the time. The water that we drink has aluminum in it. The food that we eat has aluminum in it.\"",
      "Vaccines add only a tiny amount of aluminum to the body \u2014 a combined total of about 8 milligrams \u2014 after the schedule of childhood vaccines is complete. Offit said that over the first 18 years of life, people naturally take in about 400 milligrams of aluminum from everyday sources.",
      "\"I don't know why there is so much concern,\" said Dr. Rajesh Gupta, a former FDA vaccine scientist. \"Aluminum gets distributed in the body everywhere. It is ultimately excreted by the kidneys in the urine. So, it is not that aluminum stays in the body.\"",
      "How they work",
      "The aluminum in vaccines isn't foil or metal. It's a compound of aluminum salts, such as aluminum hydroxide or aluminum phosphate, that help the vaccine work better.",
      "It's a bit like zinc in cold tablets: Patients don't swallow chunks of metal, instead ingesting a zinc salt that dissolves safely in the body.",
      "In vaccines, these aluminum salts give the immune system an extra nudge so it learns to recognize the target germ more effectively.",
      "When injected, the vaccine stays near the injection site and causes mild, short-lived inflammation that summons immune cells. Those cells pick up the vaccine antigen, a harmless piece of a virus or bacterium, and carry it to nearby lymph nodes. There, the adjuvants show it around like a wanted poster so the body can identify and destroy the germ quickly.",
      "Dr. Harm HogenEsch, a professor of immunopathology at the Purdue University College of Veterinary Medicine, said that aluminum adjuvants work only when they're injected in the same spot as the vaccine ingredient they're meant to boost, to help nearby immune cells learn to recognize the germ. If the two shots are given in different places, he said, \"you don't see that effect.\"",
      "In response to Kennedy's claims, scientists say that anything that acts as an adjuvant can, in principle, also boost an allergic response. But that doesn't mean aluminum-adjuvanted vaccines are turning children into food-allergic time bombs. Antigens in vaccines such as the hepatitis B surface antigen or HPV proteins are not allergens, and no food proteins are put into vaccines.",
      "Animal experiments",
      "Animal studies form the basis of Kennedy's claim that aluminum adjuvants in vaccines can create allergies. In these experiments, scientists deliberately sensitize rats or mice by injecting them with a food protein mixed with aluminum. The aluminum strengthens the immune response, but it does not cause an allergy by itself.",
      "\"That's the basis for a lot of the experimental mouse models, where you inject a food allergen with an aluminum adjuvant to sensitize the mice,\" HogenEsch said. \"I'm not aware of any food antigen being included in vaccines, and so I don't really see a way by which this could happen.\"",
      "Dr. Ross Kedl, a professor of immunology and microbiology at the University of Colorado Anschutz School of Medicine, went further, noting that there is no plausible route for vaccines to create a peanut allergy out of thin air. \"Someone would have had to mix peanut proteins in with the actual vaccine prior to injection.\"",
      "Dr. Stefan H. E. Kaufmann, director emeritus at the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology in Berlin, said results from mice often don't match what happens in people, because \"mice are much easier to push into allergic reactions than humans.\" In other words, what looks dramatic in a rodent study doesn't automatically apply to human immune systems.",
      "And in this case, it's \"important to distinguish between how aluminum behaves in lab animals versus people,\" Kaufmann said.",
      "Human studies",
      "Beyond animal models and theoretical scenarios, scientists have looked hard for signals of harm in large human datasets.",
      "In 2023, a study by the Vaccine Safety Datalink, a collaboration coordinated by the CDC, reported a slight increase in asthma among children with higher aluminum exposure before age 2, but the association disappeared in further analyses.",
      "\"That paper was roundly criticized,\" Offit said. \"When they controlled for breastfeeding, the association between asthma and receipt of aluminum-adjuvant-containing vaccines disappeared.\"",
      "\"It should have never been published,\" he said.",
      "Dr. Kathy Edwards, professor emerita of pediatrics at Vanderbilt University, said that false signals are common when large databases are mined for dozens of outcomes.",
      "\"When you look at a hundred different things, just by the law of percentages, some of those may look like there is a signal,\" she said. \"The whole RFK Jr. assessment is really prone to cherry-picking,\" she said, adding that \"there does need to be some kind of basic understanding of statistics for people to interpret this.\"",
      "Soon after the 2023 U.S. findings drew attention, scientists at the CDC contacted Dr. Anders Hviid, head of epidemiology research at the Statens Serum Institut in Copenhagen, Denmark, to see whether his team could replicate the work.",
      "\"It makes perfect sense to try to replicate findings of any kind in different data sources,\" Hviid said.",
      "Hviid's nationwide Danish study followed 1.2 million children over two decades, using linked national health registries that record every vaccination and diagnosis.",
      "\"Our health care system is quite egalitarian. It's free, and there's universal access. And everyone is in these nationwide registers,\" he said. Their findings: no increased risk of these conditions associated with increasing amounts of aluminum received through the vaccines.",
      "Rare bumps",
      "Doctors have documented one genuine reaction to aluminum adjuvants: itchy nodules at the injection site, called \"pruritic granulomas.\" These small bumps are so rare that most allergists and pediatricians will never see a single case.",
      "This reaction \"doesn't lead to something bad, and it really isn't associated with anything other than that local irritation,\" Edwards said.",
      "Researchers believe these bumps represent a localized immune response \u2014 meaning only in the area of the injection, not a body-wide allergy \u2014 that is very different from the kind of immediate allergic reaction people treat with antihistamines. These include the reactions driven by food or beestings, when histamine, the body's own alarm signal, floods the system within minutes and causes hives, swelling, or breathing trouble. Kedl said that distinction often gets lost in public debate.",
      "Eliminating aluminum adjuvants",
      "For many experts, the real issue is not just whether aluminum is safe but what happens to the entire vaccine program if aluminum adjuvants are stripped out. For many modern vaccines that rely on a single purified protein \u2014 such as those for diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, hepatitis B, and HPV \u2014 adjuvants are crucial.",
      "Edwards said that simply swapping in a different adjuvant isn't realistic.",
      "\"They're kind of all built on one another,\" she said. Once a vaccine has been proved to work and become the standard of care, new or updated versions are generally no longer tested against a placebo in people who should be getting that vaccine. Instead, they're tested against the existing product, which means each approval rests on the one before it.",
      "Core childhood vaccines would probably have to be reformulated, and large clinical trials would have to be repeated to prove the new products are safe and effective. Meanwhile, production gaps and shortages would have to be managed, potentially for years, while manufacturers and regulators start over \u2014 all while diseases such as whooping cough, hepatitis B, and HPV-related cancers gain more room to spread.",
      "\"The aluminum adjuvants have sort of hit the sweet spot in terms of being effective at inducing a robust antibody response that is protective for those vaccines in which they're being used and being very safe,\" HogenEsch said. \"It would be quite frankly foolish to try to eliminate them.\"",
      "A century of safe use",
      "The DTaP, hepatitis B, and HPV vaccines all contain aluminum adjuvants and have been in use for nearly a century. Large-scale studies show no link between aluminum and systemic allergic disease.",
      "\"We have had aluminum adjuvants in vaccines for decades,\" Edwards said. \"I have grandchildren. My grandchildren have received all of their vaccines. And I do not worry about the safety of them.\"",
      "If aluminum is falsely cast as the villain and vaccine uptake falls, experts warn, the consequences will not be theoretical: more measles in schools, more meningitis in college dorms, and more young adults dying of cancers that HPV shots could have prevented.",
      "In their view, the real danger isn't the trace amounts of a metal that children already encounter every day. It's rolling back the protection aluminum-adjuvanted vaccines have provided for generations.",
      "That's the trade-off Offit hopes parents will see. \"A choice not to get a vaccine is not a risk-free choice,\" he said. \"It's just a choice to take a different risk.\"",
      "KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF \u2014 the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.",

      "The 35-year-old journalist published an essay in the New Yorker magazine, writing that 10 minutes after she gave birth to her second child, a baby girl, in May 2024, doctors noticed her white-blood-cell count \"looked strange.\"",
      "She wrote in the magazine that she was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, with a rare mutation called Inversion 3, shortly afterward. Schlossberg, who has been married to Dr. George Moran since 2017, wrote that she couldn't believe this was happening.",
      "\"I did not\u2014could not\u2014believe that they were talking about me,\" she wrote. \"I had swum a mile in the pool the day before, nine months pregnant. I wasn't sick. I didn't feel sick. I was actually one of the healthiest people I knew.\"",
      "\"I had a son whom I loved more than anything and a newborn I need to take care of,\" she wrote.",
      "Schlossberg described grueling rounds of treatment including chemotherapy, several clinical trials and two bone marrow transplants, but the cancer recurred, and her doctor told her he could keep her \"alive for a year, maybe.\"",
      "Another tragedy hits the Kennedy family",
      "The second of Caroline Kennedy and Edwin Schlossberg's three children, Schlossberg said she received care at Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York City. She wrote searingly in her essay of the guilt she felt over another tragedy hitting the famous Kennedy family.",
      "\"For my whole life, I have tried to be good, to be a good student and a good sister and a good daughter, and to protect my mother and never make her upset or angry. Now I have added a new tragedy to her life, to our family's life and there's nothing I can do to stop it,\" she wrote.",
      "Caroline Kennedy, who served\u00a0as the U.S. ambassador to Australia and Japan, lost her father, President John F. Kennedy, when he was assassinated\u00a0on Nov. 22, 1963, by Lee Harvey Oswald \u2014 the same day, 62 years later, her daughter published her essay announcing her cancer diagnosis.

      "Caroline Kennedy's mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis,\u00a0died in 1994 at age 64 following a diagnosis of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Her brother, John F. Kennedy Jr.,\u00a0died in a plane crash\u00a0off the coast of Massachusetts in 1999.",
      "Kennedy's cousin, Maria Shriver, urged people on social media\u00a0on Saturday to read Schlossberg's story to see what \"a beautiful writer, journalist, wife, mother, daughter, sister, and friend\" has been going through for the last year and a half. Shriver said to let the story \"be a reminder to be grateful for the life you are living today, right now, this very minute.\"",
      "Collecting memories",
      "Schlossberg spends a portion of her essay writing about her family's dismay regarding the\u00a0nomination and confirmation\u00a0of her cousin Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as secretary of Health and Human Services. She spoke about how he cut nearly half a billion dollars for research into mRNA vaccines and slashed funding from the National Institutes of Health. She wrote that hundreds of National Institute of Health grants and clinical trials were canceled.",
      "She wrote that she worries millions of women might not get the care they deserve after she was given a dose of misoprostol to stop her postpartum hemorrhage. Because the drug can also be used as part of medication abortion, it is currently under review at the Food and Drug Administration, she wrote, due to her cousin's urging.",

      "Among the potential avenues discussed regarding operations for Venezuela was dropping U.S. leaflets on Caracas as a kind of psychological warfare to pressure Maduro, multiple U.S. officials familiar with the talks told CBS News.",
      "The operation, which was not yet authorized, could possibly take place Sunday, the officials said, which is Maduro's 63rd birthday.",
      "The Washington Post was first to report on the proposed leaflet operation.",
      "Over the past few months, the U.S. has ratcheted up the pressure on Maduro in multiple ways, including an extensive military buildup in the region,\u00a0live fire exercises, and strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific.",
      "When asked Monday, President Trump said he wouldn't rule out sending U.S. troops into Venezuela.",
      "\"No, I don't rule out that,\" the president said. \"I don't rule out anything. We just have to take care of Venezuela.\"",
      "For his part, Maduro on the same day\u00a0said\u00a0he would be open to \"face-to-face\" discussions with Mr. Trump.",
      "Last month, Mr. Trump\u00a0also confirmed\u00a0that he has authorized the CIA to go into Venezuela and conduct covert operations.",
      "The Pentagon has conducted\u00a0at least 21 strikes\u00a0since early September, killing at least 80 people. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has said the strikes are designed to target cartels and drug traffickers, although\u00a0it has not provided evidence\u00a0that the vessels struck so far were carrying drugs.",
      "There are currently about 15,000 U.S. troops in the region. A Navy official told CBS News last week that the U.S. had four military ships in the western Atlantic, including the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world's most advanced aircraft carrier, and three guided missile destroyers. It had another seven military ships in the Caribbean, the official said, which included two guided missile destroyers, two guided missile cruisers, an amphibious assault ship and two amphibious transport dock ships.",
      "There are also several dozen U.S. fighter jets\u00a0stationed in Puerto Rico.",
      "Maduro, who has led Venezuela since 2013, faced an international outcry when he declared victory in Venezuela's presidential elections in July 2024\u00a0despite results showing\u00a0he had lost by a large margin to the opposition candidate.",
      "The U.S. is one of several nations that does not recognize him as Venezuela's president. The Trump administration has accused him of operating a cartel that funnels drugs into the U.S., and has offered\u00a0a $50 million reward\u00a0for information leading to his arrest.",

    "summary": "Amid a wave of departures from the Justice Department, some of its former officials are curating a public online display of the farewell messages of ousted employees.",
    "story": [
      "One letter said, \"It became clear that it was time for me to go.\"",
      "Another read, \"I cannot continue to serve in such a hostile and toxic work environment.\"",
      "Amid a growing wave of firings, resignations and retirements from the Justice Department, some former agency officials are curating a public online display of the farewell messages of ousted employees. Some of the letters from purged non-political career Justice Department attorneys warn of a threat to democracy and a crumbling of the norms and standards in federal prosecutions.",
      "Justice Connection, a group of former Justice Department employees, has organized and posted the online page of goodbye messages. The organization's executive director and founder, Stacey Young, a former civil division attorney for the Justice Department, said the Justice Department purge has now eclipsed 5,000 employees since January, including resignations, firings and retirements.",
      "Some of those ousted have included high-profile department leaders, who wrote farewell messages expressing their fears about the trajectory of the Justice Department as agency employees have been purged.",
      "\"These messages are from people who are trying to encapsulate the thought of losing their careers,\" said Peter Carr, a longtime Justice Department public affairs specialist who was fired earlier this year. Carr, now a spokesperson for Justice Connection, told CBS News, \"Somebody needed to capture all of these letters, so that they're not lost to history.\"",
      "\"These messages show what is happening in our country at this moment,\" he said.",
      "One of the messages posted was written by Maurene Comey, a former New York-based federal prosecutor, who is the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey and previously handled part of the criminal case against convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. When she was fired this year, Maureen Comey wrote, \"If a career prosecutor can be fired without reason, fear may seep into the decisions of those who remain. . . . Do not let that happen.\"",
      "\"Fear is the tool of a tyrant, wielded to suppress independent thought,\" she continued. \"Instead of fear, let this moment fuel the fire that already burns at the heart of this place.\"",
      "Maureen Comey sued the Trump administration in September, saying her ouster was unlawful and unconstitutional.",
      "Hagan Scotten, who resigned from the office of the U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York after Justice Department leaders intervened to drop the office's criminal prosecution of New York City Mayor Eric Adams, left a blistering farewell letter to teammates.",
      "\"If no lawyer within earshot of the President is willing to give him that advice, then I expect you will eventually find someone who is enough of a fool, or enough of a coward, to file your motion, Scotten wrote. \"But it was never going to be me.\"",
      "Patty Hartman, who was fired in April from her communications position in the U.S. Attorney's Office for Washington, D.C., told CBS News she especially wanted to share a goodbye message with her team, because her firing was unexpected, abrupt and resulted in immediately losing access to her government-issued phone and computer.",
      "\"The people in charge who are supposed to protect us\u2014 our fellow Americans who we elected, along with those who were appointed, and swore an OATH to protect this nation and our Constitution \u2014 now use the Constitution as a weapon to suit their own ends,\" Hartman's farewell message said.",
      "\"When someone disappears from the office without notice, there's a tendency to think they did something wrong,\" Hartman told CBS News. \"It was important for me to publicly acknowledge my illegal termination because so many others were experiencing it and, quite frankly, I was pissed off.\"",
      "The Justice Department declined a request to comment to CBS News about the firings, resignations or the online farewell messages.",
      "Michael Romano, a prosecutor who handled some Jan. 6 prosecutions, noted his work on Capitol insurrection cases when he resigned in March.",
      "\"Many rioters saw their relationship with the rule of law as transactional, as they demonstrated when they told police officers that they had 'backed the blue' in the past and thus, that the officers should stand down or join the mob . . . .,\" he wrote in his message. \"They expected, in other words,\u00a0 that the rule of law did not apply to them. And, but for the work of the Capitol Siege Section, they would have been right.\"",
      "Romano told CBS News, \"It was important to have my colleagues see me standing up for the work we did. I needed to say it and people needed to hear it.\"",
      "Meredith Burrell, a former civil rights office attorney, wrote in her message, \"We were entrusted with the serious responsibility of engaging the power of the federal government to use the rule of law to vindicate the rights of marginalized people . . .\u00a0 I am still processing the contrast between those 25 years and the last four months.\"",
      "Other farewell messages are limited to praise of colleagues and law enforcement. Greg Rosen, who resigned in May after serving as the head of the unit that prosecuted Capitol riot cases, wrote in his message, \"To those who partnered with me on the January 6 investigation and prosecution: you represent the highest ideals of our nation\u2014unwavering in your commitment to the rule of law and the peaceful transfer of power. To the officers who were injured, physically and emotionally, protecting the greatest legislative body in the world: thank you. You are the embodiment of heroism.\"",
      "Sybil Barksdale, a former official in the agency's Office of Violence against Women, wrote in her message, \"Throughout my career, through changing administrations, evolving legal landscapes, and countless initiatives, I had the privilege of working alongside exceptional colleagues who shared an unwavering dedication to justice and protecting those most vulnerable.\"",
      "A resigned FBI analyst wrote, \"If I learned anything in the FBI, it is that yes, you can say no. If something is wrong, unjust, or unethical, you speak up, and sometimes speaking up means saying 'no.'\"",

    "summary": "The proposed trip is part of President Trump's push to get an agreement on Ukraine by Thanksgiving, U.S. and Ukrainian officials said.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. and Ukrainian officials are discussing the potential of bringing President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the U.S. this week as part of President Trump's push to get an agreement on Ukraine by Thanksgiving, according to multiple U.S. and Ukrainian officials familiar with the discussions.",
      "Whether Zelenskyy's trip happens is dependent on the outcome of peace negotiations in Geneva on Sunday, the officials said. Mr. Trump himself has described the deadline as flexible, and he told reporters on Saturday the plan was \"not my final\" proposal.",
      "Speaking from Geneva, Secretary of State Marco Rubio touted progress in discussions with a cadre of European and Ukrainian officials, but said more work would need to be done.",
      "\"I think this was a very, very meaningful \u2013 I would say probably best \u2013 meeting and day we've had so far in this entire process, going back to when we first came into office in January,\" he said. \"But there's still some work left to do and that's what our teams are going to be doing right now,\" Rubio added, promising updates after additional meetings.",
      "\"We have very good progress and we are moving forward to the just and lasting peace,\" said Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyy's chief of staff, after meeting with Rubio.",
      "There are no hard plans for a Zelenskyy visit at this moment given the active diplomacy nor are there scheduled talks with or in Russia at this point, according to a senior White House official. Another possible outcome of the negotiations in Geneva is that Army Secretary Dan Driscoll could travel to Russia or meet with Russian officials elsewhere, according to another U.S. official. Russian officials told CBS News that nothing yet is scheduled.",
      "Ukraine's response to the 28-point memo",
      "Ukraine's Ambassador to the U.S., Olga Stefanishyna, told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that her country had not agreed to all the terms in the draft 28-point peace plan that leaked to the press last week.",
      "\"This plan is not about justice and the truth of this war and the aggression,\" Stefanishyna said. \"It's about, you know, ending the war and stopping the military engagement.\"",
      "Stefanishyna said that Russia has not made any concessions to date and that none of the points in the leaked 28-point plan are related to forcing anything on the Russian side.",
      "In addition to the proposal, an early draft of which was leaked by an opposition politician in Ukraine and verified by the White House, there is an accompanying document related to security guarantees, according to U.S. and Ukrainian officials.",
      "Stefanishyna also confirmed that there is an additional document to the 28 points and referred to it as \"the framework of security assurances.\" She said it states the intention of the U.S. to provide something along the lines of Article 5 of the Washington NATO Treaty, such as a defense promise. However, unlike that NATO guarantee, the security assurances do not have a detailed layout of security guarantees nor the weight of Congressional approval and backing that would come with a treaty. That is a challenge for Ukraine, Stefanishyna said, in part because of past failures by the West to live up to security assurances given when Ukraine handed over its nuclear weapons as part of the 1994 Budapest memorandum.",
      "Why now?",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News that Russian President Vladimir Putin seems to believe that he will take the Donetsk region of Ukraine one way or the other \u2013 either through a negotiated settlement or on the battlefield. The Trump administration's negotiations in Geneva began from the premise that Putin is correct. While that same U.S. official declined to provide a U.S. assessment of whether Ukraine is losing the war in the East, the U.S. official",
      "said that the trajectory of the fighting points to Russia taking Donetsk. The official indicated that the Russian progress in the eastern frontline city of Pokrovsk, which is a logistics hub for Ukraine, was not a positive sign for Kyiv's defensive prospects. Russian media often refers to Pokrovsk as the \"gateway\" to Ukraine's industrial Donbas region.",
      "Inter-Trump administration confusion",
      "There were separate but parallel diplomatic efforts on Ukraine taking place within the Trump administration that are now being merged.",
      "Mr. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and U.S. special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff have been working on what they refer to as a \"term sheet\" to end the war, mimicking their broad-strokes proposal for a Gaza ceasefire. While the Trump administration put sanctions on Russian oil and gas to bring Putin to the negotiating table, Putin advisor Kirill Dmitriev was already at a table in Miami talking to Witkoff at the end of last month.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent at the time dismissed Dmitriev as a \"Russian propagandist,\" but it was Dmitriev who helped draft this 28-point proposal that the U.S. is now backing. A senior White House official told CBS News that Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio were kept \"apprised\" of those talks, which happened in Miami last month. At a time when Zelenskyy is facing a domestic political scandal at home, the Kushner-Witkoff term sheet leaked to the press via an opposition politician in Ukraine and through an interview Dmitriev did with Axios.",
      "On Saturday, a number of senators, including Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations committee, as well as Republican Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota and independent Sen. Angus King of Maine, said that Rubio had explained to them that the 28-point proposal was not of American origin and assured them that he personally had not heard of any threat to cut off U.S. military and intelligence sharing with Ukraine if it did not agree to terms. Rubio posted Saturday on social media that the \"plan was authored by the U.S.\"",
      "However, a Ukrainian official and a U.S. official told CBS News that the threat had been made during talks with other senior U.S. officials in Kyiv. Driscoll, a close friend of Vance's, led a delegation there last week. He's now in Geneva as part of talks.",
      "A senior White House official acknowledged to CBS News that the threat to cut off aid to Ukraine may have been implied but not explicitly stated during talks with Ukraine's leadership when U.S. officials said that Mr. Trump is getting \"weary and frustrated\" and cannot keep doing this forever.",
      "The same senior White House official told CBS News that Vance and Rubio held a call Saturday night with Driscoll and U.S. military leadership in order to answer questions from lawmakers. Rubio made additional phone calls to lawmakers, which Shaheen, King and Rounds detailed",
      "\"There are many problems with the plan as it has been reported, but the two most obvious are that it rewards Russia's illegal and unprovoked aggression by handing over substantial portions of Ukraine's sovereign territory, and its security guarantees against further Russian aggression are vague and inadequate,\" Senator King said in a statement Sunday. \"I hope that after consultation with Ukraine and the Europeans, a more fair and responsible agreement will emerge.\"",
      "When did the Army become involved in diplomacy?",
      "Driscoll has been in contact with Ukrainian officials in recent weeks and was originally planning to go to Ukraine in mid-December to discuss drone technology, but he was recently asked by Mr. Trump to restart talks about a ceasefire. Driscoll's role in the talks has involved details of the security guarantees being given to Ukraine.",
      "Driscoll combined his two missions on this trip. While Driscoll was en route to Ukraine, the 28-point plan was leaked by an anti-Zelenskyy politician. After this point, the Driscoll mission was \"adjusted\" to involve the emerging diplomacy building off the leaked Kushner-Witkoff term sheet, according to multiple U.S. officials familiar with the planning.",
      "The U.S. officials declined to discuss details of how the 28-point plan, or the additional security guarantee document have changed in the past few days.",
      "Vance has been a driving force behind the Ukraine diplomacy, according to a European diplomat and a source familiar. His close friend Driscoll has become a key conduit.",
      "Political implications",
      "The Trump administration has been reaching out in the past few days to respond to senators and congressmen including powerful, pro-Ukraine Republicans who are upset with the reported concessions being asked of Ukraine. Republican Rep Mike McCaul, chair emeritus of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, publicly acknowledged the outreach from Vance-Rubio and said he was assured it was a U.S. proposal not a Russian one.",
      "The Trump administration is sensitive to the idea of a rift between Rubio and Witkoff. It was Witkoff who engineered the August summit with Putin in Alaska.",
      "There has been much retroactive policymaking and recasting of events as we're seeing from the on camera remarks made by Rubio's old colleagues who may recall he was a Russia hawk during his Senate days. Since his time in the Senate, Vance has been consistent in arguing that Ukraine should not be a top priority for the U.S. Meanwhile, Witkoff has been trying to get Mr. Trump the deal to end the war that he so desires.",
      "Olivia  Gazis\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "Earlier, Mr. Trump appeared less optimistic and used a lengthy online post to blast Ukraine for a lack of gratitude for U.S. military assistance, while shying away from criticizing Russia.",
      "In a\u00a0Truth Social post\u00a0before Sunday's talks, Mr. Trump said the Ukraine-Russia war is \"a violent and terrible one that, with strong and proper U.S. and Ukrainian LEADERSHIP, would have NEVER HAPPENED.\"",
      "\"I INHERITED A WAR THAT SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED, A WAR THAT IS A LOSER FOR EVERYONE, ESPECIALLY THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE SO NEEDLESSLY DIED.

      "The 28-point blueprint drawn up by the U.S. sparked alarm in Kyiv and across Europe, quickly rallying Western allies around Ukraine in a push to revise the plan, which is seen as favoring Moscow. They said in a joint statement on Saturday that while the plan \"includes important elements that will be essential for a just and lasting peace,\" additional work is required. The plan acquiesces to many of Russia's demands that Ukraine has categorically rejected on dozens of occasions, including giving up large pieces of territory.",
      "After the first session, Rubio said, \"This will ultimately have to be signed off by our presidents, although I feel very comfortable about that happening given the progress we've made.\" He was joined at the talks by U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll and Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff.",

      "\"Ukraine is grateful to the United States, to every American heart, and personally to President Trump for the assistance that \u2013 starting with the Javelins \u2013 has been saving Ukrainian lives.

      "\"The leadership of the United States is important, we are grateful for everything that America and President Trump are doing for security, and we remain as constructive as possible,\" Zelenskyy said in a post on Telegram.",
      "Some U.S. lawmakers said Saturday that Rubio had privately described the plan as a Russian \"wish list\" rather than a Washington-led proposal. The bipartisan group of senators held a news conference, stating that they had spoken with Rubio about the peace plan after he reached out to some of them while en route to Geneva. Independent Maine Sen. Angus King said Rubio told them the plan \"was not the administration's plan\" but a \"wish list of the Russians.\"",

      "And this week on Face the Nation: Divisions between Congress and the White House grow on crucial conflicts, both foreign and domestic.",
      "Breaking overnight, Secretary of State Rubio and other administration officials are in Geneva meeting with Ukrainian officials and other allies about the administration's 28-point plan to end the war in Ukraine.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): We're trying to get it ended. One way or the other, we have to get it ended.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But does the proposal favor Russia over Ukraine? And if President Zelenskyy doesn't accept it?",

      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the president responded, saying those members in the video were traitors, showing seditious behavior and more.",
      "We will cover it with two Democrats who are facing threats of political violence because of their efforts, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly and Colorado Democratic Congressman Jason Crow.",
      "Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul and the new Ukrainian ambassador to the U.S., Olga Stefanishyna, will also be here.",
      "That, plus some tough news for the president when it comes to how Americans think he's handling the economy.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "As Americans prepare to kick off the holiday season with Thanksgiving, followed by Black Friday, our new poll out today underscores that their focus is still very much on the economy and high prices, with more than three-quarters of Americans who are judging Trump on the economy saying he is not spending enough time focused on the economy and inflation.",
      "Overall, his approval rating has dropped to its lowest this year. Only 40 percent of Americans now approve of Mr. Trump's job performance.",
      "The Trump administration is facing other challenges that they're dealing with right now, what their strategy is for further military action in Venezuela, negotiating an end to the war on Ukraine, and now disturbing rhetoric that's led to an increase in threats against some lawmakers, with some of that rhetoric coming from the president's social media feed.",
      "And we're joined here in studio by Colorado Democratic Congressman Jason Crow, who is one of the six lawmakers who released a recorded video earlier last week urging service members to defy illegal and unlawful orders.",
      "Good morning.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW (D-Colorado): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And it was that video that prompted some of this rhetoric from the president.",
      "I want to speak, though, about what's happening right now. I understand there was a bomb threat against your office in Aurora, Colorado, that your family has received painful death threats, even murder threats. Here is some of what your office released.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "CALLER #1: \u2026 murdered.",
      "CALLER #2: You ain't an American (EXPLETIVE DELETED). You're a communist.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: These, I believe, are phone calls that were made to your office. Are any of these threats credible?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: We don't know, Margaret.",
      "We're going to take these seriously. But it's very disturbing stuff. When you have the president of the United States threatening to execute and to hang and to arrest using this rhetoric, people listen to it. We have seen before a pattern of inciteful, dangerous rhetoric being used by the president and then people acting on that.",
      "I lived through an experience January 6, a very similar dynamic. He's been doing this for years, saying things, and in total disregard for the outcome and what might happen when he throws this stuff out in the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the president has made these social media posts, but then he then sort of walked some of those threats back, saying he wasn't threatening death. He was saying sedition was often in the past punishable by death.",
      "And then, before you appeared here today on social media, he put out: \"The traitors that told the military to disobey my orders should be in jail right now, not roaming the fake news networks\" \u2013 I guess that's us \u2013 \"trying to explain what they said was OK. It wasn't and never will be. It was sedition at the highest level. It's a major crime. There can be no other interpretation of what they said.\"",
      "That's a quote from what he put on social media.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Mm-hmm.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have any idea what all these threats actually mean? Because he mentioned in an interview military courts and referenced the DOJ as well.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: No, we don't know what this means. He doesn't know what this means, because he's irresponsible. He's acting dangerous. He's acting in an inciteful way.",
      "There's two things going on here, Margaret. One is the irresponsible and dangerous rhetoric by the president of the United States, threatening to have members of Congress executed who he disagrees with.",
      "But it's also so telling that, when members of Congress simply remind service members of the Constitution and their duty to obey the law, which is not just our right, but is our obligation to do, that he cannot handle that and he resorts the threats of violence and threats of arrest and execution.",
      "That tells you everything you need to know about Donald Trump's respect for the Constitution and the rule of law and actually underscores our point.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let's get to the content of what you had in that video you released, because there are also 15 House Republicans who are also veterans who released a video, including a retired three-star Marine Corps general, Jack Bergman.",
      "Take a listen to this.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JACK BERGMAN (R-Michigan): Troops, listen up. Any service member who refuses a lawful order is subject to court-martial for violating the Uniform Code of Military Justice.",
      "MAN #1: We study what's lawful and what's not lawful. And the Democrats' stunt insinuating that there are illegal or unconstitutional orders, it's downright dangerous.",
      "MAN #2: It is corrosive. It is meant to weaken our country and weaken the military.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you respond to these allegations from your colleagues, fellow veterans, that what you have put out there is weakening and corrosive to the military?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Well, these, unfortunately, are some of Trump's core supporters that are rallying behind the president.",
      "And they know better. They know exactly the difference between lawful versus unlawful. We were very clear in the video that what we're talking about is unlawful orders. You have the president's spokesperson going on \u2013 into a press conference this past week and saying that we called for people to disobey lawful orders.",
      "They're simply lying because the truth is unacceptable to them. It's unacceptable. We wanted to start a conversation, and we did, about the dangerous rhetoric this president is using and the threats that he's made to use our military in an unlawful way, because\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Specifically what?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Well, send troops into Chicago, send troops into polling stations, kill terrorists' families, arrest and execute\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He hasn't done those things.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: \u2026 arrest and execute members of Congress, shoot peaceful protesters in Lafayette Square. Need I go on?",
      "He has a history of doing this. And if we wait until the moment that he gives a manifestly unlawful order to a young soldier, then we have failed them. We have to start that conversation now and get people thinking about the distinction, which is exactly what we did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. So those were comments, not orders he gave, and social media posts and the like. But I hear you that words matter.",
      "But the standard for troops, as I understand it, is that they should consult with the staff judge advocate, the staff legal counsel regarding orders if they have legal questions. There is a process in place.",
      "Are you telling the rank-and-file troops to go outside of that practice?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: No, absolutely not.",
      "Let me use an example of how this plays out and what this looks like downrange, as we say in the military. I did three\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, because it sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on those people downrange.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: I did three combat deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan.",
      "And before each of those combat deployments, I sat my soldiers down, my Paratroopers and my Rangers, and we talked about the law of war. We talked about lawful versus unlawful orders, about the protection of civilians in conflict, right, because you can't wait until a soldier is in the moment and has to make a split-second decision about what to do to train them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: You have to talk about it. You have to train them before, which was why we put this video out, to get people thinking about their obligation and all of the threats and all of the things the president have said would be manifestly unlawful and would be the types of orders that people shouldn't carry through, because they would be murder if people actually did the things that Donald Trump threatened.",
      "So\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But we don't know yet that the deployment of troops on U.S. soil, if you were referring to the National Guard deployments in major U.S. cities, is actually unlawful. That's tied up in the courts right now.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: We're talking about the decision of troops on the ground out in operations, right, their interface with civilians, shooting civilians, going to polling stations, which is a violation of U.S. criminal law, things that are man\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But these things haven't happened. You're afraid they will?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: \u2026 things that are manifestly unlawful that our troops might be put in the position to carry out because that has what \u2013 that is what the president has repeatedly threatened to do.",
      "So, again, it's very telling that simply restating their obligation to the Constitution and the law\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: \u2026 which we do constantly with our service members, gets this type of response from the president.",
      "I am not going to be threatened and intimidated by the president of the United States. I have a job to do, and that is to ensure people follow the law. I took an oath to this country. It is a lifetime oath that I intend to carry out. And I am not going to be intimidated and threatened by the president and stop reminding people to follow the law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No.",
      "But I have talked to lawyers about this, and military lawyers about this, and there is some frustration that lawmakers haven't been in Washington doing their job in terms of oversight. There aren't hearings on Venezuela. There aren't hearings on those deployments of the National Guard.",
      "And yet there are public videos calling on troops at low ranks to make decisions unto themselves here about what is lawful or unlawful or recall their training or talk to their staff judge advocate about this.",
      "I mean, this \u2013 why not first publicly call for a hearing before you call on the troops?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Well, first of all, two separate issues.",
      "So, on the hearing, absolutely right. We are pushing the Trump administration to actually give us briefings, give us hearings. Mike Johnson, Speaker Johnson, shut Congress down twice, twice, to avoid votes on releasing the Epstein files.",
      "They have\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He would argue Democrats shut down Congress to \u2013 for the health care argument.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Well, it's very clear \u2013 it's very clear what they did.",
      "I still came to D.C. anyhow and pushed for oversight and pushed for briefings. So I have been in Congress for seven years almost, and I have never seen the lack of briefings and oversight and ability to access information. I have been completely shut out of the DOD and the CIA at this point, as a member of the Intelligence Committee and the Armed Services Committee.",
      "So, this administration\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Isn't so much of this because of the Republican leadership in Congress that isn't demanding those things?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: This \u2013 exactly right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Congress has the power to do this. So they're right. We need to be doing this. Democrats are trying to do it. We are being stonewalled and blocked by the Republicans, blocked by the administration, because they actually don't want us to do the oversight, because they're afraid of what we're going to learn.",
      "And that is different, Margaret, than what we're talking about, operational decisions, decisions to go to war in the Caribbean, Venezuela, which are strictly within the purview of Congress. And Congress needs to be making those decisions and debating it, versus\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that \u2013 the White House says that was not an act of war; it's foreign policy and the president has a lot of leeway under the Constitution. That's their argument.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Well, we have been hearing this for 25 years, which is why Iraq and Afghanistan went on for as long as it did. We spent $3 trillion, lost 7,000 service members' lives, and those ended poorly.",
      "Congress has to make that decision. Congress needs to be accountable for it. And Congress needs to be debating this before the American people, going to the American people, and telling them why they should send their sons and daughters into conflict and they should spend hundreds of billions of dollars of their hard-earned money.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: This president doesn't want that process to happen.",
      "And as somebody that did three combat tours in these wars\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: \u2026 I have had enough of Congress being cut out of it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you will see in some of our upcoming polling data that the American public would like more information about the plans for Venezuela, which you were referencing there.",
      "Congressman Crow, thank you.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in one minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Democratic Senator Mark Kelly, who joins us from Tucson, Arizona.",
      "Welcome back to Face the Nation, Senator.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY (D-Arizona): Thank you for having me on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to pick up where we left off on this topic of political violence.",
      "I know your family has suffered because of it, very, very directly. And then, this past week, the president called that video you participated in sedition. You heard me read what he said again this morning, sedition at the highest level and a major crime.",
      "Have you \u2013 do you have credible threats? How concerned are you about your security at this point?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Well, Margaret, what the president said is very serious.",
      "I didn't think he would step over the \u2013 over that line, calling for the execution of members of Congress. And his words carry tremendous weight, more so than anybody else in the country, and he should be aware of that.",
      "And because of what he says, there is now an \u2013 increased threats against us. I'm not going to get into details on my personal security. But, as the husband of Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, we \u2013 I understand what political violence is. The president should as well.",
      "Just like Gabby, somebody tried to assassinate him, and should \u2013 he should understand that his words have \u2013 you know, could have serious, serious consequences.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I remember just weeks ago hearing from the president and other Republicans about the need to dial back the rhetoric after the tragic shooting of Charlie Kirk.",
      "When it comes to your\u2026",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Yes, what happened to that? I mean, that was two months ago.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Where are they now? We've heard very little, basically crickets, from Republicans in the United States Congress about what the president has said about hanging members of Congress.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I \u2013 that's what I wanted to ask you. Why aren't we hearing from your Republican colleagues?",
      "And, in terms of your security, I understand there was a request for you to get a boost in Capitol Hill security support. Are Republican members on board with that?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: I don't know. I have heard them say, you know, very little about this.",
      "I think, you know, the president tries to intimidate them. He tries to intimidate Congress. He looks at government accountability as a nuisance. And I think it's really important for people to understand, Margaret, that the message he sent a couple days ago was, he declared that loyalty to the Constitution is now punishable by death.",
      "Those are serious words coming from the president of the United States. He's trying to intimidate us.",
      "But, Margaret, I'm not going to be intimidated. You know, you just heard Jason Crow. He's not going to be intimidated either. We both served our country. We swore an oath. All we said is, we reiterated what basically is the rule of law\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: \u2026 that members of the military should not, cannot follow illegal orders.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, on that point, in terms of lawful and unlawful orders, it gets complicated for rank and file to understand.",
      "I understand and other networks have reported that the senior judge advocate down at SOUTHCOM raised serious doubts about the legality of the strikes on those alleged drug boats\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 but was contradicted by lawyers at the executive branch.",
      "Have you spoken to the SOUTHCOM commander? Do you \u2013 are you hearing that there are unlawful orders being given?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Well, we're hearing the same thing that you are.",
      "The administration hasn't shared much information with us. I have read the legal analysis. It was just like the briefs. They're tying themselves in knots trying to explain why what they're doing with regards to these drug boats is legal.",
      "And it's \u2013 it's questionable, at best. Our \u2013 one of our biggest allies, the United Kingdom, recently stopped sharing intelligence with us in the Caribbean because they question whether this is legal or not. We've been asking for more briefings from the right people. We have not received them.",
      "But the information that you just shared with me is the \u2013 is the public information.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: I don't have much more beyond that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and the French government has said it's a violation of international law and the law of the sea. That's what our allies are saying about those strikes that are happening there.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Yes.",
      "But, Margaret, getting back to the junior \u2013 the junior folks\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But is that why you made this video?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: No. No.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: The reason why we made this video is a couple things.",
      "This president, from before he was in office as he was a candidate to the time he was in office in his first administration, has said things that cause us great concern.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: There is a trend here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: When he was running for president the first time, he talked about he wanted the military \u2013 he said he would \u2013 he would \u2013 the military should be killing the families of terrorists.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: And when he was told that that was illegal \u2013 this was on a debate stage \u2013 he basically said that the military will not refuse to follow my orders\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: \u2026 that they will carry out his orders regardless of what they were.",
      "Shooting protesters in the legs is something he brought up in his first administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: And, thankfully, Mark Esper, his secretary of defense\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: \u2026 and Mark Milley, you know, basically told him, you cannot do that. If they weren't there, think of what possibly could have happened.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I need\u2026",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: So, we're concerned\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Oh, I'm sorry.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Go ahead.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I just want to make sure I get to you on Ukraine, because there's so much happening.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: OK.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I know you're such a big supporter of Ukraine.",
      "There are three prominent U.S. senators who have gone on the record now, including Republican Mike Rounds, who said yesterday Secretary of State Rubio told them he was unaware of a threat to cut off U.S. support to Ukraine if they don't accept this proposed plan that's on the table.",
      "Here is how Senator Rounds described it.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "SENATOR MIKE ROUNDS (R-South Dakota): What he told us was that this was not the American proposal. This was a proposal which was received by someone who has identified and they believe to be representing Russia in this proposal. It was given to Mr. Witkoff.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So \u2013 so, since those remarks were made and backed up by multiple senators, I have received phone calls from senior White House officials, from \u2013 from senior U.S. officials saying, no, no, no, that's not at all what \u2013 what Secretary Rubio said.",
      "What version of events do we believe here in terms of what America is putting forward?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Margaret, they've got to clear this up.",
      "You have Rubio talking to my Senate colleagues saying one thing, the spokesperson for the State Department saying another. Your conversations with the White House contradict what the secretary of state and, by the way, the national security adviser, same guy, has said about this.",
      "They've got \u2013 they've got to figure this out and get the message out and explain to the American people what's going on.",
      "I will say this, that that \u2013 that plan, that's Putin's plan. That is a very good deal for Russia. It is a horrible deal for Ukraine, for our allies and even for our own national security. If Putin gets the chance with that deal to, you know, rearm\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: \u2026 rebuild his economy and gain territory, by the way, that's what he wanted.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well\u2026",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Then, the Baltics, Poland, Romania, all those other countries down the line are at threat.",

      "Earlier this month, our Camilo Montoya-Galvez reported that roughly half of those in custody have no criminal charges or convictions on their record, but are being held solely because of alleged civil violations of immigration law. And now the government has confirmed it; 48 percent of current detainees lack criminal charges or convictions.",
      "Since President Trump took office, the number of noncriminal detainees arrested by ICE has increased by over 2000 percent. Our new CBS poll shows that 54 percent of Americans believe the government is stopping and detaining more people than necessary.",
      "A similar number, 55 percent, now disapprove of President Trump's handling of immigration policy. Despite growing public concern, the administration has recently expanded enforcement operations to Charlotte and other cities, giving no sign their so-called mass deportation campaign is ending any time soon.",

      "For more from our latest CBS News poll we're now joined by our executive director of elections and surveys, Anthony Salvanto.",
      "Anthony, it's always great to have you here.",
      "It's the time of year where Americans go out and they spend a whole lot of money because they're getting ready for the holidays. So, how are people feeling about the economy?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: The story of the economy is a story about prices, as it has been for years. And people say prices are still high. Not going down. In fact, many say they're still going up. And it's a reminder that even as we talk about inflation and the macro inflation rate of change numbers, this is people walking down the aisle in a grocery store and saying, that's expensive or that's not. And simple as that is what you pick up in a poll.",
      "Now, the other part of this is about expectations, which is, at the start of this year people told us that they thought the economy was going to get better, that prices were going to come down. So, you see this sort of realization here that it is not. That's number two.",
      "But the other part of this is, as it comes back to those numbers you mentioned for the president, and his ratings for all of this. First of all, what people say they're hearing from the White House doesn't match with what they are feeling.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Interesting.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: They say the president is making the inflation issue sound better than it really is.",
      "Now, look, some of that is just going to be any president trying to be optimistic, right? Maybe that's Trump being Trump, putting something positive out there. But, a the same time, you look at people who say they judge the president, first and foremost, on how he handles the economy, and the big majority of them say his administration is not spending enough time on it. So, it's not just about the rhetoric, it's also about the action.",
      "Now, the other part of this is, when you look at the decline in his approval ratings on handling the economy, it's kind of slow and steady down to this point, which comes back to those expectations, which is that people sort of comparing what they expected to what they're seeing now. And that's a big reason why his handling for it has slowly gone down.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Pocketbook politics always so important.",
      "The other big policy for this president has been immigration. And his supporters have stuck by him on that. How is he fairing?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Very much so. Still very strong support from the Republican base. That's right. And relatively better than he does on the economy.",
      "But speaking of the economy, there's an economic component to this too, which is, people say that the deportation program is more likely to be hurting the economy right now, making it weaker, than making it stronger. So, you go a little \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it's harder to find workers?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, you go a little bit into that, right? And people say \u2013 the ones who say that they feel like it's impacting the area around them, and the ones who say they think that is for the worse, say their sense of thing is that people are staying home more as a result of this. Not necessarily going out. And so one of the things you see there is the potential or the perception of an economic impact out of the deportation program, although, yes, it still maintains strong support from Republicans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Different topic but related. The White House is preparing for some kind of military action against Venezuela, and the president has linked this to both drug policy and immigration policy because of those Venezuelan refugees who have been coming into this country in recent years.",
      "We have lawmakers saying, not enough information is being shared. Does the public think they know what's happening?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: The public is echoing exactly that sentiment, right? You get this big majority that says the administration has not yet explained what the U.S. position is, what is going on there. But then, on the other side of that, that it needs to. And even across the board, Republicans, Democrats, independent, all saying that it needs to.",
      "Now, the reason then that you'd see, as we see, this big number that say they would oppose military action in Venezuela is that that connection hasn't been made, right? So, people don't feel like they know what's going on. So you see that opposition, at least in general.",
      "The other part is, you compare that to relatively larger approval for the idea of, or the attacks on, boats and ships that the administration says are carrying drugs. That gets a little higher approval. But at the same time, you still see people saying, the administration should show evidence that there are drugs on that boat. So, it comes back to that idea of people wanting to know more.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Bring the public along with you in the decisions you're making.",
      "You also have been looking at the president's base, MAGA. How are they feeling and how does this idea of intervention, some kind of action overseas, settle with them? Because the president had promised America first focus at home.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Right now, with regard to Venezuela, you see the MAGA Republicans, so identify as MAGA Republicans, even more supportive than non-MAGA Republicans at the idea. Why is that? Number one, they do see it as tied to drugs. They're more likely to say, if we were to go in there, that it might stop the flow of drugs into the U.S. So, they are listening to what the president is arguing, number one.",
      "Number two, for context, we have often seen MAGA Republicans more differential to the president across a range of issues, including foreign policy ones. So, we say on the Iran strikes, as well as others. And what I think what we see is, when they say America first, what they're saying is, look out for U.S. interests, number one. Not necessarily be entirely isolationist. But that deference to the president, among the MAGA base, has been something consistent throughout this. It is still very much about him and his connection to that MAGA base.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Anthony Salvanto, great insights. Thank you.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Thanks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Republican Senator Rand Paul, who joins us from Bowling Green, Kentucky.",
      "Welcome back to the program, Senator.",
      "A lot to get to.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL (R-KY): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But on this concern about political violence, or angry rhetoric. I know the president himself has survived these two attempts on his life. You've talked to us about those risks to him. And then we had this killing of Charlie Kirk just a few months ago. Is the president holding himself to the same standards that he is asking of others when it comes to dialing back dangerous rhetoric?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Well, you know, everybody knows that the president is famous for his unfiltered social media. But if you take at face value the idea that calling your opponents traitors and then specifically saying that it warrants the death penalty, is reckless, inappropriate, irresponsible. There are a number of other ways to describe it, but it's not something that is helping the country heal wounds. I think it stirs things up. And, really, I think we can do better.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, on the homeland security front, I understand you are chair of that committee and so you have some insight into some of these domestic threats. It's not just these Democratic lawmakers. We saw out in the state of Indiana, four Republican state senators were targeted by swatting threats amid President Trump's pubic pressure on them to redistrict their state. Just a few weeks ago we did see one of the convicted January 6th rioters, who was then pardoned by President Trump, arrested for threatening to kill Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. I mean are we at the point here where it's not just unfiltered social media posts, but truly dangerous rhetoric?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Well, you know, I've been on the receiving side of this. Even my father, who's been retired for some time, has been on the receiving end of swatting. Police are called, says there's an emergency in the home. And the goal is to, you know, have someone draw a gun and be killed as the police come in supposedly to rescue someone who's not really in need of being rescued. So, I think both sides have been doing this. And I think the language on treason and traitors, both to Republicans and Democrats, is, as I said, reckless, inappropriate, irresponsible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think that \u2013 so one of the other developments we've seen just over the weekend is that Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican from Georgia, just a staunch supporter for so long of the president, has said she is going to step away because she's paid such a public price for some of her positions. Do you think there is room in your party for disagreeing with President Trump?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I think it's important that we have independent voices. So, I'm sad to see her voice go away, or potentially go away. I think that she brought up something in the last week or so that was very important, what is the Republican plan for health care? So, I've engaged the president on this and I'm putting forward my own plan. But in my plan what it allows for is people to buy their insurance through a collective. Basically to by their insurance through Costco or Sam's Club or Amazon. And mine is the only plan out there that would actually drive prices down. But that's what an independent voice will help in our country, an independent voice within the Republican caucus, not to see things always inside the box, but to think of some out of the box solutions. So, I think independent voices are important in the Republican Party.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, because of your position on homeland security, you may have some insight into the drug cartels. You are also on Senate Foreign Relations. And it is tomorrow that the Trump administration officially will designate the cartel de la Soles as a foreign terrorist organization. That's the cartel the Trump administration says is linked to Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.",
      "Secretary Hegseth says it gives the administration new tools. Nothing's on or off the table he says militarily. Legally, what changes tomorrow? What becomes possible?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I think by doing this they're pretending as if we are at war. They're pretending as if they've gotten some imprimatur to do what they want. When you have war, the rules of engagement are lessened. So, for example, we normally don't shoot boats that we suspect of being drug dealers. In fact, if the Coast Guard tomorrow started shooting all vessels that are off of Miami or off of San Diego, about one in four of the vessels that they normally board doesn't have drugs. So, it actually would be unlawful if the Coast Guard started blowing up boats. But for some reason they say, oh, we're at war off the coast of Venezuela. And so it's a different rule of engagement. It's one of war.",
      "But, you know, Senator Kaine and I brought this up. And we said, if it's war, let's declare it as war. Let's have this discussion. Is it war or not? And the administration refused that. They want to have it both ways. They want to say, oh, we can just say these people are terrorists, they're narco terrorists, so we can blow them up. But it's extraordinary that when some of them survive, they pluck them out of the water, they don't prosecute them for drugs, they don't collect drugs, they don't tell us if they were armed or not. They just send them back to their country, most of the time not being Venezuela. They've sent one back to Colombia and one back to Ecuador. But nobody's making any pretense of even interviewing them to find out who's selling you the drugs. Maybe we could find out who the kingpins are if they're involved in the drug trade. Not a word.",
      "And I've been given zero, not one briefing because I'm skeptical of what they're doing. They don't brief me or the general Senate at all. A few hand-select people may have gotten a briefing, but I have not been invited to any briefings on Venezuela.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that's fairly unusual given your homeland security role and that the premise for some of this action has to do with both immigration and drug policy according to the president.",
      "I know the DEA administrator recently spoke to our Nicole Sganga and told her that they have seen between a 30 to 45 percent increase in cocaine prices per kilogram due to these DOD boat strikes, and a shift towards land routes for delivery of those drugs.",
      "In other words, there's still demand for the drugs, and the cartels are just finding different routes to deliver them. Have you seen any evidence that the president's actions to date are winning a drug war?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: You know, I think we should be trying to work on the demand side, treating it as a health problem, as an addiction problem in our country, and trying to lessen the demand. And that is part of the overall solution.",
      "The war on drugs, though, to capture all the people selling drugs, the price goes up and more people are attracted to it.",
      "You know, a couple of the people that have been identified as being on these boats are simply down on their luck, people with no prospects who were offered $500 to get on a boat and race across the ocean. And so, there always will be those people. There's probably a limitless number of those people in South America.",
      "There's been some benefit when we've cooperated with countries and with governments, but that's not what this is. And I fear that this is not going to do anything for the drug trade, but it is really going against the rule of law in the way in which we interact with people on the high seas. And it has no precedent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I've seen you quoted as saying there are people in the administration who have wanted to go to war in Venezuela for some time. Who are you talking about?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I think it's clear that Senator Rubio, as a senator, was very much an advocate of regime change. This was at odds, really, with President Trump. And so, when he was picked, a lot of people who had been supportive of President Trump were, oh my goodness, they're picking someone much more hawkish and much more eager to be involved and to intervene in other countries. And so people worried.",
      "And then the first year or so people are like, oh, well, Rubio's doing a good job on foreign aid and they've cut back on all of the abuse of these NGOs around the world. And I think that people supporting the president have been very supportive of the secretary of state. But I think once there's an invasion of Venezuela, or if they decide to re-up the subsidies and the gifts to Ukraine, I think you'll see a splintering and a fracturing of the movement that has supported the president because I think a lot of people, including myself, were attracted to the president because of his reticence to get us involved in foreign war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, to date, they say nothing on or off the table. No specifics. We'll continue to track all the reporting on that.",
      "Senator Rand Paul, thank you for your time today.",
      "We'll be back in a moment.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now about the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States, Olga Stefanishyna.",
      "Welcome to \"FACE THE NATION.\"",
      "OLGA STEFANISHYNA (Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States): Welcome, Margaret. Hello.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand this is a very intense week for your country for a number of reasons, including the diplomacy that's happening right now as we sit here in Geneva. Your president said Ukraine face as choice between losing its dignity or losing a key ally, the United States. What has been agreed to at this point?",
      "OLGA STEFANISHYNA: Well, as it is known, the consultation are still ongoing between Ukraine and the American officials. This is Secretary of State Rubio and also Secretary of Army Driscoll, who arrived a little bit earlier. This consultation are still continue on the basis of the proposal of the American side on 28-point peace plan, as it's been called here. And European allies are also present in Geneva these days to work hand in hand with Ukraine in the litigation, but also with the American delegation to discuss the proposals on our \u2013 and on their side. So, consultations are still ongoing. But there has been a number of points, which have been already widely discussed in public.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you aware of Russia making any concessions at this point?",
      "OLGA STEFANISHYNA: Well, it is not seen this way from the proposal, which is on the table. In fact \u2013 in fact, none of the points are actually related to forcing anything on the Russian side. Of course, it's recognized that it is \u2013 it is aggression. There is a number of points related to return of hostages and a \u2013 and a prisoners of war, of a humanitarian nation. But this is definitely not about justice. This plan is not about the justice. And the truth of this war and the aggression. It's about, you know, ending the war and stopping the military engagement.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's unfair to Ukraine, you're saying?",
      "OLGA STEFANISHYNA: Well, again, I think this should be divided. This plan is not about justice, you know. And this plan is about a number of actions proposed as part of estimated agreement between Ukraine and potentially Russian Federation. Ukraine is in intensive engagement in a very constructive way with the American side. And under the umbrella of U.S. leadership, the discussions are ongoing and we believe that the fair piece is not the words, but this is something that should be put on paper. So, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you been told that the United States will cut off military and intelligence sharing if President Zelenskyy doesn't agree to this plan by Thursday?",
      "OLGA STEFANISHYNA: I think it's totally unfair to American colleagues and partners to call (ph) this or that statement, which were wait (ph) \u2013 where were done in course of, you know, various meetings and a phone calls. There was quite a few, you know. We had a first senior military visit to Ukraine by Secretary of Army Driscoll since we gained the independence in 1991. And I had meeting with him as well here in Washington. And his role is extremely \u2013 extremely clear to us. We also had an engagement between president and the vice president on a the phone call. There was like a lot of discussions. Some of them were more emotional. Some were less emotional. But here we are. We are sitting together and looking for a solution to end the war. And Russia is not part of the process formally.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, \"The Wall Street Journal\" is reporting that in addition to those 28 points there's a separate document that has to do with security guarantees. I have also been told that there's a separate document with security guarantees.",
      "OLGA STEFANISHYNA: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \"The Journal\" is reporting that it's ten years of support but it doesn't commit the U.S. to provide direct military assistance. What guarantees do you want from the United States?",
      "OLGA STEFANISHYNA: Well, there is a separate document called the framework. Like, of the security assurances from the United States. So, this is not the agreement. This is not the treaty. This is not the formal or detailed layout for what security guarantees is \u2013 that is the \u2013 like documents specifying the intention that U.S. government is committed to providing security assurances, which are like something like the Article Five of the Washington NATO treaty.",
      "So, it's still very different and it specifies \u2013 it's been in the public access. So, it's been publicly leaked as well. So, that U.S. will stand up together with their allies in case of the Russian aggression from the territory of the Russian Federation.",
      "I think we should not forget that the Russian aggression start, in fact, from Bella Russian territory. So, they're like a lot of nuances and this needs to be discussed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, I see. So, you're saying you want a clear security guarantee that says if you're invaded or if you're attacked, including by surrounding countries that are Russian proxies, you want America to say that it will come to Ukraine for that (ph)?",
      "OLGA STEFANISHYNA: Yes, absolutely. We can really speak about security assurances. But we have like the real document in front of our eyes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "OLGA STEFANISHYNA: And what is really important that we had. We are very complicated partner for U.S. because we also had a lot of different sad experience like Budapest memorandum, where we gave up nuclear weapons that we had.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Yes.",
      "OLGA STEFANISHYNA: Another of a different situations where we have learned our lessons, and we face the aggression for three and a half years and we learned.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I have to ask you, U.S. and European officials tell me that the trajectory on the battlefield for Ukraine is not good, particularly in that key industrial city of Pokrovsk.",
      "OLGA STEFANISHYNA: Pokrovsk, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Pokrovsk. And that Russia will likely take control of this, and that this is sort of a gateway to the eastern part, the Donbas. How do you respond to the argument that Ukraine is losing on the battlefield and that you need to negotiate now?",
      "OLGA STEFANISHYNA: Well, Ukraine is one of the largest European countries. And on a regular, within one week there are more than 1,000 combat (ph) engagements happening on all the front line. And the Russia has tried to present that it's only happen in Pokrovsk, right? So, this is a victorious narrative Russia is using as a tactics of pressuring or changing the reality also here in the United States. That's why, I mean, Pokrovsk is a very important spot on the front line but definitely not the only one.",

In fact- in fact, none of the points are actually related to- to forcing anything on the Russian side. Of course, it's recognized that it is- it is aggression. There is a number of points related to return of hostages and- and prisoners of war, of a humanitarian nation. But this is definitely not about the justice. This plan is not about the justice and the truth of this war and- and the aggression. It's about, you know, ending the war and stopping the military engagement.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's unfair to Ukraine, you're saying.",
      "AMB. STEFANISHYNA: Well again, I think this should be divided. This plan is not about justice, you know, and this plan is about a number of actions proposed as part of estimated agreement between Ukraine and potentially Russian Federation. Ukraine is in intensive engagement in a very constructive way with the American side and under the umbrella of U.S. leadership, these discussions are ongoing, and we believe that the fair peace is not the words, but this is something that should be put on paper. So, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you been told that the United States will cut off military and intelligence sharing if President Zelenskyy doesn't agree to this plan by Thursday?",
      "AMB. STEFANISHYNA: I think it's- it's totally unfair to- to American colleagues and partners to quote this or that statements which were weighed- which were done in course of, you know, various meetings and phone calls. There was quite a few, you know, we had a first senior military visit to Ukraine by Secretary of Army Driscoll since- since we gained the independence in 1991. And I had a meeting with him as well here in Washington. And his role is extremely- extremely clear to us. We also had an engagement between president and vice president on a phone call. There was, like, a lot of discussions. Some of them were more emotional. Some were- them were less emotional, but here we are. We are sitting together and looking for a solution to end the war, and Russia is not part of this process formally.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the- the Wall Street Journal is reporting that in addition to those 28 points, there's a separate document that has to do with security guarantees. I have also been told that there's a separate document with security guarantees.",
      "AMB. STEFANISHYNA: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Journal is reporting that it's 10 years of support, but it doesn't commit the U.S. to provide direct military assistance. What guarantees do you want from the United States?",
      "AMB. STEFANISHYNA: Well, there is a separate document called the framework, like of the security assurances from the United States. So this is not the agreement. This is not the treaty. This is not the- the- the formal or detailed layout of what security guarantees is. That is the like document specifying the intention that U.S. government is committed to providing security assurances, which are like something like the Article 5 of the Washington NATO Treaty. So it's- it's still very different, and it specifies it's been in a public access so it's been publicly leaked as well, so, that U.S. will stand up together with the allies, in case of the Russian aggression from the territory of the Russian Federation. I think we should not forget that the Russian aggression started, in fact, from Belarusian territory. So they're, like, a lot of nuances, and this is to be discussed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, I see. So you're saying you want a clear security guarantee that says if you're invaded, or if you're attacked, including by surrounding countries that are Russian proxies. You want America to say that it will come to Ukraine's defense?",
      "AMB. STEFANISHYNA: Yeah, absolutely. We can really speak about security assurances where we have, like the real document in front of our eyes and what is really important that we had- we are very complicated partner for U.S., because we also had a lot of different sad experiences, like Budapest Memorandum where we gave up nuclear weapons that we had, another of different situations where we have learned our lessons and we face the aggression for three and a half year and we learned.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I have to ask you. U.S. and European officials tell me that the trajectory on the battlefield for Ukraine is not good, particularly in that key industrial city of Pokrovsk --",
      "AMB. STEFANISHYNA: -- Pokrovsk.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Pokrovsk. And that Russia will likely take control of this, and that this is sort of a gateway to the eastern part, that the Donbas. How do you respond to the argument that Ukraine is losing on the battlefield and that you need to negotiate now?",
      "AMB. STEFANISHYNA: Well, Ukraine is one of the largest European countries, and on the regular, within one week, there are more than 1,000 combat engagements happening on all the front line, and Russia is trying to present that it's only happening in Pokrovsk, right? So this is a victorious narrative Russia is using as a tactics of pressuring or changing the reality also here in the United States. That's why I mean Pokrovsk is a very important spot on the front line, but definitely not the only one.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador, thank you for your time this morning. We'll be right back.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona criticized President Trump for his recent comments, in which the president accused him and other Democratic lawmakers of \"seditious behavior,\" with Kelly saying Mr. Trump should understand that his words \"could have serious, serious consequences.\"",
      "\"His words carry tremendous weight, more so than anybody else in the country, and he should be aware of that, and because of what he says, there is now increased threats against us,\" Kelly said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Democrats have railed against the president in recent days after he posted Thursday on social media that a group of lawmakers who urged members of the military to disobey illegal orders should be arrested and face trial for \"seditious behavior.\" In another post, Mr. Trump also said \"SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!\" He also reposted \"HANG THEM, GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD!\"",
      "The president's posts came in response to a video featuring Kelly and Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, along with Reps. Jason Crow of Colorado, Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania and Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire. In the video, the lawmakers, who are veterans and former national security officials, cited threats to the Constitution while urging service members and members of the intelligence community to \"refuse illegal orders.\"",
      "Crow, who appeared separately on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, said that the video referred to orders that are \"manifestly unlawful, that our troops might be put in the position to carry out, because that is what the president has repeatedly threatened to do.\"",
      "Crow listed several examples of what he considered to be unlawful orders, like threatening to send troops into Chicago or to polling stations.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday the president does not want to execute members of Congress. And Mr. Trump clarified on Fox News Radio Friday that \"I'm not threatening death, but I think they're in serious trouble. In the old days, it was death. That was seditious behavior.\" Then, late Saturday, the president again railed against the lawmakers in a post on Truth Social, saying the lawmakers who made the video \"SHOULD BE IN JAIL RIGHT NOW.\"",
      "\"IT WAS SEDITION AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL, AND SEDITION IS A MAJOR CRIME,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Kelly said the president is \"trying to intimidate us.\"",
      "\"I'm not going to be intimidated,\" he said, noting that Crow, who also appeared on \"Face the Nation,\" is \"not going to be intimidated either.\"",
      "\"We both served our country,\" Kelly said. \"We swore an oath. All we said is we reiterated what basically is the rule of law. Members of the military should not, cannot follow illegal orders.\"",
      "Kelly's wife, former Rep. Gabby Giffords, was shot at a political event in 2011, and he noted that \"as the husband of Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, I understand what political violence is.\"",
      "\"The president should as well,\" Kelly said, referring to the July 2024 assassination attempt in which a bullet grazed Mr. Trump's ear in Butler, Pennsylvania. \"Just like Gabby, somebody tried to assassinate him, and he should understand that his words, have you know, could have serious, serious consequences.\"",
      "Crow, whose district office reported a bomb threat late Saturday, said he didn't know yet whether the threat was credible, but he said it's \"very disturbing stuff.\"",
      "\"When you have the president of the United States threatening to execute and to hang and to arrest using this rhetoric, people listen to it,\" Crow said. \"We've seen before a pattern of insightful, dangerous rhetoric being used by the president, and then people acting on that.\"",
      "The Colorado Democrat cited his experience of the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, calling it a \"very similar dynamic.\"",
      "\"He's been doing this for years,\" Crow said. \"Saying things in total disregard for the outcome and what might happen when he throws this stuff out in the world.\"",
      "Crow said on top of the \"irresponsible and dangerous rhetoric,\" it's also \"so telling that when members of Congress simply remind service members of the Constitution and their duty to obey the law, which is not just our right, but is our obligation, to do that, he cannot handle that, and he resorts to threats of violence and threats of arrest and execution.\"",
      "\"That tells you everything you need to know about Donald Trump's respect for the Constitution and the rule of law,\" Crow said.",
      "The veterans and former national security officials wanted to \"start a conversation\" about \"the dangerous rhetoric this president is using and the threats that he's made to use our military in an unlawful way,\" Crow said.",
      "\"If we wait until the moment that he gives a manifestly unlawful order to a young soldier, then we have failed them,\" he added. \"We have to start that conversation now and get people thinking about the distinction which is exactly what we did.\"",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Sen. Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 23, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Republican Senator Rand Paul, who joins us from Bowling Green, Kentucky. Welcome back to the program, Senator. A lot to get to, but on this concern about political violence or angry rhetoric, I know the President himself has survived these two attempts on his life. You talked to us about those risks to him. And then we had this killing of Charlie Kirk just a few months ago. Is the President holding himself to the same standard that he is asking of others when it comes to dialing back dangerous rhetoric?",
      "SEN. RAND PAUL: You know, everybody knows that the President is famous for his unfiltered social media. But if you take at face value the idea that calling your opponents traitors and then specifically saying that it warrants the death penalty is reckless, inappropriate, irresponsible, there are a number of other ways to describe it, but it's not something that is helping the country heal wounds. I think it stirs things up and- and really, I think we can do better.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, on the homeland security front, I understand you are chair of that committee, and so you have some insight into some of these domestic threats. It's not just these Democratic lawmakers. We saw out in the state of Indiana, four Republican state senators were targeted by swatting threats amid President Trump's public pressure on them to redistrict their state. Just a few weeks ago, we did see one of the convicted January 6 rioters who was then pardoned by President Trump arrested for threatening to kill Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Are we at the point here where it's not just unfiltered social media posts, but truly dangerous rhetoric?",
      "SEN. RAND PAUL: Well, you know, I've been on the receiving side of this. Even my father, who's been retired for some time, has been on the receiving end of swatting. Police are called. Says there's an emergency in the home, and the goal is to, you know, have someone draw a gun and be killed as the police come in, supposedly to rescue someone who's not really in need of being rescued. So, I think both sides have been doing this, and I think the language on treason and traitors, both to Republicans and Democrats, is, as I said, reckless, inappropriate, irresponsible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think that- so one of the other developments we've seen just over the weekend is that Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican from Georgia, just a staunch supporter for so long of the President, has said she is going to step away because she's paid such a public price for some of her positions. Do you think there is room in your party for disagreeing with President Trump?",
      "SEN. RAND PAUL: I think it's important that we have independent voices. So, I'm sad to see her voice go away, or potentially go away. I think that she brought up something in the last week or so that was very important. What is the Republican plan for health care? So, I've engaged the President on this, and I'm putting forward my own plan. But in my plan, what it allows for is people to buy their insurance through a collective. Basically to buy their insurance through Costco or Sam's Club or Amazon. And mine is the only plan out there that would actually drive prices down. But that's what an independent voice will help in our country. Independent voice within the Republican caucus, not to see things always inside the box, but to think of some out of the box solutions. So, I think independent voices are important in the Republican Party.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, because of your position on Homeland Security, you may have some insight into the drug cartels. You are also on Senate Foreign Relations, and it is tomorrow that the Trump administration officially will designate the Cartel de los Soles as a foreign terrorist organization. That's the cartel the Trump administration says is linked to Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro. Secretary Hegseth, says it gives the administration new tools. Nothing's on or off the table, he says, militarily. Legally, what changes tomorrow? What becomes possible?",
      "SEN. RAND PAUL: I think by doing this, they're pretending as if we are at war. They're pretending as if they've gotten some imprimatur to do what they want. When you have war, the rules of engagement are lessened. So, for example, we normally don't shoot boats that we suspect of being drug dealers. In fact, if the Coast Guard tomorrow started shooting all vessels that are off of Miami or off of San Diego, about one in four of the vessels that they normally board doesn't have drugs. So it actually would be unlawful if the Coast Guard started blowing up boats. But for some reason they say, oh, we're at war off the coast of Venezuela. And so it's different rule of engagement. It's one of war. But you know, Senator Kaine and I brought this up, and we said, if it's war, let's- let's declare it as war. Let's have this discussion. Is it war or not? And the administration refused that. They want to have it both ways. They want to say, Oh, we can just say these people are terrorists, are narco-terrorists, so we can blow them up. But it's extraordinary that when some of them survive, they pluck them out of the water. They don't prosecute them for drugs. They don't collect drugs. They don't tell us if they were armed or not. They just send them back to their country, most of the time, not being Venezuela. They've sent one back to Colombia and one back to Ecuador, but nobody's making any pretense of even interviewing them to find out who's selling you the drugs. Maybe we could find out who the kingpins are if they're involved in the drug trade. Not a word. And I've been given zero, not one briefing, because I'm skeptical of what they're doing. They don't brief me or the general Senate at all. A few hand selected people may have gotten a briefing, but I have not been invited to any briefings on Venezuela.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that's fairly unusual, given your homeland security role, and that the premise for some of this action has to do with both immigration and drug policy, according to the President. I know the DEA administrator recently spoke to our Nicole Sganga and told her that they have seen between a 30% to 45% increase in cocaine prices per kilogram due to these DoD boat strikes and a shift towards land routes for delivery of those drugs. In other words, there's still demand for the drugs and the cartels are just finding different routes to deliver them. Have you seen any evidence that the President's actions to date are winning a drug war?",
      "SEN. PAUL: You know, I think we should be trying to work on the demand side, treating it as a health problem, as an addiction problem in our country, and trying to lessen the demand. And that is part of the overall solution, the war on drugs, though, to capture all the people selling drugs. The price goes up and more people are attracted to it. You know, a couple of the people that have been identified as being on these boats are simply down on their luck, people with no prospects who are offered $500 to get on a boat and race across the ocean, and so there always will be those people. There's probably a limitless number of those people in South America. There's been some benefit when we've cooperated with countries and with governments. But that's not what this is, and I fear that this is not going to do anything for the drug trade, but it is really going against the rule of law in the way in which we interact with people on the high seas, and it has no precedent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I've seen you quoted as saying there are people in the administration who have wanted to go to war in Venezuela for some time. Who are you talking about?",
      "SEN. PAUL: I think it's clear that Senator Rubio, as a senator, was very much an advocate of regime change. This was at odds, really, with President Trump, and so when he was picked, a lot of people who had been supportive of President Trump were- oh, my goodness, they're picking someone much more hawkish and much more eager to be involved and to intervene in other countries. And so people worried. And then the first year or so, people are like, oh, well, Rubio has done a good job on foreign aid, and they've cut back on all of the abuse of these NGOs around the world. And I think the people supporting the President have been very supportive of the Secretary of State. But I think once there's an invasion of Venezuela, or if they decide to re-up the subsidies and the gifts to Ukraine, I think you'll see a splintering and a fracturing of the movement that has supported the President, because I think a lot of people, including myself, were attracted to the president because of his reticence to get us involved in foreign war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, to date, they say nothing on or off the table, no specifics. We'll continue to track all the reporting on that. Senator Rand Paul, thank you for your time today. We'll be back in a moment.",

      "JASON CROW: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And it was that video that prompted some of this rhetoric from the President. I want to speak though about what's happening right now. I understand there was a bomb threat against your office in Aurora, Colorado, that your family has received painful death threats, even murder threats. Here is some of what your office released.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: These, I believe, are phone calls that were made to your office. Are any of these threats credible?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: We don't know, Margaret, we're going to take these seriously, but it's very disturbing stuff when you have the President of the United States threatening to execute and to hang and to arrest using this rhetoric, people listen to it. We've seen before a pattern of inciteful, dangerous rhetoric being used by the president and then people acting on that. You know, I lived through and experienced January 6, a very similar dynamic. He's been doing this for years, saying things and total disregard for the outcome, and what might happen when he throws this stuff out in the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the President has made these social media posts, but then he then sort of walked some of those threats back, saying he wasn't threatening death. He was saying sedition was often, in the past, punishable by death. And then, before you appeared here today, on social media he put out, \"the traitors that told the military to disobey my orders, should be in jail right now, not roaming the fake news networks. I guess that's us trying to explain what they said was okay. It wasn't and never will be. It was sedition at the highest level. It's a major crime. There can be no other interpretation of what they said.\" That's a quote from what he put on social media. Do you have any idea what all these threats actually mean? Because he mentioned in an interview military courts and referenced the DOJ as well.",
      "REP. CROW: No, we don't know what this means. He doesn't know what this means because he's irresponsible. He's acting dangerous. He's acting in an inciteful way. There's two things going on here Margaret. One is the irresponsible and dangerous rhetoric by the President of the United States threatening to have members of Congress executed who he disagrees with. But it's also so telling that when members of Congress simply remind service members of the Constitution and their duty to obey the law, which is not just our right, but is our obligation to do, that he cannot handle that, and he resorts to threats of violence and threats of arrest and execution. That tells you everything you need to know about Donald Trump's respect for the Constitution and the rule of law, and actually underscores our point.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let's get to the content of what you had in that video you released because there are also 15 House Republicans who are also veterans who released a video, including a retired three-star Marine Corps general, Jack Bergman. Take a listen to this.",

      "REP. JACK BERGMAN (R-MI) : Troops. Listen up. Any service member who refuses a lawful order is subject to court martial for violating the Uniform Code of Military Justice.",
      "REP. AUGUST PFLUGER (R-TX): We study what's lawful and what's not lawful, and the Democrats' stunt insinuating that there are illegal or unconstitutional orders. It's downright dangerous.",
      "REP. SCOTT PERRY (R-PA) : It is corrosive. It is meant to weaken our country and weaken the military.",
      "[ SOUND ON TAPE ENDS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you respond to these allegations from your colleagues, fellow veterans, that what you have put out there is weakening and corrosive to the military?",
      "REP. CROW: Well, these, unfortunately, are some of Trump's core supporters that are rallying behind the president, and they know better. They know exactly the difference between lawful versus unlawful. We were very clear in the video that what we're talking about is unlawful\u00a0 orders. You have the president's spokesperson going on into a press conference this past week and saying that we called for people to disobey lawful orders. They're simply lying because the truth is unacceptable to them. It's unacceptable. We wanted to start a conversation, and we did, about the dangerous rhetoric this president is using and the threats that he's made to use our military in an unlawful way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Specifically, what?",
      "REP. CROW: Well, send troops into Chicago, send troops into polling stations, kill terrorist families, arrest and execute, arrest and execute members of Congress--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --he hasn't done those things.",
      "REP. CROW: Shoot peaceful protesters in Lafayette Square, need I go on? He has a history of doing this, and if we wait until the moment that he gives a manifestly unlawful order to a young soldier, then we have failed them. We have to start that conversation now and get people thinking about the distinction which is exactly what we did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, so those were comments, not orders he gave, and social media posts and like, but- but I hear you that- that words matter. But the standard for troops, as I understand it, is that they should consult with the staff judge advocate, the staff legal counsel regarding orders, if they have legal questions. There is a process in place. Are you telling the rank and file troops to go outside of that practice?",
      "REP. CROW: No, absolutely not. Let me use an example of how this plays out and what this looks like downrange, as we say in the military--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Yeah, because it sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on those people down the chain.",
      "REP. CROW: I did three combat deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. And before each of those combat deployments, I sat my soldiers down, my paratroopers and my Rangers, and we talked about the law of war. We lo- we talked about lawful versus unlawful orders, about the protection of civilians in conflict, right? Because you can't wait until a soldier is in the moment and has to make a split-second decision about what to do to train them, right? You have to talk about it. You have to train them before, which was why we put this video out, to get people thinking about their obligation. And all of the threats and all of the things the President have said would be manifestly unlawful and would be the types of orders that people shouldn't carry through because they would be murder if people actually did the things that Donald Trump threatened.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But we don't know yet that the deployment of troops on U.S. soil, if you were referring to the National Guard deployments in major U.S. cities, is actually unlawful. That's- that's tied up in the courts right now.",
      "REP. JASON CROW: Well, we're talking about the decision of troops on the ground, out in operations, right? Their interface with civilians, shooting civilians, going to polling stations, which is a violation of U.S. criminal law. Things that are ma--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- these things haven't happened, you are afraid they will.",
      "REP. JASON CROW: --things that are manifestly unlawful, that our troops might be put in the position to carry out, because that has what- that is what the president has repeatedly threatened to do. So again, it's very telling that simply restating their obligation to the Constitution and the law, which we do constantly with our service members gets this type of response from the president. You know, I am not going to be threatened and intimidated by the president of the United States. I have a job to do, and that is to ensure people follow the law. I took an oath to this country. It is a lifetime oath that I intend to carry out, and I am not going to be intimidated and threatened by the president and stop reminding people to follow the law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But I've talked to lawyers about this, and military lawyers about this, and there is some frustration that, you know, lawmakers haven't been in Washington doing their job in terms of oversight. There aren't hearings on Venezuela, there aren't hearings on those deployments of the National Guard, and yet there are public videos calling on troops at low ranks to make decisions unto themselves here about what is lawful or unlawful, or recall their training, or talk to their staff judge advocate about this. I mean this- why not first publicly call for a hearing before you call on them?",
      "REP. CROW: First of all, two separate issues. So on the hearing, absolutely right. We are pushing the Trump administration to actually give us briefings, give us hearings. Mike Johnson- Speaker Johnson, shut Congress down twice, twice, to avoid votes on releasing the Epstein files.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He would argue Democrats shut down Congress to- for the healthcare argument.--",
      "REP. CROW: It's very clear what they did. I still came to D.C. anyhow and pushed for oversight and pushed for briefings. So I've been in Congress for seven years almost, and I have never seen the lack of briefings and oversight and ability to access information. I have been completely shut out of the DOD and the CIA at this point as a member of the Intelligence Committee and the Armed Services Committee. So this administration--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Isn't so much of this because the Republican leadership in Congress that isn't demanding those things.",
      "REP. CROW: Exactly, right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So-",
      "REP. CROW: Congress has the power to do this, so they're right. We need to be doing this. Democrats are trying to do it. We are being stonewalled and blocked by the Republicans, blocked by the- by the administration, because they actually don't want us to do the oversight, because they're afraid of what we're going to learn. And that is different, Margaret, than what we're talking about, you know, operational decisions, decisions to go to to, you know, war in the Caribbean, Venezuela, which are strictly within the purview of Congress. And Congress needs to be making those decisions and debating it, versus--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The White House says, oh it's not an act of war. It's, you know, foreign policy. And the president has a lot of leeway under the Constitution. That's their argument.",
      "REP. CROW: Well, we've been hearing this for 25 years, which is why Iraq and Afghanistan went on for as long as it did. We spent $3 trillion, lost 7000 service members' lives, and those ended poorly. Congress has to make that decision. Congress needs to be accountable for it, and Congress needs to be debating this before the American people, going to the American people and telling them why they should send their sons and daughters into conflict and they should spend hundreds of billions of dollars of their hard earned money. This president doesn't want that process to happen. And as somebody that did three combat tours in these wars, I've had enough of Congress being cut out of it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you'll see in some of our upcoming polling data that the American public would like more information about the plans for Venezuela, which you were referencing there. Congressman Crow, thank you.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Democratic Senator Mark Kelly, who joins us from Tucson, Arizona. Welcome back to Face The Nation, senator.",
      "SEN. KELLY: Thank you for having me on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to pick up where we left off on this topic of political violence. I know your family has suffered because of it, very, very directly. And then this past week, the president called that video. You participated in, \"sedition.\" You heard me read what he said again this morning, \"sedition at the highest level and a major crime.\" Have you- do you have credible threats? How concerned are you about your security at this point?",
      "SEN. KELLY: Well, Margaret, what the President said is very serious. I didn't think he would step over the, over that line calling for the execution of members of Congress, and his words carry tremendous weight, more so than anybody else in the country, and he should be aware of that. And because of what he says, there is now an increased threats against us. I'm not going to get into details on my personal security, but as the husband of Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, we- I understand what political violence is. The president should as well. Just like Gabby, somebody tried to assassinate him, and he should understand that his words, have you know, could have serious, serious consequences.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I remember just weeks ago, hearing from the president and other Republicans about the need to dial back the rhetoric after the tragic shooting of Charlie Kirk. When it comes to your\u2013",
      "SEN. KELLY: Yeah, what happened to that? I mean, that was two months ago. Where are they now? We've heard very little, basically crickets, from Republicans in the United States Congress about what the President has said about hanging members of Congress.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's what I wanted to ask you. Why aren't we hearing from your Republican colleagues and in terms of your security, I understand there was a request for you to get a boost in Capitol Hill security support. Are Republican members on board with that?",
      "SEN. KELLY: I don't know. I've heard them say, you know very little about this. I think you know the President tries to intimidate them. He tries to intimidate Congress. He looks at government accountability as a nuisance. And I think it's really important for people to understand, Margaret, that the message he sent a couple days ago was, he declared that loyalty to the Constitution is now punishable by death. Those are serious words coming from the President of the United States. He's trying to intimidate us, but Margaret, I'm not going to be intimidated. You know, you just heard Jason Crow. He's not going to be intimidated either. We both served our country. We swore an oath. All we said is we reiterated what basically is the rule of law that members of the military should not, cannot follow illegal orders.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, on that point, in terms of lawful and unlawful orders, it gets complicated for rank-and-file to understand. I understand and other networks have reported that the senior judge advocate down at SOUTHCOM raised serious doubts about the legality of the strikes on those alleged drug votes, but was contradicted by lawyers at the executive branch. Have you spoken to the SOUTHCOM commander? Do you- are you hearing that there are unlawful orders being given?",
      "SEN. KELLY: Well, we're hearing the same thing that you are. The administration hasn't shared much information with us. I read the legal analysis. It was just like the briefs. They're tying themselves in knots trying to explain why what they're doing with regards to these drug boats is legal and it's, it's questionable at best. Our- one of our biggest allies, the United Kingdom, recently stopped sharing intelligence with us in the Caribbean because they question whether this is legal or not. We've been asking for more briefings from the right people. We have not received them, but the information that you just shared with me is the, is the public information. I don't have much more beyond that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and the French government has said it's a violation of international law and the law of the sea. That's what our allies are saying about those strikes that are happening there. But, is that why\u2013",
      "SEN. KELLY: But, Margaret getting back to\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013you made this video?",
      "SEN. KELLY: No. The reason why we made this video is a couple things. This president, from before he was in office as he was a candidate, to the time he was in office in his first administration, has said things that cause us great concern. There is a trend here. When he was running for president, the first time he talked about he wanted the military, he said he would, he would- the military should be killing the families of terrorists. And when he was told that that was illegal, this was on a debate stage, he basically said that the military will not refuse to follow my orders, that they will carry out his orders regardless of what they were. Shooting protesters in the legs is something he brought up in his first administration and thankfully, Mark Esper, his Secretary of Defense, and Mark Milley, you know, basically told him, you cannot do that. If they weren't there, think of what possibly could have happened. So, we're concerned\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I need- yeah, I'm sorry. I just want to make sure I get to you on Ukraine, because there's so much happening, and I know you're such a big supporter of Ukraine. There are three prominent U.S. senators who have gone on the record now, including Republican Mike Rounds, who said yesterday, Secretary of State Rubio told them he was unaware of a threat to cut off U.S. support to Ukraine if they don't accept this proposed plan that's on the table. Here is how Senator Rounds described it.",
      "SEN. MIKE ROUNDS SOT: What he told us was that this was not the American proposal. This was a proposal which was received by someone who has identified and they believe to be representing Russia in this proposal. It was given to Mr. Witkoff.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So since those remarks were made and backed up by multiple senators, I've received phone calls from Senior White House officials from, from senior U.S. officials saying, no, no, no, that's not at all what, what Secretary Rubio said. What version of events do we believe here in terms of what America is putting forward?",
      "SEN. KELLY: Margaret, they've got to clear this up. You have Rubio talking to my Senate colleague, saying one thing. The spokesperson for the State Department saying another. Your conversations with the White House contradict what the Secretary of State and, by the way, the National Security Adviser, same guy, has said about this. They've got, they've got to figure this out and get the message out and explain to the American people what's going on. I will say this, that, that, that plan, that's Putin's plan. That is a very good deal for Russia. It is a horrible deal for Ukraine, for our allies and even for our own national security. If Putin gets the chance with that deal to, you know, rearm, rebuild his economy and gain territory, by the way, that's what he wanted. Then the Baltics, Poland, Romania, all those other countries down the line are at threat.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the U.S. keeps emphasizing it is a working document, so it may be in a different state than what was leaked by an anti-Zelensky politician, but Ukraine's Ambassador did tell us there's a separate security guarantee document. What, what needs to be in there that would actually protect Ukraine? Does that need to go for a vote before the U.S. Congress?",
      "SEN. KELLY: Well, it depends on what it is, but Congress should be involved. If there is a treaty with Ukraine on their own security, it's something that we would want to have some say in. And ultimately we would vote on in the United States Senate we would send to the president, but they need to be talking to us about this, on both sides of the aisle. Often the path they're going on recently is to just share information with the Republicans and even my Republican colleagues don't seem to like that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No.",
      "SEN. KELLY: But, that's what this White House is, is doing, and it's because they don't want congressional oversight in, in any way, whether it's on Ukraine, Venezuela, or any, any issue.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, we got to leave it there, senator, but to your point, a number of very fiery statements from Republican senators in the past few hours. We'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.",

Greene previously pushed back on reporting from NOTUS that she was telling people she wants to run for president as well.",

But it is also based on previous and ongoing input from Ukraine.\"",

      "\"As the Administration has consistently maintained, this plan was authored by the United States, with input from both the Russians and Ukrainians,\" a senior U.S. official told CBS News in a statement Saturday night. \"This plan has always been a hopeful start to continued negotiations, and eventually the signing of a final peace agreement once and for all.\"",
      "Shaheen said Rubio is on his way to Geneva for talks with the Europeans and Ukrainians. She said Rubio reached out to her and Republican Sen. Mike Rounds from South Dakota.",

      "\"We should not do anything that makes (Putin) feel like he has a win here. Honestly, I think what Mitch said was short of what should be said,\" said Tillis.",
      "Tillis announced earlier this year that he would not seek reelection shortly after he clashed with the Trump administration over its tax and spending package.",
      "Putin welcomed the proposal late Friday, saying it \"could form the basis of a final peace settlement\" if the U.S. can get Ukraine and its European allies to agree.",
      "Zelenskyy, in an address, did not reject the plan outright, but insisted on fair treatment while pledging to \"work calmly\" with Washington and other partners in what he called \"truly one of the most difficult moments in our history.\"",
      "Earlier Saturday, Shaheen, Tillis, King, and Democratic Sens. Peter Welch of Vermont and Chris Coons of Delaware \u2013 all of whom are on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \u2014 issued a joint statement which said: \"We share significant concerns over the details of the reported peace plan that has been released. For over 10 years, Russia has illegally occupied Ukrainian territory and for almost 4 years, Ukraine has admirably defended itself against Russia's attempts to fully occupy Ukraine. No one wants a just and lasting peace more than the Ukrainian people. However, we will not achieve that lasting peace by offering Putin concession after concession and fatally degrading Ukraine's ability to defend itself.\"",
      "In its 17th year, about 300 people gather annually at the Halifax International Security Forum held at Halifax's Westin hotel. The forum attracts military officials, U.S. senators, diplomats and scholars but this year the Trump administration suspended participation of U.S. defense officials in events by think tanks, including the Halifax International Security Forum.",
      "A large number of U.S. senators made the trip this year in part because of strained relations between Canada and the U.S. Mr. Trump has alienated America's neighbor with his trade war and insistence that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state. Many Canadians now refuse to travel to the U.S. and border states like Shaheen's New Hampshire are seeing a dramatic drop in tourism.",
      "\"There's real concern about that strain. That's one reason why there's such a big delegation is here,\" Shaheen said. \"I will continue to object to what the president is doing in terms about tariffs and his comments because they are not only detrimental to Canada and our relationship, but I think they are detrimental globally. They show a lack of respect of sovereign nations.\"",

    "summary": "The Justice Department asked a court to unseal grand jury transcripts in the sex trafficking cases of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell.",
    "story": [
      "The Justice Department on Friday asked a court to unseal grand jury transcripts in the sex trafficking cases of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell.",
      "The motion, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida by Attorney General Pam Bondi, follows the congressional passage this week of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, a bill that compels the Justice Department to release all unclassified records related to Epstein within 30 days.",
      "\"In the light of the Act's clear mandate, the Court should authorize the Department of Justice to release the grand jury transcripts and lift any preexisting protective orders that would otherwise prevent public disclosure,\" the Justice Department wrote in its motion.",
      "It stated that it would \"make appropriate redactions of victim-related and other personal identifying information.\"",
      "The motion, which was also signed by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and U.S. Attorney Jason Quinones, asks the court to \"lift any and all preexisting protective orders that would prevent the Department from complying with the Act.\"",
      "The Justice Department filed an expedited ruling given the Epstein Act's 30-day deadline.",
      "President Trump, who at one time had a friendship with Epstein and had been against the bill, dropped his opposition and signed it into law on Wednesday. Mr. Trump, who cut ties with Epstein years ago, has not been accused of wrongdoing.",
      "In July 2019, a New York federal grand jury indicted Epstein on child sex trafficking charges, about five weeks before he was found dead in a Manhattan jail. His death was later ruled a suicide.",
      "Then, in June 2020, a New York federal grand jury indicted Maxwell, Epstein's former partner, of conspiring with Epstein and helping to facilitate and operate his sex trafficking ring. She was convicted in December 2021 and sentenced to 20 years in prison.",
      "This marks the latest attempt by the Justice Department to unseal Epstein and Maxwell's grand jury records.",
      "In August, a New York judge denied a similar Justice Department request to unseal grand jury material in the Maxwell case, arguing that anyone \"who reviewed these materials expecting, based on the Government's representations, to learn new information about Epstein's and Maxwell's crimes and the investigation into them, would come away feeling disappointed and misled. There is no 'there' there.\"",
      "Epstein, a wealthy financier known for his connections to political elites and high-profile people, was under federal probes for decades over allegations of sex trafficking. In 2008, he pleaded guilty in Florida to state charges of soliciting prostitution in exchange for having a federal case against him dropped. He served 13 months in county jail and had to register as a sex offender.",
      "The Epstein case received renewed attention starting in July when the Justice Department released a two-page memo stating that a \"systematic review\" had \"revealed\" that Epstein had \"incriminating 'client list,' and that \"no credible evidence found that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals as part of his actions.\"",
      "The memo, which prompted an outcry from Epstein accusers, came after Bondi had said in a February interview that there was an Epstein client list \"sitting on my desk right now.\"",
      "Several batches of Epstein-linked documents have been intermittently released throughout the years. The latest such release occurred earlier this month, when a tranche of tens of thousands of pages of documents were released by both House Democrats and the House Oversight Committee.",
      "Joe  Walsh and \n                                                  \n                                  Jacob  Rosen\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump says he's enlisting the help of legendary golfer\u00a0Jack Nicklaus\u00a0to spruce up the courses at Joint Base Andrews \u2014 adding a site long known as the \"president's golf course\" to his long and still-growing\u00a0list of construction projects.",
      "The president took an aerial tour of the Courses at Andrews aboard Marine One on Saturday and promised, \"We're going to do some work\" there, as well as to other parts of the base.",
      "\"We're doing some fix-up of the base, which it needs. We're gonna try and reinstitute the golf courses. I'm meeting with the greatest Jack Nicklaus,\" Mr. Trump told reporters outside the White House before boarding Marine One to head to Andrews. \"He's involved in trying to bring their recreational facility back.\"",
      "Located in Maryland, about 15 miles from the White House, Andrews houses Air Force One. Gerald R. Ford was the first president to golf there in 1974, but the facility was most recently a favorite of Barack Obama.",
      "An 11th Force Support Squadron asset, the facilities include three 18-hole golf courses, three practice putting greens, two private practice areas and a driving range, according to the Andrews website. Trump said at least two of the courses could get facelifts.",
      "Mr. Trump has infrequently golfed at Andrews, but prefers to spend most weekends playing at or near one of his own properties. Those are Bedminster in New Jersey, or\u00a0Mar-a-Lago\u00a0in Palm Beach, Florida. On those weekends he remains at the White House, Trump often golfs at his course in Sterling, Virginia, near Dulles International Airport.",
      "Nicklaus won 18 professional majors and 73 times on the PGA Tour. The Nicklaus Design firm features a team that has completed more than 425 courses in 40 states and more than 45 countries.",
      "Mr. Trump said Saturday that the base at Andrews \"was a great place that's been destroyed over the years through lack of maintenance.\"",
      "\"So we'll fix that up, and Jack will be the architect and he'll design it,\" the president said.",
      "He also referenced, \"Two existing courses that are in very bad shape,\" saying, \"we can \u2014 for very little money \u2014 fix it up.\"",
      "\"And we're looking at other things over at Andrews,' Trump added.",
      "Mr. Trump's comments immediately raised questions about who is paying Nicklaus and how much such design services might cost. Also, given that Andrews is military property, who pays for improvements to its golf courses or other parts of its grounds was also unclear. The White House and the public affairs team at Andrews did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment on Saturday.",
      "The potential Andrews redesign follows construction crews already having demolished the East Wing of the White House to make room for a $300 million\u00a0ballroom\u00a0that Trump commissioned. He's promised that it is being paid for by himself and private donors \u2014 including\u00a037 individuals, firms and charitable organizations\u00a0that have publicly disclosed contributing to the project.",
      "Work on the ballroom follows Mr. Trump having\u00a0replaced\u00a0the lawn in the Rose Garden with a patio area reminiscent of Mar-a-Lago, and redecorated the Lincoln Bathroom and Palm Room in the White House's interior. The president also installed a Walk of Fame featuring portraits of past presidents along the Colonnade, massive flagpoles on the north and south lawns and substantially overhauled the Oval Office through the addition of golden flourishes, cherubs and other flashy items.",
      "The work at Andrews may eventually join another off-White House site projects Trump has announced publicly: his plan to erect a Paris-style arch just west of the Lincoln Memorial.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's meeting with incoming New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani on Friday was not expected to be warm and congenial. The two politicians agree on very little, and they've lobbed attacks at each other for months, with Mr. Trump calling Mamdani a \"100% communist lunatic\" and Mamdani describing himself as \"Donald Trump's worst nightmare.\"",
      "But instead, the two men seemed to hit it off. In a surreal 30-minute Oval Office appearance, Mr. Trump lavished Mamdani with praise, calling him \"very rational\" and predicting he could do \"really great\" things for their shared hometown. Mamdani, standing beside Mr. Trump, steered clear of criticizing the president \u2014 sometimes with an assist from Mr. Trump himself \u2014 and pledged to work with the administration on cost-of-living issues.",
      "Here are the highlights:",
      "\"I think you're going to have, hopefully, a really great mayor\"",
      "Mr. Trump was unceasingly optimistic about Mamdani, saying that during a private one-on-one meeting before their public appearance, the two men agreed on more than he expected. He pointed to Mamdani's focus on affordability and stated desire to build more housing.",
      "\"I think you're going to have, hopefully, a really great mayor,\" the president said. \"The better he does, the happier I am.\"",
      "\"I think he is going to surprise some conservative people\"",
      "Days before the election, Mr. Trump had encouraged people to vote for Mamdani's chief rival, Democratic governor-turned-independent Andrew Cuomo.",
      "But on Friday, the president said: \"I feel very confident that he can do a very good job\u2026I think he is going to surprise some conservative people, actually. And some very liberal people, he won't surprise them because they already like him.\"",
      "\"I expect to be helping him, not hurting him\"",
      "For months, Mr. Trump has flirted with cutting off federal financial support to New York City if Mamdani wins, suggesting it would be a waste.",
      "After their meeting, Mr. Trump didn't fully back away from the threat, but said it was unlikely.",
      "\"I expect to be helping him, not hurting him,\" Mr. Trump said. \"A big help. Because I want New York City to be great. Look, I love New York City, it's where I come from, I spent a lot of years there. ... I think this mayor could do some things that are going to be really great.\"",
      "Does Mamdani think Trump is a fascist? \"That's okay, you can just say yes,\" president says",
      "At various points, reporters pressed Mamdani on whether he stands by his prior attacks on Mr. Trump \u2014\u00a0 and the president helped him dodge.",
      "One reporter asked Mamdani if he believes Mr. Trump is a \"fascist.\" As the incoming mayor began to answer, the president laughed and cut him off.",
      "\"That's okay, you can just say yes,\" Mr. Trump interjected, patting Mamdani on the arm. \"That's easier. It's easier than explaining it. I don't mind.\"",
      "Earlier in the meeting, Mamdani was asked if he still believes Mr. Trump is a \"despot.\"",
      "Said Mr. Trump: \"I've been called much worse than a despot, so it's not that insulting. I think he'll change his mind after we get to working together.\"",
      "\"He's got views that [are] a little out there, but who knows\"",
      "The president also deflected when asked about his claim that Mamdani is a \"communist.\"",
      "Said Mr. Trump: \"He's got views that [are] a little out there, but who knows. I mean, we're going to see what works.\"",
      "\"He's going to change, also. We all change. I changed a lot,\" the president continued.",
      "Mamdani describes himself as a democratic socialist, not a communist. He stood by that label on Friday.",
      "Trump: Mamdani isn't a \"jihadist,\" he's \"very rational\"",
      "Earlier this month, GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik \u2014 a candidate for governor of New York \u2014 called Mamdani an \"Antisemite Jihadist Communist.\"",
      "Asked if he agrees that Mamdani is a \"jihadist,\" Mr. Trump said no.",
      "\"I met with a man who's a very rational person. I met with a man who really wants to see New York be great again,\" the president continued.",
      "\"I would feel very, very comfortable being in New York\"",
      "Mr. Trump \u2014 a Queens native whose primary residence is now in Florida \u2014 said he'd feel comfortable moving back to New York City under Mamdani's leadership.",
      "\"I would feel very, very comfortable being in New York, and I think much more so after the meeting,\" he said.",
      "The pair's views on crime and immigration enforcement came up repeatedly on Friday. The president expressed confidence in Mamdani: He said he believes the mayor-elect cares about public safety, and praised Mamdani for choosing to retain\u00a0New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch.",
      "\"That's a good sign,\" the president said.",
      "Trump: \"A lot of my voters actually voted for him, and I'm okay with that\"",
      "Mamdani pointed out that Mr. Trump's vote share in New York City jumped last year, which he attributed mostly to worries about affordability. And the mayor-elect noted that he swept up some Trump voters, which the president appreciated.",
      "\"He said a lot of my voters actually voted for him, and I'm okay with that,\" the president said.",
      "\"I think he's different than your typical guy\"",
      "Mr. Trump, for his part, praised Mamdani for the former state legislator's unexpected come-from-behind victory in the Democratic primary.",
      "\"He came out of nowhere,\" said the president. \"I watched. I said, 'Who is this guy?'\"",
      "Left unmentioned were the parallels with Mr. Trump's own insurgent victory in the 2016 Republican primary.",
      "Asked why Mamdani has drawn so much enthusiasm, Mr. Trump said: \"I think he's different than your typical guy, runs, wins, becomes mayor maybe and nothing exciting.\"",

    "story": [
      "Some U.S. lawmakers criticized the Trump administration's proposed 28-point peace plan designed to end the Ukraine-Russia war on Saturday, saying the framework appears to favor Moscow.",
      "The deal would require Ukraine to give up its eastern Donbas region and Crimea, and swear off NATO membership, according to a draft shared publicly by a Ukrainian opposition politician and confirmed by a White House official. The plan includes feedback from Russian and Ukrainian officials, and diplomatic conversations about it are ongoing. President Trump gave Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a suggested deadline of Thanksgiving Day to respond to the plan.",
      "Members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, including Democrat Jeanne Shaheen and Republican Thom Tillis, said in a statement on Saturday that they had \"significant concerns over the details of the reported peace plan.\"",
      "\"For over 10 years, Russia has illegally occupied Ukrainian territory and for almost 4 years, Ukraine has admirably defended itself against Russia's attempts to fully occupy Ukraine. No one wants a just and lasting peace more than the Ukrainian people,\" the committee members said in a statement. \"However, we will not achieve that lasting peace by offering Putin concession after concession and fatally degrading Ukraine's ability to defend itself.\"",
      "\"History teaches us that Putin only understands strength and will not abide by any agreement unless it is backed by force,\" the statement continued. \"We must consult closely with our Ukrainian and NATO partners on the path forward. We should put real pressure on Russia to come to the negotiating table. And we must make clear to the Kremlin\u2014and would-be aggressors in Beijing\u2014that America will stand unwaveringly in defense of freedom.\"",
      "Co-chairs of the bipartisan Congressional Ukraine Caucus also criticized the reported peace plan, saying it \"appears to favor the interest of the aggressor,\" Russian President Vladimir Putin, \"over the sovereignty and security of a democratic Ukraine.\"",
      "\"This framework does not offer a genuine path to lasting peace, but instead, demands the surrender and capitulation of Ukraine to Russian aggression,\" the caucus said in a statement shared on Saturday.",
      "The Trump administration's backing of the plan \"raises serious concerns,\" the caucus said.",
      "\"The international community must remain firm in supporting Ukraine, upholding the principles of territorial integrity and self-determination, and rejecting any plan that rewards an aggressor,\" the caucus said. \"Lasting peace comes not from conceding to aggression, but from the strength and unity of free nations that refuse to bow to it.\"",
      "European governments were not involved in drafting the proposal, according to European officials contacted by CBS News. Western leaders gathered at the G20 summit in South Africa said Saturday that the plan needs \"additional work.\"",
      "The plan emerged following recent meetings between the U.S. and officials from both Russia and Ukraine. Mr. Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, met with a key adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kirill Dmitriev, on Oct. 24 in Miami, to develop the plan, CBS News reported Thursday.",
      "Ukrainian envoys are set to meet with a U.S. delegation \u2014 including Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Witkoff \u2014 in Geneva, Switzerland, to discuss the proposal. Nine Ukrainian officials, including Zelenskyy's chief of staff, are set to take part in the talks, the Associated Press reported.",

    "story": [
      "Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia announced on X Friday she will resign from Congress early next year, after a weekslong falling-out with President Trump and much of her party.",
      "Her last day will be Jan. 5, 2026, Greene said.",
      "In a statement, the hard-right congresswoman expressed frustration with her party and with the change of pace in Congress, writing that GOP leadership had refused to work on addressing health care costs, and bills that she drafted on immigration and other issues had sat \"collecting dust.\" She said the \"legislature has been mostly sidelined.\"",
      "She also pointed to her dramatic break with Mr. Trump. The president pulled his support from Greene last week, calling her \"wacky\" and a \"traitor\" after she criticized Republicans' handling of several issues. She has claimed that Mr. Trump was set off by her push to disclose records related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which the president previously opposed before endorsing and later signing a bill to release the records this week.",
      "\"Standing up for American women who were raped at 14, trafficked and used by rich powerful men, should not result in me being called a traitor and threatened by the President of the United States, whom I fought for,\" Greene wrote, saying her \"self worth is not defined by a man, but instead by God.\"",
      "On Mr. Trump's threat to back a primary challenger in her deep-red district, Greene said: \"I have too much self respect and dignity, love my family way too much, and do not want my sweet district to have to endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the President we all fought for, only to fight and win my election while Republicans will lose the midterms.\"",
      "\"It's all so absurd and completely unserious,\" she said. \"I refuse to be a 'battered wife' hoping it all goes away and gets better.\"",
      "Mr. Trump reacted to the news of Greene's resignation on Saturday, saying it was because of \"PLUMMETING Poll Numbers and not wanting to face a Primary Challenger with a strong Trump Endorsement (where she would have no chance of winning!)\"",
      "\"For some reason, primarily that I refused to return her never ending barrage of phone calls, Marjorie went BAD,\" Mr. Trump\u00a0wrote on Truth Social. \"Nevertheless, I will always appreciate Marjorie, and thank her for her service to our Country!",
      "In recent days, Trump's political operation has been receiving inquiries from potential Republican contenders to challenge Greene, a GOP source familiar with the situation told CBS News.",
      "In a\u00a0statement posted to X, Georgia GOP Chairman Josh McKoon called Greene a \"tireless fighter.\"",
      "\"While her decision to step down from Congress effective January 5 comes as a surprise amid recent challenges, her legacy as a bold voice for the grassroots will endure,\" he said.",
      "If Greene's resignation leaves her seat vacant, it could tighten the GOP's already razor-thin margin in the House until it's filled with a special election. Under Georgia state law, the governor must issue a writ of special election within 10 days of a House vacancy, and the election is required to be held 30 days after that, according to the\u00a0National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "Greene's political status has been upended over the last month and a half. She has broken with a president she defended for years and clashed with her party's top congressional leaders, drawing plaudits from Democratic lawmakers who once voted to take away her committee assignments due to conspiratorial comments.",
      "It began during the government shutdown, which was driven in part by Democrats' push to extend a set of expiring health insurance tax credits in exchange for their votes to fund federal agencies. Republican leadership had argued the government should reopen before negotiating on health care.",
      "Greene publicly lashed out at her party, accusing leadership of failing to come up with a plan to prevent the massive health insurance premium increases that many families could face next year if the tax credits aren't extended. She also criticized Speaker Mike Johnson for keeping the House out of session for the duration of the shutdown.",
      "Asked by CBS News if he found any surprise GOP allies during the shutdown fight, the top House Democrat, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, answered: \"Three words \u2014 Marjorie Taylor Greene.\"",
      "Greene has also criticized the Trump administration for focusing on foreign policy rather than affordability issues at home.",
      "And her stance on the Epstein files had conflicted with Mr. Trump's. Greene and three other House Republicans joined with Democrats to force a vote on a bill ordering the release of government documents on Epstein, elevating an issue that animates many Trump allies, but one the president has long cast as a distraction by Democrats and \"stupid\" Republicans.",
      "Greene called Mr. Trump's position on the issue \"a huge miscalculation\" in an interview last week with \"CBS Mornings,\" arguing that the president has nothing to hide. Mr. Trump eventually came out in favor of the bill, which passed the House and Senate nearly unanimously this week and was signed into law on Wednesday.",
      "In a Truth Social post last week, the president said Greene \"has gone Far Left,\" and wrote that \"all I see 'Wacky' Marjorie do is COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN!\" He argued that she was upset because he discouraged her from running in next year's closely contested Georgia Senate race.",
      "Greene, meanwhile, has cast her break with the GOP and the president as a product of her commitment to the \"America First\" agenda widely associated with Mr. Trump.",
      "\"If I am cast aside by MAGA Inc and replaced by Neocons, Big Pharma, Big Tech, Military Industrial War Complex, foreign leaders, and the elite donor class that can't even relate to real Americans, then many common Americans have been cast aside and replaced as well,\" she wrote in Friday's statement.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-website-change-vaccines-autism/",
    "published": "Sat, 22 Nov 2025 09:58:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Multiple CDC officials familiar with the situation said the change was made by political appointees without input from relevant agency staffers.",
    "story": [
      "A page of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website was changed Thursday to include a false claim about autism and vaccines. Multiple CDC officials familiar with the situation said the change was made by political appointees inside the Department of Health and Human Services without input from relevant agency staffers.",
      "The page about vaccines and autism formerly said that \"no links have been found between any vaccine ingredients and Autism spectrum disorder.\" The website has now been changed to say, \"'Vaccines do not cause autism' is not an evidence-based claim\" \u2014 a statement the Autism Science Foundation calls \"misinformation\" that \"actually contradicts the best available science.\" The CDC page also falsely claims that studies supporting a link between vaccines and autism have \"been ignored by health authorities.\"",
      "Previously, changes have only occurred in consultation with subject matter experts at the agency's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities and its National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. The CDC sources told CBS News political appointees at HHS devised the change and instructed an employee inside the office of acting CDC Director Jim O'Neil to make it.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine critic, later said in an\u00a0interview with The New York Times\u00a0that he personally ordered the change.",
      "Autism is a developmental disability caused by differences in the brain. It presents with a wide range of symptoms that can include delays in language, learning, and social or emotional skills. The National Institutes of Health has committed hundreds of millions of dollars a year to studying the condition and trying to understand how and why it develops.",
      "The debunked theory that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine causes autism has its roots in a 1998 study that was\u00a0found to be fraudulent\u00a0and has been retracted. Since then, \"independent researchers across seven countries have conducted more than 40 high-quality studies involving over 5.6 million people,\" said American Academy of Pediatrics president Susan Kressly in a statement decrying the website change.",
      "\"We are at a very dangerous moment for the health of America's children,\" said Dr. Sean O'Leary, chair of the AAP's Committee on Infectious Diseases, in a news briefing on Thursday.",
      "Research has found no evidence of increased rates of autism among those who are vaccinated compared to those who are not. Vaccines also undergo intensive safety testing. Research shows that genetics play a role in autism diagnoses. The NIH says some possible risk factors for autism include prenatal exposure to pesticides or air pollution, extreme prematurity or low birth weight, certain maternal health conditions, or parents conceiving at an older age.",
      "\"There is overwhelming evidence that vaccines do not cause autism,\" said Dr. Mandy Cohen, a former CDC director. \"This change to CDC language undermines the agency's scientific integrity, damaging its credibility on vaccines and other health recommendations. Most concerning, it risks endangering children by driving down vaccination rates and leaving kids vulnerable to preventable diseases like measles and whooping cough.\"",
      "In a statement, HHS communications director Andrew Nixon said, \"This is a common-sense update that brings CDC's website in line with our commitment to transparency and gold standard science.",
      "\"As the updated page explains, the claim that 'vaccines do not cause autism' is not supported by comprehensive evidence, as studies to date have not definitively ruled out potential associations. Some research suggesting possible biologic mechanisms has been ignored or dismissed by public health agencies, and HHS is committed to finding a definitive answer,\" Nixon said.",
      "Leading autism advocacy groups dispute that.",
      "The Autism Science Foundation\u00a0said in a statement\u00a0it was \"appalled\" by the change to the CDC's website, and highlighted the decades of research into the topic. Alison Singer, the co-founder and president of the ASF, said that while researchers \"can't do a scientific study to show that something does not cause something else,\" there are a \"mountain of studies that we have exonerating vaccines as a cause of autism.\"",
      "\"I think the question of whether vaccines causes autism is one that science can answer, and science has answered it,\" Singer said in Thursday's news briefing.",
      "A subhead saying that \"Vaccines do not cause autism\" remains on the CDC website with an asterisk next to it. The bottom of the page explains that the header remains in place because of an agreement with Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, a physician who is the chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and backed Kennedy during his confirmation hearings. Cassidy said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that he supported Kennedy in part because of \"serious commitments\" from the Trump administration, but did not specify what those were.",
      "\"I'm a doctor who has seen people die from vaccine-preventable diseases,\" Cassidy wrote on social media on Thursday afternoon. \"What parents need to hear right now is vaccines for measles, polio, hepatitis B and other childhood diseases are safe and effective and will not cause autism. Any statement to the contrary is wrong, irresponsible, and actively makes Americans sicker.\"",
      "Cassidy highlighted recent outbreaks of whooping cough and measles. He also called for more research into \"the real causes of autism,\" and criticized\u00a0HHS funding\u00a0cuts.",
      "\"Redirecting attention to factors we definitely know DO NOT cause autism denies families the answers they deserve,\" Cassidy wrote.",
      "Other health agency pages with information about autism and vaccines had not been changed as of early Thursday afternoon.",
      "Kennedy has previously pushed the\u00a0discredited claim\u00a0that routine\u00a0childhood shots\u00a0cause autism. President Trump has also falsely suggested vaccines could be to blame for autism rates. Both expressed concern about rising rates of\u00a0autism diagnoses, which appear to be driven by a variety of factors including\u00a0increased awareness\u00a0and changes in how the condition is diagnosed.",
      "O'Leary said he feared the website changes would \"scare parents and further stigmatize\" people with autism.",
      "\"We have been dealing with these falsehoods for many years. They are not new. We have been promoting the science, and we're going to continue to do that, as are the other professional societies,\" he said. \"The problem is now it's coming from, these falsehoods are coming for our federal government.\"",
      "Experts have previously raised concerns about Kennedy reviving debunked theories about the cause of autism. In April, Kennedy announced the CDC would conduct a \"massive testing and research effort\" to find out what causes the disorder, and hired David Geier, a man who repeatedly claimed a link between vaccines and autism, to lead the effort. Kennedy said the work would be completed by September, though other health officials later pushed the timeline.",
      "Dr. Fiona Havers, an infectious disease physician and former CDC official, said that the website change showed scientists \"who in the past carefully vetted scientific information have been pushed aside.\"",
      "The \"CDC should be a data-driven agency based on science and not ideology, but when you take the scientists out of the process you get rhetoric that can harm families,\" said former CDC chief science and medical officer Dr. Debra Houry, who lresigned from the agency earlier this year.",

      "Abortion is again illegal in North Dakota after the state's Supreme Court on Friday couldn't muster the required majority to uphold a judge's ruling that struck down the state's ban last year.",
      "The 2023 law makes it a felony crime for anyone to perform an abortion, though it specifically protects patients from prosecution. Doctors could be prosecuted and penalized by as much as five years in prison and a $10,000 fine.",
      "Three justices agreed that the ban is unconstitutionally vague under the state constitution. The other two justices said the law is not unconstitutional.",
      "The state constitution requires at least four of the five justices to agree for a law to be found unconstitutional, a high bar. Not enough members of the court joined together to affirm the lower court ruling.",
      "In his opinion, Justice Jerod Tufte said the natural rights guaranteed by the state constitution in 1889 do not extend to abortion rights. He also said the law \"provides adequate and fair warning to those attempting to comply.\"",
      "North Dakota Republican Attorney Drew Wrigley welcomed the ruling, saying, \"The Supreme Court has upheld this important pro-life legislation, enacted by the people's Legislature. The Attorney General's office has the solemn responsibility of defending the laws of North Dakota, and today those laws have been upheld.\"",
      "Republican state Sen. Janne Myrdal, who introduced the 2023 legislation that became the law banning abortion, said she is \"thrilled and grateful that two justices that are highly respected saw the truth of the matter, that this is fully constitutional for the mother and for the unborn child and thereafter for that sake.\"",
      "Attorneys for the challengers did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The ruling means access to abortion in North Dakota will be outlawed. Even after a judge had earlier struck down the ban last year, the only scenarios for a patient to obtain an abortion in North Dakota had been for life- or health-preserving reasons in a hospital.",
      "The only abortion provider relocated in 2022 from Fargo to nearby Moorhead, Minnesota.",

    "summary": "A Coast Guard personnel directive updated language identifying symbols of racial or religious hatred, setting off a political firestorm this week.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Coast Guard is scrambling to clarify proposed internal policy changes that appeared to loosen how the service branch handles the conduct within its ranks involving hate symbols including nooses, swastikas, and other extremist symbols \u2014 touching off a political firestorm inside the nation's smallest military branch after the Space Force.",
      "The controversy centers on a little-noticed personnel directive signed on Nov. 13 by Rear Admiral Charles Fosse, the assistant commandant for personnel, following a report by the Washington Post. The document, titled \"Harassing Behavior Prevention, Response and Accountability,\" contained a provision that proposed replacing longstanding language that explicitly identified swastikas, nooses, Confederate iconography and other symbols of racial or religious hatred as \"incidents of hatred and prejudice.\"",
      "Instead, the Coast Guard's new policy recast those same images as \"potentially divisive,\" a subtle but consequential shift that alarmed lawmakers and civil rights groups when it was first reported this week.",
      "What did the original policy actually change?",
      "The internal guidance that ignited the controversy introduced a few changes. The Coast Guard eliminated the term \"hate incident.\" Instead, conduct previously handled under that category was referred to as harassment \u2014 and only when a specific victim could be identified.",
      "The guidance also raised the threshold for disciplinary action by specifying that public displays of extremist symbols would constitute misconduct only if they could be shown to harm \"good order and discipline, unit cohesion, command climate, morale or mission effectiveness.\"",
      "Further, the policy also allowed symbols \"widely identified with oppression or hatred\" to be displayed in private or non-public settings, including military housing. The policy removed gender identity from the list of protected characteristics altogether, aligning the Coast Guard with Mr. Trump's January executive order barring transgender service.",
      "It also required that harassment be \"severe or pervasive\" and judged by a \"reasonable person.\" And it went out of its way to note that hazing \u2014 even when it involves physical force \u2014 can serve \"a proper military or other governmental purpose,\" a framing that echoes Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's push to cultivate a tougher \"warrior ethos.\"",
      "What was the response?",
      "For years, Coast Guard policy has drawn a bright line on extremist symbols, stating unequivocally that items like nooses and swastikas \"have no place in the Coast Guard.\" The discovery that the service intended to downgrade them to \"potentially divisive\" immediately raised alarms on Capitol Hill.",
      "Democratic Rep. Lauren Underwood of Illinois said she met with the Coast Guard's acting commandant, Adm. Kevin Lunday, to express her concerns and was reassured that the policy would be clarified.",
      "\"He came by the office and assured us that there is an across-the-board prohibition on hate symbols, including swastikas and nooses,\" Underwood remarked in a video statement.",
      "Democratic Rep. Rick Larsen of Washington said in a statement, Thursday, that \"lynching is a federal hate crime. The world defeated the Nazis in 1945. The debate on these symbols is over.\" He added, \"Coast Guard: be better.\"",
      "By removing the \"hate incident\" designation, the Coast Guard appeared to create a narrower pathway for removing racist or extremist imagery from operational facilities, barracks and other training environments. Its new timeline for reporting \u2014 requiring victims to come forward within 45 days \u2014 also raised eyebrows over concerns it might deter reporting and make enforcement harder.",
      "In January, President Trump abruptly removed Adm. Linda Fagan as commandant just a day after taking office, placing Coast Guard leadership under scrutiny.",
      "What is the Coast Guard saying now?",
      "In response to the uproar, Lunday issued a forceful statement just hours after the policy became public, asserting that \"any display, use or promotion of symbols like nooses and swastikas will be thoroughly investigated and severely punished.\"",
      "Later that night, the service released an additional memo declaring that \"divisive or hate symbols and flags are prohibited\" at Coast Guard workplaces \u2014 an even firmer posture. The Coast Guard insisted the new memo was not a reversal but rather a clarification meant to counter \"misinformation\" and reaffirm the service's longstanding stance against extremist imagery.",
      "Still, leadership has not explained why earlier guidance explicitly permitted private displays or eliminated the \"hate incident\" language altogether.",
      "How do harassment cases work under the new framework?",
      "Even with the late clarifications, the underlying mechanics of the directive remain changed in significant ways. Because the term \"hate incident\" has been retired, displays of extremist symbols are not automatically categorized as harassment, and commanders will have to determine whether a specific victim exists and whether the conduct meets the now higher bar of being \"severe or pervasive.\"",
      "Investigations and punishment will use a \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard \u2014 higher than before \u2014 and leaders evaluating an incident must consider how a hypothetical \"reasonable person\" would interpret any alleged misconduct.",
      "The directive does reinforce that any public displays of the Confederate battle flag remain prohibited, except in rare instances of historical or artistic contexts. And although victims have 45 days to file a harassment report, commanders must notify their chain of command within 48 hours if an incident sparks potential interest from the media or Congress.",
      "The Coast Guard occupies a unique middle ground \u2014 subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice but operating under the Department of Homeland Security rather than the Defense Department. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has been outspoken in his intent to roll back what he views as \"woke\" personnel policies, including diversity initiatives and certain extremism-prevention measures.",

    "story": [
      "Only 776 air traffic controllers and technicians who had perfect attendance during the government shutdown will receive $10,000 bonuses while nearly 20,000 other workers will be left out, the Federal Aviation Administration announced Thursday.",
      "A number of controllers started calling out of work as the shutdown dragged on longer than a month and they dealt with the financial pressure of working without a paycheck. Some of them got side jobs, but others simply couldn't afford the child care or gas they needed to work. Their absences forced delays at airports across the country and led the government to order airlines to cut some of their flights at 40 busy airports.",
      "President Trump suggested the bonuses for those who have stayed on the job in a social media post, but he also suggested that controllers who missed work should have their pay docked. FAA officials haven't publicly announced plans to penalize controllers.",
      "Thousands of FAA technicians also had to work during the shutdown to maintain the equipment that air traffic controllers rely on. At least 6,600 technicians were expected to work throughout the shutdown but more than 3,000 others were subject to be recalled to work.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the bonuses acknowledged the dedication of these few workers who never missed a shift during the 43-day shutdown. In a post on X he described it as \"Santa's coming to town a little early.\"",
      "\"These patriotic men and women never missed a beat and kept the flying public safe throughout the shutdown,\" Duffy said in his formal announcement.",
      "The National Air Traffic Controllers Association union said only 311 of its more than 10,000 members will receive the bonuses. The union said these workers with perfect attendance deserve recognition but so do the others.",
      "\"We are concerned that thousands of air traffic controllers who consistently reported for duty during the shutdown, ensuring the safe transport of passengers and cargo across the nation, while working without pay and uncertain of when they would receive compensation, were excluded from this recognition. More than 311 of these dedicated professionals were instrumental in keeping America moving,\" the union said in a statement.",
      "The Professional Aviation Safety Specialists union said the thousands of technicians it represents worked hard to keep the aging computer and radar systems controllers use operating during the shutdown and they should all be recognized - not just the 423 getting bonuses.",
      "\"It took many hands to ensure that not one delay during the historic 43-day shutdown was attributed to equipment or system failures,\" the union said in a statement.",
      "Democratic Rep. Rick Larsen of Washington State questioned why all the controllers and others who worked to keep flights moving during during the shutdown won't get bonuses.",
      "\"For the Trump administration to not give a bonus to every single one of these hardworking women and men is wrong; they all deserve a bonus and back pay,\" said Larsen, the ranking member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure committee.",
      "The controllers union said they hope to work with Duffy to find a way to recognize all the other air traffic controllers who worked during the shutdown.",
      "Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that any TSA officers who went \"above and beyond\" while working without pay would get $10,000 bonuses but she never specified how many will qualify beyond the handful of checks she handed out to officers at a news conference.",
      "The FAA was already critically short on air traffic controllers before the shutdown. Duffy had been working to boost controller hiring and streamline the years of training required in the hope of eliminating the shortage over the next several years.",
      "Duffy has said that some students and controllers quit and more experienced controllers retired during the shutdown. Many controllers already work 10-hour shifts six days a week because the FAA is so short on staffing.",
      "As more controllers missed work, the FAA ordered airlines to cut flights to relieve pressure on the system. Duffy said repeatedly that FAA safety experts became worried as the absences grew because of reports from pilots concerned about controllers' responses and a number of runway incursions.   FAA lifts emergency order that slashed flights at 40 major U.S. airportsSince the shutdown ended, controller staffing has improved significantly and airlines were allowed to resume normal operations this week.",

    "story": [
      "Education Secretary Linda McMahon told CBS News on Tuesday that federal money to support low-income students and special education will continue to flow as the Education Department shifts some of its grant programs to other agencies, amid the Trump administration's push to wind down the department altogether.",
      "The agency announced Tuesday\u00a0that the Department of Labor will now manage many of the Education Department's grants to elementary and secondary schools, including the Title I program, which hands out billions of dollars to aid schools with large numbers of low-income students.",
      "A handful of other shifts were also unveiled Tuesday. Certain higher education grants will be moved to the Department of Labor, the Department of the Interior will now handle Native American education grants, the State Department will run some international education programs, and the Department of Health and Human Services will take over a small child care grant program and a panel that reviews foreign medical schools.",
      "McMahon said the department has not decided how to handle some of its other major responsibilities, including its special education\u00a0grants and its Office for Civil Rights.",
      "But programs that support low-income students, students with special needs and civil rights will remain in place, even if they're moved to different agencies, McMahon told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett on \"The Takeout.\"",
      "\"They will all still be done,\" McMahon said. \"They were done before there was a Department of Education, and they will continue to be done.\"",
      "\"Special education will not be abandoned,\" McMahon added.",
      "She said the Education Department will still oversee the programs that are being moved to other agencies, and their funding will come from the department's budget.",
      "McMahon said permanently moving the Education Department's responsibilities elsewhere would require congressional approval. But the department has argued that it does have the legal authority to essentially contract out some of its duties to other parts of the federal government.",
      "She referred to the moves as a \"pilot program\" and a \"proof of concept.\"",
      "\"I want to prove to Congress that these transfers of programs are more efficient and that they work,\" McMahon said. \"And so if we can do that, then hopefully ... we can get Congress to vote and to codify those transfers and make it a permanent move.\"",
      "President Trump has taken aim at the Education Department for months, signing an executive order in March directing the department to start closing itself down to the maximum extent required by law. The department has also moved to slash its workforce.",
      "The administration has argued that the Department of Education is overly bureaucratic and many of its tasks should be overseen by states and localities.",
      "\"The Trump Administration is fully committed to doing what's best for American students, which is why it's critical to shrink this bloated federal education bureaucracy while still ensuring efficient delivery of funds and essential programs,\" White House spokesperson Liz Huston said Tuesday, adding that \"students and teachers don't need Washington bureaucrats micromanaging their classrooms.\"",
      "Tuesday's moves drew pushback from the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents thousands of Education Department staffers.",
      "\"Students, educators and families depend on the Department's comprehensive support for schools, from early learning through graduate programs,\" the union said in a press release that called the changes \"unlawful\" and an \"insult\" to students. \"That national mission is weakened when its core functions are scattered across other federal or state agencies that are not equipped or positioned to provide the same support and services as ED staff.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/national-institues-health-clinical-trial-funding-cuts-cancer-research/",
    "published": "Tue, 18 Nov 2025 15:26:55 -0500",
    "summary": "The NIH cuts affected over 115 clinical trials studying cancer and nearly 100 studying infectious disease, researchers found.",
    "story": [
      "Nearly 1 in 30 clinical trials were interrupted by funding cuts to the National Institutes of Health, affecting more than 74,000 patients and research into cancer, infectious disease and more, according to a newly published paper.",
      "Clinical trials are the best way for researchers to study how medical interventions affect a patient population, doctors say.",
      "\"The types of trials that are affected are among the most rigorous way that we generate scientific evidence: randomized clinical trials,\" said Dr. Anupam B. Jena, a study author and professor at Harvard Medical School. \"It would be one thing if studies affected by terminated grants focused on less rigorous or important forms of research, but clinical trials are important, gold-standard in terms of evidence generation, time-intensive, and costly. Those are the last types of studies we would want to stop mid-stream.\"",
      "The paper, published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine, found that 383 clinical trials were interrupted by the funding cuts, which Jena said was \"surprisingly high\" to the research team. To calculate that number, the researchers looked at all clinical trials that received NIH funding between Feb. 28, 2025, the day of the first reported grant termination, and Aug. 15, 2025. There were about 11,008 clinical trials funded by NIH grants during that time period.",
      "More than 36% of the interrupted trials have since been completed. Another 35% were recruiting patients. About 11% of the trials were active and not recruiting patients, while 14% were active but not yet recruiting. The remaining trials were enrolling patients by invitation. Trials that had their funding interrupted had more expected participants enrolled than trials that were not affected, the researchers found.",
      "Trials that were active and not recruiting, where participants may have been receiving interventions, had a total of 74,311 patients enrolled in them, the researchers said.",
      "The researchers looked at the trial details to learn more about what kind of research was being interrupted. Trials conducted outside the U.S. were disproportionately affected, and within the United States, the Northeast had the highest rate of interrupted trials. More than 115 trials studying cancer were interrupted, as well as 97 trials that looked at infectious diseases. Trials studying cardiovascular diseases, mental health and reproductive health were also affected.",
      "Jena warned that the interruptions could lead to \"avoidable waste\" and \"impact the future willingness of patients to participate in trials.\"",
      "Jena said there is no systemic data on how often clinical trials are paused for funding lapses. Termination of federal grant funding was \"exceedingly rare\" before 2025, he said.",
      "\"Clinical trials aren't light switches,\" said CBS News medical contributor Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, an editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News. \"You can't just flip them off without consequences. Cutting off funding mid-trial wastes research dollars and puts patients at risk. This is a breach of trust with every person who volunteers for research.\"",
      "The NIH said it strongly rejected the \"intentionally misleading portrayal of our grant management process\" in the letter and accused the researchers of having conflicts of interest, though it did not specify what those were. The NIH highlighted the \"more than 42,500 active, recruiting, or planned clinical trials across every major disease area\" that it currently funds and oversees, and said the paper had a \"selective focus on a handful of appropriately paused studies.\"",
      "\"What they fail to mention is that NIH is undergoing a strategic realignment. We are prioritizing high-impact, high-urgency science ... The biomedical research enterprise is being refocused and that's what will keep America at the forefront of global science, safety, and innovation,\" the NIH said. The agency also said the terminated or interrupted studies \"likely happened because this research prioritized ideological agendas over scientific rigor and meaningful outcomes for the American people.\"",
      "The NIH is the largest funder of biomedical research. More than $2 billion in federal research grants were canceled by the NIH earlier this year as part of President Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency's efforts to downsize the federal government. Agency spending has also been slowed, and 1,300 employees have been fired. Thousands of universities and U.S. institutions rely on NIH funding for their research.",
      "Former NIH head Dr. Francis Collins, who led the agency for 12 years across three administrations, told CBS News in April that \"every dollar that NIH gave out in 2024 to a grant is estimated to have returned $2.46 just in a year.\"",
      "\"When you're talking about medical research, when you're talking about people's lives, when you're talking about clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease or cancer that may take three or four years, you can't just go in and decide, 'I'm going to shut those down and maybe I'll try something else.' Those are people's lives at risk,\" Collins told CBS News.",

      "One of the images shows the comet, also known as\u00a03I/ATLAS, as it moves through space about 190 million miles from Earth. It was taken from Manciano, Italy.",
      "The comet was first discovered in July and has been photographed several times. In early August, images released showed the comet from about 277 million miles away. A month ago, images taken by two Mars orbiters showed a bright, fuzzy white dot of the comet about 18,641,135 miles away from Mars.",
      "3I/ATLAS is only the third ever interstellar comet confirmed to enter our solar system.",
      "The comet is visible from Earth in the predawn sky by using binoculars or a telescope.",
      "\"Everyone that is in control of a telescope wants to look at it because it's a fascinating and rare opportunity,\" NASA's acting astrophysics director, Shawn Domagal-Goldman, told The Associated Press.",
      "The comet will make its closest approach to Earth on Friday, Dec. 19, coming within about 170 million miles, which is nearly twice the Earth-Sun distance. NASA spacecraft will keep tracking it as it moves through the solar system, crossing Jupiter's orbit in spring 2026.",
      "ESA's Juice spacecraft, bound for Jupiter, has been training its cameras and scientific instruments on the comet all month, particularly after it made its closest pass to the sun. But scientists won't get any of these observations back until February because Juice's main antenna is serving as a heat shield while it's near the sun, limiting the flow of data.",
      "Named for the telescope in Chile that first spotted it, the comet is believed to be anywhere from 1,444 feet across to 3.5 miles across. Observations indicate that the exceptionally fast-moving comet may have originated in a star system older than our own \u2014 \"which gives me goose bumps to think about,\" said NASA scientist Tom Statler.",

    "summary": "Moss spores survived in outer space for a majority of 2022, and could even reproduce when they were eventually returned to Earth, according to a new study.",
    "story": [
      "Moss spores survived in outer space for a majority of 2022, and could even reproduce as usual when they were eventually returned to Earth, according to a new study from researchers who say their findings \"reveal the potential of terrestrial plants to endure extreme environments\" \u2014 including the extraterrestrial kind.",
      "\"Climate change highlights the importance of understanding life's survival limits for addressing global challenges and supporting future human habitation beyond Earth,\" reads the introductory text of the study, conducted by scientists at Hokkaido University in Japan. \"Understanding the resilience of Earth-born organisms in extreme and unfamiliar conditions, such as the space environment, is a crucial step toward expanding human habitats other than Earth like the Moon or Mars.\"",
      "The full text was published Thursday in the online journal iScience. It describes a pioneering effort to study bryophyte plants, such as moss, with the intent to learn more about the limits of their survival skills and gauge their adaptability. Although the plants' resilience was already well-known in environments on Earth, research on their survival limits more widely is still in its early stages, the study's authors said.",
      "For nine months, moss withstood the markedly harsh conditions of space \u2014 which very few Earthly creatures have ever done \u2014 while affixed to the outside of the International Space Station. While the spores' chlorophyll, which gives them their green color, did degrade during the experiment, scientists said more than 80% of them retained their viability after nine months outside of the space station.",
      "Different types of moss spores had individual strengths, like one that may protect against ultraviolet rays, heat and intensive light stresses, and another that \"could be used for planetary greening and life support systems,\" the authors said.",
      "Bryophytes have existed on Earth since at least 500 million years ago, when they began to advance from water onto land, scientists say. The plants continue to exist today despite the fact that Earth has changed considerably, and they have become known for their tolerance to desiccation, freezing and radiation, all of which made them good candidates to be studied in an extraterrestrial setting.",

    "summary": "The rare interstellar comet, also known as 3I/ATLAS, was first discovered in July and has been photographed several times.",
    "story": [
      "NASA released close-up images on Wednesday of the rare interstellar comet that's making a single pass through the solar system.",
      "One of the images shows the comet, also known as\u00a03I/ATLAS, as it moves through space about 190 million miles from Earth. It was taken from Manciano, Italy.",
      "The comet was first discovered in July and has been photographed several times. In early August, images released showed the comet from about 277 million miles away. A month ago, images taken by two Mars orbiters showed a bright, fuzzy white dot of the comet about 18,641,135 miles away from Mars.",
      "3I/ATLAS is only the third ever interstellar comet confirmed to enter our solar system.",
      "The comet is visible from Earth in the predawn sky by using binoculars or a telescope.",
      "\"Everyone that is in control of a telescope wants to look at it because it's a fascinating and rare opportunity,\" NASA's acting astrophysics director, Shawn Domagal-Goldman, told The Associated Press.",
      "The comet will make its closest approach to Earth on Friday, Dec. 19, coming within about 170 million miles, which is nearly twice the Earth-Sun distance. NASA spacecraft will keep tracking it as it moves through the solar system, crossing Jupiter's orbit in spring 2026.",
      "ESA's Juice spacecraft, bound for Jupiter, has been training its cameras and scientific instruments on the comet all month, particularly after it made its closest pass to the sun. But scientists won't get any of these observations back until February because Juice's main antenna is serving as a heat shield while it's near the sun, limiting the flow of data.",
      "Named for the telescope in Chile that first spotted it, the comet is believed to be anywhere from 1,444 feet across to 3.5 miles across. Observations indicate that the exceptionally fast-moving comet may have originated in a star system older than our own \u2014 \"which gives me goose bumps to think about,\" said NASA scientist Tom Statler.",
      "\"That means that 3I/ATLAS is not just a window into another solar system, it's a window into the deep past and so deep in the past that it predates even the formation of our Earth and our sun,\" Statler told reporters.",
      "NASA officials dismissed rumors that the \"friendly solar system visitor\" might actually be an alien spacecraft.",

Her wife, previously identified as astronaut\u00a0Anne McClain, was at the ISS from December 2018 to June 2019. It was the first allegation of a crime being committed in space.",

The investigation also found that Worden had regularly given McClain access to her bank records, including login credentials, from at least 2015, the news release said.",
      "McClain said in 2019 that she had accessed the bank account with Worden's permission, The New York Times reported. Worden, a former Air Force intelligence officer, disputed that claim and filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission. A complaint filed to NASA's Office of Inspector General by Worden's family accused McClain of identity theft and improper access.",

      "The chipmaker reported earnings of $31.9 billion on record revenue of $57 billion for the third quarter. Revenue for the period surged 22% from the previous quarter and 62% from a year ago. Its earnings per share were $1.30. The Santa Clara, Calif., company had been expected to earn $1.26 per share on revenue of $54.9 billion for the quarter, according to analysts polled by FactSet.",

The AI ecosystem is scaling fast \u2014 with more new foundation model makers, more AI startups, across more industries, and in more countries. AI is going everywhere, doing everything, all at once,\" Huang added.",
      "Nvidia forecast revenue of $65 billion for the fourth quarter. The company's shares, which have jumped 39% this year, rose nearly 4% in after-hours trading to $193.80.",

Despite the promise of AI, most companies that are implementing AI have yet to see a measurable increase in productivity or profits, according to Wall Street analysts.",
      "\"Nvidia earnings are such an important event both because of the weighting that the stock has in the major equity indices and because it is ground zero for the entire Artificial Intelligence build out,\" Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, said in an email.",
      "The rapid construction of data centers across the U.S. has boosted demand for Nvidia's chips. Data center investment, which includes spending on AI research and development, has become the largest contributor to U.S. growth this year, according to S&P Global.",
      "The S&P 500's 15% gain this year has been driven largely by big tech companies with AI investments. The combined market capitalization of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" \u2014 Google-owner Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla \u2014 accounts for 37% of the index's total value,\u00a0according\u00a0to Morningstar.",
      "\"Market psychology has been negative this month as investors worried that the artificial intelligence infrastructure build out was a bubble, and in a few years we may look back at this time and point to signs that it was, Zaccarelli said. \"But in the meantime, the largest technology companies in the world are extremely profitable, and they are reinvesting billions of dollars into data centers, servers and chips, and the spending is real.\"",

    "story": [
      "Roblox, the popular online gaming platform that hosts millions of user-created games, said Tuesday it is strengthening protections for minors.",
      "Roblox said it will soon require players to use AI-powered facial age-estimation technology to help verify their age. The system, combined with ID-based age verification and confirmed parental consent, is intended to \"provide a more accurate measure of a user's age than simply relying on what someone types in when they create an account,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "Roblox CEO David Baszucki described the guardrails in an interview with CBS Mornings' Tony Dokoupil as \"what we believe will become the gold standard for safety and civility on the internet.\"",
      "Doukopil questioned Baszucki about potential parental concerns about the AI verification, given that it involves minors sending pictures of themselves into the app to verify the user's age. Some parents \"are already skeptical about their children's safety on Roblox,\" Doukopil said.",
      "Roblox is \"not storing these images,\" Baszucki said. The photos \"are deleted soon after [Roblox] process[es] them.\"",
      "The image is used to determine the age of the Roblox user, and \"then to assign them to the right people that might connect with,\" he added.",
      "The company will start enforcing the age-check requirement in select global markets, including Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands, before expanding the system to other countries in early January. Roblox is also launching a dedicated online safety center to help families understand and set up the platform's parental controls.",
      "The company's enhanced protections arrive as dozens of families, along with attorneys general in Kentucky and Louisiana, are suing Roblox, Discord and other technology companies for allegedly failing to deter sexual predators from approaching children on their platforms.

    "summary": "The stock market has stumbled on concerns that the surge in artificial intelligence stocks could echo the dot-com bubble.",
    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence has fired the stock market to record highs this year, with companies eager to tout their AI prowess and investor darlings like AI chipmaker Nvidia soaring\u00a0on expectations of runaway growth.",
      "But a tinge of fear is starting to shadow that exuberance. Stocks have slumped this week as investors fret that the AI boom could go bust, with the S&P 500 on Nov. 18 dipping 0.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 1.1% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite sinking 1.2%.",
      "The startling run-up in AI-related stocks is prompting comparisons to the dot-com era of the late 1990s, when many internet companies saw their stock prices skyrocket despite suffering vast financial losses. When that bubble burst in the early 2000s, it took down former high-fliers like Pets.com, torched investor portfolios and triggered a recession.",
      "Bubbles occur when stocks surge on inflated growth expectations that ultimately prove to be disconnected from a company's underlying fundamentals, a painful reality check that typically ends with overhyped shares falling back to Earth.",
      "Beyond the stock market, economists are also questioning whether AI will turn out to be as transformative for businesses as proponents of the technology insist. Advocates say AI will spur a productivity boom, leading to stronger corporate growth and profitability.",
      "\"The stock market is a giant bet on AI right now. It's really 10 companies that are driving all of it,\" Rebecca Homkes, an economist and lecturer at the London Business School, told CBS News.",
      "In other words, this year's 15% gain in the S&P 500 \u00a0is largely due to a handful of tech giants that are heavily investing in AI. The combined market capitalization of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" \u2014 Google-owner Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla \u2014 today represents a record 37% of the S&P 500's total value, according to Morningstar.",

      "Irrational exuberance?",
      "That may give pause to the millions of Americans who are saving for retirement in 401(k) and other plans. If the market's gains lean so heavily on a few dominant companies, as during the dot-com bubble, the fallout could be severe if investors suddenly sour on AI.",
      "\"No one wants to be caught dancing after the music has stopped,\" Aaron Schaechterle, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, said in an email.",
      "Still, today's stock valuations aren't nearly as stretched as they were in the late 1990s, Goldman Sachs analysts note. The investment bank's analysis of the Magnificent 7's median price-to-earnings ratio \u2014 a measure of a company's share price compared to its profits \u2014 found it is \"roughly half\" that of the largest seven companies in the late 1990s.",
      "\"So it is true that valuations are high but, in our view, generally not at levels that are as high as are typically seen at the height of a financial bubble,\" they noted.",
      "Why this time may be different",
      "The question of whether AI is fueling a bubble akin to the late 1990s was even posed to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the central bank's Oct. 29 meeting.",
      "\"This is different in the sense that these companies \u2014 the companies that are so highly valued \u2014 actually have earnings and stuff like that,\" Powell said. \"So you go back to the '90s and the dot-com [period]... these were ideas rather than companies.\"",
      "Nvidia, for example, the AI boom's poster child, has seen its revenue more than double to $130 billion in its last fiscal year, while its profit surged 145%.",
      "Although the stock market may not be in imminent danger of a bubble-bursting crash, economists are increasingly questioning whether AI companies can live up to the hype, as well as justify the trillions in capital spending on the data centers and other infrastructure required to power the AI revolution.",
      "For these bets to pay off, AI will need to transform U.S. businesses by spurring a productivity boom that translates into stronger corporate growth and profitability, experts say.",
      "\"We want to understand whether this is storytelling or actual tangible gains,\" Homkes of the London Business School told CBS News.",
      "For tech evangelists like Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, the AI boom will lead to a \"4th industrial revolution\" that could supercharge economic growth. \"This is an AI Arms Race, and what is fueling this next chapter of growth is Big Tech spending and that is NOT slowing down into 2026,\" he wrote this week in a research note.",
      "\"The doubters need to come on board and recognize this is a transformational technology,\" Homkes agreed, while noting that such a shift is likely to take much longer than some AI boosters currently envision.",

    "summary": "Meta has prevailed over an existential challenge to its business that could have forced the tech giant to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp.",
    "story": [
      "Meta has prevailed over an existential challenge to its business that could have forced the tech giant to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp after a judge ruled that the company does not hold a monopoly in social networking.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued his ruling Tuesday after the historic antitrust trial wrapped up in late May. His decision follows two separate rulings that branded Google an illegal monopoly in both search and online advertising, dealing yet another regulatory blow to the tech industry that for years enjoyed nearly unbridled growth.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission \"continues to insist that Meta competes with the same old rivals it has for the last decade, that the company holds a monopoly among that small set, and that it maintained that monopoly through anticompetitive acquisitions,\" Boasberg wrote in his ruling. \"Whether or not Meta enjoyed monopoly power in the past, though, the agency must show that it continues to hold such power now. The Court's verdict today determines that the FTC has not done so.\"",
      "Meta Platforms Inc., the FTC had argued, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg's strategy, \"expressed in 2008: 'It is better to buy than compete.' True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats.\"",
      "During his April testimony, Zuckerberg pushed back against the FTC's contention that Facebook bought Instagram to neutralize a threat. In his line of questioning, FTC attorney Daniel Matheson repeatedly brought up emails \u2014 many of them more than a decade old \u2014 written by Zuckerberg and his associates before and after the acquisition of Instagram.",
      "While acknowledging the documents, Zuckerberg has often sought to downplay the contents, saying he wrote them in the early stages of considering the acquisition and that what he wrote at the time didn't capture the full scope of his interest in the company. But the case was not about the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp more than a decade ago, which the FTC approved at the time, but about whether Meta holds a monopoly now. The FTC, Boasberg wrote in the ruling, could only win if it proved \"current or imminent legal violation.\"",
      "The FTC's complaint said Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and \"neutralize perceived competitive threats,\" just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers.",
      "Meta said Tuesday's decision \"recognizes that Meta faces fierce competition.\"",
      "\"Our products are beneficial for people and businesses and exemplify American innovation and economic growth. We look forward to continuing to partner with the Administration and to invest in America,\" the Menlo Park, California-based company said in a statement.",
      "The social media landscape has changed so much since the FTC filed its lawsuit in 2020, Boasberg wrote, that each time the court examined Meta's apps and competition, they changed. Two opinions to dismiss the case \u2014 filed in 2021 and 2022 \u2014 didn't even mention popular social video platform TikTok. Today, it \"holds center stage as Meta's fiercest rival.\"",
      "Quoting the Greek philosopher Heraclitus, \"that no man can ever step into the same river twice,\" Boasberg said the same is true for the online world of social media as well.",
      "\"The landscape that existed only five years ago when the Federal Trade Commission brought this antitrust suit has changed markedly. While it once might have made sense to partition apps into separate markets of social networking and social media, that wall has since broken down,\" he wrote.",
      "Emarketer analyst Minda Smiley said Meta's win \"is not necessarily surprising considering the lengths it's gone to in recent years to keep up with TikTok.\"",
      "\"But from a regulatory standpoint, Meta is far from out of the woods: next year, major social networks will face landmark trials in the US regarding children's mental health,\" she added. \"Still, today's win is surely a boost for the company as it battles criticism and questions over how its massive AI spending will ultimately benefit Meta in the long run.\"",
      "Facebook bought Instagram \u2014 then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following \u2014 in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal's value fell to $750 million after Facebook's stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012.",
      "Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller \"acqui-hires\" \u2014 a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion.",
      "WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta's competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple's messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp.",

Billups is facing charges of wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering.",
      "The 49-year-old \u2014 who had served as head coach of the Portland Trail Blazers until being suspended by the league in late October following his arrest \u2014 appeared alongside 30 other defendants in the Eastern District's massive ceremonial courtroom to face charges over allegations of cheating in high-stakes poker games operated by mafia figures.",
      "The elaborate cheating scheme netted more than $7 million from rigged games, prosecutors said.",
      "The hearing before U.S. District Court Judge Ramon Reyes also allows defendants and their attorneys to update the court on scheduling, progress and deadlines for discovery, motion filings and settlement talks in the complex case.",
      "Prosecutors said plea discussions have begun but no formal plea deals have been offered.",
      "There are two federal cases in the crackdown. One focuses on high-stakes poker games while the other concerns a sports betting ring. The second indictment revolves around bets on NBA basketball games which were allegedly placed using insider information related to injury reports.",
      "The two indictments have a combined 34 defendants, 31 of whom are charged in the poker case.",
      "Former NBA player Damon Jones has been indicted in both cases. He pleaded not guilty earlier this month in both indictments and was released on a $200,00 bond, secured by his parents' Texas home. Jones appeared in court Monday.",
      "The indictment in the sports betting case has also ensnared Miami Heat player Terry Rozier, who is accused of providing nonpublic information in exchange for a flat fee or a cut of the profits. In one game in particular, prosecutors allege, Rozier told a co-conspirator that he would fake an injury in order to leave a game early. Defendants charged solely under this indictment did not appear Monday in court.",
      "Several alleged members of the mob appeared in court as prosecutors said many of the rigged ongoing poker games were backed by Mafia families. Most of the 31 accused defendants in the poker case had been released on bond over the past several weeks; however, defendants who prosecutors allege had strong ties to organized crime were not as fortunate.",
      "Angelo Ruggiero, Jr., who prosecutors allege was a member of the Genovese crime family and an organizer of the Washington Place poker game, was denied bail after his attorney offered a bail application of $5 million. Thomas Gelardo, also known as \"Juice,\" who prosecutors allege is an associate of the Bonanno family, supervised the Lexington Avenue poker game and took a cut of the proceeds, prosecutors claim.",
      "Because there are so many defendants, prosecutors filed a motion last week asking the court to divide the 31 defendants in the poker case into three groups, with each group having 10 to 11 defendants for status conferences for \"convenience.\" Attorneys opposed the motion, saying the government is trying to \"divide and conquer\" the defendants.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Monday said it would end yet another Temporary Protected Status immigration program, this time for nearly 4,000 immigrants from Myanmar, a country in Southeast Asia engulfed in civil war over the past several years.",
      "The announcement is the latest move by President Trump's administration to curtail humanitarian immigration programs, which it has argued have been exploited by bad actors and extended for too long, despite the intended temporary nature of the TPS policy. The administration has also said TPS encourages illegal immigration, since some of those who've benefited from the policy entered the U.S. illegally.",
      "As part of its immigration crackdown, the Trump administration has moved to revoke TPS protections for hundreds of thousands of migrants from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Syria, Sudan and Venezuela, making many of them eligible for arrest and deportation. Pro-immigrant advocates have called the campaign the largest de-documentation effort in modern U.S. history.",
      "Created by Congress in 1990, TPS has allowed Democratic and Republican administrations to offer temporary work permits and deportation protections to immigrants from countries facing armed conflict, an environmental disaster or another emergency that makes their return unsafe. The program was greatly expanded under former President Joe Biden.",
      "Since 2021, when the country's military staged a coup, Myanmar has been plagued by armed conflict and political instability. Armed militias scattered throughout the country have fought the country's military, which has a long history of persecuting minority groups, including members of the Rohingya Muslim community. The United Nations said earlier this year that the military had killed roughly 6,500 civilians as of March and that the violence had displaced more than 3.5 million people.",
      "While it acknowledged that Myanmar \"continues to face humanitarian challenges,\" the Department of Homeland Security argued in an official notice that ending the country's TPS program was warranted because there have been \"improvements\" in \"governance and stability\" there.",
      "The DHS notice, signed by Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, also said that continuing the TPS policy for Myanmar was at odds with national U.S. interests.

      "Judge Matthew Thornhill in suburban St. Louis faces a six-month unpaid suspension under the deal he reached with a state board to avoid a disciplinary hearing. After the suspension, he would serve 18 more months on the bench before resigning from the St. Charles County Circuit Court.",
      "The agreement, reached last month, is pending before the Missouri Supreme Court, spokeswoman Beth Riggert said Friday. The court agreed Thursday to accept 35 letters in support of Thornhill's character.",
      "Thornhill wrote in a letter dated Nov. 12 that he intended \"to add levity at times when I thought it would help relax litigants.\" But he added: \"I now recognize that this could affect the integrity and solemnity of the proceedings.\"",

      "While the Commission on Retirement, Removal and Discipline also faulted Thornhill for talking about politics from the bench, it highlighted his affinity for the \"King of Rock 'n' Roll\" first. The court file is sprinkled with photos of Thornhill on the bench or posing with staff in a plastic Elvis wig and sunglasses.",
      "According to the commission, Thornhill routinely wore the wig in the courtroom around Halloween and would offer people options on how they wanted to be sworn in before testifying, including an option where he played Elvis' music from his phone. Thornhill also sometimes played the songs while entering the courtroom, court records show.",

He was elected an associate circuit judge in 2006 and a circuit judge in 2024. His primary assignment is family court. His public Facebook page has more than 300 followers.",
      "In 2008, he was reprimanded and fined $750. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that the fine stemmed from Thornhill reducing the charges against a woman he was prosecuting after she offered to give him a baseball signed by Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Terry Bradshaw. Thornhill denied taking the baseball, which was a fake.",
      "In the latest case, Thornhill was also cited for mentioning his political affiliation and preferred election candidates during court business. At times, he commented on where his \"Thornhill for Judge\" campaign signs were posted or remarked that litigants or attorneys lived in \"Thornhill for Judge Country,\" court documents said.",
      "Once, he asked someone appearing in court if the labor union the person worked for had \"warmed up to Thornhill for judge,\" court records show.",
      "Thornhill wrote that, although the references to campaign signs were made in informal conversations, they were still a mistake.",
      "\"Never did they impact a decision,\" he wrote.",
      "He was also criticized for offering a character letter in an adoption case, which the commission deemed an abuse of his position. Thornhill agreed it was \"a mistake and improper.\"",
      "A court transcript of the case shows three images of Thornhill wearing the wig, including one photo of him behind the bench and one showing him in front of various Elvis posters and memorabilia.",
      "The images elicited bemused reaction from local attorneys, including Brendan Roediger, who quipped to St. Louis Magazine: \"Suspicious minds are wondering about the punishment. It's now or never\u2014either he should be a judge or he shouldn't.\"",

The friend, who declined to share their name, said they didn't want Geyser to be alone, so the two of them hopped on a bus from Madison to Chicago and eventually just started walking. According to the friend, Geyser injured her foot during the trip and wasn't able to go on any longer, and they were detained at a truck stop after someone called the police on them for loitering.",

      "Geyser and Weier fled after the attack but were arrested as they were walking on Interstate 94. They told investigators they attacked Leutner to earn the right to be Slender Man's servants and feared he would hurt their families if they didn't follow through. They had planned to walk to Slender Man's mansion in northern Wisconsin after the attack, they said.",
      "Leutner barely survived.\u00a0Geyser ultimately pleaded guilty\u00a0to being a party to attempted first-degree intentional homicide in 2017 but claimed she wasn't responsible because she was mentally ill.

      "\"I think the responsibility I have as the mayor of the city is to work with anyone who can help to alleviate the affordability crisis and deliver dignity to each and every person that calls the city home, and I think it is critically important to both be honest about our own opinions, our own assessments, and be committed to working with anyone who could further that,\" Mamdani replied.",
      "Common ground around the cost of living",
      "Before traveling to Washington, D.C., the mayor-elect said he planned to stay focused on affordability, noting that he and the president both campaigned on the issue. On Sunday, he said he's \"feeling good coming out of that meeting.\"",
      "\"We spoke about things that all of us have been paying attention to for quite some time, whether we're speaking about housing or public transit or child care,\" said Mamdani.",
      "There was much at stake\u00a0in their meeting, including everything from\u00a0federal funding for infrastructure projects\u00a0to immigration enforcement protocols and the mayor-elect's security clearances.",
      "When asked whether he thinks Mr. Trump may send in federal troops or what this means for their relationship moving forward, Mamdani said he's \"confident that we're establishing a productive relationship.\"",
      "\"I can only take things one meeting at a time, one conversation at a time. And all I hoped to do in that conversation was to establish a working relationship and to have a productive meeting that focused on the work itself,\" he added.",
      "More on the issue of immigration",
      "Mamdani went on to say they spoke about the city's sanctuary policies, which he said allow the city government to coordinate with federal law enforcement on approximately 170 serious crimes.",
      "\"The concern comes from beyond those crimes, that many New Yorkers who at this moment are being arrested, they're being detained, they are being deported for the crime of showing up to a regular court appearance at 26 Federal Plaza, for the crime of simply being present in New York City,\" he said. \"And how my focus as the next mayor of the city is going to be to protect immigrants who call the city their home and to deliver public safety to each and every New Yorker who lives across these five boroughs.\"",
      "The mayor-elect said they also spoke about NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch staying on as leader of the police department.",
      "\"One of the most recent decisions we made to retain Commissioner Tisch was one that actually came up in the conversation that I had with President Trump. It was one that he saw, as do I, as do many New Yorkers, as a reflection of the importance we're placing on public safety,\" he said.",

      "Schlossberg spends a portion of her essay writing about her family's dismay regarding the\u00a0nomination and confirmation\u00a0of her cousin Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as secretary of Health and Human Services. She spoke about how he cut nearly half a billion dollars for research into mRNA vaccines and slashed funding from the National Institutes of Health. She wrote that hundreds of National Institute of Health grants and clinical trials were canceled.",
      "She wrote that she worries millions of women might not get the care they deserve after she was given a dose of misoprostol to stop her postpartum hemorrhage. Because the drug can also be used as part of medication abortion, it is currently under review at the Food and Drug Administration, she wrote, due to her cousin's urging.",

    "summary": "Those prioritizing economy say Trump is not spending enough time on it, as ratings of economy, his handling of inflation slip.",
    "story": [
      "The situation around Venezuela has Americans asking to know more.",
      "Across party lines, big majorities say the administration needs to explain what the U.S. intends regarding any action, and that it has not done so clearly yet.",
      "Meanwhile, what Americans hear from the White House about inflation is, they say, not what they're actually feeling at home: rising prices and worsening economic views.",
      "In the meantime, Americans do not think of Venezuela as a major threat to the US. Instead, more see a minor one, and they are largely opposed to potential military action.",
      "So, the idea of potential U.S. military action in Venezuela meets with widespread disapproval. It doesn't get overwhelming backing from Republicans either.",
      "Three in four Americans also say Trump would need congressional approval before taking military action in Venezuela, including just over half of Republicans.",
      "Just one in five Americans have heard a lot about the U.S. military buildup in the first place. That may be another expression of that sense of limited information about the purpose.",
      "The current military attacks on boats suspected of bringing drugs find division \u2014 just over half approve, driven by nearly universal support among Republicans \u2014 though Americans overall overwhelmingly say they should see the evidence that there are drugs.",
      "However, most Americans don't think U.S. military action in Venezuela would change the amount of drugs coming into the U.S.",
      "Looking more closely within the president's GOP base: MAGA Republicans are actually more supportive of potential military action than non-MAGA ones.",
      "For context, that is similar to what we've seen over time on many issues, including foreign policy, in which that part of the base is largely deferential to the president. (As one example, MAGA was also supportive of the bombing in Iran months ago.) Most of them say the president has explained things, and in turn, are more apt to see any action in Venezuela as decreasing the amount of drugs entering the U.S.",
      "But many who are opposed to military action, including those within the GOP ranks, may also be seeing this in terms of issue priorities. They're a little more likely to judge the administration on what it does about the economy than those in favor. And most who judge him on the economy think he isn't spending enough time on it.",
      "Here's what Americans say about the economy",
      "There's a disconnect between how Americans hear the White House describing the economy, and what they're feeling themselves.",
      "Most Americans say Trump describes things with prices and inflation as better than they really are.",
      "(This includes four in 10 Republicans who say this about Trump. They are also among those more likely to say prices are going up.)",
      "This comes as ratings for the overall economy continue to be low \u2014 as they've been for years \u2014 ticking down this week to their lowest mark in 2025.",
      "Prices, more generally, are still seen by most as going up.",
      "As we head into the holiday season, that economic dissatisfaction includes the majority of Americans who feel President Trump's policies are making the cost of food and groceries, specifically, go up.",
      "So, that disconnect appears to continue to weigh on the president's ratings.",
      "There are many ways Americans judge a president. For those who say they judge Mr. Trump most on what he does about the economy and inflation, they overwhelmingly say he isn't spending enough time on that.",
      "That, in turn, has continued to push his approval on handling the economy and inflation down over the course of several months. That trend continues this week, with assessments of the overall economy, and his ratings for handling the economy and inflation, hitting lows for the year.",
      "More than two-thirds disapprove of his handling of inflation.",
      "He does especially poorly on handling the economy among people who mainly judge him on that.",
      "Among independents, his ratings for handling the economy, and his ratings overall, have also hit lows for the year. That has continued to push his approval rating overall lower over time too, now down to their low point for his second term after a steady decline over recent months.",
      "The president does a little better on his handling of immigration, backed by continued large support from the GOP base, as has been the case for months.",
      "The decline in the president's overall approval ratings connects to people's economic priorities in this way: even among those who voted for him in 2024, disapproval today is more likely to come when people are judging him mostly on the economy.",
      "Deportation",
      "The administration's deportation program continues to split the country, but support is underpinned by strong approval from Republicans.",
      "Most \u2014 particularly those outside the GOP base \u2014 continue to feel that ICE is detaining more people than necessary.",
      "But the deportation program is seen by many as more undermining than strengthening the economy.",
      "One possible reason: a third of the country (who tend to live in cities and suburbs) say it is impacting their community for the worse, and they feel people in their area are staying home more as a result of the program.",
      "Epstein files",
      "Americans across party lines think it is important to see the Epstein files released.",
      "Americans overwhelmingly believe they will contain damaging information about powerful people. Most say it's too soon to know if what's in them is true. On balance, though, more think that information will be true rather than false.",
      "Republicans are more satisfied with how the Trump administration is handling the Epstein case than they were in the summer. (The survey was conducted just after Trump said Congress should vote to release the files, which they did shortly thereafter.) Today, most others are not satisfied.",
      "However, the president's Republican base says issues surrounding the files are not important to how they judge him. Nearly two-thirds of Republicans say this doesn't affect how they evaluate Trump overall. (Independents and Democrats, though, give it comparably more importance in this regard.)",
      "This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,489 U.S. adults interviewed between November 19-21, 2025. The sample was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as 2024 presidential vote.

    "story": [
      "One letter said, \"It became clear that it was time for me to go.\"",
      "Another read, \"I cannot continue to serve in such a hostile and toxic work environment.\"",
      "Amid a growing wave of firings, resignations and retirements from the Justice Department, some former agency officials are curating a public online display of the farewell messages of ousted employees. Some of the letters from purged non-political career Justice Department attorneys warn of a threat to democracy and a crumbling of the norms and standards in federal prosecutions.",
      "Justice Connection, a group of former Justice Department employees, has organized and posted the online page of goodbye messages. The organization's executive director and founder, Stacey Young, a former civil division attorney for the Justice Department, said the Justice Department purge has now eclipsed 5,000 employees since January, including resignations, firings and retirements.",
      "Some of those ousted have included high-profile department leaders, who wrote farewell messages expressing their fears about the trajectory of the Justice Department as agency employees have been purged.",
      "\"These messages are from people who are trying to encapsulate the thought of losing their careers,\" said Peter Carr, a longtime Justice Department public affairs specialist who was fired earlier this year. Carr, now a spokesperson for Justice Connection, told CBS News, \"Somebody needed to capture all of these letters, so that they're not lost to history.\"",
      "\"These messages show what is happening in our country at this moment,\" he said.",
      "One of the messages posted was written by Maurene Comey, a former New York-based federal prosecutor, who is the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey and previously handled part of the criminal case against convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. When she was fired this year, Maureen Comey wrote, \"If a career prosecutor can be fired without reason, fear may seep into the decisions of those who remain. . . . Do not let that happen.\"",
      "\"Fear is the tool of a tyrant, wielded to suppress independent thought,\" she continued. \"Instead of fear, let this moment fuel the fire that already burns at the heart of this place.\"",
      "Maureen Comey sued the Trump administration in September, saying her ouster was unlawful and unconstitutional.",
      "Hagan Scotten, who resigned from the office of the U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York after Justice Department leaders intervened to drop the office's criminal prosecution of New York City Mayor Eric Adams, left a blistering farewell letter to teammates.",
      "\"If no lawyer within earshot of the President is willing to give him that advice, then I expect you will eventually find someone who is enough of a fool, or enough of a coward, to file your motion, Scotten wrote. \"But it was never going to be me.\"",
      "Patty Hartman, who was fired in April from her communications position in the U.S. Attorney's Office for Washington, D.C., told CBS News she especially wanted to share a goodbye message with her team, because her firing was unexpected, abrupt and resulted in immediately losing access to her government-issued phone and computer.",
      "\"The people in charge who are supposed to protect us\u2014 our fellow Americans who we elected, along with those who were appointed, and swore an OATH to protect this nation and our Constitution \u2014 now use the Constitution as a weapon to suit their own ends,\" Hartman's farewell message said.",
      "\"When someone disappears from the office without notice, there's a tendency to think they did something wrong,\" Hartman told CBS News. \"It was important for me to publicly acknowledge my illegal termination because so many others were experiencing it and, quite frankly, I was pissed off.\"",
      "The Justice Department declined a request to comment to CBS News about the firings, resignations or the online farewell messages.",
      "Michael Romano, a prosecutor who handled some Jan. 6 prosecutions, noted his work on Capitol insurrection cases when he resigned in March.",
      "\"Many rioters saw their relationship with the rule of law as transactional, as they demonstrated when they told police officers that they had 'backed the blue' in the past and thus, that the officers should stand down or join the mob . . . .,\" he wrote in his message. \"They expected, in other words,\u00a0 that the rule of law did not apply to them. And, but for the work of the Capitol Siege Section, they would have been right.\"",
      "Romano told CBS News, \"It was important to have my colleagues see me standing up for the work we did. I needed to say it and people needed to hear it.\"",
      "Meredith Burrell, a former civil rights office attorney, wrote in her message, \"We were entrusted with the serious responsibility of engaging the power of the federal government to use the rule of law to vindicate the rights of marginalized people . . .\u00a0 I am still processing the contrast between those 25 years and the last four months.\"",
      "Other farewell messages are limited to praise of colleagues and law enforcement. Greg Rosen, who resigned in May after serving as the head of the unit that prosecuted Capitol riot cases, wrote in his message, \"To those who partnered with me on the January 6 investigation and prosecution: you represent the highest ideals of our nation\u2014unwavering in your commitment to the rule of law and the peaceful transfer of power. To the officers who were injured, physically and emotionally, protecting the greatest legislative body in the world: thank you. You are the embodiment of heroism.\"",
      "Sybil Barksdale, a former official in the agency's Office of Violence against Women, wrote in her message, \"Throughout my career, through changing administrations, evolving legal landscapes, and countless initiatives, I had the privilege of working alongside exceptional colleagues who shared an unwavering dedication to justice and protecting those most vulnerable.\"",
      "A resigned FBI analyst wrote, \"If I learned anything in the FBI, it is that yes, you can say no. If something is wrong, unjust, or unethical, you speak up, and sometimes speaking up means saying 'no.'\"",

    "published": "Sun, 23 Nov 2025 09:16:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Dr. Uma Naidoo, a nutritional psychiatrist, says the sugar found in many comfort foods hits our brains in the same pleasure center as street drugs do. But that's not the only reason we find comfort in such treasured dishes; there is also warm-and-fuzzy nostalgia.",
    "story": [
      "Poorhouse Pies, a bakery in Underhill, Vermont, is home to 50 different types of pie, each one somebody's favorite comfort food. The owner, Suzanne Tomlinson, has been quoted as saying that if comfort food were an Olympic sport, she'd be a contender. \"Yeah, I'm pretty sure I'd get a gold medal,\" she said. \"I love to envision different varieties of comfort foods and then make them into pies.\"",
      "From classic apple, to maple cream, a key ingredient is nostalgia, says Tomlinson. Take the chicken pot pie: \"Chicken pot pie is one of my very favorite comfort foods, and it's probably because my mom used to make it with me. And I still remember her, and I remember the smell of her kitchen and her hands making it, and it connects me to her.\"",
      "So, what defines a dish as a comfort food? \"I think something that gives you that warm-and-fuzzy feeling, like, 'Oh, my stress is going to be relieved, and I'm going to remember a time when I felt safe and loved,'\" Tomlinson said.",
      "RECIPE: Chicken Pot Pie, from Poorhouse Pies",
      "Poorhouse Pies can make from 150 pies a day to more than 1,000 around the holidays. Every pie contains memories, but that's certainly not all it contains. Tomlinson says there isn't anything you couldn't put into a pie. Take their pulled pork mac and cheese pie. \"This sucker weighs three-and-a-half pounds. So, you're feeding your family with that,\" Tomlinson said. \"You're not gonna run a marathon after eating that!\"",
      "So, what is the common thread to comfort foods? Are they high in sugar, fat, salt? \"When we think comfort food, we don't see people reaching out for broccoli,\" said Dr. Uma Naidoo, an author and nutritional psychiatrist. She says the sugar in comfort food hits our brains in the same pleasure center as street drugs do, making us feel instantaneously happy.",
      "\"Sugar is almost more powerful in certain studies than cocaine,\" Naidoo said. \"When someone tells me that they're addicted to sugar, I do take them seriously.\"",
      "Being addicted to comfort food usually means eating more of it \u2013 which, Naidoo says, is of course a bad idea. \"In the short term you may feel calmer or better, but in the longer term it's gonna wreck your mental clarity, your focus, your cognition, and actually you won't feel good,\" she said.",
      "But there are comfort foods that are not high in fat or sugar, says Stefani Sassos, a registered dietician and head of the Good Housekeeping Institute Nutrition & Fitness Lab. \"If you look at kimchi or bibimbap, these are Korean comfort foods, and these have, you know, vegetables incorporated into them and at their core. Then you also have, you know, India cuisine, like dal, a lentil dish. The spices are so delicious. It's a nice plant-based option.\"",
      "\"Plant-based option\" is a key refrain for Sassos, who demonstrated for \"Sunday Morning\" how to make a roasted cauliflower and mashed potatoes dish. She says most comfort food \u2013 even a butter-laden classic like mashed potatoes \u2013 can be made healthier by a simple tweak or two. In this case: Just add cauliflower!",
      "Do you 'fess up? \"I think it depends on the crowd, right?\" said Sassos. \"You could do a surprise, let's see what everyone thinks afterwards.\"",
      "RECIPE: Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes & Cauliflower (from Good Housekeeping Test Kitchen)",
      "The true surprise was in the tasting. \"It's actually pretty good!\" I said.",
      "\"It's not bad!\" said Sassos.",
      "\"But it's gotta be better than not bad.\"",
      "So, how does Dr. Uma Naidoo feel about comfort food? \"I love them,\" she laughed. \"I love comfort foods. I think they're great.\"",
      "But are you supposed to admit that? \"I'm only human,\" she said.",
      "\"I love to feed people their comfort food,\" said Poorhouse Pies owner Susan Tomlinson.",
      "And what message does Tomlinson have for comfort food lovers as Thanksgiving approaches? \"Enjoy in moderation,\" she laughed. \"Make 'em with someone you love. Pass it on; they are passed from generation to generation.\"",

    "summary": "The FDA said it received multiple reports that the baby formula is still being found on store shelves in multiple states.",
    "story": [
      "Cases of botulism tied to ByHeart baby formula have doubled since the company expanded its recall of the products early this month, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.",
      "There are now at least 31 reported cases of infant botulism associated with various lots of the ByHeart Whole Nutrition infant formula, the FDA said Wednesday. The infants were hospitalized across 15 states since Aug. 9, with the most recent case reported on Nov. 13, but no deaths have been reported.",
      "Symptoms of infant botulism can take weeks to develop and can include poor feeding, loss of head control, drooping eyelids and a flat facial expression, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. Babies may feel \"floppy\" and can have problems swallowing or breathing.",
      "Despite the expanded recall of all ByHeart infant formula products, the FDA said it received multiple reports that the baby formula is still being found on store shelves in multiple states.",
      "The FDA's update also said the recalled products have been sold online and shipped outside the U.S., cautioning consumers to not use any of the ByHeart brand products.",
      "\"We are doing everything we can to show up for parents,\" ByHeart said in a statement on Nov. 13. \"Please know that we are actively working on updates, and we will keep sharing information as quickly and clearly as we can.\"",
      "The parents of at least two babies sickened in the infantile botulism outbreak last week said they are suing the makers of the ByHeart baby formula. The lawsuits, filed in federal courts in two states, allege that the ByHeart formula the babies consumed was defective and the company was negligent in selling it. They seek financial payment for medical bills, emotional distress and other harm.",
      "\"It was just absolutely terrifying,\" Hanna Everett told CBS News in an interview. \"You know, we just kind of felt like we failed as a parent in some ways.\"",
      "ByHeart officials had said they would \"address any legal claims in due course.\"",
      "\"We remain focused on ensuring that families using ByHeart products are aware of the recall and have factual information about steps they should take,\" the company had said in a statement. In a separate statement provided to CBS News last week, the company said, \"We express our deepest sympathy to the families currently impacted by the cases of infant botulism.\"",
      "Infant botulism is caused by a type of bacterium that produces a toxin in the large intestine. The bacterium is spread through hardy spores present in the environment that can cause serious illness, including paralysis, the CDC says.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration said it would end Temporary Protected Status for nearly 4,000 immigrants from Myanmar.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Monday said it would end yet another Temporary Protected Status immigration program, this time for nearly 4,000 immigrants from Myanmar, a country in Southeast Asia engulfed in civil war over the past several years.",
      "The announcement is the latest move by President Trump's administration to curtail humanitarian immigration programs, which it has argued have been exploited by bad actors and extended for too long, despite the intended temporary nature of the TPS policy. The administration has also said TPS encourages illegal immigration, since some of those who've benefited from the policy entered the U.S. illegally.",
      "As part of its immigration crackdown, the Trump administration has moved to revoke TPS protections for hundreds of thousands of migrants from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Syria, Sudan and Venezuela, making many of them eligible for arrest and deportation. Pro-immigrant advocates have called the campaign the largest de-documentation effort in modern U.S. history.",
      "Created by Congress in 1990, TPS has allowed Democratic and Republican administrations to offer temporary work permits and deportation protections to immigrants from countries facing armed conflict, an environmental disaster or another emergency that makes their return unsafe. The program was greatly expanded under former President Joe Biden.",
      "Since 2021, when the country's military staged a coup, Myanmar has been plagued by armed conflict and political instability. Armed militias scattered throughout the country have fought the country's military, which has a long history of persecuting minority groups, including members of the Rohingya Muslim community. The United Nations said earlier this year that the military had killed roughly 6,500 civilians as of March and that the violence had displaced more than 3.5 million people.",
      "While it acknowledged that Myanmar \"continues to face humanitarian challenges,\" the Department of Homeland Security argued in an official notice that ending the country's TPS program was warranted because there have been \"improvements\" in \"governance and stability\" there.",
      "The DHS notice, signed by Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, also said that continuing the TPS policy for Myanmar was at odds with national U.S. interests. The department cited concerns about the ability to properly vet people from Myanmar and the risk of them overstaying their visas, and said a number of TPS holders from that country were subject to national security or immigration fraud investigations.",
      "Federal government figures indicate there are currently 3,969 people enrolled in the Myanmar TPS program. Unless a court intervenes, the program will expire in late January.",

      "A pocket watch that once belonged to one of the Titanic's most renowned passengers has sold at an auction for $2.3 million \u2014 a record price for memorabilia related to the historic shipwreck, according to the auction house.",
      "The 18-carat gold watch was gifted to its original owner, Isidor Straus, by his wife, Ida Straus, for his 43rd birthday, said Henry Aldridge and Son, the auction house that sold it on Saturday. It was recovered from his body after the Titanic sunk in the North Atlantic in April 1912.",
      "Isidor Straus was an American businessman and politician who owned the Macy's department store in New York City. He and his wife were first-class passengers on the Titanic during its maiden voyage from England to New York, and the couple are remembered for their final act of selflessness while on board.",
      "Witnesses who survived the Titanic wreck said afterward that the Strauses were offered two seats on a lifeboat once the ship had struck an iceberg, according to the U.K. government's\u00a0National Archives. But Isidor Straus refused his seat, instead insisting that it should have been offered to younger men, and Ida Straus followed him, reportedly saying, \"Where you go, I go.\"",
      "According to those archives, Isidor and Ida Straus were last seen standing arm in arm on the deck of the Titanic, before a wave crashed overhead and washed them out to sea. The Strauses were the ancestors of Wendy Rush, wife of OceanGate founder Stockton Rush, who died in the infamous Titan submersible explosion in 2023 en route to the Titanic wreck site.",
      "Straus' pocket watch exceeded the previous record sale for a piece of the Titanic's history memorabilia by about $300,000, according to Henry Aldridge and Son. The previous record was set for another gold pocket watch, which sold an auction last year for about $1.97 million. It had been gifted by Titanic survivors to the captain of the RMS Carpathia, who steered his ship toward the Titanic wreck on the night it sunk and ultimately rescued hundreds of passengers still afloat on life boats, according to the auction house.",
      "\"Pocket watches are incredibly personal items,\" said Andrew Aldridge, managing director of the auction house, in a statement. \"Every man, woman and child passenger or crew had a story to tell and they are told 113 years later through the objects that they owned.

      "Reggae music icon Jimmy Cliff, who's unique tone, lyricism and breakthrough role on the silver screen helped make the music of his native Jamaica part of popular culture across the globe, has died at the age of 81, his family said in a statement shared Monday on social media.",
      "\"It's with profound sadness that I share that my husband, Jimmy Cliff, has crossed over due to a seizure followed by pneumonia,\" Latifa Chambers said in a statement posted on Cliff's Instagram account. \"I am thankful for his family, friends, fellow artists and coworkers who have shared his journey with him. To all his fans around the world, please know that your support was his strength throughout his whole career \u2026 Jimmy, my darling, may you rest in peace. I will follow your wishes.\"",
      "The couple's children Lilty and Aken also signed the statement.",
      "Cliff was one of Jamaican music's early international stars, emerging as reggae evolved from the sounds of ska and rocksteady in the 1960s and early 1970s. His starring role in the enduring classic movie \"The Harder They Come,\" an entirely Jamaican production, in 1972 cemented his legacy as not only a musician, but a cultural phenom.",
      "Cliff played Ivanhoe \"Ivan\" Martin,  an aspiring singer who came up against the harsh realities of a music business run by self-interested producers, at the expense of artists, and the abundant traps for young Jamaicans trying to survive amid an epidemic of violent gang crime that swept the nation.",
      "\"Ivanhoe was a real-life character for Jamaicans,\" Cliff told Variety magazine in a 2022 interview to mark the 50th anniversary of the movie's release. \"When I was a little boy, I used to hear about him as being a bad man. A real bad man. No one in Jamaica, at that time, had guns. But he had guns and shot a policeman, so he was someone to be feared. However, being a hero was the manner in which [director] Perry [Henzel] wanted to make his name \u2014 an anti-hero in the way that Hollywood turns its bad guys into heroes.\"",
      "The messages in the movie, just like his music, were timeless.",
      "The title track from \"The Harder They Come,\" along with familiar hits including \"Many Rivers to Cross\" and \"You Can Get It If You Really Want,\" spoke to the struggles of Jamaicans at the time, but they have continued to resonate with audiences around the world since he wrote them.",
      "Cliff, along with other icons such as Bob Marley and Toots Hibbert helped give the music and culture of their relatively small Caribbean nation a global impact that endures today, and far exceeds Jamaica's size in terms of population economy.",
      "His animated onstage presence and high-pitched tone were unmistakable. Cliff released his last single, \"Human Touch,\"   only four years ago. According to The Associated Press, Cliff was nominated for Grammy awards seven times and he won twice, taking best reggae album in 1986 with \"Cliff Hanger,\" and again in 2012 with \"Rebirth.\"",
      "In a tribute posted on his own social media accounts early Monday morning, Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness called Cliff \"a true cultural giant whose music carried the heart of our nation to the world.\"",
      "\"Jimmy Cliff told our story with honesty and soul,\" Holness said. \"His music lifted people through hard times, inspired generations, and helped to shape the global respect that Jamaican culture enjoys today.  We give thanks for his life, his contribution, and the pride he brought to Jamaica ... Walk good, Jimmy Cliff. Your legacy lives on in every corner of our island and in the hearts of the Jamaican people.\"",

      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday that the suggested legal recognition of Russian sovereignty over captured territory in the east of his country remained a \"main problem\" in negotiations as President Trump pushes for a deal to end Moscow's nearly-four-year war on Ukraine.",
      "Ukrainian and American officials met over the weekend in Switzerland to discuss a 28-point proposal floated last week by the White House. They discussed the possibility of Zelenskyy visiting the U.S. this week as part of Mr. Trump's bid to get an agreement by Thanksgiving, CBS News' Margaret Brennan reported, citing multiple U.S. and Ukrainian officials familiar with the discussions.",
      "Mr. Trump has described the Thanksgiving deadline as flexible, and he told reporters Saturday that the plan presented last week was \"not my final\" proposal.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was in Geneva for the weekend talks, said \"very, very meaningful\" progress was made with the Ukrainian and European delegations, but that \"there's still some work left to do and that's what our teams are going to be doing right now.\"",
      "Addressing Sweden's parliament on Monday, Zelenskyy made it clear one of the key points of contention over the U.S. proposal was a call for Ukraine and the global community to formally recognize some portion of the ground Russian forces have occupied by force as no longer Ukrainian.",
      "\"Putin wants legal recognition to what he has stolen, to break the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty,\" Zelenskyy said. \"That's the main problem. You all understand what that means.\"",
      "Finland's President Alexander Stubb said there were still \"major issues which remain to be resolved\" regarding the U.S. peace proposal, though he also welcomed progress made during the high-stakes talks in Geneva.",
      "Rubio struck a more optimistic tone in describing the weekend talks, saying Sunday that the session in Geneval was \"probably the most productive day we have had on this issue\" since President Trump came back into office for his second term in January.",
      "Rubio stressed that there was more work to do and said he didn't want to \"declare victory or finality.\"",
      "The top U.S. diplomat was pressed by reporters but would not offer any insight into which issues were the main sticking points in the peace talks. He called the proposal a \"living, breathing document\" and said he believed the issues that remained unsettled were \"not insurmountable.\"",

    "story": [
      "Peshawar, Pakistan \u2014 Two suicide bombers attacked the headquarters of a security force in northwestern Pakistan on Monday morning, killing at least three officers and wounding 11 others, police and rescue officials said.",
      "The attack took place in Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan, when security forces were preparing for the morning parade at the sprawling facility located in the heart of the city, said Peshawar Police Chief Saeed Ahmad.",
      "He said one attacker detonated his explosives at the main gate of the provincial headquarters of the Federal Constabulary, while the second bomber was shot and killed by officers near the parking area.",
      "According to Ahmad, about 150 security personnel were on open ground inside the headquarters for morning parade drills when the attack took place. \"The terrorists involved in today's attack were on foot and failed to reach the parade area and a timely response by our forces prevented a much larger tragedy,\" he told The Associated Press.",
      "He said police had completed the clearance operation and authorities had collected samples of the body parts of the attackers for DNA tests. He added police are still investigating to determine the identity and nationality of the attackers without giving further details.",
      "Asim Khan, a spokesperson at the government-run Lady Reading Hospital, said all 11 persons wounded in the Peshawar attack were listed in stable condition.",
      "Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in separate statements, condemned the attack in Peshawar, with Zardari calling it a \"cowardly act by foreign-backed terrorists,\" and Sharif saying the swift response of security forces prevented a larger tragedy. They offered condolences to the families of the victims.",
      "No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.",
      "However, the Pakistani Taliban, also known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, have been blamed for similar previous assaults in the country, which has witnessed a surge in militant attacks. The TPP is separate from but allied with the Afghan Taliban that leads Afghanistan.",
      "The latest attack came less than two weeks after a suicide bomber struck outside a court in Pakistan's capital Islamabad, detonating his explosives next to a police car and killing 12 people.",
      "The attacks have strained ties between Islamabad and Afghanistan's Taliban government, with Pakistan accusing the Pakistani Taliban of operating freely inside Afghanistan since the Taliban takeover in 2021.",
      "Pakistan's government often accuses Afghanistan of turning a blind eye to cross-border attacks by militants.",
      "Kabul denies the allegation, but tensions between the two sides escalated after Afghanistan blamed Pakistan for Oct. 9 drone strikes in Kabul and vowed retaliation. The ensuing fighting killed dozens of people, including soldiers, civilians and militants, before Qatar brokered a ceasefire on Oct. 19, which remains in place.",
      "It was followed by two rounds of talks in Istanbul, during which the two sides failed to reach an agreement after Afghanistan refused to give guarantees in writing about preventing the TTP from using Afghan soil for attacks inside Pakistan.",

    "story": [
      "A 33-year-old South Korean man was sentenced to life in prison Monday for running an online blackmail ring that sexually exploited or abused 261 victims, including more than a dozen minors he raped or assaulted, over a four-year period before his arrest in January.",
      "The Seoul Central District Court said the severity of Kim Nok-wan's crimes warrants his \"permanent isolation from society.\" It sentenced 10 accomplices to prison terms ranging from two to four years in what law enforcement authorities describe as the country's largest cybersex crime case to date.",
      "He was the head of the so-called Vigilantes: a large-scale, pyramid-style group that blackmailed victims into producing explicit content and sharing it in online chatrooms, BBC News reported. Calling himself the \"pastor\" of the group, Kim targeted both male and female victims, according to the BBC News.",
      "Starting around August 2020, Kim targeted women who posted sexually suggestive content on social media, and men attempting to join secret Telegram chat rooms for sharing digitally-manipulated sexual images of acquaintances. He threatened to expose them and coerced them into recruiting new victims, forming a pyramid-like blackmail ring on the app that produced and shared manipulated sexual images of their targets, most of whom were minors, according to details of the crimes revealed in court.",
      "Kim raped or assaulted 16 victims, including 14 minors, and recorded videos of his crimes in 13 of those cases. He created roughly 1,700 sexually exploitative images or videos targeting about 70 victims, disseminating around 260 of them online to threaten those who refused to cooperate, and also attempted to blackmail some of the victims' family members and work colleagues, the court said.",
      "\"[Kim Nok-wan] says in court that he is remorseful, but he committed countless crimes over the past four to five years,\" the court said, per BBC News. \"Considering the brutality of the crimes and the lack of restitution for victims, it is necessary to permanently isolate him from society.\"",
      "The other defendants, including five minors, knew that the victims they recruited through threats involving video and images would face the same sexual exploitation they had endured, but carried out the acts anyway to prevent their own images from being circulated, the court said.",
      "\"Most of the victims were children or adolescents, and it appears they would have suffered extreme physical and psychological pain as a result of the crimes,\" the court said in a statement.",
      "\"Digital sex crimes can rapidly amplify the damages of the victims to an irreparable level in the digital space, and once sexually exploitative materials are distributed, it's physically very difficult to completely remove them, making recovery from damage practically impossible.\"",
      "The revelation of Kim's crimes following his January arrest triggered public shock and concern over the growing risk of sexual violence enabled by digital technologies. Monday's ruling came almost five years after the same court issued a 40-year prison term for Cho Ju-bin on charges of blackmailing dozens of women, including minors, into filming sexually explicit videos and selling them to others.",

    "story": [
      "Manila, Philippines \u2014 Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. refused to respond on Monday to an allegation by his estranged sister, a senator, that he has been a longtime drug addict whose cocaine dependence has undermined his governance, saying with a somber tone that he didn't want to discuss a family rift in public.",
      "That split has been growing since Imee Marcos publicly aligned with his political arch rival, Vice President Sara Duterte, ahead of midterm elections in May. Sara Duterte is the daughter of Rodrigo Duterte, Ferdinand Maros Jr.'s harsh critic and predecessor.",
      "Communications Undersecretary Claire Castro has said that Sen. Imee Marcos' accusations against her own brother before a huge religious rally in Manila last week were \"a web of lies\" and may have been a desperate attempt to distract from ongoing investigations into a corruption scandal that may implicate her opposition allies in the Senate.",
      "Aides have said in the past that Marcos Jr. had tested negative for cocaine and methamphetamine. When asked to respond to his elder sister's allegations, the president briefly paused and then said in a televised news conference, \"It's anathema to talk about family matters generally in public. We do not like to show our dirty linen in public.\"",
      "The president suggested that something was troubling her sister. \"The lady that you see talking on TV is not my sister and that view is shared by our cousins, friends, that it's not her,\" he said without elaborating.",
      "\"That's why we are worried, we are very worried about her. I hope she feels better soon,\" the president said. When asked if he plans to talk to her, Marcos said that he and his sister \"no longer travel in the same circles, political or otherwise.\"",
      "Marcos, 68, and his sister are children of then dictator Ferdinand Marcos Sr., who was overthrown in an army-backed but largely peaceful \"people power\" uprising in 1986 after an authoritarian era that was notorious for human rights and political repression and plunder. The dictator died in exile in Hawaii in 1989. His family returned to the Philippines in 1991 and slowly regained a political foothold.",
      "Marcos Jr. won the presidency in 2022 with a landslide margin in one of the greatest political comebacks in Philippines history.",
      "In a speech Monday night before a huge rally by a religious group in a Manila park, Imee Marcos said her brother's drug addiction allegedly started when their father was still president and has continued to this day. She claimed it has affected his health and ability to govern.",
      "Rodrigo Duterte was arrested on an International Criminal Court warrant in March and flown to and detained in the Netherlands for alleged crimes against humanity over his brutal anti-drug crackdowns that left thousands of mostly poor suspects dead. Duterte has denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Duterte's family and allies, including Imee Marcos, have blamed Marcos Jr. for what they claim was the ex-president's illegal arrest and detention by the global court.",

      "London \u2014 Pressure is increasing on the former Prince Andrew to give evidence to a U.S. congressional committee investigating\u00a0convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein after Britain's prime minister suggested he should testify.",
      "Keir Starmer declined to comment directly about King Charles III's disgraced younger brother but told reporters traveling with him for the Group of 20 summit in Johannesburg that as a \"general principle,\" people should provide evidence to investigators.",
      "\"I don't comment on his particular case,'' Starmer said. \"But as a general principle I've held for a very long time is that anybody who has got relevant information in relation to these kind of cases should give that evidence to those that need it.''",
      "The former prince, now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, has so far ignored a request from members of the House Oversight Committee for a \"transcribed interview\" about his \"long-standing friendship\" with Epstein. Andrew was stripped of his royal titles and honors last month as the royal family tried to insulate itself from criticism about his relationship with Epstein.",
      "Starmer's comments came after Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the committee's ranking Democrat, and Rep. Suhas Subramanyam, a Democrat from Virginia, said Andrew \"continues to hide\" from serious questions.",
      "\"Our work will move forward with or without him, and we will hold anyone who was involved in these crimes accountable, no matter their wealth, status or political party,\" they said in a statement released on Friday. \"We will get justice for the survivors.\"",

      "Among the potential avenues discussed regarding operations for Venezuela was dropping U.S. leaflets on Caracas as a kind of psychological warfare to pressure Maduro, multiple U.S. officials familiar with the talks told CBS News.",
      "The operation, which was not yet authorized, could possibly take place Sunday, the officials said, which is Maduro's 63rd birthday.",
      "The Washington Post was first to report on the proposed leaflet operation.",
      "Over the past few months, the U.S. has ratcheted up the pressure on Maduro in multiple ways, including an extensive military buildup in the region,\u00a0live fire exercises, and strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific.",
      "When asked Monday, President Trump said he wouldn't rule out sending U.S. troops into Venezuela.",
      "\"No, I don't rule out that,\" the president said. \"I don't rule out anything. We just have to take care of Venezuela.\"",

      "Last month, Mr. Trump\u00a0also confirmed\u00a0that he has authorized the CIA to go into Venezuela and conduct covert operations.",
      "The Pentagon has conducted\u00a0at least 21 strikes\u00a0since early September, killing at least 80 people. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has said the strikes are designed to target cartels and drug traffickers, although\u00a0it has not provided evidence\u00a0that the vessels struck so far were carrying drugs.",
      "There are currently about 15,000 U.S. troops in the region. A Navy official told CBS News last week that the U.S. had four military ships in the western Atlantic, including the USS Gerald R.

It had another seven military ships in the Caribbean, the official said, which included two guided missile destroyers, two guided missile cruisers, an amphibious assault ship and two amphibious transport dock ships.",

    "summary": "The proposed trip is part of President Trump's push to get an agreement on Ukraine by Thanksgiving, U.S. and Ukrainian officials said.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. and Ukrainian officials are discussing the potential of bringing President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the U.S. this week as part of President Trump's push to get an agreement on Ukraine by Thanksgiving, according to multiple U.S. and Ukrainian officials familiar with the discussions.",
      "Whether Zelenskyy's trip happens is dependent on the outcome of peace negotiations in Geneva on Sunday, the officials said. Mr. Trump himself has described the deadline as flexible, and he told reporters on Saturday the plan was \"not my final\" proposal.",
      "Speaking from Geneva, Secretary of State Marco Rubio touted progress in discussions with a cadre of European and Ukrainian officials, but said more work would need to be done.",
      "\"I think this was a very, very meaningful \u2013 I would say probably best \u2013 meeting and day we've had so far in this entire process, going back to when we first came into office in January,\" he said. \"But there's still some work left to do and that's what our teams are going to be doing right now,\" Rubio added, promising updates after additional meetings.",
      "\"We have very good progress and we are moving forward to the just and lasting peace,\" said Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyy's chief of staff, after meeting with Rubio.",
      "There are no hard plans for a Zelenskyy visit at this moment given the active diplomacy nor are there scheduled talks with or in Russia at this point, according to a senior White House official. Another possible outcome of the negotiations in Geneva is that Army Secretary Dan Driscoll could travel to Russia or meet with Russian officials elsewhere, according to another U.S. official. Russian officials told CBS News that nothing yet is scheduled.",
      "Ukraine's response to the 28-point memo",
      "Ukraine's Ambassador to the U.S., Olga Stefanishyna, told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that her country had not agreed to all the terms in the draft 28-point peace plan that leaked to the press last week.",
      "\"This plan is not about justice and the truth of this war and the aggression,\" Stefanishyna said. \"It's about, you know, ending the war and stopping the military engagement.\"",
      "Stefanishyna said that Russia has not made any concessions to date and that none of the points in the leaked 28-point plan are related to forcing anything on the Russian side.",
      "In addition to the proposal, an early draft of which was leaked by an opposition politician in Ukraine and verified by the White House, there is an accompanying document related to security guarantees, according to U.S. and Ukrainian officials.",
      "Stefanishyna also confirmed that there is an additional document to the 28 points and referred to it as \"the framework of security assurances.\" She said it states the intention of the U.S. to provide something along the lines of Article 5 of the Washington NATO Treaty, such as a defense promise. However, unlike that NATO guarantee, the security assurances do not have a detailed layout of security guarantees nor the weight of Congressional approval and backing that would come with a treaty. That is a challenge for Ukraine, Stefanishyna said, in part because of past failures by the West to live up to security assurances given when Ukraine handed over its nuclear weapons as part of the 1994 Budapest memorandum.",
      "Why now?",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News that Russian President Vladimir Putin seems to believe that he will take the Donetsk region of Ukraine one way or the other \u2013 either through a negotiated settlement or on the battlefield. The Trump administration's negotiations in Geneva began from the premise that Putin is correct. While that same U.S. official declined to provide a U.S. assessment of whether Ukraine is losing the war in the East, the U.S. official",
      "said that the trajectory of the fighting points to Russia taking Donetsk. The official indicated that the Russian progress in the eastern frontline city of Pokrovsk, which is a logistics hub for Ukraine, was not a positive sign for Kyiv's defensive prospects. Russian media often refers to Pokrovsk as the \"gateway\" to Ukraine's industrial Donbas region.",
      "Inter-Trump administration confusion",
      "There were separate but parallel diplomatic efforts on Ukraine taking place within the Trump administration that are now being merged.",
      "Mr. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and U.S. special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff have been working on what they refer to as a \"term sheet\" to end the war, mimicking their broad-strokes proposal for a Gaza ceasefire. While the Trump administration put sanctions on Russian oil and gas to bring Putin to the negotiating table, Putin advisor Kirill Dmitriev was already at a table in Miami talking to Witkoff at the end of last month.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent at the time dismissed Dmitriev as a \"Russian propagandist,\" but it was Dmitriev who helped draft this 28-point proposal that the U.S. is now backing. A senior White House official told CBS News that Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio were kept \"apprised\" of those talks, which happened in Miami last month. At a time when Zelenskyy is facing a domestic political scandal at home, the Kushner-Witkoff term sheet leaked to the press via an opposition politician in Ukraine and through an interview Dmitriev did with Axios.",
      "On Saturday, a number of senators, including Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations committee, as well as Republican Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota and independent Sen. Angus King of Maine, said that Rubio had explained to them that the 28-point proposal was not of American origin and assured them that he personally had not heard of any threat to cut off U.S. military and intelligence sharing with Ukraine if it did not agree to terms. Rubio posted Saturday on social media that the \"plan was authored by the U.S.\"",
      "However, a Ukrainian official and a U.S. official told CBS News that the threat had been made during talks with other senior U.S. officials in Kyiv. Driscoll, a close friend of Vance's, led a delegation there last week. He's now in Geneva as part of talks.",
      "A senior White House official acknowledged to CBS News that the threat to cut off aid to Ukraine may have been implied but not explicitly stated during talks with Ukraine's leadership when U.S. officials said that Mr. Trump is getting \"weary and frustrated\" and cannot keep doing this forever.",
      "The same senior White House official told CBS News that Vance and Rubio held a call Saturday night with Driscoll and U.S. military leadership in order to answer questions from lawmakers. Rubio made additional phone calls to lawmakers, which Shaheen, King and Rounds detailed",
      "\"There are many problems with the plan as it has been reported, but the two most obvious are that it rewards Russia's illegal and unprovoked aggression by handing over substantial portions of Ukraine's sovereign territory, and its security guarantees against further Russian aggression are vague and inadequate,\" Senator King said in a statement Sunday. \"I hope that after consultation with Ukraine and the Europeans, a more fair and responsible agreement will emerge.\"",
      "When did the Army become involved in diplomacy?",
      "Driscoll has been in contact with Ukrainian officials in recent weeks and was originally planning to go to Ukraine in mid-December to discuss drone technology, but he was recently asked by Mr. Trump to restart talks about a ceasefire. Driscoll's role in the talks has involved details of the security guarantees being given to Ukraine.",
      "Driscoll combined his two missions on this trip. While Driscoll was en route to Ukraine, the 28-point plan was leaked by an anti-Zelenskyy politician. After this point, the Driscoll mission was \"adjusted\" to involve the emerging diplomacy building off the leaked Kushner-Witkoff term sheet, according to multiple U.S. officials familiar with the planning.",
      "The U.S. officials declined to discuss details of how the 28-point plan, or the additional security guarantee document have changed in the past few days.",
      "Vance has been a driving force behind the Ukraine diplomacy, according to a European diplomat and a source familiar. His close friend Driscoll has become a key conduit.",
      "Political implications",
      "The Trump administration has been reaching out in the past few days to respond to senators and congressmen including powerful, pro-Ukraine Republicans who are upset with the reported concessions being asked of Ukraine. Republican Rep Mike McCaul, chair emeritus of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, publicly acknowledged the outreach from Vance-Rubio and said he was assured it was a U.S. proposal not a Russian one.",
      "The Trump administration is sensitive to the idea of a rift between Rubio and Witkoff. It was Witkoff who engineered the August summit with Putin in Alaska.",
      "There has been much retroactive policymaking and recasting of events as we're seeing from the on camera remarks made by Rubio's old colleagues who may recall he was a Russia hawk during his Senate days. Since his time in the Senate, Vance has been consistent in arguing that Ukraine should not be a top priority for the U.S. Meanwhile, Witkoff has been trying to get Mr. Trump the deal to end the war that he so desires.",

      "\"They reaffirmed that any future agreement must fully uphold Ukraine's sovereignty and deliver a sustainable and just peace,\" the statement read in part. \"Both sides reiterated their readiness to continue working together to secure a peace that ensures Ukraine's security, stability, and reconstruction.\"",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a post on Telegram that the delegates had \"substantive conversations\" that would continue.",

      "In a\u00a0Truth Social post\u00a0before Sunday's talks, Mr. Trump said the Ukraine-Russia war is \"a violent and terrible one that, with strong and proper U.S. and Ukrainian LEADERSHIP, would have NEVER HAPPENED.\"",

      "The 28-point blueprint drawn up by the U.S. sparked alarm in Kyiv and across Europe, quickly rallying Western allies around Ukraine in a push to revise the plan, which is seen as favoring Moscow. They said in a joint statement on Saturday that while the plan \"includes important elements that will be essential for a just and lasting peace,\" additional work is required. The plan acquiesces to many of Russia's demands that Ukraine has categorically rejected on dozens of occasions, including giving up large pieces of territory.",
      "After the first session, Rubio said, \"This will ultimately have to be signed off by our presidents, although I feel very comfortable about that happening given the progress we've made.\" He was joined at the talks by U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll and Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff.",

      "After Mr. Trump's post, Zelenskyy cheered U.S.-led efforts on security, but stressed that \"the crux of the entire diplomatic situation is that it was Russia, and only Russia, that started this war.\"",
      "\"Ukraine is grateful to the United States, to every American heart, and personally to President Trump for the assistance that \u2013 starting with the Javelins \u2013 has been saving Ukrainian lives. We thank everyone in Europe, in the G7, and in the G20 who is helping us defend life. It is important to preserve the support.",

      "\"The leadership of the United States is important, we are grateful for everything that America and President Trump are doing for security, and we remain as constructive as possible,\" Zelenskyy said in a post on Telegram.",
      "Some U.S. lawmakers said Saturday that Rubio had privately described the plan as a Russian \"wish list\" rather than a Washington-led proposal. The bipartisan group of senators held a news conference, stating that they had spoken with Rubio about the peace plan after he reached out to some of them while en route to Geneva. Independent Maine Sen. Angus King said Rubio told them the plan \"was not the administration's plan\" but a \"wish list of the Russians.\"",

      "UKRAINIAN AMBASSADOR OLGA STEFANISHYNA: Welcome, Margaret, hello.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand this is a very intense week for your country for a number of reasons, including the diplomacy that's happening right now as we sit here in Geneva. Your president said Ukraine faces a choice between losing its dignity or losing a key ally, the United States. What has been agreed to at this point?",
      "AMB. STEFANISHYNA: Well as- as it is known, the consultation are still ongoing between Ukraine and the American officials. This is Secretary of State Rubio, and also Secretary of Army Driscoll, who arrived a little bit earlier. These consultations are still continue on the basis of the proposal of the American side on 28 point peace plan, as it's been called here. And European allies are also present in Geneva these days to work hand in hand with the Ukrainian delegation, but also with the American delegation to discuss the proposals on our and on their side. So the consultations are still ongoing, but there has been a number of points which have been already widely discussed in public.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you aware of Russia making any concessions at this point?",
      "AMB. STEFANISHYNA: Well, it does not seem this way from the proposal which is on the table. In fact- in fact, none of the points are actually related to- to forcing anything on the Russian side. Of course, it's recognized that it is- it is aggression. There is a number of points related to return of hostages and- and prisoners of war, of a humanitarian nation. But this is definitely not about the justice. This plan is not about the justice and the truth of this war and- and the aggression. It's about, you know, ending the war and stopping the military engagement.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's unfair to Ukraine, you're saying.",
      "AMB. STEFANISHYNA: Well again, I think this should be divided. This plan is not about justice, you know, and this plan is about a number of actions proposed as part of estimated agreement between Ukraine and potentially Russian Federation. Ukraine is in intensive engagement in a very constructive way with the American side and under the umbrella of U.S. leadership, these discussions are ongoing, and we believe that the fair peace is not the words, but this is something that should be put on paper. So, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you been told that the United States will cut off military and intelligence sharing if President Zelenskyy doesn't agree to this plan by Thursday?",
      "AMB. STEFANISHYNA: I think it's- it's totally unfair to- to American colleagues and partners to quote this or that statements which were weighed- which were done in course of, you know, various meetings and phone calls. There was quite a few, you know, we had a first senior military visit to Ukraine by Secretary of Army Driscoll since- since we gained the independence in 1991. And I had a meeting with him as well here in Washington. And his role is extremely- extremely clear to us. We also had an engagement between president and vice president on a phone call. There was, like, a lot of discussions. Some of them were more emotional. Some were- them were less emotional, but here we are. We are sitting together and looking for a solution to end the war, and Russia is not part of this process formally.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the- the Wall Street Journal is reporting that in addition to those 28 points, there's a separate document that has to do with security guarantees. I have also been told that there's a separate document with security guarantees.",
      "AMB. STEFANISHYNA: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Journal is reporting that it's 10 years of support, but it doesn't commit the U.S. to provide direct military assistance. What guarantees do you want from the United States?",
      "AMB. STEFANISHYNA: Well, there is a separate document called the framework, like of the security assurances from the United States. So this is not the agreement. This is not the treaty. This is not the- the- the formal or detailed layout of what security guarantees is. That is the like document specifying the intention that U.S. government is committed to providing security assurances, which are like something like the Article 5 of the Washington NATO Treaty. So it's- it's still very different, and it specifies it's been in a public access so it's been publicly leaked as well, so, that U.S. will stand up together with the allies, in case of the Russian aggression from the territory of the Russian Federation. I think we should not forget that the Russian aggression started, in fact, from Belarusian territory. So they're, like, a lot of nuances, and this is to be discussed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, I see. So you're saying you want a clear security guarantee that says if you're invaded, or if you're attacked, including by surrounding countries that are Russian proxies. You want America to say that it will come to Ukraine's defense?",
      "AMB. STEFANISHYNA: Yeah, absolutely. We can really speak about security assurances where we have, like the real document in front of our eyes and what is really important that we had- we are very complicated partner for U.S., because we also had a lot of different sad experiences, like Budapest Memorandum where we gave up nuclear weapons that we had, another of different situations where we have learned our lessons and we face the aggression for three and a half year and we learned.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I have to ask you. U.S. and European officials tell me that the trajectory on the battlefield for Ukraine is not good, particularly in that key industrial city of Pokrovsk --",
      "AMB. STEFANISHYNA: -- Pokrovsk.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Pokrovsk. And that Russia will likely take control of this, and that this is sort of a gateway to the eastern part, that the Donbas. How do you respond to the argument that Ukraine is losing on the battlefield and that you need to negotiate now?",
      "AMB. STEFANISHYNA: Well, Ukraine is one of the largest European countries, and on the regular, within one week, there are more than 1,000 combat engagements happening on all the front line, and Russia is trying to present that it's only happening in Pokrovsk, right? So this is a victorious narrative Russia is using as a tactics of pressuring or changing the reality also here in the United States. That's why I mean Pokrovsk is a very important spot on the front line, but definitely not the only one.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador, thank you for your time this morning. We'll be right back.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Sen. Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 23, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Republican Senator Rand Paul, who joins us from Bowling Green, Kentucky. Welcome back to the program, Senator. A lot to get to, but on this concern about political violence or angry rhetoric, I know the President himself has survived these two attempts on his life. You talked to us about those risks to him. And then we had this killing of Charlie Kirk just a few months ago. Is the President holding himself to the same standard that he is asking of others when it comes to dialing back dangerous rhetoric?",
      "SEN. RAND PAUL: You know, everybody knows that the President is famous for his unfiltered social media. But if you take at face value the idea that calling your opponents traitors and then specifically saying that it warrants the death penalty is reckless, inappropriate, irresponsible, there are a number of other ways to describe it, but it's not something that is helping the country heal wounds. I think it stirs things up and- and really, I think we can do better.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, on the homeland security front, I understand you are chair of that committee, and so you have some insight into some of these domestic threats. It's not just these Democratic lawmakers. We saw out in the state of Indiana, four Republican state senators were targeted by swatting threats amid President Trump's public pressure on them to redistrict their state. Just a few weeks ago, we did see one of the convicted January 6 rioters who was then pardoned by President Trump arrested for threatening to kill Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Are we at the point here where it's not just unfiltered social media posts, but truly dangerous rhetoric?",
      "SEN. RAND PAUL: Well, you know, I've been on the receiving side of this. Even my father, who's been retired for some time, has been on the receiving end of swatting. Police are called. Says there's an emergency in the home, and the goal is to, you know, have someone draw a gun and be killed as the police come in, supposedly to rescue someone who's not really in need of being rescued. So, I think both sides have been doing this, and I think the language on treason and traitors, both to Republicans and Democrats, is, as I said, reckless, inappropriate, irresponsible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think that- so one of the other developments we've seen just over the weekend is that Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican from Georgia, just a staunch supporter for so long of the President, has said she is going to step away because she's paid such a public price for some of her positions. Do you think there is room in your party for disagreeing with President Trump?",
      "SEN. RAND PAUL: I think it's important that we have independent voices. So, I'm sad to see her voice go away, or potentially go away. I think that she brought up something in the last week or so that was very important. What is the Republican plan for health care? So, I've engaged the President on this, and I'm putting forward my own plan. But in my plan, what it allows for is people to buy their insurance through a collective. Basically to buy their insurance through Costco or Sam's Club or Amazon. And mine is the only plan out there that would actually drive prices down. But that's what an independent voice will help in our country. Independent voice within the Republican caucus, not to see things always inside the box, but to think of some out of the box solutions. So, I think independent voices are important in the Republican Party.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, because of your position on Homeland Security, you may have some insight into the drug cartels. You are also on Senate Foreign Relations, and it is tomorrow that the Trump administration officially will designate the Cartel de los Soles as a foreign terrorist organization. That's the cartel the Trump administration says is linked to Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro. Secretary Hegseth, says it gives the administration new tools. Nothing's on or off the table, he says, militarily. Legally, what changes tomorrow? What becomes possible?",
      "SEN. RAND PAUL: I think by doing this, they're pretending as if we are at war. They're pretending as if they've gotten some imprimatur to do what they want. When you have war, the rules of engagement are lessened. So, for example, we normally don't shoot boats that we suspect of being drug dealers. In fact, if the Coast Guard tomorrow started shooting all vessels that are off of Miami or off of San Diego, about one in four of the vessels that they normally board doesn't have drugs. So it actually would be unlawful if the Coast Guard started blowing up boats. But for some reason they say, oh, we're at war off the coast of Venezuela. And so it's different rule of engagement. It's one of war. But you know, Senator Kaine and I brought this up, and we said, if it's war, let's- let's declare it as war. Let's have this discussion. Is it war or not? And the administration refused that. They want to have it both ways. They want to say, Oh, we can just say these people are terrorists, are narco-terrorists, so we can blow them up. But it's extraordinary that when some of them survive, they pluck them out of the water. They don't prosecute them for drugs. They don't collect drugs. They don't tell us if they were armed or not. They just send them back to their country, most of the time, not being Venezuela. They've sent one back to Colombia and one back to Ecuador, but nobody's making any pretense of even interviewing them to find out who's selling you the drugs. Maybe we could find out who the kingpins are if they're involved in the drug trade. Not a word. And I've been given zero, not one briefing, because I'm skeptical of what they're doing. They don't brief me or the general Senate at all. A few hand selected people may have gotten a briefing, but I have not been invited to any briefings on Venezuela.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that's fairly unusual, given your homeland security role, and that the premise for some of this action has to do with both immigration and drug policy, according to the President. I know the DEA administrator recently spoke to our Nicole Sganga and told her that they have seen between a 30% to 45% increase in cocaine prices per kilogram due to these DoD boat strikes and a shift towards land routes for delivery of those drugs. In other words, there's still demand for the drugs and the cartels are just finding different routes to deliver them. Have you seen any evidence that the President's actions to date are winning a drug war?",
      "SEN. PAUL: You know, I think we should be trying to work on the demand side, treating it as a health problem, as an addiction problem in our country, and trying to lessen the demand. And that is part of the overall solution, the war on drugs, though, to capture all the people selling drugs. The price goes up and more people are attracted to it. You know, a couple of the people that have been identified as being on these boats are simply down on their luck, people with no prospects who are offered $500 to get on a boat and race across the ocean, and so there always will be those people. There's probably a limitless number of those people in South America. There's been some benefit when we've cooperated with countries and with governments. But that's not what this is, and I fear that this is not going to do anything for the drug trade, but it is really going against the rule of law in the way in which we interact with people on the high seas, and it has no precedent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I've seen you quoted as saying there are people in the administration who have wanted to go to war in Venezuela for some time. Who are you talking about?",
      "SEN. PAUL: I think it's clear that Senator Rubio, as a senator, was very much an advocate of regime change. This was at odds, really, with President Trump, and so when he was picked, a lot of people who had been supportive of President Trump were- oh, my goodness, they're picking someone much more hawkish and much more eager to be involved and to intervene in other countries. And so people worried. And then the first year or so, people are like, oh, well, Rubio has done a good job on foreign aid, and they've cut back on all of the abuse of these NGOs around the world. And I think the people supporting the President have been very supportive of the Secretary of State. But I think once there's an invasion of Venezuela, or if they decide to re-up the subsidies and the gifts to Ukraine, I think you'll see a splintering and a fracturing of the movement that has supported the President, because I think a lot of people, including myself, were attracted to the president because of his reticence to get us involved in foreign war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, to date, they say nothing on or off the table, no specifics. We'll continue to track all the reporting on that. Senator Rand Paul, thank you for your time today. We'll be back in a moment.",

      "JASON CROW: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And it was that video that prompted some of this rhetoric from the President. I want to speak though about what's happening right now. I understand there was a bomb threat against your office in Aurora, Colorado, that your family has received painful death threats, even murder threats. Here is some of what your office released.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE STARTS]",

      "UNKNOWN CALLER 2: You ain't an American, f*****, you're a communist",
      "[SOUNDS ON TAPE ENDS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: These, I believe, are phone calls that were made to your office. Are any of these threats credible?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: We don't know, Margaret, we're going to take these seriously, but it's very disturbing stuff when you have the President of the United States threatening to execute and to hang and to arrest using this rhetoric, people listen to it. We've seen before a pattern of inciteful, dangerous rhetoric being used by the president and then people acting on that. You know, I lived through and experienced January 6, a very similar dynamic. He's been doing this for years, saying things and total disregard for the outcome, and what might happen when he throws this stuff out in the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the President has made these social media posts, but then he then sort of walked some of those threats back, saying he wasn't threatening death. He was saying sedition was often, in the past, punishable by death. And then, before you appeared here today, on social media he put out, \"the traitors that told the military to disobey my orders, should be in jail right now, not roaming the fake news networks. I guess that's us trying to explain what they said was okay. It wasn't and never will be. It was sedition at the highest level. It's a major crime. There can be no other interpretation of what they said.\" That's a quote from what he put on social media. Do you have any idea what all these threats actually mean? Because he mentioned in an interview military courts and referenced the DOJ as well.",
      "REP. CROW: No, we don't know what this means. He doesn't know what this means because he's irresponsible. He's acting dangerous. He's acting in an inciteful way. There's two things going on here Margaret. One is the irresponsible and dangerous rhetoric by the President of the United States threatening to have members of Congress executed who he disagrees with. But it's also so telling that when members of Congress simply remind service members of the Constitution and their duty to obey the law, which is not just our right, but is our obligation to do, that he cannot handle that, and he resorts to threats of violence and threats of arrest and execution. That tells you everything you need to know about Donald Trump's respect for the Constitution and the rule of law, and actually underscores our point.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let's get to the content of what you had in that video you released because there are also 15 House Republicans who are also veterans who released a video, including a retired three-star Marine Corps general, Jack Bergman. Take a listen to this.",
      "[ SOUND ON TAPE STARTS ]",

      "REP. AUGUST PFLUGER (R-TX): We study what's lawful and what's not lawful, and the Democrats' stunt insinuating that there are illegal or unconstitutional orders. It's downright dangerous.",
      "REP. SCOTT PERRY (R-PA) : It is corrosive. It is meant to weaken our country and weaken the military.",
      "[ SOUND ON TAPE ENDS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you respond to these allegations from your colleagues, fellow veterans, that what you have put out there is weakening and corrosive to the military?",
      "REP. CROW: Well, these, unfortunately, are some of Trump's core supporters that are rallying behind the president, and they know better. They know exactly the difference between lawful versus unlawful. We were very clear in the video that what we're talking about is unlawful\u00a0 orders. You have the president's spokesperson going on into a press conference this past week and saying that we called for people to disobey lawful orders. They're simply lying because the truth is unacceptable to them. It's unacceptable. We wanted to start a conversation, and we did, about the dangerous rhetoric this president is using and the threats that he's made to use our military in an unlawful way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Specifically, what?",
      "REP. CROW: Well, send troops into Chicago, send troops into polling stations, kill terrorist families, arrest and execute, arrest and execute members of Congress--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --he hasn't done those things.",
      "REP. CROW: Shoot peaceful protesters in Lafayette Square, need I go on? He has a history of doing this, and if we wait until the moment that he gives a manifestly unlawful order to a young soldier, then we have failed them. We have to start that conversation now and get people thinking about the distinction which is exactly what we did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, so those were comments, not orders he gave, and social media posts and like, but- but I hear you that- that words matter. But the standard for troops, as I understand it, is that they should consult with the staff judge advocate, the staff legal counsel regarding orders, if they have legal questions. There is a process in place. Are you telling the rank and file troops to go outside of that practice?",
      "REP. CROW: No, absolutely not. Let me use an example of how this plays out and what this looks like downrange, as we say in the military--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Yeah, because it sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on those people down the chain.",
      "REP. CROW: I did three combat deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. And before each of those combat deployments, I sat my soldiers down, my paratroopers and my Rangers, and we talked about the law of war. We lo- we talked about lawful versus unlawful orders, about the protection of civilians in conflict, right? Because you can't wait until a soldier is in the moment and has to make a split-second decision about what to do to train them, right? You have to talk about it. You have to train them before, which was why we put this video out, to get people thinking about their obligation. And all of the threats and all of the things the President have said would be manifestly unlawful and would be the types of orders that people shouldn't carry through because they would be murder if people actually did the things that Donald Trump threatened.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But we don't know yet that the deployment of troops on U.S. soil, if you were referring to the National Guard deployments in major U.S. cities, is actually unlawful. That's- that's tied up in the courts right now.",
      "REP. JASON CROW: Well, we're talking about the decision of troops on the ground, out in operations, right? Their interface with civilians, shooting civilians, going to polling stations, which is a violation of U.S. criminal law. Things that are ma--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- these things haven't happened, you are afraid they will.",
      "REP. JASON CROW: --things that are manifestly unlawful, that our troops might be put in the position to carry out, because that has what- that is what the president has repeatedly threatened to do. So again, it's very telling that simply restating their obligation to the Constitution and the law, which we do constantly with our service members gets this type of response from the president. You know, I am not going to be threatened and intimidated by the president of the United States. I have a job to do, and that is to ensure people follow the law. I took an oath to this country. It is a lifetime oath that I intend to carry out, and I am not going to be intimidated and threatened by the president and stop reminding people to follow the law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But I've talked to lawyers about this, and military lawyers about this, and there is some frustration that, you know, lawmakers haven't been in Washington doing their job in terms of oversight. There aren't hearings on Venezuela, there aren't hearings on those deployments of the National Guard, and yet there are public videos calling on troops at low ranks to make decisions unto themselves here about what is lawful or unlawful, or recall their training, or talk to their staff judge advocate about this. I mean this- why not first publicly call for a hearing before you call on them?",
      "REP. CROW: First of all, two separate issues. So on the hearing, absolutely right. We are pushing the Trump administration to actually give us briefings, give us hearings. Mike Johnson- Speaker Johnson, shut Congress down twice, twice, to avoid votes on releasing the Epstein files.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He would argue Democrats shut down Congress to- for the healthcare argument.--",
      "REP. CROW: It's very clear what they did. I still came to D.C. anyhow and pushed for oversight and pushed for briefings. So I've been in Congress for seven years almost, and I have never seen the lack of briefings and oversight and ability to access information. I have been completely shut out of the DOD and the CIA at this point as a member of the Intelligence Committee and the Armed Services Committee. So this administration--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Isn't so much of this because the Republican leadership in Congress that isn't demanding those things.",
      "REP. CROW: Exactly, right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So-",
      "REP. CROW: Congress has the power to do this, so they're right. We need to be doing this. Democrats are trying to do it. We are being stonewalled and blocked by the Republicans, blocked by the- by the administration, because they actually don't want us to do the oversight, because they're afraid of what we're going to learn. And that is different, Margaret, than what we're talking about, you know, operational decisions, decisions to go to to, you know, war in the Caribbean, Venezuela, which are strictly within the purview of Congress. And Congress needs to be making those decisions and debating it, versus--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The White House says, oh it's not an act of war. It's, you know, foreign policy. And the president has a lot of leeway under the Constitution. That's their argument.",
      "REP. CROW: Well, we've been hearing this for 25 years, which is why Iraq and Afghanistan went on for as long as it did. We spent $3 trillion, lost 7000 service members' lives, and those ended poorly. Congress has to make that decision. Congress needs to be accountable for it, and Congress needs to be debating this before the American people, going to the American people and telling them why they should send their sons and daughters into conflict and they should spend hundreds of billions of dollars of their hard earned money. This president doesn't want that process to happen. And as somebody that did three combat tours in these wars, I've had enough of Congress being cut out of it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you'll see in some of our upcoming polling data that the American public would like more information about the plans for Venezuela, which you were referencing there. Congressman Crow, thank you.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Democratic Senator Mark Kelly, who joins us from Tucson, Arizona. Welcome back to Face The Nation, senator.",
      "SEN. KELLY: Thank you for having me on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to pick up where we left off on this topic of political violence. I know your family has suffered because of it, very, very directly. And then this past week, the president called that video. You participated in, \"sedition.\" You heard me read what he said again this morning, \"sedition at the highest level and a major crime.\" Have you- do you have credible threats? How concerned are you about your security at this point?",
      "SEN. KELLY: Well, Margaret, what the President said is very serious. I didn't think he would step over the, over that line calling for the execution of members of Congress, and his words carry tremendous weight, more so than anybody else in the country, and he should be aware of that. And because of what he says, there is now an increased threats against us. I'm not going to get into details on my personal security, but as the husband of Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, we- I understand what political violence is. The president should as well. Just like Gabby, somebody tried to assassinate him, and he should understand that his words, have you know, could have serious, serious consequences.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I remember just weeks ago, hearing from the president and other Republicans about the need to dial back the rhetoric after the tragic shooting of Charlie Kirk. When it comes to your\u2013",
      "SEN. KELLY: Yeah, what happened to that? I mean, that was two months ago. Where are they now? We've heard very little, basically crickets, from Republicans in the United States Congress about what the President has said about hanging members of Congress.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's what I wanted to ask you. Why aren't we hearing from your Republican colleagues and in terms of your security, I understand there was a request for you to get a boost in Capitol Hill security support. Are Republican members on board with that?",
      "SEN. KELLY: I don't know. I've heard them say, you know very little about this. I think you know the President tries to intimidate them. He tries to intimidate Congress. He looks at government accountability as a nuisance. And I think it's really important for people to understand, Margaret, that the message he sent a couple days ago was, he declared that loyalty to the Constitution is now punishable by death. Those are serious words coming from the President of the United States. He's trying to intimidate us, but Margaret, I'm not going to be intimidated. You know, you just heard Jason Crow. He's not going to be intimidated either. We both served our country. We swore an oath. All we said is we reiterated what basically is the rule of law that members of the military should not, cannot follow illegal orders.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, on that point, in terms of lawful and unlawful orders, it gets complicated for rank-and-file to understand. I understand and other networks have reported that the senior judge advocate down at SOUTHCOM raised serious doubts about the legality of the strikes on those alleged drug votes, but was contradicted by lawyers at the executive branch. Have you spoken to the SOUTHCOM commander? Do you- are you hearing that there are unlawful orders being given?",
      "SEN. KELLY: Well, we're hearing the same thing that you are. The administration hasn't shared much information with us. I read the legal analysis. It was just like the briefs. They're tying themselves in knots trying to explain why what they're doing with regards to these drug boats is legal and it's, it's questionable at best. Our- one of our biggest allies, the United Kingdom, recently stopped sharing intelligence with us in the Caribbean because they question whether this is legal or not. We've been asking for more briefings from the right people. We have not received them, but the information that you just shared with me is the, is the public information. I don't have much more beyond that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and the French government has said it's a violation of international law and the law of the sea. That's what our allies are saying about those strikes that are happening there. But, is that why\u2013",
      "SEN. KELLY: But, Margaret getting back to\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013you made this video?",
      "SEN. KELLY: No. The reason why we made this video is a couple things. This president, from before he was in office as he was a candidate, to the time he was in office in his first administration, has said things that cause us great concern. There is a trend here. When he was running for president, the first time he talked about he wanted the military, he said he would, he would- the military should be killing the families of terrorists. And when he was told that that was illegal, this was on a debate stage, he basically said that the military will not refuse to follow my orders, that they will carry out his orders regardless of what they were. Shooting protesters in the legs is something he brought up in his first administration and thankfully, Mark Esper, his Secretary of Defense, and Mark Milley, you know, basically told him, you cannot do that. If they weren't there, think of what possibly could have happened. So, we're concerned\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I need- yeah, I'm sorry. I just want to make sure I get to you on Ukraine, because there's so much happening, and I know you're such a big supporter of Ukraine. There are three prominent U.S. senators who have gone on the record now, including Republican Mike Rounds, who said yesterday, Secretary of State Rubio told them he was unaware of a threat to cut off U.S. support to Ukraine if they don't accept this proposed plan that's on the table. Here is how Senator Rounds described it.",
      "SEN. MIKE ROUNDS SOT: What he told us was that this was not the American proposal. This was a proposal which was received by someone who has identified and they believe to be representing Russia in this proposal. It was given to Mr. Witkoff.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So since those remarks were made and backed up by multiple senators, I've received phone calls from Senior White House officials from, from senior U.S. officials saying, no, no, no, that's not at all what, what Secretary Rubio said. What version of events do we believe here in terms of what America is putting forward?",
      "SEN. KELLY: Margaret, they've got to clear this up. You have Rubio talking to my Senate colleague, saying one thing. The spokesperson for the State Department saying another. Your conversations with the White House contradict what the Secretary of State and, by the way, the National Security Adviser, same guy, has said about this. They've got, they've got to figure this out and get the message out and explain to the American people what's going on. I will say this, that, that, that plan, that's Putin's plan. That is a very good deal for Russia. It is a horrible deal for Ukraine, for our allies and even for our own national security. If Putin gets the chance with that deal to, you know, rearm, rebuild his economy and gain territory, by the way, that's what he wanted. Then the Baltics, Poland, Romania, all those other countries down the line are at threat.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the U.S. keeps emphasizing it is a working document, so it may be in a different state than what was leaked by an anti-Zelensky politician, but Ukraine's Ambassador did tell us there's a separate security guarantee document. What, what needs to be in there that would actually protect Ukraine? Does that need to go for a vote before the U.S. Congress?",
      "SEN. KELLY: Well, it depends on what it is, but Congress should be involved. If there is a treaty with Ukraine on their own security, it's something that we would want to have some say in. And ultimately we would vote on in the United States Senate we would send to the president, but they need to be talking to us about this, on both sides of the aisle. Often the path they're going on recently is to just share information with the Republicans and even my Republican colleagues don't seem to like that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No.",
      "SEN. KELLY: But, that's what this White House is, is doing, and it's because they don't want congressional oversight in, in any way, whether it's on Ukraine, Venezuela, or any, any issue.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, we got to leave it there, senator, but to your point, a number of very fiery statements from Republican senators in the past few hours. We'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.",

    "story": [
      "Fifty of the 303 schoolchildren abducted from a Catholic school in north-central Nigeria's Niger state have escaped captivity and are now with their families, the school authority said Sunday, bringing relief to some distraught families after one of the largest school abductions in Nigeria's history.",
      "The schoolchildren, aged between 10 and 18, escaped individually between Friday and Saturday, according to the Most Rev. Bulus Dauwa Yohanna, chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria in Niger state and the proprietor of the school. A total of 253 schoolchildren and 12 teachers are still held by the kidnappers, he said in a statement.",
      "\"We were able to ascertain this when we decided to contact and visit some parents,\" Yohanna said.",
      "The pupils and students were seized together with their teachers by gunmen who attacked the St. Mary's School, a Catholic institution in Niger state's remote Papiri community, on Friday. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the abductions and authorities have said tactical squads have been deployed alongside local hunters to rescue the children.",
      "It was not immediately clear where the Niger state children were being held or how they managed to return home. Nigeria's military and police did not immediately respond to an Associated Press inquiry.",
      "\"As much as we receive the return of these 50 children that escaped with some sigh of relief, I urge you all to continue in your prayers for the rescue and safe return of the remaining victims,\" Yohanna said.",
      "Pope Leo XIV called for the immediate release of the schoolchildren and staff of the school, saying at the end of a mass in St. Peter's Square on Sunday that he was \"deeply saddened\" by the incident.",
      "\"I feel great sorrow, especially for the many girls and boys who have been abducted and for their anguished families,\" the pontiff said. \"I make a heartfelt appeal for the immediate release of the hostages and urge the competent authorities to take appropriate and timely decisions to ensure their release.\"",
      "All schools in Niger state were ordered to close on Saturday in response to the kidnappings,\u00a0reported BBC, a CBS partner. Dominic Adamu, whose daughters are students at St. Mary's School but were not abducted, told the outlet that the attack \"took everybody by surprise.\"",
      "\"Everybody is weak,\" Adamu said, according to the BBC.",
      "Another woman, who was not identified by name, told the outlet that her 6- and 13-year-old nieces had been kidnapped from the school, adding: \"I just want them to go home.\"",
      "The Niger state attack happened four days after 25 schoolchildren were seized in similar circumstances in neighboring Kebbi state's Maga town, which is 106 miles away.",
      "Both states are in a northern region of Nigeria where dozens of armed gangs have used kidnapping for ransom as one way of dominating remote communities with little government and security presence.",
      "Satellite image shows that the Niger state school compound is attached to an adjoining primary school, with more than 50 classrooms and dormitory buildings. It's located near a major road linking the towns of Yelwa and Mokwa.",
      "School kidnappings have come to define insecurity in Africa's most populous nation, and armed gangs often see schools as \"strategic\" targets to draw more attention.",
      "Niger state hurriedly closed down all schools after Friday's attack, while some federal colleges in conflict hotspots across the region were also closed by the Nigerian government.",
      "\"I will not relent\"",
      "The kidnappings are happening against the backdrop of President Trump's claims of \"Christian persecution\" in the West African country. Attacks in Nigeria affect both Christians and Muslims. The school attack earlier this week in Kebbi state was in a Muslim-majority town.",
      "Arrests are rare and ransom payments are common in many of the hot spots in northern Nigeria.",
      "Confidence McHarry, a security analyst at Lagos-based consultancy SBM Intelligence, said that while there's little evidence that Trump's comments might have inspired the gunmen to launch more attacks in the hope that more attention would bring higher ransoms, \"the absence of consequences is what is fuelling these attacks.\"",
      "In a statement welcoming the freedom of some of those kidnapped in Niger state and Kebbi state, Nigerian President Bola Tinubu said his government will not relent until every hostage is freed.",
      "\"Let me be clear: I will not relent. Every Nigerian, in every state, has the right to safety \u2014 and under my watch, we will secure this nation and protect our people,\" he added.",

      "It's a popularity that amazes chef Judy Joo: \"I grew up in Jersey, and I was embarrassed by my lunchbox. It's incredible that these flavors that I grew up with, that I was once embarrassed about, are now going mainstream.",
      "\"It still is an education, but people's first foot into learning about a culture is usually through the food,\" said Joo. \"It's their stomach that drives them. They end up in a Korean restaurant, and they usually go for a food that seems familiar, like fried chicken.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump said the peace plan is not his last offer as Ukrainian and U.S. officials are set to meet in Geneva for negotiations.",
    "story": [
      "The 28-point peace plan proposed by the U.S. for Ukraine is a basis that \"requires additional work,\" Western leaders gathered at the G20 summit in South Africa said.",
      "Group of Seven nations and European leaders met on the sidelines of the summit in Johannesburg\u00a0to discuss the U.S. peace plan for the war in Ukraine, now in its fourth year. The Trump administration boycotted the summit.",
      "\"The initial draft of the 28-point plan includes important elements that will be essential for a just and lasting peace,\" the leaders of the European Union, Germany, France, Britain, Canada, the Netherlands, Spain, Finland, Italy, Japan and Norway said in a joint statement. \"We believe, therefore, that the draft is a basis which will require additional work.\"",
      "The 28-point plan, sent to Kyiv and Moscow this week, includes a framework that would require Ukraine to give up its eastern Donbas region and Crimea, and swear off NATO membership, according to a draft shared publicly by a Ukrainian opposition politician and confirmed by a White House official.",
      "It contains many of Moscow's long-standing demands, while offering limited security guarantees to Kyiv.",
      "The plan sparked alarm in Kyiv and other European capitals, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy saying Friday\u00a0that his country could face a stark choice between standing up for its sovereign rights and preserving the American support it needs.",
      "German Chancellor Friedrich Merz told reporters at the summit that \"wars cannot be ended by major powers over the heads of the countries affected,\" and insisted Kyiv needed robust guarantees.",
      "President Trump said he wants an answer from Zelenskyy on the plan by Thursday, which is Thanksgiving in the U.S., but says an extension is possible to finalize terms.",
      "On Saturday, Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House that the U.S peace plan is not his final offer for Ukraine.",
      "\"We'd like to get the peace... It should have happened a long time ago. The Ukraine war with Russia should have never happened,\" he said. \"If I were president, it never would have happened. We're trying to get it ended one way or the other. We have to get it ended.\"",
      "Three U.S. senators, however, told reporters Saturday that U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio informed them in a call that the plan was not of U.S. origin.",
      "Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Republican Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota, who were speaking at an international security conference in Canada, told reporters that they were on a phone call with Rubio in which they alleged that Rubio told them the peace plan did not come from the U.S.",
      "Independent Maine Sen. Angus King, who was also attending the conference, said Rubio told the senators the proposal \"was not the administration's plan\" but a \"wish list of the Russians.\"",
      "\"I think he made it very clear to us that we are the recipients of a proposal that was delivered to one of our representatives,\" Rounds said. \"It is not our recommendation, it is not our peace plan.\"",
      "Rubio on Saturday night rejected those claims,\u00a0writing\u00a0in a social media post that, \"the peace proposal was authored by the U.S. It is offered as a strong framework for ongoing negotiations It is based on input from the Russian side. But it is also based on previous and ongoing input from Ukraine.\"",
      "Ukrainian envoys will meet a U.S. delegation in Switzerland to discuss the proposal, a top official said Saturday, but European leaders warned against rushing a peace deal.",
      "In their statement on Saturday, Western leaders said they are \"clear on the principle that borders must not be changed by force.\"",
      "\"We are also concerned by the proposed limitations on Ukraine's armed forces, which would leave Ukraine vulnerable to future attack,\" the statement said.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters on Friday that \"we have a plan\" to address the war, but Zelenskyy still needs to approve it. The president said of the Ukrainian leader: \"At some point, he's going to have to accept something.\"",
      "\"He'll have to like it, and if he doesn't like it, then they should just keep fighting, I guess,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin acknowledged on Friday that Russia had received the text of the 28-point plan \"through existing channels of communication with the U.S. administration.\"",
      "\"I believe it could too form the basis for a final peace settlement,\" he said. \"But this text is not being discussed with us in any substantive way. And I can assume why. I believe the reason is the same: the U.S. administration has so far been unable to secure the consent of the Ukrainian side. Ukraine is against it.\"",
      "Zelenskyy struck a defiant note on Saturday as the country commemorated the \"great famine\" that Soviet leader Josef Stalin imposed on Ukraine in the early 1930s, which led to millions of deaths.",
      "\"We all know how and why millions of our people died, starved to death, and millions were never born. And we are once again defending ourselves against Russia, which has not changed and is once again bringing death,\" Zelenskyy said in a post on Telegram marking Holodomor Memorial Day.",
      "\"We defended, defend, and will always defend Ukraine. Because only here is our home. And in our home, Russia will definitely not be the master,\" Zelenskyy added.",
      "A Ukrainian delegation will soon head to Switzerland to discuss the proposal with U.S. representatives, according to Rustem Umerov, a former defense minister who led Ukrainian negotiators in past failed talks with Russia.",
      "\"These days in Switzerland, we are starting consultations between high-ranking officials of Ukraine and the USA regarding possible parameters of a future peace agreement. Ukraine approaches this process with a clear understanding of its interests,\" Umerov wrote Saturday on Telegram.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 16:54:00 -0500",
    "summary": "A web of undersea cables connects our lives and our global economy. As U.S. adversaries are accused of sabotage, they're proving to be targets of choice.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0Over 95% percent of the world's internet traffic and voice and communication data flows through a vast network of fiber optic cables laid across the floors of oceans and seas. The cables are faster, more reliable and cheaper data carriers than alternatives such as satellites, and they have become indispensable to modern life.",
      "They are the veins and arteries that link our deeply interconnected world, transmitting data for everything from sensitive government and military information and text messages between friends, to trillions of dollars worth of financial transactions every day, underpinning the global economy.",
      "But our reliance on these undersea cables is a vulnerability, and one that rogue actors have allegedly already tried to exploit, including some adversaries of the United States.",
      "Russia has been accused recently by America's NATO allies of increasing \"hybrid warfare\" against Europe, and analysts say it has shown a clear interest in targeting things like undersea infrastructure.",
      "\"That's quite explicitly a part of Russian thinking regarding modern warfare,\" said Sidharth Kaushal, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a British military think tank, in an interview with CBS News earlier this year.",
      "He said that sabotaging \"critical nodes on which society functions\u2026 [has been] illustrated in real time in the last few years.\"",
      "Since President Vladimir Putin ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russia has regularly conducted military strikes against Ukrainian energy and transport facilities. But beyond the battlefield, Russia has also been accused of targeting the infrastructure \u2014 including undersea cables \u2014 that's vital to other countries, including many of the United States' NATO allies.",
      "\"The sabotage events, they are a new phenomenon,\" Gabrielius Landsbergis, the former foreign minister of Lithuania, told CBS News. \"They are directly associated with this later stage of Russia's militarization and aggressive action \u2014 not just against Ukraine, but also against the West.\"",
      "Russia has denied allegations of interfering with undersea cables and called accusations it has carried out acts of sabotage in Europe \"Russophobia.\"",
      "What is happening in the Baltic Sea?",
      "The Baltic Sea is a nearly enclosed body of water surrounded by eight NATO countries and Russia.",
      "Relatively few undersea cables connect some of the Baltic NATO members, such as Lithuania, to the rest of Europe and the wider world.",
      "\"Baltic states are, you know, not entirely an island, but pretty much so,\" Landsbergis told CBS News. \"That means that for us [Baltic states] to connect to the Western infrastructure, it's a rather difficult task. So most of our connections, a big part of our connections, go through the Baltic Sea.\"",
      "The Baltic Sea is relatively shallow, meaning ships only need to drag their anchors along the bottom to cause potentially serious damage to cables. That increases the possibility of accidental damage, but also lends plausible deniability to malign actors who would like to carry out sabotage operations there.",
      "And Russia's \"shadow fleet\" of vessels, with hazy registration and insurance documentation that allows it to continue transporting oil and other energy products around the world despite Western sanctions imposed over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, has increased its plausible deniability.",
      "When Finland and Sweden joined NATO, many in the West hoped the Baltic Sea would effectively become a \"NATO lake.\" Over the last few years, there have been several incidents of alleged Russian sabotage of underwater cables in the sea.",
      "\"It is clearly a spike,\" Landsbergis told CBS News. \"We have never seen almost any incidents during the last, I don't know, 20 years, and suddenly after [Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine] started, they're basically recurring every month.\"",
      "Targeting the \"anthropogenic shell of modern society\"",
      "RUSI's Kaushal said the apparent sabotage operations in the Baltic are an example of the hybrid warfare tactics being increasingly adopted by U.S. adversaries.",
      "\"Ever since the 90's and early 2000's, the Russians have talked about how the so-called anthropogenic shell of modern society \u2014 basically the fragile infrastructure on which it depends \u2014 is its Achilles heel,\" he told CBS News earlier this year. \"Attacks on undersea cables are one major part of that, along with missile attacks (like on infrastructure in Ukraine) and cyberattacks.\"",
      "Landsbergis told CBS News that he believes Russia's objective in disrupting undersea cables is to intimidate local populations, as well as to \"test the reactions \u2014 you know, how do politicians react? How do militaries react? Whether there is a response or not.\"",
      "With the Trump administration pushing hard for its European NATO allies to rely less on the U.S. for their security, \"it's not the question about how we see NATO, but it's the question how Putin sees NATO,\" Landsbergis told CBS News.",
      "He said without a firm, unified response to the sabotage, Putin could determine \"NATO is not the alliance that it has been before Trump,\" and that could lead the Russian autocrat to \"say, OK, maybe this is the time that I intend to test it.\"",
      "What is NATO doing about it?",
      "At the start of this year, NATO launched \"Baltic Sentry,\" a new operation \"to strengthen the protection of critical infrastructure.\"",
      "\"By working together with all Allies, we will do what it takes to ensure the safety and security not only of our critical infrastructure but of all that we hold dear,\" NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said in a statement announcing Baltic Sentry in January.",
      "The operation involves maritime patrols, aircraft and naval drones, as well as national surveillance assets, according to NATO. The Alliance said it would also work with industry to improve the resilience of undersea cables.",
      "Sweden, another country that shares a Baltic coastline with Russia, broke with its centuries-old policy of military non-alignment and became NATO's newest member last year, in direct response to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.",
      "It staged military exercises earlier this month to practice countering covert espionage and sabotage missions carried out by adversaries in the Baltic Sea.",
      "\"We're not at peace, but not at war,\" Swedish submarine flotilla Commander Paula Wallenburg told CBS News during the exercise.",
      "Wallenburg said the current circumstances look \"pretty close to\" those seen during the Cold War, when the nuclear-armed U.S. and then-Soviet Union tested each other's resolve in a face off that never quite turned into a full-scale military conflict.",
      "\"It's a very serious situation when it comes to security here in this area,\" she said.",
      "Below is a look at some recent incidents in the Baltic Sea in which Russia-linked vessels have been alleged to have been involved in damaging, or seen loitering around, undersea cables.",
      "Case study: Eagle S",
      "On Christmas Day 2024, an electricity cable and four telecommunications cables linking Finland and Estonia suffered unplanned outages, reducing the two countries' interconnectivity. Finland's National Bureau of Investigation later discovered a 60-mile drag mark near the Estlink 2 cable.",
      "The Eagle S, a crude oil tanker sailing under the flag of the Cook Islands and officially registered to a UAE company, left Russia's Baltic port of Ust-Luga on the morning of the outages, with its destination listed as Turkey, according to ship tracking data from MarineTraffic.",
      "The ship sailed over one of the Estlink submarine cables in the Gulf of Finland around the time a power failure was reported by the country's electric grid operators.",
      "The ship's anchor was later discovered near the point where the drag mark ended.",
      "Finnish border guards detained the ship and its crew, led by a Georgian national.",
      "The Eagle S was released to international waters in March, but Finland pursued criminal charges against the crew. The case was dismissed in October, when the court ruled prosecutors had failed to prove intent, but prosecutors said they would appeal.",
      "Case study: Two Russian trawlers tracked in area when Svalbard cable cut",
      "In February 2022, Norwegian police told local media they believed \"human impact\" was to blame for damage to one of a pair of undersea telecommunications cables connecting the country's mainland with its northern archipelago of Svalbard a month earlier.",
      "Space Norway, which operates the Svalbard Undersea Cable System, told CBS News the two cables \u2014 which were laid as a redundant pair in the event one suffered damage \u2014 are the world's northernmost subsea cable systems.",
      "Space Norway said it detected an outage in the Greenland Sea on Jan, 7.",
      "The damage occurred in an area where the cables descend steeply from a depth of 980 feet to nearly 9,000 feet, the operator told CBS News.",
      "Generally, the cables are buried approximately six feet deep, although there may be variations due to the nature of the seabed, the state-owned company explained, while declining to go into detail about the seabed conditions where the damaged cables were buried.",
      "There was never a loss of service for users in Svalbard, a Space Norway spokesperson said, and the investigation into the cut was eventually closed due to a lack of evidence.",
      "But a report from Norway's public broadcaster NRK and open-source information showed Russian fishing trawlers made more than a dozen passes over the area before the damage occurred.",
      "Other evidence of \"hybrid warfare\"",
      "This week, Poland's top diplomat accused Russia of carrying out an \"act of state terror\" by blowing up a railway line over the weekend.",
      "\"It was an act of not only subversion, as happened before, but an act of state terror as its clear intention was to cause human casualties,\" Polish foreign minister Radek Sikorski said.",
      "Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk said two Ukrainian citizens believed to have been working with Russia's secret services were suspected of carrying out the attack, which he called an \"unprecedented act of sabotage.\"",
      "The explosion took place on a rail line linking the Polish capital, Warsaw, to Ukraine, and Polish officials said it was used to transport aid to Ukraine.",
      "Russia dismissed allegations that it was involved in the explosion, calling them \"Russophobia.\"",
      "\"The latest sabotage in Poland that could have become a mass casualty event brings even more heightened dimension to the debate,\" Landsbergis told CBS News on Thursday.",
      "\"Imagine if there would be 100 casualties \u2014 would we be still talking about hybrid? Or we would drop the hybrid and just call it war and ask for Article 5?\" Landsbergis said, referring to the mutual-defense agreement among NATO members. \"The question points to a fact that Russians are pushing the escalation lines even further, forcing us to ask ourselves: Aren't we at war already?\"",
      "The incident came amid a spate of airspace violations, including some near airports and military bases, in Western European nations, usually involving unidentified drones, but also, in at least two instances, Russian warplanes.",

      "Sweeney's American Eagle ad campaign boosted the jeans company's shares by 10%, according to data from Brokerchooser. The controversial ad campaign, titled \"Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans,\" added roughly $400 million in market value and amplified the brand's web traffic by 100%.",

      "\"In this case, controversy led to coverage, which created sustained attention and interest, all of which produced increased investment. The uptick in the AE stock price speaks for itself,\" Eldridge explained. \"A 10% increase \u2014 which was almost entirely attributable to one, standalone, campaign \u2013 is incredible. They\u2019ve always made the same jeans, they just didn\u2019t have the same \u2018go to market\u2019 approach when it came to brand messaging.\"",

      "\"She didn\u2019t grovel or backpedal; there was no performative mea culpa from the starlet. She shut down criticism, not with witty banter or overly defensive conjecture; she simply smiled and said nothing,\" the branding expert said. \"Her near silence was worth a thousand words and tens of millions of dollars. That type of stoic sincerity is hard to find, given the scourge of cancel culture, pressure campaigns, and the endless lists of -ists and -isms that are often attached to those who tack against the tide of the \u2018mainstream morality police.'

      "\"It remains to be seen whether a brand that is typically associated with young people will see these customers remain,\" Quast added. \"American Eagle isn\u2019t helped in the long-term when conservative culture warriors, including the President, go out of their way to publicly praise the campaign, thereby taking a stand in the controversy that is unlikely to resonate with a majority of the company\u2019s customer base.\"",

    "summary": "How China gained control of 90% of rare-earth refining while the U.S. abandoned Mountain Pass mine, creating dangerous dependence on a strategic rival.",
    "story": [
      "Two experts trace the collapse of America\u2019s rare-earth industry from the 1990s to today \u2014 and why the race to rebuild it has become a fight for national security.",
      "At the edge of California\u2019s Mojave Desert, the Mountain Pass mine looks like any other stretch of dust and rock. But for decades, this lonely pit supplied the world with the rare-earth elements that make modern technology \u2014 and modern warfare \u2014 possible.",
      "In the 1980s, Mountain Pass was the beating heart of a quiet American advantage. The ore pulled from its depths yielded neodymium, lanthanum and cerium \u2014 metals that powered radar systems, early computer chips and the guidance of precision munitions. At its peak, the mine met nearly two-thirds of global demand.",
      "Then, almost overnight, it went silent.",
      "As environmental rules tightened and global prices collapsed under China\u2019s state-subsidized production, the U.S. abandoned what had once been its mineral lifeline. Trucks stopped rolling. Processing plants rusted in the desert sun. And the world\u2019s most powerful economy became dependent on a rival for the elements essential to its defense.",
      "CHINA'S RARE EARTH TECH OBSESSION ENSNARES US RESIDENT AS CCP LOOKS TO MAINTAIN STRANGLEHOLD",
      "At the edge of California\u2019s Mojave Desert, the Mountain Pass mine looks like any other stretch of dust and rock. But for decades, this lonely pit supplied the world with the rare-earth elements that make modern technology \u2014 and modern warfare \u2014 possible. (Steve Marcus/Reuters)",
      "\"The Middle East has oil; China has rare earths,\" former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping declared in 1987. Just as Arab nations turned oil wealth into global power, Beijing recognized the leverage it could gain by dominating the materials modern industry would only grow more dependent on.",
      "Four decades later, that foresight has paid off. China now controls roughly 70 percent of global rare-earth mining and nearly 90 percent of refining \u2014 the most strategic and profitable step in the chain.",
      "The U.S. didn\u2019t just lose ground in mining \u2014 it handed Beijing the technology that made rare earths valuable in the first place.",
      "In the early 1990s, a General Motors subsidiary called Magnaquench was producing 85 percent of the magnets used in precision-guided missiles and other defense systems. When GM sold the company in 1995 to a consortium that included two Chinese entities, the consequences were immediate. Within a year, the entire product line had been replicated in China, and the U.S. had lost its magnet-making process almost overnight.",
      "Abigail Hunter, executive director of the Ambassador Alfred Hoffman Jr. Center for Critical Mineral Strategy at SAFE, said the sale represented more than a bad deal \u2014 it was a strategic surrender. \"We were focused on the internet and globalization, not on where our materials were coming from,\" she said. \"Policy became episodic rather than strategic.\"",
      "While Washington debated environmental rules and trade policy, China moved aggressively. \"The United States had Mountain Pass and a few other capabilities tied to companies like GM,\" said Wade Senti, president of Advanced Magnet Lab. \"But our total capacity was under 2,000 metric tons a year. Meanwhile, China poured money into innovation, refining and manufacturing at a scale that far exceeded what we ever had.\"",
      "By the early 2000s, the U.S. mining and refining base had collapsed. The technology migrated east along with the supply chain. Beijing not only mined the minerals but mastered the high-value steps that turned them into finished magnets \u2014 the core of everything from fighter jets to electric vehicles.",
      "The ore pulled from its depths, pictured above, yielded neodymium, lanthanum and cerium \u2014 metals that powered radar systems, early computer chips and the guidance of precision munitions.\u00a0 (Steve Marcus/Reuters)",
      "\"Between market forces and environmental restrictions \u2026 it's certainly led to a constraint with extracting resources,\" Senti said.",
      "Rare-earth elements now underpin nearly every modern weapons system. \"They steer missiles, power radar and drive the night-vision goggles Marines wear in the field,\" Hunter said. \"If it moves, sees or communicates in today\u2019s military, there\u2019s probably a rare-earth element in it.\"",
      "Washington\u2019s complacency cracked this spring when Beijing briefly restricted exports of rare-earth products \u2014 a warning shot that rippled through supply chains from Detroit to the Pentagon.",
      "\"When China required export licenses, some U.S. factory lines literally stopped,\" Hunter said. \"The administration scrambled to negotiate with Beijing and simultaneously rolled out emergency support for MP Materials, the operator of Mountain Pass.\"",
      "That deal marked a turning point: for the first time, the federal government backed an entire supply chain \u2014 from mine to magnet \u2014 using every tool at its disposal. Grants, loans, price supports and guaranteed purchases were deployed to jump-start domestic production.",
      "CHINA'S TRADE WAR WEAPONS: RARE EARTH BAN AND US DEBT DUMP COULD CRIPPLE AMERICAN ECONOMY AND DEFENSE",
      "MP Materials, which resumed mining at Mountain Pass in 2018 and ramped up refining to record levels before the Pentagon deal, is now expanding its magnet manufacturing facility in Texas. Another U.S. manufacturer in South Carolina has also begun producing magnets. But rebuilding the ecosystem will take time. \"It\u2019s a ten-year project, not something we can do in a year,\" Hunter said. \"We\u2019re starting to see progress, but we\u2019re nowhere near self-sufficiency.\"",
      "The Trump administration has put the U.S. on a wartime footing for decoupling with China, taking a 15 percent stake in MP Materials in an unprecedented arrangement and pushing a wave of international critical-minerals agreements meant to cut Beijing out of key supply chains.",
      "Over the past year, Washington has signed multi-billion dollar partnerships across five continents \u2014 including a $10 billion package of new projects announced this fall. A landmark framework with Australia commits both nations to co-invest roughly $1 billion each in rare-earth and battery-metal ventures, while parallel agreements with Japan and South Korea focus on securing non-Chinese refining and magnet production.",
      "China now controls roughly 70 percent of global rare-earth mining and nearly 90 percent of refining \u2014 the most strategic and profitable step in the chain. (Stringer/Reuters)",
      "The administration has also turned to Africa, signing deals with Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to trace and develop mineral supply routes, and to Ukraine, where a 2025 reconstruction fund gives U.S. companies preferred access to future mining projects. Together, the web of pacts marks the most aggressive U.S. mineral diplomacy since the Cold War \u2014 a global race to control the elements that power modern weapons, vehicles and technology.",
      "Yet even as the U.S. forges alliances abroad, officials warn that true security will hinge on what happens at home. Under a 2027 mandate, the Pentagon must build a fully domestic rare-earth supply chain for defense production \u2014 from mine to magnet \u2014 that avoids Chinese inputs entirely. Meeting that goal will require more than foreign partnerships: it means breaking through America\u2019s own permitting gridlock, financing new refineries and rebuilding a skilled workforce that vanished when the industry collapsed two decades ago.",
      "\"The international deals may buy time,\" Senti said, \"but they\u2019re no substitute for restoring the industrial base that once made us the world\u2019s undisputed source of strategic minerals.\"",
      "Both Hunter and Senti see the next few years as decisive. The same materials that once powered America\u2019s Cold War innovation now underpin China\u2019s economic and military strength.",
      "\"We have to reform permitting so we can actually build mines and refineries here,\" Hunter said. \"We can\u2019t keep pretending it\u2019s someone else\u2019s problem while importing everything.\"",

      "For Senti, the mission is more direct. \"There\u2019s a lot of work to do,\" he said. \"Companies like ours are boots on the ground trying to unlock the bottlenecks.\"",
      "In the Mojave Desert, the trucks at Mountain Pass are running again \u2014 small symbols of a nation trying to reclaim what it lost. But as China continues to tighten its grip on the minerals that drive the modern world, America\u2019s comeback in the resource race is only just beginning."

Phase 1 focuses on redeveloping up to 200,000 square feet of hangars and locking in control of the FBO, while Phase 2 layers in AI air traffic and ground management, smart sensor-embedded runways and a more digital, streamlined passenger experience.",
      "United Airlines CFO Michael Leskinen praised the move and said,\u00a0\"Archer's trajectory validates our conviction that eVTOLs are part of the next generation of air traffic technology that will fundamentally reshape aviation. Their vision for an AI-enabled operations platform isn't just about eVTOLs, it's also about leveraging cutting-edge technology to better enable moving people safely and efficiently in our most congested airspaces. Through United's investment arm, United Airlines Ventures, we're investing in companies like Archer that pioneer technologies that will define and support aviation infrastructure for decades to come.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Hawthorne Mayor Alex Vargas celebrated the deal on social media, writing\u00a0\"WELCOME ARCHER TO THE CITY OF HAWTHORNE!\"",
      "Archer plans to turn Hawthorne Airport into the main hub for its LA air taxi network. (Archer Aviation)",
      "Neighbors outraged over \u2018AI air taxi\u2019 takeover",
      "Not everyone is cheering Archer's plan to turn Hawthorne into a flagship hub for AI-guided flying taxis. A local group called Hawthorne Quiet Skies, made up of residents living around the airport, says it was blindsided by the $126 million takeover and that no one from the company or city bothered to engage it before announcing a \"test bed for AI-powered aviation technologies\" over homes.",
      "Neighbors who live just across the street and within a couple of blocks of the runway describe Hawthorne as one of the most tightly packed airports in the country, with homes on three sides and years of complaints about deafening jet and helicopter noise. The city's own 2021 noise study identified more than 160 homes and roughly 480 people already exposed to unhealthy noise levels, yet residents say there has been \"zero progress\" on mitigation even as the airport shifted from small private planes to commercial traffic and now an around-the-clock eVTOL hub.",
      "The group is also raising alarms about Archer's AI ambitions, pointing to academic research that current machine-learning systems in aviation still struggle to handle unusual conditions and lack formal safety guarantees.",
      "They argue that whatever the promises of cleaner, futuristic air taxis, Hawthorne is being used as a live test site without clear safeguards, updated federal noise rules or any serious plan to compensate families if nonstop eVTOL traffic makes their homes too loud to live in.",
      "CHINA\u2019S FIRST MASS-PRODUCED FLYING CAR DEBUTS",
      "How Archer Aviation is funding growth and expanding its air taxi program",
      "Alongside the airport news, Archer reported major financial momentum. The company raised an additional $650 million in equity, which boosted its total liquidity to more than $2 billion. The company's Midnight aircraft also hit new flight milestones, including a 55-mile flight at over 126 mph and a climb to 10,000 feet.",
      "Archer also expanded its global technology footprint. It completed the acquisition of Lilium's patent portfolio, which pushes Archer's total intellectual property to more than 1,000 global assets. Those patents cover ducted fans, high voltage systems, flight controls and other key technologies.",
      "International expansion is underway, too. Archer began test and demo flights in the UAE and secured new partnerships with Korean Air and with Japan Airlines and Sumitomo's JV in Osaka and Tokyo.",
      "The airport will serve as a test bed for next-generation AI aviation systems designed to manage busy airspace more safely. (Archer Aviation)",
      "What this means for you",
      "Archer's airport deal suggests that air taxis are moving closer to everyday use. This shift could mean shorter trips across major cities at a fraction of today's travel time. It could also bring quieter aircraft over neighborhoods compared to helicopters.",
      "For Los Angeles residents, Hawthorne Airport may become a central point for fast point-to-point travel once certification moves forward. Visitors flying in for major events like the LA28 Olympics could see air taxis as a smooth alternative to gridlocked freeways.",
      "Businesses may gain new options for rapid transport across the region. The move also signals more investment and jobs in advanced aviation, automation and clean electric travel.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Archer's acquisition of Hawthorne Airport marks a major milestone in the race to build a real air taxi network, giving the company the aircraft, funding and prime location it needs to push the industry forward. Its focus on AI-driven operations shows how automated aviation may soon play a much bigger role in daily life, even as regulators are still working out how to safely integrate these aircraft into crowded cities. At the same time, the move is already sparking backlash from neighbors who worry about more noise and safety risks and being turned into a test site for AI-guided aircraft without a real say. If Archer can win over regulators, investors and the communities living just beyond the fence line, this step could make the future of urban flight feel much closer, for better or worse.",

    "summary": "Fake AI apps disguised as &quot;ChatGPT&quot; and &quot;DALL\u00b7E&quot; are flooding app stores with dangerous malware that steals data and monitors users without detection.",
    "story": [
      "\u2018The CyberGuy\u2019 Kurt Knutsson joins \u2018Fox & Friends Weekend\u2019 to discuss the potential effects of artificial intelligence software like ChatGPT on the brain.",
      "App stores are supposed to be reliable and free of malware or fake apps, but that's far from the truth. For every legitimate application that solves a real problem, there are dozens of knockoffs waiting to exploit brand recognition and user trust. We've seen it happen with games, productivity tools and entertainment apps. Now, artificial intelligence has become the latest battleground for digital impostors.",
      "The AI boom has created an unprecedented gold rush in mobile app development, and opportunistic actors are cashing in. AI-related mobile apps collectively account for billions of downloads, and that massive user base has attracted a new wave of clones. They pose as popular apps like ChatGPT and DALL\u00b7E, but in reality, they conceal sophisticated spyware capable of stealing data and monitoring users.",

      "OPENAI ACCUSES NY TIMES OF WANTING TO INVADE MILLIONS OF USERS' PRIVACY IN PAPER'S LAWSUIT AGAINST TECH GIANT",
      "Fake AI apps pose as trusted tools like ChatGPT and DALL\u00b7E while secretly stealing user data. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know about the fake AI apps",
      "The fake apps flooding app stores exist on a spectrum of harm, and understanding that range is crucial before you download any AI tools. Take the \"DALL\u00b7E 3 AI Image Generator\" found on Aptoide. It presents itself as an OpenAI product, complete with branding that mimics the real thing. When you open it, you see a loading screen that looks like an AI model generating an image. But nothing is actually being generated.",
      "Network analysis by Appknox showed the app connects only to advertising and analytics services. There's no AI functionality, just an illusion designed to collect your data for monetization.",
      "Then there are apps like WhatsApp Plus, which are far more dangerous. Disguised as an upgraded version of Meta's messenger, this app hides a complete malware framework capable of surveillance, credential theft and persistent background execution. It's signed with a fake certificate instead of WhatsApp's legitimate key and uses a tool often used by malware authors to encrypt malicious code.",
      "Once installed, it silently requests extensive permissions, including access to your contacts, SMS, call logs, device accounts and messages. These permissions allow it to intercept one-time passwords, scrape your address book and impersonate you in chats. Hidden libraries keep the code running even after you close the app. Network logs show it uses domain fronting to disguise its traffic behind Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud endpoints.",
      "Not every clone is malicious. Some apps identify themselves as unofficial interfaces and connect directly to real APIs. The problem is that you often can't tell the difference between a harmless wrapper and a malicious impersonator until it's too late.",
      "Clones hide spyware that can access messages, passwords and contacts. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Users and businesses are equally at risk",
      "The impact of fake AI apps goes far beyond frustrated users. For enterprises, these clones pose a direct threat to brand reputation, compliance and data security.",
      "When a malicious app steals credentials while using your brand's identity, customers don't just lose data but also lose trust. Research shows customers stop buying from a brand after a major breach. The average cost of a data breach now stands at 4.45 million dollars, according to IBM's 2025 report. In regulated sectors like finance and healthcare, such breaches can lead to violations of GDPR, HIPAA and PCI-DSS, with fines reaching up to 4% of global turnover.",
      "These impostors harm both users and brands, leading to costly data breaches and lost trust. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "8 steps to protect yourself from fake AI apps",
      "While the threat landscape continues to evolve, there are practical measures you can take to protect yourself from malicious clones and impersonators.",
      "A quality mobile security solution can detect and block malicious apps before they cause damage. Modern antivirus programs scan apps for suspicious behavior, unauthorized permissions and known malware signatures. This first line of defense is especially important as fake apps become more sophisticated in hiding their true intentions.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Apps like WhatsApp Plus specifically target credentials and can intercept passwords typed directly into fake interfaces. A password manager autofills credentials only on legitimate sites and apps, making it significantly harder for impostors to capture your login information through phishing or fake app interfaces.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Given that malicious clones can steal personal information, intercept SMS verification codes and even impersonate users in chats, identity theft protection provides an additional safety net. These services monitor for unauthorized use of your personal information and can alert you if your identity is being misused across various platforms and services.",
      "Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "PROTECTING KIDS FROM AI CHATBOTS: WHAT THE GUARD ACT MEANS",
      "While some sophisticated malware can intercept SMS codes,\u00a02FA still adds a critical layer of security. Use authenticator apps rather than SMS when possible, as they're harder to compromise. Even if a fake app captures your password, 2FA makes it significantly more difficult for attackers to access your accounts.",
      "Security patches often address vulnerabilities that malicious apps exploit. Regular updates to your operating system and legitimate apps ensure you have the latest protections against known threats. Enable automatic updates when possible to stay protected without having to remember manual checks.",
      "Stick to the Apple App Store and Google Play Store rather than third-party marketplaces. While fake apps can still appear on official platforms, these stores have security review processes and are more responsive to removing malicious applications once they're identified. Third-party app stores often have minimal or no security vetting.",
      "Check the developer name carefully. Official ChatGPT apps come from OpenAI, not random developers with similar names. Look at the number of downloads, read recent reviews and be suspicious of apps with few ratings or reviews that seem generic. Legitimate AI tools from major companies will have verified developer badges and millions of downloads.",
      "Even if you avoid downloading fake apps, your personal information may already be circulating on data broker sites that scammers rely on. These brokers collect and sell details like your name, phone number, home address and app usage data, information that cybercriminals can use to craft convincing phishing messages or impersonate you.",
      "A trusted data removal service scans hundreds of broker databases and automatically submits removal requests on your behalf. Regularly removing your data helps reduce your digital footprint, making it harder for malicious actors and fake app networks to target you.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "The AI boom has driven massive innovation, but it has also opened new attack surfaces built on brand trust. As adoption grows across mobile platforms, enterprises must secure not only their own apps but also track how their brand appears across hundreds of app stores worldwide. In a market where billions of AI app downloads have happened, the clones aren't coming. They're already here, hiding behind familiar logos and polished interfaces.",

      "This scam works because a vehicle report sounds routine. A fake buyer pushes you to a site you've never heard of, then applies pressure to act fast. Slow down, verify and stick to well-known services. Real buyers will accept a report you provide or will run one themselves. You can still sell safely on marketplaces by following a few simple rules. Control the process, choose the report source and avoid links sent by strangers. Thanks to readers like Nick, more sellers can spot the trap before any money or data is at risk.",

      "A new Play Store update makes it easier to manage apps across all your Android devices. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The new uninstall button rolls out",
      "Google is rolling out version 48.8 of the Play Store, and it introduces a new \u2018Uninstall\u2019 button right on each app's listing. You can now remove an app from any of your devices directly from your main phone. This eliminates the need to pick up each device and remove the app one by one.

NASA said each discovery has helped scientists better understand how meteorites interact with the Martian surface over time.",

      "Every year, they target holiday shoppers with fake websites, \"too-good-to-be-true\" deals and scam emails that look identical to legitimate retailers. But here's the part most people miss: scammers don't just rely on luck. They already have your personal data before you even click \"add to cart.\"",
      "From leaked email addresses to exposed phone numbers and home addresses, your personal information is being bought and sold by data brokers, companies that collect and resell detailed profiles about you.

We let our guard down when we're rushed, distracted or excited by a deal. Staying alert during the holiday season can help you avoid data exposure and financial losses. Here are some of the most common scams you should be aware of.",
      "The surge of promotions during the holiday season is the perfect time for \"phantom stores\" to thrive. It's a fraudulent store that mimics the interface and products of a well-known brand. Once you purchase from such a website, you'll never receive your order as the store doesn't actually exist.",
      "Real-world example: Fake IKEA websites appeared with URLs spelled \"ikeaa-sale.com\" and \"ikea-blackfriday.shop,\" mimicking the official ikea.com interface with copied product images, logos and discount banners.",
      "They lured shoppers with huge discounts and clearance offers to steal credit card data. Eventually, they were reported and taken down, but the damage has been done.",
      "What to do?\u00a0Always check the URL of the store you shop at and only click links from the store's official website or social media.",
      "According to recent research, some of the most popular shopping apps like Temu are selling your location data to third parties. It's no surprise that you might receive fake delivery texts.",
      "Your leaked data fuels realistic \"order\" and \"delivery\" scams online. (iStock)",
      "MAJOR COMPANIES, INCLUDING GOOGLE AND DIOR, HIT BY MASSIVE SALESFORCE DATA BREACH",
      "Real-world example: Temu is a popular app for scammers to mimic. They can easily find your contact information and order details to text \"Your order couldn't be delivered.\" Each text contains a phishing link that can install malware on your device or steal your personal information. That's why Temu warns its users about the couriers they partner with.",
      "What to do?\u00a0Make sure the texts you receive come from a legit courier service and double-check it on the store's website.",
      "Some scammers use sophisticated phishing tactics to lure victims. They engineer emails from well-known brands, use an urgent tone, place malicious links and urge you to click on your order status. In reality, there is no order status \u2013 they're stealing your data.",
      "Real-world example: Amazon is one of the biggest online retailers worldwide, and that makes the brand easy to mimic. Scammers send emails on behalf of Amazon to try to steal customers' personal data because it's highly likely that their victims have used Amazon, making it less suspicious. However, phishing emails have some telltale signs you can look out for.",
      "What to do?\u00a0Never click on any suspicious links and always check the sender's contact information.",
      "When you shop online, you should be aware of the data you share, including your contact information, shopping habits, credit card details and more. All stores collect some type of data about you. However, some companies collect more than you think.",
      "Real-world example: The infamous Target controversy in 2012 revealed how big retailers use data analysis to predict your shopping behavior. The company collected shopping data and managed to produce a predictive model for soon-to-be mothers.",
      "They sent out brochures with baby clothes, vouchers for baby formula and more before the customers even knew they were pregnant. Thankfully, modern shopping looks a bit different. You can opt out of certain data collection and exercise your right to remove personal information from websites that collect it.",

      "How scammers find you",
      "Imagine you're browsing for gifts online. Within minutes, your activity generates data points \u2013 device info, IP address, browsing habits that feed into online databases. At the same time, data brokers already have your full profile: age, income, address history, family members and even shopping behavior. These profiles are sold to marketers and often leak into criminal databases.",
      "That's why scam calls, texts and emails often feel so \"real.\" They use your name, the right retailer, even your city. They're not guessing. They've bought your digital footprint.",
      "The \"holiday cleanup\" your data needs",
      "Most people clear their browser cookies or delete old emails to \"stay private.\" But that's like locking your front door while leaving all your personal documents on the lawn.",
      "If you want to stop scammers from targeting you this holiday season, you need to remove your personal data from the source, the data broker databases that feed these scams.",
      "That's where a data removal service comes in. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "A major national security debate is unfolding, and it affects more than government networks. It touches your home, your devices and the Wi-Fi your family uses every day. The Commerce Department has proposed blocking new sales of TP-Link products after a months-long review into the company\u2019s ties to China, citing a growing TP-Link security risk.",
      "Multiple agencies, including the Departments of Homeland Security and War, supported that proposal. They believe the company\u2019s connections could expose American networks to foreign influence.",
      "Security experts warn that foreign-backed hackers have targeted home and office routers for years. These devices often act as silent steppingstones that help attackers move deeper into sensitive systems. When compromised, they can expose everything connected to them, including computers, smart home gear, military devices used on base and more.",
      "This potential ban would be one of the biggest consumer tech actions in U.S. history. It comes as lawmakers raise fresh alarms about Chinese-made cameras, routers and connected home products sold on military exchanges and in homes across the country.",

      "CHINESE HACKERS BREACH US NUCLEAR SECURITY AGENCY IN CYBERATTACK OPERATION, OFFICIALS SAY",
      "The proposed TP-Link ban stems from growing concerns that foreign-linked routers and cameras could expose American homes and networks to outside influence. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why military families are even more vulnerable",
      "Lawmakers from both parties say military households face extra risk. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, who leads a bipartisan group of 23 lawmakers, warns that TP-Link cameras and networking devices sold on Army, Navy and Air Force exchange sites could expose sensitive footage from base housing and dorms. Rep. Ashley Hinson, R-Iowa, echoed that concern, saying these devices could act as a backdoor for Chinese intelligence to collect information on service members and their families. Even when products appear out of stock, officials worry they remain popular in military communities.",
      "These lawmakers say Chinese laws could force companies to share data or push hidden software changes that weaken U.S. networks. They argue that this creates a real risk for households on or near military installations. While TP-Link disputes every allegation and states that it stores U.S. data inside America, lawmakers want a deeper investigation.",
      "\"China will use any way to infiltrate us, and we must ensure they cannot access our homeland or military bases,\" said Ernst. \"High-tech security cameras sending video and audio directly back to Beijing must be treated like the grave threat that they are. We have seen this playbook from China before, with Huawei Technologies, and need the Trump administration to investigate and determine if TP-Link is a Trojan horse compromising our national security.\"",
      "10M AMERICANS HIT IN GOVERNMENT CONTRACTOR DATA BREACH",
      "How Congress is responding to TP-Link security risks",
      "Ernst is pressing the Commerce Department to finish its investigation by Nov. 30. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, says TP-Link could give the Chinese government access to American networks and wants faster action. Their concerns reflect past decisions involving Huawei and Kaspersky, which lost access to the U.S. market due to national security risks.",
      "Congressional leaders say foreign-made smart home devices sold on military bases should face strict scrutiny. They see routers, cameras and other connected home gear as critical targets in a time when cyberthreats continue to grow.",

      "\"This letter has nothing to do with security and everything to do with a competitor trying to remove TP-Link Systems\u2019 products from the marketplace. The \u2018open source information\u2019 the members reference is actually a manufactured echo chamber of false and misleading attacks that the media has parroted over the past year.

      "\"TP-Link has not been contacted by policymakers to discuss the alleged concerns, but if we were to meet with them, they would learn that TP-Link has located its core security functions and data infrastructure in the United States.

      "\"TP-Link Systems currently holds a very small share of the U.S. security camera market, representing approximately 3% of the consumer market segment according to Circana checkout data. The company has virtually no business presence in the enterprise segment. Additionally, TP-Link Systems' router market share in the U.S. has been inaccurately reported as being much higher than it actually is. Recent market research from Dell\u2019Oro Group, Inc., found that TP-Link Systems' market share of residential Wi-Fi router sales in North America is under 10%.",

      "According to the statement provided to CyberGuy, the breach was limited to employment-related information tied to Hyundai AutoEver America and Hyundai Motor America. The company confirmed that about 2,000 current and former employees were notified of the incident in late October. HAEA said it immediately alerted law enforcement and hired outside cybersecurity experts to assess the damage.",

      "Cybercriminals targeted Hyundai AutoEver America\u2019s systems, exposing sensitive data. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why this Hyundai AutoEver America breach matters",
      "The exposed data reportedly includes names, Social Security numbers and driver's license numbers, making this breach far more serious than one involving passwords alone. Experts warn that these details can be used for long-term identity theft and financial fraud. Because Social Security numbers cannot easily be changed, criminals have more time to create fake identities, open fraudulent accounts and launch targeted phishing attacks long after the initial breach.",

      "According to the company, this incident was limited to employment-related data and primarily affected approximately 2,000 current and former employees of Hyundai AutoEver America and Hyundai Motor America. No customer information or Bluelink driver details were exposed. While some filings reference sensitive data types such as Social Security numbers or driver's license information, the incident did not involve Hyundai customers or the millions of connected vehicles HAEA supports.",
      "Earlier reports suggested that 2.7 million individuals were affected, but Hyundai says that figure is unrelated to the breach. Instead, 2.7 million is the estimated number of connected vehicles that Hyundai AutoEver America helps support across North America. None of that consumer or vehicle data was accessed.",
      "GENESIS PREVIEWS G70 SPORTS SEDAN WITH NEW YORK CONCEPT",
      "Hyundai also clarified that the United States has about 850 Hyundai dealerships and emphasized that the scope of this incident was narrow and contained.",
      "We reached out to HAEA for a comment, and a representative for the company provided CyberGuy with this statement:",
      "\"Hyundai AutoEver America, an IT vendor that manages certain Hyundai Motor America employee data systems, experienced an incident to that area of business that impacted employment-related data and primarily affected current and former employees of Hyundai AutoEver America and Hyundai Motor America. Approximately 2,000 primarily current and former employees were notified of the incident. The 2.7 million figure that is cited in many media articles has no relation to the actual security incident. The 2.7 million figure represents the alleged total number of connected vehicles that may be supported by Hyundai AutoEver America across North America.

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "A Skagit County Superior Court judge ruled that images from Flock Safety automated license plate reader cameras in Stanwood and Sedro-Woolley qualify as public records under Washington's Public Records Act.",
      "Judge Elizabeth Yost Neidzwski said the images are \"not exempt from disclosure\" and explained that an agency does not need to physically hold a record for it to fall under the law.",
      "The request that led to the ruling",
      "The case began when Washington resident Jose Rodriguez asked Stanwood for one hour of Flock camera images. That request prompted Stanwood and neighboring Sedro-Woolley to ask the court to declare that vendor-stored data did not count as public records.",

      "Judge Neidzwski rejected that argument. She said the cities' ALPR images support a government purpose and meet the definition of a public record.",

      "Flock Safety cameras use AI to capture license plate images in real time, tracking vehicles as they move through neighborhoods. (Flock Safety)",
      "However, Rodriguez will not receive the specific images he sought. The city had already allowed the footage to auto-delete after 30 days, and it expired before the ruling.",
      "We reached out to Flock Safety, and a spokesperson provided CyberGuy with the following statement:",
      "\"The Court merely declined to exempt these records from disclosure under Washington's extremely broad public records law. Nothing changed in the status quo in Washington as a result of this ruling \u2014 these records were covered by the law before the ruling, and remain so following the ruling. Unfortunately, some individuals in Washington have abused the breadth of the public records law to extort significant settlements from Washington communities for technical violations of the disclosure requirements, which we cannot believe is the intent of the law. We are supporting efforts to enact a legislative fix to this situation, which is costing Washington communities tens of thousands of dollars to stave off frivolous lawsuits.\"",
      "The Washington court ruling marks a major step toward transparency in how police collect and store surveillance data. (Flock Safety)",
      "Why the decision matters for transparency",
      "Flock's automated license plate reader cameras capture multiple still images of passing vehicles along with time, location and license plate information. Cities use the system to assist law enforcement with investigations, relying on stored images to identify vehicles connected to crimes or alerts.",
      "The court's ruling raises broader questions about how local agencies manage these images once they're created. By finding that the images qualify as public records, the decision forces cities to examine how long they retain this data, how it is stored and who may request access under state law.",
      "Privacy advocates say the ruling highlights the need for clear policies around retention and transparency, while law enforcement groups argue that access rules must still protect ongoing investigations.",
      "AI DASHCAMS ENHANCE TRUCKER SAFETY WHILE RAISING PRIVACY CONCERNS",
      "The debate continues as communities weigh the balance between public safety, privacy and the right to know what\u2019s being recorded. (Flock Safety)",
      "How this ruling impacts privacy and surveillance",
      "For years, cities and police agencies have argued that data stored by third-party vendors falls outside public records laws. They often make this claim even when the data documents activity on public roads. The Washington ruling did not settle broader questions about surveillance, but it rejected the idea that Flock camera images are exempt simply because a vendor stores them. This decision exposes a growing tension between how agencies use surveillance tools and what the public can access under state law.",
      "Beryl Lipton of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to defending digital privacy, free expression and transparency in technology, told Cyberguy,\u00a0\"The use of third-party vendors for surveillance and data storage is widespread and growing across the country, and allowing this to undermine the public\u2019s right to know is very dangerous. The government's primary obligation should be to its constituents, which includes protecting their rights under public records laws, not to the private vendors that they choose to employ while conducting mass surveillance. Whether an agency stores images and information on their own devices or on the private server of a vendor should not affect the appropriate disclosure of these records under public records laws. If the use of these devices makes it too difficult for a city to comply with the law, then the response should not be to circumvent the laws they find inconvenient, but rather it should be to only use vendors that won\u2019t get in the way of a city\u2019s ability to fulfill its responsibilities to their citizenry. Otherwise, they should not use these tools at all.\"",
      "What this means for you",
      "If your town uses Flock or other automated license plate readers, this ruling shows how Washington courts may handle future records requests. It confirms that ALPR images can count as public records, even when a vendor stores the data.",
      "The debate over privacy and safety continues. Supporters say public access builds trust and oversight. Critics worry that releasing vehicle data could expose sensitive details without strong safeguards or redactions.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "This ruling shows how courts may handle data from automated license plate readers. It also reveals how much vehicle information cities collect. As a result, it raises new questions about who should access these records. In addition, the decision may guide future transparency debates in Washington.

      "Veteran actor Gerald McRaney stepped into the part of the formidable father at the heart of Hulu\u2019s limited series \"Murdaugh: Death in the Family,\" a role he said required him to inhabit a family\u2019s patriarch amid scandal.",
      "McRaney, 78, spoke with Fox News Digital about how he approached portraying Randolph Murdaugh III, the patriarch who loomed over generations of privilege in South Carolina\u2019s Lowcountry.",
      "\"You were dealing with a man who had no soul,\" McRaney said of Randolph's son, Alex. \"Everything was done to impress other people with his success. It didn\u2019t matter how he got that sort of approval.\"",
      "The Murdaugh family held influence over South Carolina\u2019s judicial system for nearly a century. Three generations served as solicitors on the state\u2019s 14th Circuit, while maintaining a lucrative private law practice in Hampton County.",

      "That mask of prestige began to crack after a 2019 boating accident involving Paul Murdaugh, the grandson of Randolph III, which killed 19-year-old Mallory Beach.",
      "In 2021, Randolph\u2019s son, Alex Murdaugh, was charged with murdering his wife, Maggie, and son, Paul. Prosecutors said Alex killed them to distract from financial crimes that were about to come to light.",
      "The shocking revelations are captured in Hulu\u2019s \"Murdaugh: Death in the Family\" series, created by Michael D. Fuller and Erin Lee Carr.",
      "For McRaney, understanding the Murdaughs began with examining how power became inherited and unchallenged.",
      "\"There was a generational indulgence of prodigal sons,\" he said. \"Every generation got a little bit deeper into trouble. And when you don\u2019t hold people to account when they\u2019re children, then no one holds them to account until they\u2019re in a court of law.\"",

      "\"It was out of ego for himself, to have people think that his children were perfect,\" he said. \"People aren\u2019t perfect. When you have to maintain that image, you\u2019re asking for trouble.\"",
      "In the series, Randolph Murdaugh III is portrayed as the keeper of the family\u2019s image, a man who commands respect but struggles with what that legacy demands. McRaney approached the role not as a villain, but as a man blinded by pride.",
      "\"You do want to defend your children all the time. You don\u2019t want bad things to happen to them,\" he said. \"But that instinct can turn destructive when it becomes about protecting an illusion.\"",

      "Though the Murdaugh saga unfolded in South Carolina, the Hulu series was filmed entirely in Georgia, a detail that disappointed McRaney, whose daughter lives in Beaufort.",
      "\"We filmed everything in the Atlanta area. I would rather have done it in South Carolina,\" he said, adding that the cast never went on a site visit to the Murdaughs' estate. \"My daughter lives in Beaufort. She and her family were very aware of this case the whole time it was going on.\"",
      "Even from a distance, McRaney said the production team worked meticulously to capture the case\u2019s authenticity.",
      "\"They did a lot of research, even matching wardrobe to photographs taken on particular days while the case was going on,\" he explained. \"It was very detailed. Most people probably won\u2019t notice, but for me, it helped in the acting process.\"",
      "McRaney described Alex Murdaugh as a man \"who had no soul.\" (Disney/Daniel Delgado Jr.)",
      "Beyond the specifics of the Murdaugh saga, McRaney sees the story as a reflection of a broader moral erosion.",
      "\"We\u2019ve become too indulgent with people and we don\u2019t hold them to account,\" he said. \"You read all these stories of a guy who finally commits murder after being given probation for assault or burglary. He was never held to account until it\u2019s too late.\"",
      "\"We\u2019ve sort of taken religion, whatever your religion might be, out of our culture,\" he said. \"Religion used to hold two things: hope for people who were down, and judgment for people who were evil. People don\u2019t believe that anymore. And when they don\u2019t, justice becomes just a matter of luck.\"",
      "The veteran actor credits the show\u2019s success to its restraint and refusing to sensationalize a story.",
      "\"They didn\u2019t over-dramatize things,\" he said. \"You\u2019re dealing with a story that doesn\u2019t need to be dramatized. Just tell the story, and it works.\"",
      "Despite the dark subject matter, he found playing Randolph surprisingly natural.",
      "\"How easy it was to understand his point of view,\" McRaney said. \"It\u2019s always easy to justify protecting your children. But that\u2019s where pride becomes a trap.\"",

Rabbi Aryeh Ralbag, chief justice of the Union of Orthodox Rabbis of the United States and Canada, also weighed in, calling the \"genocide\" label applied to Israel a distortion of historical truth. Similar letters came from rabbis Yitzchak Lasry and Tal Peretz, along with additional submissions from Rabbis Dana, Ovadia and Tobali.",
      "\"In terms of rabbis taking a position, I think this is extremely important,\" Lemkin said. \"If an organization uses Raphael's name to distort or invert his legacy, religious and moral leaders have a duty to defend historical truth. \u2026 When a revered public figure\u2019s name such as Raphael, is misused, it becomes a form of false witness, which, as I understand it, is contrary to Jewish law and ethics.\"",

It reinforces rhetoric that spills into real-world antisemitism.",
      "Lemkin said the connection is clear to him.",
      "\"In terms of feeding narratives to help antisemitism spread, it seems obvious, and I believe it is supported by empirical evidence that spikes in accusations that Israel is committing genocide correlate with surges in antisemitic incidents in the U.S.,\" he wrote. \"From my perspective, using the \u2018genocide\u2019 trope against Israel doesn\u2019t advance peace or justice. It just brings back antisemitic patterns. It turns the memory of Jewish victimhood into an accusation against the Jewish people and corrupts a word coined to prevent another Holocaust.",
      "\"Candidly using the word genocide against Israel while ignoring Darfur, Rwanda and Syria and others erodes the moral credibility of human rights activists, spotlighting their true antisemitic motivations.\"",

      "\"My view of this political moment \u2013 The recent anti-Zionist rhetoric is massively troubling and scary, not only from the streets and campuses but increasingly by elected officials,\" he said. \"What we used to see confined to the fringe extremists is being heard in legislative chambers and political rallies.\"",

    "story": [
      "As the holiday shopping season starts to kick into high gear, Americans are balancing Black Friday deals with lingering concerns about their own finances.",
      "Consumers are looking to shell out less this holiday season, new data from Deloitte shows. Surveyed shoppers said they plan to spend 4% less than last year between Black Friday and Cyber Monday, citing higher costs of living and more fear of the economy.",
      "It\u2019s a reversal. Previous Deloitte surveys dating back to 2021 had shown shoppers planned to spend more than previous years during the post-Thanksgiving weekend.",
      "The pullback is expected to hit both ends of the income spectrum. Consumers making less than $50,000 a year are expected to spend 12% less than last year, according to the business services firm. Shoppers making more than $200,000 a year say they\u2019ll cut their spending by 18%.",
      "\u201cWhile we expect shoppers to plan to pull back on spending, we also anticipate strong participation throughout the holiday week,\u201d Natalie Martini, Deloitte\u2019s vice chair and U.S. retail and consumer products leader, said in a press release.",
      "The firm surveyed 1,200 consumers across the United States between Oct. 15 and Oct. 23.",
      "Shoppers are hitting the malls and retail websites at a precarious time, with Americans feeling increasingly fearful about both the broader economy and their personal finances. Consumer confidence hit one of the lowest levels on record in November, according to the University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment survey that was released Friday. It\u2019s just slightly above the June 2022 low, when inflation was soaring.",
      "Voters cited affordability as a top concern during November\u2019s elections, fueling Democratic wins in Virginia, New Jersey and New York City. President Donald Trump has tried to address rising food costs by eliminating many of the tariffs he imposed this year on food imports, including beef and coffee from Brazil.",
      "The University of Michigan report found that consumers were particularly worried about their jobs and personal finances: 69% of respondents said they expect unemployment to increase over the next year, twice the percentage from a year ago.",
      "\u201cAfter the federal shutdown ended, sentiment lifted slightly from its mid-month reading,\u201d wrote Joanne Hsu, the director of consumer surveys at the school. \u201cHowever, consumers remain frustrated about the persistence of high prices and weakening incomes.\u201d",
      "The rate of inflation, which slowed earlier this year, has been climbing since April, according to federal data, reaching an annual rate of 3% in September. That\u2019s stinging Americans\u2019 wallets, and many aren\u2019t expecting relief anytime soon. Respondents in the University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey expect inflation to hit 4.5% by next year.",
      "Retail earnings reports over the past few weeks point to some troubling consumer trends. Walmart posted strong results last week as the discount retailer benefited from shoppers looking to save money on core items like groceries and other staples. The company said higher-income families are shopping more at the store in search of bargains, while lower-income families are under greater financial strain.",
      "\u201cAs pocketbooks have been stretched, you\u2019re seeing more consumer dollars go to necessities versus discretionary items,\u201d said John David Rainey, Walmart\u2019s chief financial officer, during the company\u2019s earnings call.",
      "Discount fashion retailers like Gap and TJX Cos., which owns the chains T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, also reported strong quarterly earnings, another sign that shoppers are trading down and seeking out cheaper options. Target and Bath & Body Works, which are seen as stores that encourage splurging, struggled during the previous quarter.",
      "With their bank accounts already stretched, consumers are increasingly turning to financing in order to afford their purchases. A report last month from PayPal found that half of shoppers plan to use buy now, pay later services for their holiday shopping. These services, which include apps like Klarna, Afterpay and Affirm, allow customers to make a purchase and then pay it off in installments, typically with 0% interest.",
      "These apps are especially popular with younger shoppers. According to the Deloitte study, 39% of Gen Zers and millennials will use buy now, pay later apps for Black Friday spending. Many shoppers use these services to spread out their spending over a longer period of time, but some worry that it entices people to spend more than they can afford and can pull them into debt they didn\u2019t expect."

      "A new feature on X has stirred confusion, anger and a wave of online sleuthing after users discovered that the platform was suddenly displaying the surprising locations where certain accounts are based.",
      "Over the weekend, users noticed that clicking on an account\u2019s join date now opens a tab that shows the country or region in which the account is located.",
      "X\u2019s head of product, Nikita Bier, teased the feature last month as a way to help users verify the authenticity of content they read and limit the influence of troll farms, which often run political accounts from outside the countries they target.",
      "The issue of inauthentic or \"bot\" accounts has plagued the platform, formerly Twitter, and other social media sites for over a decade. Perhaps most notably, inauthentic accounts on Twitter and other social media platforms were allegedly used by a Russian government operation in the run-up to the 2016 election in an attempt to influence the outcome. The incident set off a wave of concern online about the persistent presence of inauthentic accounts, but detection methods to sniff out such accounts remained unreliable for years.",
      "When tech billionaire Elon Musk took over Twitter in 2022, he promised to address the issues of \"bots\" on the platform, conducting several purges early in his ownership of the company that took down many accounts. Several studies have shown, however, that suspected inauthentic activity on the platform has remained at persistent levels since Musk bought Twitter.",
      "The new location-revealing feature is a different approach to the issue.",
      "As soon as it appeared live for users, X was flooded with viral posts showing that numerous high-engagement, MAGA-branded accounts that present themselves as those of patriotic Americans appear to instead be based overseas, including in Eastern Europe, Thailand, Nigeria and Bangladesh.",
      "An account that calls itself \u201cULTRAMAGA \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 TRUMP\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf82028,\u201d claiming to be based in Washington, D.C., is listed as being based in Africa. Another now-deleted account with a President Donald Trump-inspired username \u2014 \u201cTrump Is My President\u201d \u2014 was listed as being based in Macedonia. And an account with the username @American, complete with a profile picture featuring a bald eagle over an American flag, is apparently based in South Asia.",
      "Users also attempted to target left-leaning accounts.",
      "Some pointed to an unofficial account with several hundred followers that purported to represent the Democratic Socialists of America, which X listed as being based in Portugal. However, the real account for the political party has over 300,000 followers and is verified.",
      "Some users pushed back against the locations listed on their account. Three accounts belonging to NBC News journalists showed locations that did not correlate to where they are based but to where they had traveled to recently instead.",
      "X also placed a warning that popped up when a user's location is clicked on: \"The country or region that an account is based can be impacted by recent travel or temporary relocation. This data may not be accurate and can change periodically.\"",
      "While it's not clear exactly how X was determining users' locations, Bier posted Sunday night that the system was still evolving. In response to a post asking if the company had taken a shortcut and questioning its accuracy, Bier wrote that an upgrade would happen the next day.",
      "\"Accuracy will be nearly 99.99%,\" he wrote.",
      "But the posts that stirred the biggest frenzy came Friday morning, when screenshots and screen recordings claiming that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security account was listed as being based in Israel quickly went viral. The department and Bier have both denied the speculation, claiming the posts are spreading misinformation.",
      "X users circulated images and videos that alleged to show the location field displaying \u201cTel Aviv, Israel.\u201d The account information feature abruptly disappeared Friday night.",
      "NBC News did not view the account\u2019s location before the feature went away Friday and has not confirmed the authenticity of the posts.",
      "The situation comes amid mounting backlash from across the political spectrum to U.S. officials\u2019 support for Israel, which many commentators have lamented as appearing to prioritize a foreign entity over America.",
      "DHS initially responded with a meme-like image of Trump, looking stunned, which neither confirmed nor denied the discourse about its account location.",
      "On Sunday, it followed up with an official denial.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t believe we have to say this, but this account has only ever been run and operated from the United States,\u201d DHS posted. \u201cScreenshots are easy to forge, videos are easy to manipulate. Thank you for your attention to this matter.\u201d",
      "Reached for comment, a spokesperson for DHS pointed NBC News to the same social media statement.",
      "The account information feature returned soon after Friday\u2019s brief shutoff, with Bier announcing a global rollout Saturday. But the feature, which previously listed both an account\u2019s current location and its location on the date of its creation, no longer shows the latter.",
      "Bier also responded to the speculation by telling a user to \u201cstop spreading misinformation,\u201d saying X\u2019s account information feature was temporarily shut off \u201cbecause the account creation country was incorrect on a very small subset of old accounts, due to IP ranges changing over time.\u201d He did not clarify whether such an error was present on DHS\u2019 account specifically.",
      "Still, he responded to some of the posts showing the DHS account as being based in Israel, calling the claim \u201cfake news.\u201d",
      "\u201cLocation was not available on any gray check [government] account at any point,\u201d he wrote in response to one screen recording, which X has now labeled as \u201cmanipulated media.\u201d \u201cFurthermore, the DHS has only shown IPs from the United States since account creation.\u201d",
      "As of Sunday morning, however, the location information is available again on the DHS account. This time, it reads: \u201cUnited States.\u201d But DHS appears to be the only gray-check government account that displays the location where it is based, as other government accounts now display only their dates of account creation and account verification.",
      "Bier and X did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Bier said in a post that there are still \u201ca few rough edges\u201d around the feature that should be resolved by Tuesday.",
      "\u201cIf any data is incorrect, it will be updated periodically based on best available information,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis happens on a delayed and randomized schedule to preserve privacy.\u201d"

      "The phone was announced on the 10th anniversary of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign launch and was the Trump brand\u2019s first foray into mobile products and services. According to the initial announcement, the phone was supposed to be released in August.",

      "After confirming with the credit card company that the transaction was not fraudulent, NBC News received a confirmation email verifying the order.",
      "But the company provided no proactive updates after the order. NBC News made five separate phone calls to the Trump Mobile customer support line between September and November. At one point in October, the call operator promised a specific ship date: Nov. 13.",
      "That date passed without an update, and when NBC News followed up with the call center, an operator said the delivery would now be in the \u201cbeginning of December,\u201d with no specific date.",
      "The operator cited the government shutdown as a reason for the delay, without further explanation.",
      "Trump Mobile launched the T1 phone in tandem with a number of phone service offerings, including a 5G service plan priced at $47.45 per month \u2014 a nod to the president\u2019s terms.

      "But in August, Trump Mobile\u2019s X account posted, \u201cThe wait is almost over!\u201d The post featured a photo of a supposed T1 phone with a completely different design, including more than three rear cameras.",
      "The Verge reported that the phone appeared to be a render of a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra. When phone case company Spigen noticed that the photo appeared to be a doctored image of a Samsung in one of its cases, the company suggested it would sue.",
      "NBC News has not been able to identify any lawsuit from Spigen, and the company has not responded to repeated requests for comment.",

      "Todd Weaver, the founder and CEO of Purism, a Carlsbad, California-based company that manufactures the only U.S.-made smartphone on the market, said that when his company started, there was \u201cno skilled labor\u201d in the U.S. capable of manufacturing a phone, and \u201cnobody [had] done it before.\u201dHe said that creating a chain of production that would allow for a made-in-the-USA label was time and labor-intensive.",
      "\u201cWe actually had to go over to China with our designs, to learn the process, the manufacturing process, to see what are all the steps,\u201d Weaver said.",
      "He said it took him six years to take his Liberty Phone from idea to production, which Purism sells at a $2,000 price point.",

      "Previous research, including Raji\u2019s own, has studied the relationship between visceral fat and health outcomes such as brain volume loss, cognitive impairment and structural changes in the brain.",
      "The study involved 1,164 healthy people whose average chronological age was 55.17. About 52% were women and 39% were nonwhite. All underwent a whole-body MRI that looked at brain, fat and muscle tissue.",
      "To determine participants\u2019 brain age, Raji and his colleagues used an algorithm that had been trained on the MRI scans of 5,500 healthy adults ages 18 to 89. The average brain age of study participants was 56.04 \u2014 older than their average chronological age. Researchers called this difference the \u201cbrain age gap.\u201d",
      "The average brain age gap was 0.69 years, meaning participants\u2019 brains looked slightly older than they should. However, this metric was not statistically significant.",
      "Just as higher muscle mass and a lower visceral fat-to-muscle ratio corresponded to a younger brain age, lower muscle mass and a higher visceral fat-to-muscle ratio corresponded to an older brain age.",
      "This link between body fat and brain age only held true for visceral fat, which is also known as hidden fat, active fat or deep belly fat. Subcutaneous fat, the layer of fat just below the skin\u2019s surface, wasn\u2019t associated with brain age, the study found.",
      "\u201cVisceral fat, which is the really terrible fat, [is] linked to a higher rate of diabetes, insulin resistance, prediabetic states, high cholesterol,\u201d Raji said. \u201cThat leads to a higher inflammatory state in the body, which over time affects the brain. That\u2019s the main mechanism by which we believe obesity can affect risk for Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\u201d",
      "BMI reveals little of body composition",
      "From a clinical perspective, the study results are on par with what Dr. Zhenqi Liu, the James M. Moss professor of diabetes at the University of Virginia School of Medicine, would expect.",
      "\u201cWhen people are very young and healthy, they tend to have more muscle mass and they will have [a] younger brain age,\u201d said Liu, who wasn\u2019t involved in the research.",
      "Older adults, on the other hand, especially those living with chronic diseases such as diabetes or obesity, usually have lower muscle mass, Liu added. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if their brain volume is decreased.\u201d",
      "Even so, the study reinforces that muscle health is vital to overall health, Liu said.",
      "The limitations of body mass index, or BMI, as a measure of health are also on display in this research, Liu said. BMI is a standardized, nearly 200-year-old body fat metric calculated using your height and weight. But it\u2019s fallen out of favor in recent years, namely because it doesn\u2019t take into account how your fat \u2014 neither visceral nor subcutaneous \u2014 is distributed throughout your body.",
      "A BMI of 30 or higher falls into the obese category. For Raji, his latest work demonstrates how a low BMI could disguise poor brain health.",
      "\u201cIf you have more visceral fat and less muscle, you can have an older-looking brain,\u201d Raji said. \u201cThat makes sense in terms of Alzheimer\u2019s being a big risk factor \u2014 regardless of whatever the BMI would show.\u201d",
      "Liu favors two other approaches to assessing body composition. The first is waist circumference. Measurements beyond 35 inches for women or 40 inches for men increase your risk of heart disease and Type 2 diabetes, according to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. The second metric is the waist-hip ratio, which involves dividing your waist circumference by your hip circumference. According to the World Health Organization, this ratio shouldn\u2019t exceed 0.85 for women or 0.9 for men.",
      "Still, you can\u2019t accurately measure your own visceral fat unless your doctor refers you for an MRI, which can assess the amount of fat under the skin and surrounding the organs. An elective full-body scan can cost up to $5,000.",
      "The good news is, there are steps you can take to increase muscle mass and lower visceral fat without spending a dime.",
      "How to build muscle and burn visceral fat",
      "If it\u2019s been ages since you\u2019ve touched a dumbbell or gone for a long walk, fear not, said Siddhartha Angadi, a colleague of Liu\u2019s and an associate professor of kinesiology at UVA\u2019s School of Education and Human Development.",
      "\u201cAnyone can exercise \u2014 regardless of their age,\u201d said Angadi, who wasn\u2019t involved in the research. \u201cThere\u2019s excellent data across the lifespan, across the health span, across multiple diseases showing that exercise is incredibly safe.\u201d",
      "Angadi recommends following the American College of Sports Medicine\u2019s physical activity guidelines. At least twice a week, healthy adults 65 and younger are encouraged to do muscle-strengthening activities that work all major muscle groups.",
      "\u201cDo 10 to 15 different exercises,\u201d Angadi said. \u201cYou want to do one to three sets; in each set, you want to have eight to 12 reps. Use machines if you\u2019re not familiar with resistance training, which is a fancy way of saying weightlifting.\u201d",
      "Aerobic exercise is particularly effective at targeting visceral fat, Angadi said. The guidelines suggest 150 minutes of moderately intense aerobic activity every week.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing that can reverse brain aging,\u201d Angadi said. \u201cYou can just slow the rate of it.\u201d",
      "Glenn Gaesser, a professor of exercise physiology at the Arizona State University College of Health Solutions, said baby steps can help build muscle and burn visceral fat.",
      "\u201cA lot of people think that it takes a lot to produce some sort of health benefit from exercise, and that is not necessarily true,\u201d said Gaesser, who wasn\u2019t part of the study. \u201cThe biggest return on investment is with the initial few minutes of exercise.\u201d",
      "For example, if you\u2019re striving for the recommended 150 minutes of aerobics per week, your body will benefit most in those first 30 minutes, Gaesser said.",
      "\u201cSame with resistance training,\u201d Gaesser said. \u201cA lot of people may not want a gym membership, they may not want to go and lift weights, but you can do resistance training even with the weight of your own body.\u201d",
      "While Raji\u2019s research doesn\u2019t conclude that higher muscle mass and a lower visceral fat-to-muscle ratio guarantee better brain health, it spotlights the relationship between the brain and the musculoskeletal system, Gaesser said. When you work out, your muscles release chemical signals thought to positively influence the brain and other tissues.",
      "\u201cThis is why individuals who perform regular exercise tend to have lower risk of cognitive decline, dementia, Alzheimer\u2019s and the like,\u201d Gaesser said. \u201cIf you want a healthy brain, you need to have healthy muscle.\u201d",
      "Gaesser added, \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that the single best predictor of whether or not you\u2019re going to spend the last years of your life in a nursing home or assisted living is fitness.\u201d",
      "Strength training crucial for healthy weight loss",
      "In October, Michael Snyder turned 70, an age when muscle mass and strength are naturally in decline. He\u2019s also taking a GLP-1 medication to help maintain a healthy weight.",
      "As GLP-1 usage has surged in recent years, so too has awareness of the decline in muscle mass that can accompany significant weight loss, said Snyder, the Stanford W. Ascherman professor of genetics at the Stanford University School of Medicine, who wasn\u2019t part of the study.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re on [GLP-1s], you should be strength training,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cI lift weights every day.\u201d",
      "Dr. David D\u2019Alessio, chief of the division of endocrinology, metabolism and nutrition at the Duke University School of Medicine, stressed that muscle loss isn\u2019t unique to people taking GLP-1s.",
      "\u201cIf you lose weight by restricting calories \u2014 that is, going on a diet \u2014 or if you lose weight by bariatric surgery, or if you lose weight by taking Ozempic, you\u2019re going to lose some fat mass and some lean mass,\u201d said D\u2019Alessio, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be about 30% lean, 70% fat. About half of lean mass on these measures is muscle.\u201d",
      "Even for people who aren\u2019t trying to lose weight, strong muscles are necessary for a long, healthy life, Snyder said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a ton of interest in longevity these days,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cEverybody wants to live forever, and to do that, you\u2019re going to want to keep your mass up.\u201d"

      "Warning: This story contains spoilers for \"Wicked\" and \"Wicked: For Good.\"",
      "Marissa Bode first saw \"Wicked\" at the age of 12 after her mother surprised her with tickets to see the Broadway show.",
      "What she didn't know then was that merely a decade later, she'd find herself starring in the big-screen version opposite Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande in a blockbuster that smashed box office records after its release in 2024.",
      "\"I'm so grateful for this experience and \u2014 especially my first ever experience,\" Bode, 25, tells TODAY.com. \"I'm definitely grateful for that ... to be a part of something so big.\"",
      "\u201cWicked\u201d fans will likely remember that Bode\u2019s character, Nessarose, is born unable to walk because her mother ate too many milk flowers during her pregnancy out of fear of having another baby with green skin like Nessarose's maligned sister, Elphaba (Erivo).",
      "The show has been on Broadway since 2003, but, Bode is the first actor who uses a wheelchair to be cast in the role of Nessarose.",
      "In \"Wicked\" Part 1, Bode's character is full of youthful hope and in love with Boq (Ethan Slater), the Munchkin boy she falls for while at a dance at the Ozdust Ballroom, and whom she believes returns her affection.",
      "Fast forward to \"Wicked: For Good. Set one year later, Nessarose is Munchkinland's newest governor, a dark, controlling workaholic who learns Boq, her true love, has actually been pining for Glinda (Grande) the entire time.",
      "It's this betrayal that sets Nessarose up as one of the sequel's villains \u2014 a label Bode says is largely undeserved.",
      "\"I think Nessa is totally misunderstood. I think sometimes people can mix the bigger picture and just write her off as the villain or inherently evil,\" Bode says. \"But I think the point of the film is to really show that all of these characters really have so many layers.\"",
      "In \"Wicked: For Good,\" Nessarose transforms from a happy, young girl to an isolated, cold woman \u2014 a metamorphosis Bode calls \u201cdevastating.\u201d",
      "\u201cEven the whole dance scene, I think that hit close to home, because I do have other disabled friends where something similar has happened,\u201d Bode explains.",
      "\u201cWhere people are friends with them from a distance or they are asked out, but it\u2019s only for a photo op or something to make the other person feel good type of thing, rather than really caring about them and discarding them when they\u2019re no longer either useful or can benefit them,\u201d Bode says.",
      "Instead of being immoral, Nessarose is simply a product of her circumstances, Bode says.",
      "\"It's her just desperately wanting to hang on to the parts that she feels are good in her life. Wanting to really, so deeply, hold onto the moment of her at the dance, which was one of the happiest nights of her life really,\" she says of her character.",
      "\u201cThen when she finds out that all of it wasn\u2019t true and, in addition to being abandoned by her sister \u2014 or at least that\u2019s how she feels \u2014 and really having nobody left at the end of the day, I think there\u2019s moments of her being like, \u2018Well, I have nothing else to lose,\u2019\u201d she says.",
      "Nessarose and her estranged sister do briefly reunite after the ousted witch returns to Munchkinland seeking to drum up support for her campaign to restore animals' rights.",
      "After Nessarose confronts Elphaba for her perceived abandonment, she attempts to help Nessarose reunite with Boq. In the process, she makes Nessarose fly, restoring her child-like joy, if only for a brief moment.",
      "The pivotal scene is symbolic in more ways than one.",
      "\u201cI think with a song like \u2018Defying Gravity,\u2019 where one of the lyrics is, \u2018Everyone deserves a chance to fly,\u2019 to me, that\u2019s not just physically flying, it\u2019s also metaphorically and feeling like you\u2019re on top of the world or feeling like you do finally have control of your life in some way and flying on that high,\u201d Bode says.",
      "As for how that felt to film?",
      "\u201cI physically had fun flying in the air. What was most tricky for me was pretending like I wasn\u2019t,\u201d Bode recalls. \u201cI do laugh in it, but going from that and then bringing it back down after, I think was the trick for sure.\u201d",
      "But when she shows Boq that she can fly, he tells her she no longer needs him. He asks if he can leave and profess his love for Glinda.",
      "\"When Boq sees Nessa flying, there's a real clear connection between her and Elphaba in that way,\" Slater tells TODAY.com. \"I think, yes, it's magic, but it's also the kind of power that Elphaba has to fly. So I think that, in some ways, informs where the fear goes.\"",
      "Nessarose reacts by trying to force him to love her \u2014 through magic. She attempts to cast a love spell using Elphaba's Grimmerie, but it results in Boq's heart shrinking. To save his life, Elphaba turns him into the Tin Man of \"The Wizard of Oz\" lore.",
      "The physical transformation into the Tin Man took Slater up to five hours. But Slater suggests Boq remains more similar than different.",
      "\"I think it was really important to me that Boq, pre-transformation, is the same Boq, post-transformation. From his point of view, the world around him is changing, and he's just responding to it,\" Slater says.",
      "Nessarose and Boq both meet tragic fates in \"Wicked.\" Boq loses his humanity, while Nessa dies after Madame Morrible brings a tornado (yes, that tornado) to Oz, resulting in a house falling on her.",
      "But the characters' actors are looking to the future. Slater is set to star in the play \"Marcel on the Train,\" which opens on Broadway Feb. 22.",
      "Bode says she's grateful for the opportunity she's had to be part of something so epic, but at the same time, is ready to move on.",
      "\"I think I'm just someone that can't have the same scenery for too long,\" she explains. \"I love playing around and wearing a number of different hats, so I'm looking forward to the future.\""

      "JB: It was all prosthetics. There\u2019s no CGI, there\u2019s no special effects. It\u2019s an extraordinary thing to be in any sort of film that celebrates the creative arts in the way that (\u201cWicked\u201d) does and I think everyone\u2019s been able to flex years of craft.",
      "It was four-and-a-half hours every morning. It was Mark (Coulier), who\u2019s an extraordinary designer, who came up with this burlap texture and it was the first conversation I had with Frances (Hannon), to think about where the literal transformation ends.",
      "There's so much that we sort of explored, the physicality, obviously with a nod to Ray Bolger (the original Scarecrow in \"The Wizard of Oz\").",
      "There's footage of a camera test which made me ... I kind of started crying because it was so reminiscent of \"The Wizard of Oz,\" and it was me and Ethan (Slater) as the Tin Man and Bethany Weaver as Dorothy.",
      "They had a chalk slate and we just walked up and down the yellow brick road and we were just exploring the characters. That was almost one of my highlights, actually.",
      "JG: I'd like to see that. There are many things about the ending that intrigue me now. What's the nothingness like? What happens to them? You know, Boq, that's very interesting and savage, his whole thing, it fascinates me. But the two ladies, our main story, wooooow!",
      "JB: The Grimmerie really comes alive.",
      "JG: And does Elphaba now not have the powers that she did with the Grimmerie? And why couldn't she have trusted (Glinda) perhaps? There's a lovely line, \"I have to be wicked so you can be good.\" Glinda is amazing, why couldn't (Elphaba) trust that, \"Hey, we're going to be OK. Don't try to contact us, etc., etc.. Don't tell anybody that we faked it.\"",
      "Or, or is the loss that Glinda experiences the portal, the thing that triggers her power, her ability to go through that loss of the greatest love that she's ever had, really, with Elphaba? Does that trigger her ability to that power?",
      "JB: I think what's going to happen is \"Dune\" Part 3 is coming out in cinemas next year, and I think Fiyero and Elphaba are just going to walk into the shot ...",
      "JG: (Both laughing) And you'll go, \"People ... \"",
      "JB: \"Timmy?",
      "JG: \"Timothee Chalamet?\"",
      "JB: I think the answers always lie in the Grimmerie.",
      "I do think it's particularly thrilling to see the Grimmerie come alive and for someone \u2014 Ariana (Grande) charts so brilliantly \u2014 is that the absolute knowledge that (Glinda) has no magic and she no power. To see the Grimmerie come alive, feels to me, like a transference and a conversation between the two women.",
      "JG: Certainly, Elphaba telepathically kind of does that as they commune with each other across the space.",
      "Does Glinda? ... Good question. Does Glinda go, \"I don't think I did that. Are you out there somewhere?\" Maybe it's meant to be ambiguous. Ask Jon M. Chu this question because every moment means something and he, I'm sure, intends and has excavated all the logic behind all of that.",
      "JB: As we know with grief, as well, is that these people do always exist in a different form, don't they? So, in a metaphysical sense, they are still living on together.",
      "JG: Yes, you've changed me for good, meaning both those things, of course, forever.",
      "JB: There's so much hope and optimism in this story and that lies with seeing other sides and being curious about other perspectives. And what a time to be celebrating that idea.",
      "JG: Empathy. Empathy. A valuable commodity, now more than ever. If this movie isn't a machinery for the spread of empathy, I don't know what is.",
      "JB: And it just takes one person. It can be one act of kindness. It can have a ripple effect and one intentional act of radicalism that can inspire and shift.",
      "JG: The pebble in the lake and the spreading rings."

    "link": "https://www.today.com/popculture/movies/michelle-yeoh-madame-morrible-wicked-for-good-rcna244379",
    "published": "Sat, 22 Nov 2025 20:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Oscar-winning actor, Michelle Yeoh, talks \"Wicked: For Good,\" what it took to transform into Madame Morrible and the \"sisterhood\" she shares with her co-stars.",
    "story": [
      "Warning: Spoilers ahead for \"Wicked\" and \"Wicked: For Good.\"",
      "According to Michelle Yeoh, the real witches in \"Wicked\" aren't the ones you immediately think of. And she'd know, because she's one of them.",
      "\"There were only two witches in the Land of Oz,\" Yeoh tells TODAY.com in a sit-down interview. \"It was Madame Morrible and Elphaba.\"",
      "That may come as a surprise to fans of the \"Wizard of Oz\" who think that when it comes to \"Wicked's\" witches, that distinction belongs to the Wicked Witch of the West, Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo), and Glinda the Good Witch (Ariana Grande).",
      "But to know the musical is to remember that the only two people with any sort of magical ability in Oz are, in fact, Elphaba and Morrible, not Glinda and definitely not The Wizard.",
      "That's why Yeoh says her character, Madame Morrible, initially aligns herself with Elphaba, before ultimately becoming her biggest adversary.",
      "\"She didn't have quite the gift and talent as Elphaba did. But at that moment, she thought, 'I found my muse. I couldn't do it, but now I have someone who can help me get to where I think it's for the goodness of Oz,'\" explains Yeoh of Madame Morrible's less-than-honorable intentions for the young sorcerer.",
      "If that's not enough to convince you that Morrible is the true wicked witch of the story, consider her initials: \"MM.\" Turn them upside down and what have you got? \"WW,\" which stands for \u2014 you guessed it \u2014\u00a0Wicked Witch.",
      "Without revealing too much, it's safe to say that Madame Morrible gets the ending she deserves in \"Wicked: For Good.\" Even so, it's hard not to wonder if, in spite of her malicious intent, there's anything redeeming about the character.",
      "\"I think the lesson to be learned here is don't get corrupted by your own desires and ambition,\" says Yeoh. \"Because (Madame Morrible) forgot about compassion and kindness, which is something she had right at the beginning. And then she got lost in her own tempest.\"",
      "Bringing the 'Scary' to Madame Morrible",
      "Fresh off the heels of her Oscar win for \"Everything Everywhere All At Once\" in 2023, Yeoh stepped into the shoes of the \"Wicked\" character. To portray Madame Morrible, Yeoh says she drew on past experience to give Shiz\u2019s imposing headmistress her commanding presence.",
      "\"I think everything that I've done, especially in the physicality of my life, whether ... from ballet, to contemporary dance, to sports, to diving, to all these kind of things, helped me focus the stillness rather than the chaotic movement.\"",
      "Instead of playing Morrible as an over-the-top villain, Yeoh says she took a more subtle approach and worked at curating Morrible's icy but alluring appeal.",
      "\"This is how she would command respect and awe. It's like, how does she charm them? She draws them in,\" explains Yeoh. \"That's the most scary of all \u2014 when they're charming and personable and they listen to you and it seems like you're the only one in her world.\"",
      "\"With Madame Morrible, this was an art form that she needed to have to have that gravitas,\" she continues.",
      "Morrible's high-collared costumes and elaborate up-dos also contributed to her intimidating stature, Yeoh says.",
      "\"It was the combination of everything that helped me build Madame Morrible to when she walks out, you go back and go, 'Alright, not going to mess with you!'\"",
      "It's not the first time Yeoh has used her inner stillness to bring a character to life. She says she also channeled it for her work in  \"Memoirs of a Geisha\" and the hit 2018 rom-com, \"Crazy Rich Asians,\" which was also directed by Jon M. Chu.",
      "\"The mother, Mrs. Eleanor Young, is also a very commanding figure without being loud, she never raises her voice, but when she speaks with her tone, every gesture is measured with intention. It's not frivolous. It's nothing like that,\" Yeoh says.",
      "\"So, when she stops to look at you, you go, \"Okayyyy,\" she adds.",
      "Forging a Sisterhood",
      "Based on the 1995 Gregory Maguire book, \"Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West,\" bringing the films \"Wicked\" and \"Wicked: For Good\" to the big screen has been a decades-long endeavor that began back in the early 2000s.",
      "Yeoh joined the cast in 2022 and filmed the original and sequel simultaneously along with the rest of the cast, including Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo.",
      "\"You will miss (them), because at the end of the day, you've built up such a great bond and it's a family,\" says Yeoh, who explains that while goodbyes can be hard, they're also an inevitable part of the business.",
      "\"This is how it is, but the good news is if you really bonded, they'll always be there. I'm still in touch with Jamie Lee Curtis, and it's been so many years. And 'Crazy Rich Asians,' we still have a group chat,\" she says.",
      "As for Grande and Erivo, Yeoh says that even though the films are done, what she takes away from her co-stars is a lasting sisterhood.",
      "\"We champion each other. We believe in each other. We support each other. No questions asked, let's just go forward, up and above, let's just do it together,\" Yeoh says.",
      "\"And when we're not with each other, we don't forget that will always have the bond.\""

      "\u201cIt\u2019s this extraordinary anthem, and it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Fox says. \u201cThe animals don\u2019t stay because she can\u2019t convince them, and the truth is they\u2019re probably right to leave.

      "\u201cPart of deconstructing the fairy tale \u2014 which is sort of the point of \u2018Wicked,\u2019 to see this American fairytale in a new way, through a new perspective \u2014 part of that was understanding not just what what Elphaba was going through, but also what it means for somebody in a bubble of privilege when the truth is coming out,\u201d Chu says.",
      "\u201cAt what point does someone who doesn\u2019t have to be affected by this, what kind of courage does it take to actually pop your own bubble and engage and help somebody else? I think that that\u2019s such an important lesson in these days, that courage \u2014 no matter where you missed the moment \u2014 courage has no expiration date, and that we still have time to be the people who we see ourselves as,\u201d he adds.",
      "She ultimately chooses to go to Elphaba\u2019s side. The best friends briefly reconcile with \u201cFor Good\u201d before Elphaba fakes her own death. After escaping, Glinda returns to the Emerald City, forces the departure of the Wizard, arrests Madame Morrible and takes over as a leader of Oz.",
      "And in a slight expansion from the musical, we see exactly what she does with that newfound power: Free the animals.",
      "The Grimmerie Opens for Glinda",
      "Finally, the very end of \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d introduces a scene that is meant to spark discourse. As Elphaba and Fiyero escape to the Lands Beyond Oz, Glinda looks out over the Emerald City. The magic book, the Grimmerie, which Elphaba entrusted to her before her \u201cdeath,\u201d suddenly comes alive and opens beside Glinda.",
      "There are theories about what the Grimmerie\u2019s opening means, even among the cast and crew. Some think it represents Glinda finally having the potential to be a true witch, while others say it\u2019s a message from Elphaba to Glinda.",
      "\u201cWhat I think is great about this book of knowledge, the Grimmerie, I mean, it can be interpreted as many things,\u201d Chu says."

      "Throughout the film, Glinda's ability to trust the Wizard and Madame Morrible is tested. After her fianc\u00e9, Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey), and Elphaba run away together on Glinda's wedding day, she helps draw Elphaba out of hiding by targeting her sister, Nessarose (Marissa Bode).",

      "\"The idea of 'The Girl in the Bubble' is really interesting because it could feel like a person talking about how they feel, or it could feel like a person making a decision,\" Fox says. \"Where we had to make sure it landed was somewhere where it felt like it was motivating her to do something different, instead of just, 'Oh I'm sad I'm the girl in the bubble.'\"",

Glinda escapes on horseback, shrouded in a black cape. (Yes, Glinda was the mysterious figure we saw escaping a castle in the very first scene of the first \u201cWicked\u201d movie.) She goes on to assume power in Oz as she mourns her best friend\u2019s death.",
      "Only Elphaba isn\u2019t dead. She\u2019s hiding in a trapdoor, waiting for her beloved Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey) to meet her before they leave for the Land Beyond Oz together.",
      "From there, viewers get a bit of a twist before the movie concludes. Here\u2019s what happens.",
      "How \u2018Wicked: For Good\u2019 Ends",
      "The stage version of \u201cWicked\u201d ends with Elphaba and Fiyero leaving Oz, and Glinda stepping into a position of power.",
      "But in \u201cWicked: For Good,\u201d viewers see what happens to Glinda after she becomes Oz\u2019s leader. First, she officially declares the land welcome to all animals again.",
      "In the final scene, Glinda looks over the Emerald City as Elphaba and Fiyero trek through a desert to leave Oz. Elphaba looks back for a brief moment. Then Elphaba\u2019s book of spells, the Grimmerie, flutters to life before Glinda\u2019s eyes. Elphaba had given the book to Glinda before Elphaba\u2019s encounter with Dorothy.",
      "As established in the first film, the Grimmerie only opens for and can be read by a true witch, something that, as much as she tried \u2014  whether through begging Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh) for sorcery lessons or twirling her practice wand \u2014 Glinda decidedly was not.",
      "So what does the Grimmerie opening mean?",
      "We asked the team behind \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d for their takes on the final scene. See what director Jon M. Chu and stars Cynthia Erivo, Jeff Goldblum and Jonathan Bailey had to say.",
      "How \u2018Wicked: For Good\u2019 Stars Interpret the Ending",
      "Chu declines to say \u201cexactly what (the ending) is\u201d by his intention.",
      "But he points to all the different interpretations of what the Grimmerie, \u201ca book of knowledge,\u201d could be, relative to both Glinda and Elphaba.",
      "\u201cWhether (Glinda) finally gets to be who she\u2019s meant to be, that she\u2019s not reliant on this image in this mirror,\u201d Chu says. \u201cShe didn\u2019t say, \u2018I\u2019m going to be good.\u2019 She says, \u2018I\u2019m going to try to be good.\u2019",
      "\u201cJust the effort of trying to be who we\u2019re supposed to be opens and unlocks our unlimited possibilities,\u201d he adds.",
      "The spontaneous opening of the Grimmerie could also relate to the film\u2019s theme of pursuing the truth amid propaganda. By the end of the film, Elphaba\u2019s reputation as the Wicked Witch of the West as told in \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d is upended by political lies told by the nonmagical Wizard of Oz and, as actor Michelle Yeoh says, the true wicked witch, Madame Morrible. But while viewers know the truth, in the world of the movie, Ozians do not, after Elphaba tells Glinda not to clear her name.",
      "\u201cIt could also be, Cynthia could be Jesus giving us, the humans, this Bible and saying, you know the truth, now what are you going to do with it?\u201d Chu says.",
      "\u201cI think it is a challenge to us as the audience, whereas maybe movie one was more of an answer. This is more a question and challenge for us to see how we\u2019re going to tell our story to the next generation,\u201d he adds.",
      "Erivo says Elphaba leaving the Grimmerie behind represents her entrusting it to Glinda.",
      "\u201cI think Elphaba\u2019s powers exist independent of the Grimmerie, and because she has certain powers, she\u2019s able to read the Grimmerie. It\u2019s like she and Grimmerie have an intrinsic relationship, and so the Grimmerie answers to her,\u201d she explains.",
      "\u201cBut her leaving it behind and trusting it to Glinda essentially tells the Grimmerie, \u2018You\u2019re in new hands, trust this person,\u2019\u201d she adds.",
      "But that doesn\u2019t mean Elphaba\u2019s lost her connection with the book. She says she believes Elphaba in fact can see the Grimmerie opening for Glinda.",
      "\u201cShe has visions, so I think she can see what happens, and she can feel it. And it opening means to her that, one, Glinda\u2019s made the right decision, and two, the Grimmerie trusts Glinda now, so everything\u2019s going to be fine,\u201d she says.",
      "But does Glinda know Elphaba is watching over her?",
      "\u201cI think she\u2019s aware that Elphaba has something to do with it (opening), but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s aware that Elphaba\u2019s alive,\u201d Erivo says.",
      "As for Goldblum, who stars as the Wizard of Oz, he is curious what leaving the Grimmerie behind means for Elphaba\u2019s powers. He also wonders: Why couldn\u2019t Elphaba trust Glinda with the knowledge that they survived?",
      "\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t she trust that, \u2018Hey we\u2019re going to be OK, don\u2019t try to contact us ... Don\u2019t tell anybody that we faked it.\u2019 I don\u2019t know,\u201d Goldblum says. \u201cOr, is the loss that (Glinda) experiences the portal, the thing that triggers her power. Her ability to go through that loss of the greatest love that she\u2019s ever had with Elphaba, does that trigger her ability to power?\u201d",
      "As for the opening of the Grimmerie, Goldblum says it\u2019s possible for Elphaba to \u201ctelepathically\u201d \u201ccommune\u201d with Glinda across space.",
      "\u201cDoes Glinda go, \u2018I don\u2019t think I did that. Are you out there somewhere. Are you OK?\u2019\u201d he adds. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s meant to be ambiguous.\u201d",
      "Like Goldblum, Bailey believes there\u2019s a chance the opening of the Grimmerie was Elphaba sending Glinda a message.",
      "\u201cI think that the answers always lie in the Grimmerie, and I do think it\u2019s particularly thrilling to see the Grimmerie come alive for someone ... (with) the absolute knowledge that she has no magic and that she has no power,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cTo see the Grimmerie come alive feels to me like a transference and a conversation between the two women.\u201d",
      "He believes this, even if it\u2019s not so literal of a conversation or message.",
      "\u201cAs we know with grief as well, those people do always exist in a different form, don\u2019t they? In a metaphysical sense, they are still living on together,\u201d he adds.",
      "Holzman, who wrote the book for \u201cWicked\u201d and co-wrote the screenplays for both films with writer Dana Fox, says the goal for the ending was to create a \u201cmystical moment.\u201d",
      "\u201cWith something mystical, it\u2019s not like the whole point is you know the answer, it\u2019s that it pulls something out of you, like a spiritual feeling,\u201d she says.",
      "One interpretation of the Grimmerie opening, Holzman says, has to do with the evolution of Glinda\u2019s character.",
      "\u201cShe was willing to let go ... of all the need to be admired in this empty way. And she was willing to be humble, to be a student, to say, \u2018I don\u2019t know everything,\u2019\u201d Holzman says.",
      "Fox adds that the moment Glinda \u201cearns\u201d the Grimmerie opening is when she admits her \u201cdeepest shame\u201d to Elphaba: that she can\u2019t read the Grimmerie and perform spells.",
      "\u201cShe wanted so much to be that magical creature who could make magic happen, and she\u2019s going to end up being that, but it\u2019s going to take hard work,\u201d Holzman says. \u201cAnd to me, the Grimmerie opening is like the Grimmerie saying, \u2018OK, you\u2019re ready.\u2019\u201d",
      "But the question remains: Does Elphaba know?",
      "\u201cI think the thing that really is up to interpretation that everyone should just talk about amongst themselves is, Does Elphaba know? Did she have anything to do with it? I think that is something that just everyone should decide for themselves,\u201d Fox says."

      "Jelly Roll has debuted a new look that even shocked himself while reacting to a recent milestone moment: receiving three nominations at the upcoming 2026 Grammys.",
      "On Nov. 20, the 40-year-old musician uploaded a vlog to YouTube, marking his \u201clong overdue\u201d comeback to the video style that he used during the early days of his career. The 15-minute clip began with footage of him on his Nashville farm and ended with Jelly Roll deciding to shave his beard for the first time in over a decade.",
      "He shared that he wanted to shave his beard as he continues his weight loss journey.",
      "\u201cAt this point, I\u2019m sure some of y\u2019all are exhausted about hearing about my weight loss. But a lot of things change when you start losing weight. You realize things. One of the things I realized is I don\u2019t know what I look like. I\u2019ve had a beard to try to cover up my double chin,\u201d he said.",
      "Jelly Roll added, \u201cThe last time my face was shaved I was fresh out of jail.\u201d",
      "He predicted that he might resemble a Ninja Turtle after shaving his facial hair, but said he wanted to go through with it so he could surprise his family with his new appearance. He shared that he only told his wife, Bunnie XO, about his plans to shave his beard and that his daughter, Bailee Ann, had never seen him without it.",
      "The \u201cGet By\u201d singer used timelapse editing to show him slowly removing his beard as his wife looked on and filmed the moment on her phone. About halfway through the process, he turned to Bunnie XO, who appeared stunned.",
      "\u201cOh my gosh,\u201d she said as he laughed. She later gave her stamp of approval when he finished, telling her husband, \u201cI love it.\u201d",
      "He blurred out his face in the shot, saving the reveal for the last minutes of the video. Before he debuted his look to his fans, he showed off his clean-shaven face to his daughter, who instantly responded with laughter.",
      "\u201cStay over there!\u201d she playfully told her dad. \u201cOh my gosh, I\u2019m going to cry. I don\u2019t like this! You look like a turtle.\u201d",

      "\u201cBy now, you have probably figured out that I look like a Ninja Turtle,\u201d he joked while strolling through a wooded area. \u201cYeah, this was crazy.\u201d",
      "Taking a more sentimental tone, he continued, \u201cYou know, one of the reasons I\u2019d even started growing a beard was because I was so obese, it was just easier to cover up what was happening here.\u201d",
      "He then went on to talk about \u201cthe craziest thing\u201d that has ever happened to him: his latest Grammy nominations. When the Recording Academy announced the list of nominees for the 2026 Grammys on Nov. 6, Jelly Roll was one of the many stars who received the coveted recognition. He was nominated for best contemporary country album for \u201cBeautifully Broken,\u201d best country duo/group performance for his collaboration with Shaboozey called \u201cAmen\u201d and best contemporary Christian music performance/song for \u201cHard Fought Hallelujah.\u201d",
      "In his vlog, Jelly Roll recalled receiving his first Grammy nomination at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards in 2024 for best new artist. He said that at the time he never imagined he would be recognized by the Recording Academy again.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t care what artists say. I don\u2019t care what artists act like. I\u2019m going to tell you the real truth. There\u2019s not an artist in the world that didn\u2019t grow up watching the Grammys when they were a kid and walk in their bedrooms afterwards and rehearse their speech,\u201d he said. \u201cGod will take something that\u2019s either normal and make it extremely abnormal or he will take something that\u2019s already incredible and make it absolutely mesmerizing, and that\u2019s the case here.\u201d",
      "He said that now he gets to celebrate this achievement while in \u201cthe best headspace.\u201d",
      "\u201cI see all my friends in this category. But then I just see standing there is this album called \u2018Beautifully Broken,\u2019\u201d he added. \u201cMan, if that doesn\u2019t represent what\u2019s happening in the world right now. I think more than ever\u2026 I think we can find beauty in what\u2019s happening. Win, lose or draw. Holy f---, dude, we won.\u201d",
      "He expressed his gratitude again to the Record Academy and said he wouldn\u2019t have accomplished anything without his faith.",
      "Before signing off, he encouraged his fans to mock his beardless face.",
      "\u201cI thought my chin went at least a half inch further than it actually went, f---. I didn\u2019t know. Failed science experiment, y\u2019all!\u201d he said.",
      "Jelly Roll uploaded the snippet of his newly shaven face to Instagram, too. Celebrity friends complimented him about his Grammy nominations beneath the post.",
      "Charlie Puth said, \u201cVery inspiring man.\u201d",
      "Country singer Carly Pearce echoed that sentiment, calling Jelly Roll \u201can inspiration.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, fans gave their approval of his look.",
      "\u201cFresh fit and clean faced,\u201d one fan commented.",
      "Another said, \u201cShut up I love it!!! You look so good!!!!!\u201d",
      "\u201cHey i love ninja turtles,\u201d a third wrote.",
      "This is the latest dramatic transformation Jelly Roll has shared with his fans. Over the past year, he has also opened up repeatedly about losing weight.",
      "While appearing on \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d in April, he said his goal was to be under 250 pounds before explaining why losing weight is important to him.",
      "\u201cTo do all the fun stuff in life, you\u2019ve gotta be under 250,\u201d he told host Jimmy Kimmel before mentioning skydiving, riding a rollercoaster, riding a bull and wrestling an alligator. \u201cI\u2019ve got a list of things I want to do.\u201d",
      "He gave a progress update in August while giving a speech to the Tennessee Titans. \u201cI lost 200 pounds,\u201d he said. \u201cI told coach I\u2019m getting a contract if I lose another 50.\u201d"

      "How it went: Over the course of eight weeks, the newlyweds encountered several highs and lows. They experienced trust issues when Josh claimed that he had unfollowed his ex-girlfriend on social media, but later revealed that he hadn't.",
      "The couple learned that they had a few key personality differences when Josh expressed how passionate he was about attending music festivals, namely Burning Man. Jalyn didn't share the same interest and wasn't sure that she'd feel comfortable attending the event. Josh was concerned that he would lose the sense of community he finds at Burning Man if his wife didn't support his passion.",
      "How it ended in the season finale: Going into decision day, Josh was feeling \u201cextremely thankful\u201d about his experience with Jalyn.",

      "Josh acknowledged that he envisioned \"a great future\" with his wife and said decision day would \"take a part of me with it\" if Jalyn decided against continuing their marriage.",
      "Meanwhile, Jalyn opened up about her \"biggest reservations\" as she prepared for decision day, saying she and Josh are \"different people\" who are \"in two different lanes in a lot of ways.\"",
      "\"I feel like this is make or break for me. I think in the past anytime I saw a red flag, I ended the relationship but now I'm married and I don't know what you work through and what you don't. But I hope to feel confident and secure in my decision,\" she said.",
      "When decision time arrived, Both Jalyn and Josh decided to stay married and expressed confidence in the way they had addressed obstacles in their relationship so far.",

      "How it ended in the season finale: On decision day, Derrek noted that Meghann's pregnancy added \"a whole other element\" to the experiment. Still, he was feeling confident going into the discussion.",
      "On her way to filming, Meghann reflected on the moment, saying, \"We have a lot of things that are gonna hit us, a lot of new things in the future that we're gonna have to figure out. And we need to really work through this.\"",
      "While sitting down with the relationship experts, the couple announced their pregnancy. When the big moment arrived, Derrek went first and shared his decision.",
      "\"You are extremely caring and compassionate and without any hesitation, 100% I want to stay married to you. I love you and I love your sense of humor.

      "\"There's never a good time to do it. It's always going to be hard. I knew that this wasn't the right person for me. I had to be true to myself and be true to Meghann,\" Derrek said.",
      "Meghann offered her take on the breakup, saying, \"When he broke up with me, something in my head changed and I couldn't remember anything good from our relationship. I just remembered all the bad. And then I watched (the show) and then I remembered all the good and that was hard.\"",

      "Rhonda and Pat",
      "How it started: It didn't take long for chemistry to spark between Rhonda and Pat on their wedding day. The couple had plenty of fun at their reception and even jumped in the pool together. It was soon apparent that their fun-loving personalities were a good match.",
      "How it went: Once they started diving deeper in their relationship, Rhonda and Pat hit a few roadblocks. Rhonda told her husband she didn't feel like he was interested in hearing about her life since he regularly made the conversation about him. He was taken aback and tried to remedy the situation.",
      "Still, it was a consistent theme throughout the eight-week experiment for the newlyweds.",
      "How it ended in the season finale: While preparing to make his decision Pat admitted that he was feeling \"conflicted.\"",

      "\"It's been hard but also it's been everything I think I could have ever hoped for,\" she said.",
      "When it came time to share their decisions, Rhonda said she suspected that Pat didn't want to stay married based on his closed off body language. He then explained that he ignored red flags in his first marriage and didn't want to do that this time around.",
      "\"I do not trust that I will be seen and heard as my authentic self,\" he said.",
      "Rhonda wasn't sure what he meant, so Pat explained that he had struggled hearing her repeatedly allege he didn't care about her.",
      "The relationship experts on hand encouraged the couple to talk through their issues. Rhonda apologized to Pat but said her emotional needs hadn't been met.",
      "\"I just think I've been really, really frustrated with you and my frustration pushes you away. And that's not my intention. I'm struggling on how to deal with it. So I would (like to) apologize for making you feel like I'm pushing you away,\" she said.",
      "Pat thanked his wife and said he went into the discussion not wanting to move forward, but was now thinking he may be \"being too rigid.\"",
      "Ultimately, Pat decided he wanted to continue to work on their marriage. Rhonda said she didn't feel \"as open or hopeful\" as she did going into the discussion, but wasn't ready to give up on their relationship.",
      "Are they still together? No. During the reunion, Rhonda said she and Pat stayed together for nine months after decision day. At that point, Pat went to Europe for a month on his own. He did invite her to go, but she'd already taken a lot of time off from work and decided to stay home.",
      "When Pat returned home, Rhonda said she was \"on cloud nine\" for a period of 10 days. One day, she saw him listening to a meditation about anger and asked if he was angry that they hadn't slept together since he got home. He was, and at dinner that night he told Rhonda he was done with their relationship.",
      "During the reunion, Pat said he'd felt that way \"for quite some time.\" Rhonda then explained that he was \"very insecure\" and said \"that insecurity was a complete turnoff romantically.\"",
      "Rhonda suggested that Pat only wanted a wife, and not necessarily her, adding that he wanted physical intimacy that would turn into a romantic connection. However, she wanted a connection and said intimacy would be the icing on the cake.",
      "Belynda and Chad",
      "How it started: When Belynda and Chad got married, it was a slow burn at first. However, they both seemed committed to exploring their connection and shared some sweet moments as they got to know each other.",
      "How it went: Chad repeatedly expressed frustration with Belynda's dog sleeping in their bed throughout the experiment. He also grew tired of the filming schedule and said \"I don't give a f--- about this show\" during one heated moment. Still, the couple's connection grew over time.",
      "Before decision day, Belynda said she was doubtful that she'd want to stay married based on Chad's recent aggressive behavior.",
      "How it ended in the season finale: Belynda described her husband as \"kind, funny and sweet\" on decision day but admitted that her marriage had been \"a little exhausting at times.\"",
      "\u201cI just don\u2019t want to lose my voice. I can\u2019t lose myself in a marriage and I feel like I need to remember that I\u2019m also there and that I also matter,\u201d she said.",
      "In a confessional interview, Chad said he wanted to be with his wife and couldn't \"imagine my life without Belynda.\"",
      "He also acknowledged that he had \"hurt\" his wife at times with his impatience and said he needed \"to find healthier ways to burn off some steam.\"",
      "When the moment to make a decision arrived, Chad went first, saying, \"I genuinely care about you and I believe you care about me. And I don't think there's anything we can't figure out as long as (we keep that in mind).\"",
      "Chad said he was willing to do \"whatever it takes\" to make their marriage work and asked if Belynda was willing to stay together.",
      "\"I mean, I think if anything, if I had a reason to walk away it would just be because we weren't working on it the way we committed and said we were going to. But I know that if we're working on it, we can get through it, so yes, I will stay married to you,\" she replied.",
      "Are they still together? No. During the reunion special, Belynda and Chad announced that they were no longer married.",
      "They both recalled an incident with his cat and her dog after they returned home from decision day, saying Chad was triggered by the animals' behavior and his anxiety came out as he began to yell at Belynda, saying her dog wasn't trained.",
      "Belynda said the incident reminded her of a prior marriage when her ex-husband would yell. She decided to grab her things and left with the dog.",

      "\"I think that throughout this, her not thinking I'm trying, her not thinking that I'm doing anything, her not feeling anything from what I'm doing, that was the theme,\" he said.",

      "\"Yes, I do want to be with you and I do want to continue this and I want to learn with you,\" he said.",
      "Are they still together? No. During the reunion, Brittany revealed that she and Will hadn't spoken together since the show ended. She recalled how he went away for work for a week after the finale then ended things when he returned.",
      "Will shared his side of the story, saying he did \"adore\" Brittany and decided to stay with her in the heat of the moment since he didn't want to see her sad. However, she said she \"had an inkling\" that they would break up when he returned home."

      "Colleen Hoover says the legal saga involving \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d stars Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni has been tough for her to process.",
      "Hoover is the author of the 2016 book that was the basis for the 2024 film of the same name. The movie has been tainted with controversy since late last year, when Lively filed a lawsuit against Baldoni, in which she accuses him of sexual harassment on the set, as well as creating a smear campaign against her. Baldoni\u2019s $400 million countersuit against Lively and a defamation suit he filed against The New York Times was dismissed in June.",
      "The legal issues have cast a shadow over the movie, while Hoover told Elle magazine in a Nov. 20 article that the matter is \u201cunfortunate\u201d and \u201cdisappointing.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt feels like a circus,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen there are real people involved, with real feelings and emotions. This actually truly has impacted some of the actors\u2019 careers in huge ways. And I just find it all around sad.\u201d",

      "\u201cI\u2019m just trying to stay removed from the negativity. I have my own story I could tell \u2026 but I don\u2019t want to bring attention to it, and I don\u2019t want to have to put someone else down to lift myself up. So I\u2019d rather just ignore it and let people think and say what they\u2019re going to say,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cI feel like it\u2019s so big at this point that there\u2019s nothing anyone can say to change whatever opinion people have of it, even though no one has the actual truth. Not even me.\u201d",
      "A New York judge on Oct. 31 formally ended Baldoni\u2019s countersuit against Lively and the Times when Baldoni and his legal team missed a deadline to file an amended complaint. Attorneys for Lively and Baldoni did not respond to a request for comment from NBC News at the time.",
      "Lively\u2019s lawsuit against Baldoni goes to trial in March 2026.",
      "\u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d centers on florist Lily Bloom (Lively), whose relationship with neurosurgeon Ryle Kincaid (Baldoni, who also directed the film) unfurls into domestic violence, following a pattern of abuse Lily witnessed by her father toward her mother.",
      "The basis of \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d was drawn from Hoover\u2019s mother\u2019s own experience. The author says the controversy takes away from what she has had to endure.",
      "\u201cThe book was inspired by her story, and now it gives us PTSD to think about it,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel awful because I almost feel like she\u2019s gone through more with the aftermath of this film, more pain than she went through with my dad, just seeing the ugliness of it.\u201d",
      "The legal matter between Lively and Baldoni has also changed how Hoover feels about the book.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t even recommend it anymore. I feel like (the lawsuit) has overshadowed it,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m almost embarrassed to say I wrote it. When people ask what I do, I\u2019m just like, \u2018I\u2019m a writer. Please don\u2019t ask me what I wrote.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cThe more time that passes, the easier everything gets for all of us,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut it is sad, because I was very proud of that book. And I\u2019m still proud of it, but less publicly so. Maybe I need therapy, I don\u2019t know.\u201d"

      "Created by Mike Shur and based the 2020 Chilean documentary \u201cThe Mole Agent,\u201d the Netflix comedic mystery \"Man on the Inside\" follows Charles Nieuwendyk (Ted Danson), an engineering professor who turns to solving mysteries.",

Catching a man having an affair might be interesting the first time around, but after the ninth, Charles is ready to never encounter a cheating man again. That\u2019s why, when he hears about Berenger\u2019s case, he jumps at the chance to go undercover.",
      "As soon as Charles steps foot on the campus of Wheeler College, he assembles a long list of possible suspects, all of whom have a reason to detest the billionaire graduate who is known for flying his dog on a private jet every day from San Francisco to Aspen.",

      "One theme that Shur wanted to examine in \u201cA Man on the Inside\u201d was the need for connection and how the dynamic relationship between adult children and their aging parents evolve over time.",

      "\u201cThey loved each other and were close, but drifted apart because of a tragedy that happened,\u201d Shur tells TODAY.com. Over the course of the first season, Charles learned how to communicate his shared grief with Emily.",
      "That same theme of familial reconciliation can be seen with Julie and her mother. Because Julie never discussed her personal life with Charles, Shur described how this new season was a chance for viewers to get to know Julie and her past.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a reason this woman is a private investigator,\u201d Shur says. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason that she\u2019s so guarded and mistrustful of people \u2014 almost borderline paranoid. We thought, \u2018What if the story is her mom was a con artist and was arrested when she was a kid?\u2019 That explains a lot about that character. But then what if that woman is still in her life in a very tangential way? It was a wonderful story to tell about making amends with a parent.\u201d",

      "\u201cI did a prenuvo scan and they called me today and they\u2019re like, \u2018Everything looks great, but you have an aneurysm in your brain,\u2019 and they\u2019re like, \u2018It\u2019s been there for years.\u2019 It was here two years ago,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "According to Mayo Clinic, an aneurysm is \u201ca bulge or ballooning in the wall of a blood vessel\u201d and can form in several parts of the body. A ruptured aneurysm can cause bleeding inside the body, which can result in death, according to the Mayo Clinic.",
      "While talking to her sister, Kardashian said that doctors told her that an aneurysm can be ruptured by stress. The Skims founder explained that she\u2019s been under a lot of it lately studying for the bar exam and has developed hives because of it.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m definitely worried about Kim. She has so much going on between work and her four kids that I don\u2019t want her to have an aneurysm, of course,\u201d Kardashian Barker said in a confessional.",

      "\u201cI just look at things differently. I love that my kids see me go to school,\u201d she said in a confessional. \u201cWhen I drop them off at school, they see me go to school. I enjoy that. It\u2019s like I love educating myself. I just wouldn\u2019t feel like myself if I wasn\u2019t learning and trying new things. That\u2019s just what I like to do. We\u2019re all totally different.\u201d",

      "There were no specific details released. European leaders expressed optimism but cautioned that \"major issues\" remained as Kyiv and its allies sought to navigate the U.S. ultimatum to accept the 28-point proposal they view as handing the Kremlin its key demands.",
      "Moscow continued to suggest it had been shut out of the discussions, and it was unclear whether any counterproposals from Ukraine would be acceptable to Russia.",
      "President Donald Trump also weighed in. \"Is it really possible that big progress is being made in Peace Talks between Russia and Ukraine??? Don\u2019t believe it until you see it, but something good just may be happening,\" he said in a post on Truth Social early Monday.",
      "The Ukrainian delegation was on its way home to report back on the progress made, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. \u201cBased on these reports, we will determine the next steps and the timing,\u201d he added.",
      "Speaking earlier by video link at a summit in Sweden, Zelenskyy said that Kyiv was working with partners \"to look for compromises that strengthen, but not weaken us.\"",

      "\u201cWhile work remains to be done, there is now a solid basis for moving forward,\u201d European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement following the meeting.",
      "A German government spokesperson said Berlin saw the progress made in Geneva \u201cvery positively,\u201d according to Reuters.",
      "The plan backed by Trump amounts to Ukraine's effective capitulation, ceding key territories to Russia while reducing its military in return for no major concessions from Moscow.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin wants legal recognition for what he has \u201cstolen,\u201d Zelenskyy said Monday in reference to the plan\u2019s provision for the entire eastern Donbas region, as well as Crimea, annexed in 2014, to be de facto recognized as Russian. \u201cTo break the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty, and that\u2019s the main problem,\u201d he added.",
      "U.S. allies and lawmakers have raised questions over who may have been behind the plan and how much Ukraine was consulted.",
      "Rubio insisted Sunday that the plan was authored by the U.S. after a bipartisan group of senators said he had told them that the text being discussed was a Russian initiative given to special envoy Steve Witkoff.",
      "Moscow has maintained it has not officially been looped in to talks.",
      "During a call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip  Erdo\u011fan on Monday, Putin said the plan, \"in the version we have reviewed,\" is consistent with discussions at his summer summit with Trump in Alaska, \"and, in principle, could form the basis for a final peace settlement,\" according to a Kremlin readout.",
      "Still, it\u2019s unclear if the Kremlin would agree to any modifications that would be necessary to get Ukraine and Europe to sign on.",

    "story": [
      "As representatives from nearly 200 nations were wrapping up talks at the United Nations\u2019 COP30 climate summit this week, the United States was not only absent, but the Trump administration also introduced a series of sweeping proposals to roll back environmental protections and encourage fossil fuel drilling.",
      "The United Nations Climate Change Conference ended Friday in the Brazilian city of Bel\u00e9m, where delegates gathered to hammer out a road map to phase out fossil fuels, boost climate action and limit global warming.",
      "For the first time in the summit\u2019s history, the U.S. \u2014 one of the top emitters of greenhouse gases \u2014 did not send a delegation. Instead, the Trump administration this week announced a plan to open up new oil drilling off the coasts of California and Florida for the first time in decades and proposed rule changes to weaken the Endangered Species Act and limit the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s authority to protect wetlands and streams.",
      "\u201cThese rules double down on the administration\u2019s refusal to confront the climate crisis in a serious way and, in fact, move us in the opposite direction,\u201d said Jessie Ritter, associate vice president of waters and coasts for the National Wildlife Federation, a conservation group.",
      "The White House told NBC News on Friday that this week\u2019s \u201chistoric\u201d announcements aim to \u201cfurther President Trump\u2019s American energy dominance agenda.\u201d",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is reversing government overreach, restoring energy security, and protecting American jobs by rolling back excessive, burdensome regulations and creating new opportunities to \u2018DRILL, BABY, DRILL,\u2019\u201d White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in a statement. \u201cPresident Trump serves the American people, not radical climate activists who have fallen victim to the biggest scam of the century.\u201d",

      "\u201cI doubt that this surprises folks who have been watching in the international arena,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s unfortunate, given the example the U.S. sets and what our leadership, or lack thereof, emboldens other countries to do.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration's announcement on Thursday that it intends to open up roughly 1.27 billion acres of coastal U.S. waters for oil drilling drew bipartisan pushback.",
      "Although the American Petroleum Institute, a trade association for the oil and gas industry, hailed the program as a \u201chistoric step toward unleashing our nation\u2019s vast offshore resources,\u201d Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., pushed to uphold the current moratorium on drilling, which Trump extended during his first term.",
      "\u201cI have been speaking to @SecretaryBurgum and made my expectations clear that this moratorium must remain in place, and that in any plan, Florida\u2019s coasts must remain off the table for oil drilling to protect Florida\u2019s tourism, environment, and military training opportunities,\u201d Scott wrote Thursday on X, referring to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum.",
      "Across the country, California Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote on X that \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s idiotic proposal to sell off California\u2019s coasts to his Big Oil donors is dead in the water.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will not stand by as our coastal economy and communities are put in danger,\u201d he said.",
      "The drilling directive came just three days after the Trump administration proposed major limits to the Clean Water Act of 1972 that would undo protections from pollution and runoff for most of the country\u2019s small streams and wetlands. The rule would narrow the definition of which bodies qualify as \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d under the act.",
      "If finalized, the changes would mean that the smallest share of freshwater resources would be under federal protection since the law was enacted, according to Jon Devine, who heads the water policy team at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group.",
      "\u201cBy EPA\u2019s own estimate, only about 19% of the country\u2019s wetlands would be protected against unregulated destruction and development if this were finalized,\u201d Devine said.",
      "Wetlands act as buffers against flooding by absorbing and storing water during extreme rainfall and other high-runoff events. As the world warms, coastal and inland flooding is expected to become more frequent and severe.",
      "\u201cMany of the places that we already have in the U.S. that are increasingly flood-prone due to climate change are going to be even more in harm\u2019s way,\u201d Devine said.",
      "Wetlands and streams also feed into other bodies of water that serve as critical drinking water supplies across the country, so critics fear the policy could make drinking water unsafe in some communities.",
      "The third major environmental rollback announced this week was a set of four rules that would erode protections under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The proposed changes aim to make it easier to remove species classified as threatened or endangered and harder to add new protected species and their habitats to the list. The rules, if passed, would also allow the government to consider \u201ceconomic impacts\u201d in decisions to list or delist species.",
      "Taken together, Ritter said, these three proposals are consistent with the Trump administration\u2019s deregulatory agenda.",
      "\u201cThese decisions prioritize short-term gain, often for a few industries and special interests, at the expense of things that have been widely bipartisan and important issues for people for decades,\u201d Ritter said.",
      "The impacts of the changes might not all be apparent right away, she added, but the scale of the long-term consequences could be immense.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s truly not an exaggeration that this is going to touch all Americans in some way,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything is connected, and it\u2019s hubris to think that we can have these massive negative effects on our streams and wetlands, our animals, our coastal waters, without impacts to humans.\u201d"

      "\"The number is expected to rise as the airstrikes continue, and some of the wounded are in critical condition,\" Khalil al-Daqran, spokesperson for the Ministry of Health, told NBC News.",
      "The Israeli strikes came as international momentum was building on Gaza, with the U.N. Security Council on Monday approving the U.S. blueprint to secure and govern the territory. It authorizes an international stabilization force to provide security, approves a transitional authority to be overseen by President Donald Trump and envisions a possible future path to an independent Palestinian state.",
      "Israel has previously carried out similar waves of strikes after reported attacks on its forces. At least 33 Palestinians were killed over a 12-hour period Wednesday and Thursday, mostly women and children, health officials said.",
      "One of Saturday's strikes targeted a vehicle, killing 11 and wounding over 20 Palestinians in Gaza City's Rimal neighborhood, said Rami Mhanna, managing director of Shifa Hospital, where the casualties were taken. The majority of the wounded were children, director Mohamed Abu Selmiya said. Associated Press video showed children and others inspecting the blackened vehicle, whose top was blown off.",
      "Another strike targeting a house near Al-Awda Hospital in central Gaza killed at least three people and wounded 11 others, according to the hospital. It said a strike on a house in Nuseirat camp in central Gaza killed at least seven people including a child and wounded 16 others.",
      "And a strike targeting a house in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza killed three people, including a woman, according to Al-Aqsa Hospital.",
      "\"Suddenly, I heard a powerful explosion. I looked outside and saw smoke covering the entire area. I couldn't see a thing. I covered my ears and started shouting to the others in the tent to run,\" said Khalil Abu Hatab in Deir al-Balah. \"When I looked again, I realized the upper floor of my neighbor's house was gone.\"",
      "He added: \"It's a fragile ceasefire. This is not a life we can live. There's no safe place.\"",
      "Israel's military in a statement said it launched attacks against Hamas after an \"armed terrorist\" crossed into an Israeli-held area and shot at troops in southern Gaza. It said no soldiers were hurt. The military said the person had used a road on which humanitarian aid enters the territory, and called it an \"extreme violation\" of the ceasefire.",
      "In separate statements, the military said soldiers killed five \"terrorists\" in the Rafah area, and two others after firing at four people who crossed into Israeli-held areas in northern Gaza and advanced toward soldiers in two separate incidents.",
      "The war began with the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, that killed some 1,200 people and took over 250 hostage. Almost all of the hostages or their remains have been returned in ceasefires or other deals.",
      "Gaza's Health Ministry says 69,733 Palestinians have been killed and 170,863 injured in Israel's retaliatory offensive. The toll has gone up during the ceasefire both from new Israeli strikes and from the recovery and identification of bodies of people killed earlier in the war.",
      "The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its figures but has said women and children make up a majority of those killed. The ministry, part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals, maintains detailed records viewed as generally reliable by independent experts."

      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said \"a tremendous amount of progress\" was made Sunday after a day of talks with Ukrainian and European officials in Switzerland, however the U.S. efforts to coordinate a Ukraine peace push were clouded by concerns over the origins of the proposal.",
      "The 28-point plan suggests that Russia could be granted more territory than it holds, stipulates limits on Ukraine\u2019s army, and prevents Kyiv from ever joining NATO \u2014 concessions that amount to a near-mirror of Moscow\u2019s long-standing demands.",
      "Rubio told reporters Sunday the talks in Geneva marked \"probably the most productive day we have had on this issue.\"",
      "\"We arrived here today with one goal, and the goal was to take, you know what, 28 points, or 26 points, depending on which version as it continues to evolve, and try to narrow the ones that were open items,\" he said.",
      "In a statement issued Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said an open dialogue with the U.S. and \u201csigns that President Trump\u2019s team is listening to us\u201d are important.",
      "\u201cIt is important to ensure that the steps to end the war are effective and that everything is workable,\u201d he said. \u201cUkraine never wanted war, and we will never be an obstacle to peace. Diplomacy has been activated, which is good. We expect that the result will be the right steps.\u201d",
      "Origins of the plan",
      "Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said in an X post Sunday that European leaders were ready to work on the plan \u201cdespite some reservations,\u201d but added: \u201cBefore we start our work, it would be good to know for sure who is the author of the plan and where was it created.\u201d",
      "In a news conference Saturday, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators said Rubio had told them that the existing text being discussed was not in fact a U.S. initiative, nor the administration\u2019s position, but rather a Russian proposal given to special envoy Steve Witkoff.",
      "The plan \u201cwas not the administration\u2019s plan\u201d but a \u201cwish list of the Russians,\u201d Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, said Rubio told them.",
      "Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., asserted that \u201cnone of the information that was released on this particular proposal came back from the administration,\u201d following his call with Rubio Saturday afternoon.",
      "A State Department spokesperson later denied the senators\u2019 account, calling it \u201cblatantly false,\u201d while Rubio has asserted that the U.S. did produce the proposal.",
      "\u201cThe peace proposal was authored by the U.S. It is offered as a strong framework for ongoing negotiations,\u201d Rubio wrote on X late Saturday night. \u201cIt is based on input from the Russian side. But it is also based on previous and ongoing input from Ukraine.\u201d",

      "This confusion is \u201ceither by design for the Russian side, or it\u2019s a reflection of incoherence inside the administration,\u201d he added.",
      "The White House previously described the plan as \u201cthe best win-win scenario, where both parties gain more than they must give,\u201d but the mixed messages from Washington \u2014 combined with nervous allies demanding clarity \u2014 have deepened doubts about what the U.S. is actually trying to achieve.",
      "Rubio on Sunday said the talks precipitated about three weeks ago with a \u201cfoundational document that we socialized and ran by both sides and with input from both sides.\u201d While he declined to go into specifics, he affirmed, \u201cthe items that remain open are not insurmountable.\u201d",

      "A U.S. official said Rubio, Witkoff and Army Secretary Dan Driscoll held \u201cpositive and constructive\u201d coordination meetings Sunday morning in Geneva, followed by more detailed afternoon talks aimed at ironing out the terms of a potential peace agreement.",

      "The Formula 1 cars blasted down the Las Vegas Strip for 50 laps at breathtaking speeds of over 215 mph, delivering thrilling wheel-to-wheel racing under the bright lights for the third consecutive year.",
      "But in a stunning twist, both Norris and fellow McLaren driver Oscar Piastri were later disqualified in the middle of the night, hours after the race finish and podium celebrations, with officials finding illegal plank wear on their cars.",
      "Norris crossed the line in second place, ahead of title rival Piastri, who finished in fourth. Their disqualification carries huge implications for the world championship fight with just two more Grand Prix races and one \u201csprint\u201d left in the season.",
      "It puts Norris just 24 points ahead of both Piastri and four-time world champion Verstappen, who are tied on points in second place. Norris now has 390 points, while Piastri and Verstappen have 366.",
      "\u201cA frustrating end to today,\u201d Norris said in a statement. \u201cWe had to do some managing towards the end of the race and now we know it was due to some issues on our car, which have unfortunately resulted in us being disqualified.\u201d",
      "Piastri called it \u201cdisappointing\u201d and \u201cunfortunate.\u201d",
      "F1 rules require the wooden skid blocks under the cars to be at least 9 mm thick after a race in order to be deemed legal, a way to control ride height and contact with the ground. The penalty for failing to meet that standard is disqualification. It\u2019s rare, but not unheard of.",
      "McLaren team principal Andrea Stella said the breach was unintentional and apologized to Norris and Piastri \u201cfor the loss of points today, at a critical time in their Championship campaigns.\u201d He also apologized to McLaren partners and fans.",
      "\u201cWhile this outcome is extremely disappointing, we remain fully focused on the last two races of the season,\u201d Stella said.",
      "There are just two Grand Prix left in a 2025 season full of twists and turns \u2014 next weekend in Qatar and the weekend after in Abu Dhabi. The Qatar race features a shortened \u201csprint\u201d race, too, so there are a maximum of 58 points still up for grabs.",
      "\u201cThe upcoming weekends, we\u2019ll again try to win the race, and at the end of Abu Dhabi we\u2019ll see where we end up,\u201d Verstappen said of the title fight in a postrace interview ahead of the McLarens\u2019 disqualification.",
      "Norris started first but lost two positions in the opening corners after making an aggressive move to defend his lead, but ran wide on the first turn and got overtaken by Verstappen and George Russell. He eventually overtook Russell of Mercedes but couldn\u2019t get close to Verstappen, and he was forced to slow his pace toward the end due to a then-unknown issue with the car.",
      "Russell was promoted from third to second. Mercedes teammate Kimi Antonelli finished fifth but was moved up to third.",
      "\u201cI messed it up and made my life tougher into turn one,\u201d Norris said. \u201cBut even after that, we just weren\u2019t quick enough. ... I was pushing flat out and Max was still pulling away.\u201d",
      "Piastri fell a further six points behind Norris before the disqualification, but now they remain 24 points apart.",
      "An economic boost for Las Vegas",
      "Local leaders hope the race weekend will provide a much-needed economic boost to Las Vegas, which has struggled this year due to high costs and declining tourism, among other issues. Last year\u2019s Las Vegas Grand Prix delivered an economic impact of $934 million, according to one estimate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very important event. And I fully support all of our special events. We\u2019re not just the entertainment capital, we\u2019re the entertainment and sports capital,\u201d U.S. Rep. Steven Horsford, D-Nev., who represents parts of the city, told NBC News ahead of the race. \u201cSo having a marquee event like this on the Las Vegas Strip is great, and it does a lot for our economy.\u201d",
      "F1 is looking to build on its momentum with American fans, having secured the races in Miami and Las Vegas \u2014 in addition to the long-standing Grand Prix in Austin \u2014 on the calendar for the long haul. It signed a five-year deal with Apple, which will take over the U.S. broadcast rights from ESPN starting next year.",
      "Celebrity sightings included musicians Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z, actors Ben Affleck, Michael Douglas and Naomi Campbell, NBA All-Stars Magic Johnson and Jimmy Butler, and tennis player Taylor Fritz. Actor Catherine Zeta-Jones waved the checkered flag.",
      "The top three finishers were driven to the podium, which is located on the Strip at the Bellagio Fountain Club, in a pink LEGO-built Cadillac car driven by Terry Crews.",
      "Before the race, Ferrari superstar Lewis Hamilton took Beyonc\u00e9 on a hot lap around the circuit, a team spokesperson confirmed, as she was decked out in a Louis Vuitton custom racing suit. The two stars were spotted watching the race from the Ferrari garage.",

And we\u2019re excited to see everybody race,\u201d Noem said, adding that she was getting a tour of the McLaren garage. Patel called Formula 1 \u201cone of the greatest sports,\u201d saying he\u2019s a McLaren fan.",
      "Rain brings chaos in qualifying",
      "The Friday qualifying session was thrown into chaos due to rain, which extracted every ounce of skill from the 20 drivers just to stay out of the barriers. The track, already known to have low grip even in dry conditions, was slippery and treacherous for most of the session.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re just trying to keep it on the track. Not crash. Not take yourself out,\u201d Norris said after taking pole position. \u201cOne day, I just hope \u2014 apart from having a two-seater F1 car \u2014 people can get that sensation of just how nerve-wracking and scary it can be at times. How unpredictable.\u201d",
      "And the Las Vegas paddock was abuzz with internal drama among several teams during the weekend.",
      "Piastri was asked about recently reposting an Instagram post that quoted F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone claiming McLaren \u201cprefers\u201d Norris because of his \u201chigh star quality\u201d and \u201cmarketing appeal.\u201d",
      "Asked about the repost, which was highlighted online by F1 content creators, Piastri told reporters it was an error.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said Friday after deleting it from his feed. \u201cI woke up this morning and saw it. So I don\u2019t know, maybe I accidentally did it. Obviously, it was not intentional. But yeah, I didn\u2019t know what had happened.\u201d",
      "Instagram has one-click reposts \u2014 unlike X, which requires users to click twice to confirm \u2014 making it easy to erroneously repost something while scrolling. Still, it added to a drama in which the Australian driver\u2019s fans have theorized that the British team favors his British teammate, a claim that McLaren firmly denies.",
      "Ferrari\u2019s two drivers downplayed recent comments by Ferrari chairperson John Elkann, who said they should \u201ctalk less and focus on driving\u201d \u2014 remarks slammed by critics as a gratuitous dig against Charles Leclerc and Hamilton after Ferrari\u2019s decision to build a new car for 2025 (rather than upgrade last year\u2019s version) backfired and led to a winless season so far.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always willing to do less media,\u201d Hamilton quipped.",
      "The seven-time world champion told reporters it\u2019s \u201cnot really\u201d possible to focus any more on driving than he already does. \u201cI wake up thinking about it. And I go to sleep thinking about it. And I think about it while I\u2019m sleeping,\u201d Hamilton said.",
      "Leclerc said the comment was a product of Elkann\u2019s ambition to maximize the team\u2019s potential. \u201cHe loves Ferrari. I love Ferrari. We all love Ferrari,\u201d Leclerc said. \u201cWhen he called me, he told me what were the intentions of these words, and that was very clear. It was a positive message, trying to be positive.\u201d",
      "Ferrari currently sits fourth in a close battle for second in the team championship, behind Mercedes and Red Bull. While the driver\u2019s title carries more glory, the constructors\u2019 championship is the one that awards cash prizes. Ferrari finished runner-up to McLaren last year in a close battle.",
      "While Hamilton said he takes no positives regarding his comeback from last place to a points finish, he enjoys racing in Las Vegas.",
      "\u201cI love coming to Vegas,\u201d he told reporters after the race. \u201cI think it\u2019s a really great city. Always get a great welcome here. This is the biggest crowd I think we\u2019ve seen, even though it\u2019s quite cold.\u201d",
      "And the activities of the weekend have evolved over the three years as F1 seeks a better balance between sport and show.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s certainly better than it was a few years ago. I think that was a bit too much for everyone,\u201d Norris said. \u201cMay as well be in Cirque du Soleil with what we were doing back then.\u201d"

      "The B.C. Wildlife Federation, a nonprofit that works toward environmental preservation, said Friday that a 2017 province ban on hunting grizzlies correlates to a rise in such attacks because the bears, plentiful in Bella Coola, have been freer to learn behavior dangerous to humans.",
      "Since the prohibition started, the federation said in a statement  Friday, the number of bear reports to the British Columbia Conservation Officer Service has doubled.",
      "\u201cWith no hunting pressure, grizzlies and humans will increasingly occupy the same spaces with inevitable consequences,\u201d BC Wildlife Federation Executive Director Jesse Zeman said.",
      "While the federation expressed hope the incident would lead to reconsideration of the hunting ban, Davidson, the province's parks minister, said it was too soon.",
      "\"This is an ongoing live situation where the bear is still at large and the community doesn't feel safe,\" she said. \"No considerations just yet.\"",
      "At the same time, Davidson said, her ministry hopes the families of those attacked experience \"healing and comfort in the coming days.\""

    "story": [
      "A U.S.-led peace plan that mirrors several key Russian demands has sent ripples across Europe, with leaders voicing concerns that it could leave Ukraine vulnerable and calling for changes to the proposals.",
      "European leaders and key allies met on the sidelines of the G20 summit in South Africa and said in a joint statement that the plan requires additional work, adding that they are \u201cconcerned by the proposed limitations on Ukraine\u2019s armed forces, which would leave Ukraine vulnerable to future attack.\u201d",
      "The statement was signed by leaders of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain and Norway, as well as the European Union Commission and the E.U. Council. Japan\u2019s and Canada\u2019s leaders also signed on to the statement, which warns that \u201cborders must not be changed by force.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump has set Thanksgiving as the deadline for Ukraine to agree to the 28-point framework, which suggests that Russia could be granted more territory than it holds and would place limits on Ukraine\u2019s army and prevent Kyiv from ever joining NATO \u2014 Moscow\u2019s long-sought demands.",
      "The U.S. proposals do include a security guarantee modeled on NATO\u2019s Article 5, which would commit the U.S. and European allies to treat a future attack on Ukraine as an attack on the entire trans-Atlantic community, according to a U.S. official, though there are few specifics on what that would entail.",
      "Top Ukrainian and U.S. officials will meet in Switzerland to discuss \u201cpossible parameters of a future peace,\u201d Rustem Umerov, the secretary of Ukraine\u2019s National Security and Defense Council, wrote on Telegram Saturday. Separately, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s office said Saturday that the delegation has been confirmed for the talks, which \u201cwill take place in the coming days.\u201d",
      "The White House has described the plan as \u201cthe best win-win scenario, where both parties gain more than they must give,\u201d saying the proposals were crafted with input from Russia and Ukraine.",
      "However, analysts say the plan could amount to a dangerous capitulation for Ukraine, which has previously rejected plans that would require recognizing Russia\u2019s illegal annexations of the entire eastern Donetsk region and Crimea.",
      "\u201cEven if parts of this plan were to be shoved down Ukraine\u2019s throat, it would be the end of Ukraine as we know it. It\u2019s a real capitulation,\u201d Michael Bociurkiw, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center, who was in Johannesburg, told NBC News by phone.",
      "The U.S. was facilitating a \u201cpotentially disastrous surrender for Ukraine,\u201d said Keir Giles, a senior consulting fellow at Chatham House, a London-based think tank.",
      "\u201cAnd now we will see yet another panicked scramble by European leaders to head off an outcome that would be disastrous for their own security,\u201d he said, adding that the European response toward \u201crepeated disastrous peace plans has been in words, not action.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere should be nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine,\u201d Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, said Friday in a post on X, adding European leaders will also meet in Angola next week.",
      "Ukraine must have a \u201cdecisive voice in peace talks,\u201d Polish President Karol Nawrocki said late Friday on X. \u201cThe price of peace cannot in any way be the achievement of strategic goals by the aggressor, and the aggressor was and remains the Russian Federation,\u201d he added.",
      "As European leaders mulled over the plan on the G20 summit\u2019s sidelines, notably absent was Trump, who is boycotting the event over his unfounded claims that South Africa\u2019s white minority is subject to hate crimes and land grabs.",
      "While Trump initially said Vice President JD Vance would attend, he later said there would be no U.S. delegation taking part. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has an International Criminal Court warrant calling for his arrest, is also not attending.",
      "How much Europe will actually be able to influence the plan without U.S. involvement remains an open question, and one with implications for both Ukraine\u2019s borders and peace for the broader continent.",
      "\u201cThey can\u2019t influence this,\u201d said Bociurkiw. \u201cIt makes NATO and Europe look weak, and Putin will go on and on to cause more disruptions.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a speed train and you have Putin and Trump on it, and then you have Zelenskyy on the departure platform and Europe stuck at the check-in counter,\u201d he added.",
      "Giles said the military aspects of the peace plan leave Ukraine effectively defenseless against a future Russian attack.",
      "\u201cAnd since Ukraine forms the front line of the defense of Europe, this is a potentially disastrous outcome for the continent as a whole,\u201d Giles said.",
      "Lawmakers in Ukraine aren\u2019t particularly happy with the plan either, with Victoria Podgorna from Zelenskyy\u2019s political party saying it was giving Russia \u201camnesty for launching a brutal war.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy said Friday he had spoken with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his counterparts in Germany and France, adding that he would also talk to Washington to ensure Kyiv\u2019s \u201cprincipled stances are taken into account.\u201d",
      "\u201cUkraine may now face a very difficult choice, either losing its dignity or the risk of losing a key partner, either the difficult 28 points, or a very difficult winter,\u201d Zelenskyy said, warning his country of a \u201cvery difficult, eventful\u201d week ahead.",
      "His warning also came as Ukraine suffers setbacks on the battlefield and Zelenskyy tries to contain the fallout from a $100 million corruption scandal implicating his top officials.",
      "On Saturday, the Russian defense ministry said it had captured two additional villages in eastern Ukraine, one in the Donetsk region and another in Zaporizhzhia.",
      "Russia's gains, both on the battlefield and in the proposed plan, have drawn a positive response from the Kremlin, where Putin has said it could \u201cform the basis of a final peace settlement,\u201d though adding it was not \u201csubstantively\u201d discussed with Russia.",
      "Meanwhile, two people were killed in Russia\u2019s southern city of Syzran in a Ukrainian strike on energy facilities, the regional governor, Vyacheslav Fedorishchev, said Saturday on Russia\u2019s state-backed Max messenger app."

      "Dozens of young people wave their phone flashlights and sing along with a teen as she belts out lyrics and plays her keyboard outside a subway station.",
      "It\u2019s a scene that regularly plays out in cities around the world. But the singer in this widely shared video is now behind bars.",
      "Diana Loginova, the 18-year-old student and street musician, has emerged as an unlikely \u2014 and perhaps unwilling \u2014 voice of defiance in wartime Russia.",
      "Known by her stage name Naoko, the teen gained popularity over the summer with viral videos taken around St. Petersburg of her band Stoptime performing songs by musicians who have spoken out against Vladimir Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine. Inevitably, in a country where nearly all forms of dissent have been crushed, Russian authorities quickly took notice.",
      "Naoko was first detained last month for organizing a \u201cmass simultaneous gathering of citizens\u201d during a performance, which authorities said disrupted public order, and was sentenced to 13 days behind bars. She has since been rearrested twice on the same charges, as well as for petty hooliganism, and put back in prison. Her fellow band members have also served back-to-back sentences, although one has since been released.",
      "\u201cWhat is happening is what we call carousel arrests,\u201d Dmitrii Anisimov, a human rights activist and spokesperson for the OVD-Info protest monitoring group, told NBC News. \u201cTheoretically, it can continue forever,\u201d he said. In practice, it could mean months in detention, and there is legal precedent for this, he added.",
      "\u201cIt looks like Russian authorities want to use the persecution of Naoko, as with many other public cases, to intimidate others,\u201d said Anisimov.",
      "Loginova\u2019s lawyer, Maria Zyryanova, told NBC News she wouldn\u2019t discuss the case while the singer is behind bars. Her current sentence expires Sunday.",
      "Naoko\u2019s case has been extensively covered by Russian state news agencies and exiled independent media, while supporters have spread leaflets calling for her freedom.",
      "In an interview published in August, months before her imprisonment, Naoko said she was \u201cscared\u201d to be detained but felt she \u201chad to do it.\u201d",
      "\u201cI understand that art is now the only language \u2014 at least in Russia \u2014 through which you can express your thoughts. I\u2019ve chosen it and don\u2019t want to speak any other,\u201d she told St. Petersburg news outlet Bumaga.",
      "Others have taken up that language in Loginova\u2019s absence.",
      "On a bench near the Kiyevskaya metro station in central Moscow, musician Vasily told NBC News that Naoko\u2019s case had \u201clit a fire\u201d in him, inspiring his own street performances as a way to support the jailed singer.",
      "\u201cHer freedom was taken away for her singing,\u201d said Vasily, whose last name NBC News chose not to reveal for his safety. \u201cThat got me mad.\u201d",
      "Valentina, a professional musician from the city of Yaroslavl, about 380 miles southeast of St. Petersburg, has been singing on both the streets and social media in support of Naoko.",
      "Inspired after seeing Naoko\u2019s performances on TikTok, she has been posting videos where she performs the same songs. One gained more than 600,000 views on Instagram, which scared her because she did not want to get on authorities\u2019 radar, said Valentina, who did not want her last name revealed for fear of repercussions. \u201cWhen I saw the news about Naoko, it felt like my last hope was taken away,\u201d she said. \u201cI did not feel sorry for myself. I just really wanted to help. I thought, \u2018Why do I berate people who keep silent and don\u2019t say anything in our country when I am also remaining silent and scared?\u2019\u201d",
      "Loginova is still a child, noted Vasily \u2014 himself only 19. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s touched people, that this little girl is not afraid to get on the streets and sing the songs of foreign agents.\u201d",
      "He\u2019s referencing the status of exiled singer Monetochka and rapper Noize MC, both slapped with the official designation often reserved for public figures whose views have set them at odds with the Kremlin.",
      "It was a song by Noize MC, who has openly spoken out against the war and Putin\u2019s regime, that Loginova performed before she first landed in jail.",
      "The rapper\u2019s lyrics that appear to have gotten her in the most trouble appear innocuous on the surface: \u201cI want to watch a ballet, let the swans dance.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a reference to the failed 1991 coup attempt against the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, during which state TV showed the \u201cSwan Lake\u201d ballet on a continuous loop. It has since come to symbolize something dangerous in Putin\u2019s Russia \u2014 change.",
      "A video of the band\u2019s cover of the song, which Loginova has said they performed rarely and not for the cameras, drew the ire of war supporters who questioned why the band was allowed to perform the songs of \u201ctraitors\u201d and whether their performances were, in fact, concealed protests.",
      "A representative for Noize MC said in an email that the rapper \u201cprefers not to give interviews or public comments regarding this case \u2014 primarily to avoid any risk of unintentionally affecting those directly involved.\u201d",
      "Monetochka, whose songs the band also performed, hailed them as \u201cheroes\u201d in a statement on social media, saying that Loginova was bringing \u201cmusic and freedom\u201d into the world rather than \u201cviolence and war.\u201d She did not respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment.",
      "NBC News has reached out to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov for comment on the case.",
      "Kremlin critic Boris Nadezhdin, who was barred from running against Putin in last year\u2019s election, said he had been in communication with Loginova\u2019s mom, Irina, and was fundraising to cover the band\u2019s legal costs.",
      "He has also been raising awareness on social media and said people\u2019s emotional reactions were palpable. \u201cShe is young, she is a female, and she is not at all a politician or journalist. People are used to repressions against opposition politicians and journalists, but this is a new low,\u201d said Nadezhdin.",
      "The people who came to listen to the band were also young, he added, a red flag for the Kremlin because of its predominantly older support base. \u201cSo they need to have an exemplary reprisal against some young singer,\u201d he said, \u201cso that others get fearful.\u201d",
      "While she garners sympathy at home and abroad, Loginova remains behind bars for her singing. Nadezhdin said he was not optimistic about her chances of performing again anytime soon.",
      "\u201cThey won\u2019t leave her alone quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cI am telling them to get ready for a long ride ahead.\u201d"

      "TOKYO \u2014 As Japan\u2019s first female prime minister, Sanae Takaichi has broken new ground in a country that struggles with gender equality. But she has quickly run up against a tradition that may be immovable.",
      "Trophies for sumo wrestling, Japan\u2019s national sport, are sometimes presented by the country\u2019s top leader \u2014 most recently in January, when Shigeru Ishiba, the prime minister at the time, awarded the winner\u2019s trophy at the New Year Grand Sumo Tournament in Tokyo.",
      "But awkward questions arose ahead of the Kyushu Grand Sumo Tournament, which concludes Sunday in the Japanese city of Fukuoka. Takaichi is prohibited from entering the ring according to the rules of sumo, which consider women impure.",
      "Takaichi will have a chance to sidestep the issue as the Japanese leader is expected to attend the G20 summit in South Africa this weekend amid a diplomatic spat with China.",
      "But the dilemma could resurface during the New Year\u2019s tournament in Tokyo.",
      "In Japan, sumo is not just a sport but a 1,500-year-old tradition that is held sacred in the nation of over 100 million people. It has deep roots in Shinto, Japan\u2019s Indigenous religion.",
      "Experts suggested Takaichi, a hard-line conservative elected last month whose policies are not seen as particularly pro-women, is likely to avoid the issue altogether so as not to challenge tradition, and send another high-ranking government official instead.",
      "\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to upset her supporters or conservatives,\u201d said Hiromi Murakami, an expert on Japanese politics at Temple University in Japan.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t want to even see a discussion around the topic,\u201d she said.",
      "Minoru Kihara, the Japanese government\u2019s top spokesperson, said last week that Takaichi \u201cholds the view that Japan\u2019s sumo culture is a traditional art form that should be cherished.\u201d",
      "She \u201cintends to respect the traditions of sumo culture,\u201d he later told reporters in Tokyo.",
      "Reached for comment this week, the Japan Sumo Association said it had not received any request from Takaichi\u2019s office regarding her involvement. The association told the Asahi Shimbun newspaper this month, \u201cWe believe it is our mission to pass down the traditional culture of sumo.\u201d",
      "This is not the first time there have been questions as to whether a high-ranking female official would be allowed to enter the sumo ring, also known as the dohyo.",
      "In 1990, Mayumi Moriyama became Japan\u2019s first female chief Cabinet secretary, who often represents the government at sumo trophy ceremonies. The sumo association did not allow her to do so.",
      "The association rejected another request in 2000 by Japan\u2019s first female governor, Fusae Ohta, to enter the sumo ring at a tournament in the city of Osaka. She ultimately presented the trophy on a walkway next to the dohyo.",
      "In 2018, a female mayor, Tomoko Nakagawa of the city of Takarazuka, was denied a request to make a speech in the ring. That same year, the association apologized after two women were ordered out of the ring when they rushed to the aid of a mayor who had collapsed inside it.",
      "Such incidents underscore the challenges that continue to face women in Japan, which ranked 118th out of 148 countries in the World Economic Forum\u2019s 2025 Global Gender Gap Report.",
      "Sumo wrestling has also proved popular on the rare occasion a competition is held outside Japan. Last month, tickets sold out for the Grand Sumo Tournament at London\u2019s Royal Albert Hall, which hosted the event for the first time in 34 years.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite interesting that they went to the U.K.,\u201d Murakami said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a female political leader who wants to give the trophy, what would happen then?\u201d",

      "The first Group of 20 summit to be held in Africa opened on Saturday with an ambitious agenda to make progress on solving some of the long-standing problems that have afflicted the world's poorest nations.",
      "Leaders and top government officials from the richest and leading emerging economies came together at an exhibition center near the famous Soweto township in South Africa, once home to Nelson Mandela, to try and find some consensus on the priorities set out by the host country.",
      "Many of South Africa's priorities for the group, especially a focus on climate change and its impact on developing countries, have met resistance from the United States, which is boycotting the talks.",
      "As he opened the summit, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said in his speech that \"consensus has emerged\" and appeared to indicate that a declaration would be adopted in the absence of the U.S. and despite its opposition.",
      "South Africa's agenda",
      "South Africa, which gets to set the agenda as the country holding the rotating presidency, wants leaders to agree to more help for poor countries to recover from climate-related disasters, reduce their foreign debt burdens, transition to green energy sources and harness their own critical mineral wealth \u2014 all in an attempt to counter widening global inequality.",
      "\"We'll see,\" United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdnio Guterres said on whether the G20 could prioritize developing world countries and make meaningful reforms. \"But I think South Africa has done its part in putting those things clearly upon the table.\"",
      "The two-day summit will take place without the world's biggest economy after U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a U.S. boycott of the summit over his claims that South Africa is pursuing racist anti-white policies and persecuting its Afrikaner white minority.",
      "The Trump administration has also made clear its opposition to South Africa's G20 agenda from the start of the year, when South Africa began hosting G20 meetings. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio skipped a G20 foreign ministers meeting in February, calling the agenda all about diversity, equity and inclusion and climate change",
      "Rubio said he would not waste American taxpayers' money on that.",
      "Diplomatic rift",
      "The monthslong diplomatic rift between the U.S. and South Africa deepened in the buildup to the main summit this weekend, but while Trump's boycott dominated the pre-talks discussions in Johannesburg and threatened to undercut the agenda, some of the leaders were eager to move on.",
      "\"I do regret it,\" French President Emmanuel Macron said of Trump's absence, \"but it should not block us. Our duty is to be present, engage and work all together because we have so many challenges.\"",
      "The G20 is actually a group of 21 members that includes 19 nations, the European Union and the African Union.",
      "The bloc was formed in 1999 as a bridge between rich and poor nations to confront global financial crises. While it often operates in the shadow of the Group of Seven richest democracies, G20 members together represent around 85% of the world's economy, 75% of international trade and more than half the global population.",
      "But it works on consensus rather than any binding resolutions, and that is often hard to come by with the different interests of members like the U.S., Russia, China, India, Japan, the Western European nations France, Germany and the U.K., and others like Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and South Africa.",
      "Guterres cautioned that rich nations have often failed to make the concessions required to strike effective climate or global financial reform agreements.",
      "Doubts over a declaration",
      "G20 summits traditionally end with a leaders' declaration, which details any broad agreement reached by the members, but even that was proving hard to come by in Johannesburg.",
      "South Africa said the U.S. was exerting pressure on it not to issue any leaders' declaration in the absence of the U.S. and instead tone down the final document to a unilateral statement from the host country.",
      "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa responded to that by saying \"we will not be bullied\" and has promised a declaration from all members present at the close of the summit on Sunday, with or without U.S. input.",
      "Even so, the direction of the G20 bloc is likely to change sharply given that the U.S. takes over the rotating presidency from South Africa at the end of this summit, as the Trump administration has derided the focus on climate change and inequality. Trump has said the U.S. will stage next year's summit at his golf club in Doral, Florida.",
      "The only role the U.S. will play at this summit, the White House said, will be when a representative from the United States Embassy in South Africa attends the formal handover ceremony at the end to accept the G20 presidency.",
      "South Africa said it's an insult for Ramaphosa to hand over to what it considers to be a junior diplomatic official.",
      "\"We have communicated to the American government that the president will not be handing over to a junior official of the embassy,\" South African Foreign Ministry spokesperson Chrispin Phiri told The Associated Press. \"And so, as a result, we don't anticipate that there'll be any form of handover here (at the summit).\""

      "At a gathering of reporters at the White House on Friday, Trump said that the plan is \"a way of getting peace\" that needs to be approved by Zelenskyy. \"He\u2019ll have to like it, and if he doesn\u2019t like it, then, you know, they should just keep fighting, I guess,\" Trump said.",
      "He added, \"Well, at some point he\u2019s going to have to accept something. You know he hasn\u2019t accepted. You remember right in the Oval Office, not so long ago, I said you don\u2019t have the cards.\"",
      "The U.S. communicated the Thursday deadline to the Ukrainian government, though the officials stressed this was more of a goal than a firm deadline.",
      "Negotiations to end the conflict are expected to be quite complex and will take more than a week to hash out, these officials acknowledged.",
      "On reports that the U.S. threatened to halt intelligence sharing and weapons supplies for Ukraine if the deal is rejected, a senior administration official said: \u201cIt was strongly implied to the Ukrainians that the United States expects them to agree to a peace deal. Any changes will be decided upon by the president himself.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is one of the most difficult moments in our history,\u201d Zelenskyy said in a somber 10-minute video addressed to the Ukrainian people.",
      "\u201cCurrently, the pressure on Ukraine is one of the hardest,\u201d he said. \u201cUkraine may now face a very difficult choice, either losing its dignity or the risk of losing a key partner, either the difficult 28 points, or a very difficult winter\u201d Zelenskyy added, urging the nation to stay united during what he said would be \"a very difficult, eventful\" week.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin struck a more upbeat note, saying the plan could \u201cform the basis of a final peace settlement,\u201d though he said it had not been discussed \u201csubstantively\u201d with Russia.",
      "Putin said that if Ukraine rejects the proposal, Russia would seek to achieve its objectives \"through military means, through armed struggle.\"",
      "The stark warnings came as Ukraine and its allies raced to respond to the proposal that would grant Russia key demands at a moment of weakness for Kyiv.",
      "Zelenskyy later shared in a post on X that he spoke with Vice President JD Vance and Army Secretary Dan Driscoll for almost an hour Friday about the plan.",
      "\"We agreed to work together with the U.S. and Europe at the level of national security advisors to make the path to peace truly doable,\" Zelenskyy said. \"Ukraine has always respected and continues to respect U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s desire to put an end to the bloodshed, and we view every realistic proposal positively.\"",
      "The Kremlin maintained that it had not seen details of the plan, but urged Ukraine to make a \"responsible decision\" in light of mounting battlefield pressure.",
      "Zelenskyy held an urgent call with the leaders of Britain, Germany and France, after which he said he valued Trump's efforts and would keep working with American officials to ensure Kyiv's \"principled stances are taken into account.\"",
      "The sudden emergence of the plan has fueled unease across the continent, which fears a deal imposing major concessions on Ukraine could further embolden Russia.",
      "A senior U.S. official told NBC News that the plan was drawn up immediately following discussions with Rustem Umerov, the secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council. He \u201cagreed to the majority of the plan, after making several modifications, and presented it to President Zelenskyy,\u201d the official said.",
      "Umerov denied this Friday.",
      "\"During my visit to the United States, my role was technical \u2014 organizing meetings and preparing the dialogue. I provided no assessments or, even more so, approvals of any points. This is not within my authority and does not correspond to the procedure,\" he said in a post on X.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that any deal must provide full security guarantees and deterrence for Ukraine, Europe and Russia.",
      "\u201cThis plan was crafted to reflect the realities of the situation, after five years of a devastating war, to find the best win-win scenario, where both parties gain more than they must give,\u201d she said."

      "The 28 points, published by Axios and confirmed to NBC News as accurate by a source familiar with the matter who has seen different drafts of the plan, suggest that Russia would be granted even more Ukrainian territory than it already holds, and that Ukraine would have to limit the size of its army and agree to never join NATO.",

      "Convicted Israeli spy Jonathan J. Pollard downplayed the controversy around his private meeting with U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, telling NBC News the visit was \u201cpersonal\u201d and \u201cwasn\u2019t done surreptitiously.\u201d",
      "The \u201cmain point\u201d of the meeting at the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem in July, Pollard said, was to \u201cthank\u201d the ambassador for \u201chis efforts on my behalf during my incarceration.\u201d",
      "Pollard, a former American intelligence analyst, spent 30 years in prison on espionage charges after being found to have passed critical security documents to Israeli intelligence in the 1980s. Israel made Pollard a citizen during his lengthy prison term, and he moved there in 2020, five years after his release on probation.",
      "During Pollard\u2019s detention, Huckabee was among several pro-Israeli politicians who advocated for his release, arguing that the sentence was too severe for someone who had been spying for an ally.",
      "Pollard described his meeting as more of a social call and insisted the two didn\u2019t discuss politics or Gaza. But the meeting comes amid a growing list of episodes in which the ambassador, a fierce champion of Israel, has appeared to deviate from official White House policy as the Trump administration deepens its involvement in Middle East diplomacy and peacekeeping.",
      "The New York Times first revealed the meeting Thursday. In a statement, a spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem said the article \u201cis filled with inaccuracies\u201d and said Huckabee \u201chas meetings each day with numerous people and as a matter of general policy we don\u2019t comment as to the content of conversations.\u201d",
      "The embassy offered no further information and declined to offer a comment from the ambassador himself.",
      "\u201cThe White House was not aware of that meeting but the president stands by our ambassador,\u201d press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday.",
      "Pollard said the meeting was \u201ca simple story\u201d that \u201cgot far more complicated than it deserved.\u201d",
      "He told NBC News that he had arranged the visit simply by phoning up the ambassador\u2019s office. \u201cHe had nothing to hide and I had nothing to hide,\" Pollard said, adding that it was an \u201cintensely personal visit to thank him\u201d for his work while he was incarcerated.",
      "But there were questions across the political spectrum for Huckabee over his decision to meet the notorious spy, whose long imprisonment drove a wedge between the U.S. and Israel.",
      "Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, who sits on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a post on X that Huckabee should not have met with \u201ca convicted traitor,\u201d while former Fox News host Tucker Carlson said Huckabee\u2019s conduct was \u201cshocking behavior from a United States ambassador.\u201d",
      "But this isn\u2019t the first time that Huckabee, a two-time presidential candidate, former governor of Arkansas and self-described Christian Zionist, has ruffled feathers on policy.",
      "The ambassador told Israeli media in early September that the U.S. would not stop Israel from annexing the occupied West Bank. The White House and several senior administration officials have since made it clear that the U.S. would oppose such a move.",
      "Earlier this year, he told the Bloomberg news agency that the U.S. was no longer pursuing the goal of Palestinian statehood, which has long stood as a central feature of American diplomacy in the Middle East. A U.S.-backed plan for Gaza approved by the United Nations earlier this month restated support for a future \u201ccredible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.\u201d",
      "Huckabee has regularly used the religiously loaded term \u201cJudea and Samaria\u201d to refer to the West Bank, the mostly Palestinian enclave that Israel has occupied since 1967. In 2008, he said that \u201cthere is no such thing as a Palestinian\u201d and that Palestinian nationhood is just a \u201cpolitical tool to try and force land away from Israel.\u201d",
      "In an interview with NBC News on Sunday before news of the Pollard meeting broke, he downplayed talk of a rift with the White House and struck a decidedly more obedient tone.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t get to make the policy. I simply carry it out as an ambassador,\u201d Huckabee said. \u201cI\u2019ve had some very strong opinions on it, but my job here is not to be the chemist making the medicine. My job is simply to be the pharmacist and dispense it.\u201d"

      "The pageant is seldom devoid of controversy, with sexual harassment and rigging complaints almost every year. And this year was no exception.",
      "Nawat, the Thai national director, hectored Bosch for not following the promotional activities guidelines in a livestreamed sashing ceremony on Nov. 4 and called security when the Mexican delegate stood up for herself.",
      "Bosch refused to be silenced and walked out unbowed, joined by others, including last year\u2019s winner, Denmark\u2019s Victoria Kj\u00e6r Theilvig.",
      "\u201cWhat your director did is not respectful: he called me dumb,\u201d Bosch told Thai reporters then. \u201cIf it takes away your dignity, you need to go.\u201d",
      "The public embarrassment for the organizers was palpable, prompting Miss Universe\u2019s co-owner, Mexican businessman Ra\u00fal Rocha Cant\u00fa, to call out Nawat, saying he won\u2019t let contestants be \u201chumiliated.\u201d",
      "Nawat later offered a teary apology.",
      "\u201cIf anyone (was) affected and not comfortable it happened, I am so sorry,\u201d he said with the contestants behind him. He then turned to them and said, \u201cIt\u2019s passed. OK? Are you happy?\u201d",
      "Then, Omar Harfouch, a Lebanese-French composer, stepped down from the eight-member jury panel, saying Tuesday that there had been a \"secret vote\" by people not officially part of the jury to preselect the top 130 contestants out of 136.",
      "Hours later, another judge, former French soccer star Claude Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9, announced he was stepping down, citing \u201cunforeseen personal reasons.\u201d",
