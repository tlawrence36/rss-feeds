      "Director Francis Ford Coppola, actor Viola Davis and director Paul Feig are among those paying tribute to Gene Hackman after his death at age 95",
      "Director Francis Ford Coppola, actor Viola Davis, director Paul Feig and actor George Takei are among those paying tribute to Gene Hackman after his death at age 95. Hackman, his wife Betsy Arakawa and their dog were found dead in their New Mexico home, authorities said Thursday.",
      "\u201cThe loss of a great artist, always cause for both mourning and celebration: Gene Hackman a great actor, inspiring and magnificent in his work and complexity, I mourn his loss, and celebrate his existence and contribution.\u201d \u2014 Francis Ford Coppola on Instagram.",
      "\u201cWe have lost a true legend. The magnificent Gene Hackman has passed away. A man whose breath of talent was immeasurable. Growing up on his movies was an absolute thrill for me. To observe his remarkable facility and humanity in every role was something to behold. Whatever film he was in, he made it better. A force of nature like no other and as such there will never be another like him.\u201d \u2014 actor Cary Elwes.",
      "\u201cHe was a tough nut, Gene Hackman, but he was really good and he was really difficult. Like, we can say it now, but he was a tough guy because older, great actors do not give young directors much of a chance. They're really rough on \u2019em.\u201d \u2014 actor Bill Murray, recalling working with Hackman on \u201cThe Royal Tenenbaums\u201d with director Wes Anderson, in an interview.",
      "\u201cThe greatest ... \u201d \u2014 director Edgar Wright on X.",
      "\u201cSo awful. Gene was such an inspiration to so many of us who love movies. So many brilliant roles. His performance in \u2018The Conversation\u2019 alone changed the way I looked at acting and what actors could bring to a role. Such an amazing career. RIP Mr. Hackman.\u201d \u2014 director Paul Feig on X.",
      "\u201cLoved you in everything! \u2018The Conversation,\u2019 \u2018The French Connection,\u2019 \u2018The Poseidon Adventure,\u2019 \u2018Unforgiven\u2019 \u2014tough yet vulnerable. You were one of the greats. God bless those who loved you. Rest well, sir.\u201d \u2014 actor Viola Davis on Instagram.",
      "\"One of the best, one of the very, very best, has passed. Everything you ever wanted to know and learn about the craft of screen acting could be found in any, ANY of his performances. \u2018The French Connection.\u2019 \u2018Crimson Tide,\u2019 \u2018The Conversation.\u2019 Gosh! I could go on\u2026 A master. \u2014 actor Steve Toussaint on Instagram.",
      "\u201cI am crushed by the sudden deaths of Gene Hackman and his wife Betsy Arakawa (and their dog). Crushed. He was always one of my favorites. Not many who beat to their own drums like he did. Rest in Peace.\u201d \u2014 actor Josh Brolin on Instagram.",

      "Last year\u2019s Oscars was by all accounts a successful show, with memorable performances and unscripted moments (thanks in part to Emma Stone\u2019s dress), and a winning movie that most people had seen. But the team behind last year\u2019s show is \u201caiming for the stars\u201d once more.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re feeling the pressure,\u201d said Oscars executive producer and showrunner Raj Kapoor. \u201cBut we\u2019re not ones to rest on our laurels. We always want to push the envelope.\u201d",
      "With just days to go until the three-and-a-half hour live broadcast, airing on ABC and streaming live on Hulu Sunday, March 2, the team behind the show gave The Associated Press a little insight into what to expect.",
      "\u201cWe want people when they watch the Oscars to be inspired by the films but also be inspired by the broadcast and feel something like it\u2019s a show that you can watch with your friends and your family and debate on who should have won and who is winning,\u201d Kapoor said. \u201cWe want people to have all the feels when they watch the show.\u201d",
      "One of the major things that the producers are excited about this year is their first-time host, Conan O\u2019Brien.",
      "\u201cThat alone brings this fresh, invigorated energy,\u201d Kapoor said. O\u2019Brien, he said, has been a \u201cwealth of ideas and imagination\u201d since he accepted the gig and that he and his team are going to keep writing up until the show \u2014 and as a veteran of live television, he's skilled at in-the-moment improvisation as well.",
      "\u201cHe is going to be this great, exciting, warm hug and guide us through the night,\u201d said Oscars executive producer Katy Mullan. \u201cHe\u2019s got some surprises up his sleeve, which is fantastic because we love to keep people guessing.\u201d",
      "The Oscars this year decided to nix performances of the original songs, but there will still be some big names gracing the stage including \u201cWicked\u201d stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo \u2014 though they\u2019re staying mum on whether any gravity will be defied in that performance.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been talking for months,\u201d Kapoor said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a moment that\u2019s been very special.\u201d",
      "Lisa of Blackpink and Doja Cat will also be part of the broadcast, and the producers promised a musical moment that will honor Los Angeles and filmmaking in Hollywood.",
      "The wildfires, Mullan said, will be acknowledged in the show.",
      "\u201cThe Grammys did an incredible job with their show and how it was treated,\u201d Mullan said. \u201cOur show being a month after that and Conan having been affected himself, we\u2019re just looking at the right way to calibrate it so that it feels like the right show for March 2 \u2014 that we do acknowledge it and reflect on it but also allow people the chance to step on that stage and have their moment and celebrate their talent.\"",
      "Last year the Oscars made a moment out of what is usually just a list of names by inviting past Oscar acting winners to speak about each of the nominees before the winner was read. This year it's back, but evolved. It won\u2019t be the actors this time, but some of the other categories that \u201cmaybe don\u2019t normally get the spotlight on the Oscar stage,\u201d Mullan said.",
      "She added: \u201cOur theme is all about collaboration and the alchemy of filmmaking and really taking a look behind the scenes and understanding a bit more of the interconnectedness of how a film comes together.\u201d",
      "First, Mullan said, it\u2019s only Wednesday \u2014 there\u2019s still time to catch the diverse group of 10 best picture nominees before Sunday if you really try. But don\u2019t fret if you\u2019ve only seen a few. The show could be a discovery event.",
      "\u201cIf you love the movies, like come to the Oscars and maybe you\u2019ll discover things that you actually have not seen yet but will want to,\u201d Kapoor said. \u201cHopefully you\u2019ll fall in love even with a few pictures while watching the show.\u201d",
      "Also? It's just full of major stars.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got some reunions that I think will hit people in the heart,\" Mullan said.",

      "A new album documents jazz legend Ella Fitzgerald in concert in Oakland, California, in 1967",
      "The setting is less grand than suggested by the title of a new Ella Fitzgerald album, \u201cThe Moment of Truth: Ella at the Coliseum.\u201d In this case, the coliseum is not in Rome or Los Angeles, but the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Arena in Oakland, California.",
      "Jazz giant Fitzgerald\u2019s presence elevated any event, however, and that was the case on June 30, 1967, when she performed at a concert that also included The Duke Ellington Orchestra and other luminaries.",
      "\u201cThe Moment of Truth\u201d documents Fitzgerald\u2019s set, and her incomparable alto is in typically fine form. She bounces and glides, blares and coos, bellows and whoops and scats and swings to the audience\u2019s delight. \u201cIf you love her, clap!\u201d someone shouts.",
      "The album, which will be released Friday, features performances of nine songs unearthed from the private tape collection of Verve Records founder Norman Granz. The vinyl release offers outstanding sound quality and extensive, informative liner notes by the critic Will Friedwald. He notes that while it was unusual for Fitzgerald to sing contemporary pop tunes, the set includes her only known performance of two classics from the mid-1960s \u2014 the Burt Bacharach and Hal David penned \"Alfie\u201d and Bob Crewe's \u201cMusic to Watch Girls By.\u201d",
      "Fitzgerald is accompanied by a piano trio, and on several songs by the Ellington orchestra, with whom she had a lengthy 1960s collaboration. Ellington doesn\u2019t play, however, and the understated arrangements leave the spotlight entirely to Fitzgerald. She\u2019s in a playful mood in her on stage banter, teasing a late arrival, impersonating Louis Armstrong, and ruling out a striptease.",
      "Her singing is radiant as she turns sophisticated melodies into a thrill ride. Their direction is as unpredictable as a pinball, with rhythmic daring and inventiveness that could make an arena sway. And it probably did.",
      "Fitzgerald flies high on \u201cMack the Knife,\u201d and displays jazzy verve on Benny Goodman\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Be That Way\u201d and the Tony Bennett staple \u201cThe Moment of Truth,\u201d while \u201cYou\u2019ve Changed\u201d shimmers with bluesy beauty. On \u201cLet\u2019s Do It (Let\u2019s Fall in Love),\u201d her phrasing is as clever as Cole Porter\u2019s lyrics. In her version, she injects references to the Beatles,James Bond, Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor.",
      "As Friedwald notes, Fitzgerald rarely drew from the Burt Bacharach-Hal David catalogue. But her interpretation of their classic ballad \u201cAlfie\u201d is a marvel of technique, emotional investment and creativity, including a brief digression. Fitzgerald navigates the complicated melody and rhythm with ease. It's an exemplar of the album, because as always, in keeping with the advice of the lyrics, her heart leads the way.",

      "New York musician Larry Saltzman isn't really a movie fan, but he'll be sure to watch the Oscars this year",
      "NEW YORK -- He's not a movie buff, so New York musician Larry Saltzman doesn't always watch the Oscars. This year, however, he's got a rooting interest.",
      "Saltzman taught actor Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet how to play guitar for the role of Bob Dylan in \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d In turn, Chalamet earned a best actor nomination and the film is also up for best picture at the Academy Awards on Sunday.",
      "A guitarist who's performed with Simon & Garfunkel, Bette Midler and David Johansen, as well as in the pit at Broadway productions \u201cHairspray\u201d and \u201cAin't Too Proud to Beg,\u201d Saltzman has developed a specialty in teaching actors how to play music for their roles. Besides Chalamet, recent pupils have included Adam Driver and Sadie Sink of \u201cStranger Things.\u201d",
      "On a fellow musician's recommendation, Saltzman first got a call from a movie studio about a decade ago. He admits to being cranky as discussions dragged on. \u201cI almost did everything to talk them out of hiring me,\u201d he said.",
      "Not until the fifth phone call did the studio identify the client: Meryl Streep.",
      "She needed to learn the electric guitar for her starring role in the 2015 film \u201cRicki and the Flash,\u201d where she portrayed an aging rocker trying to keep her career and life together in the wake of a series of disappointments.",
      "Working with Streep is a little like a political consultant's first client being elected president. If she likes you and word gets around, other students will follow. Teaching actors now represents about 40% of his business, the 69-year-old said.",
      "\u201cMy time spent with her was excellent,\u201d he said of Streep. \u201cShe's smart. She knows how to learn things. There was a steady progress over three or four months. She did very well.\u201d",
      "Faking it just won't do for serious actors and film directors. It's like lip-syncing \u2014 the audience is going to tell the difference, and the characters will be less believable. That was especially true with Chalamet, who needed to sing and play at the same time for a character whose artistry is the centerpiece of the film.",
      "\u201cWhen the actors come to you, they're kind of vulnerable,\u201d Saltzman said. \u201cThey want to do a great job.\u201d",
      "Saltzman had more than 50 sessions with Chalamet, starting in person and retreating to Zoom during the pandemic. It wasn't easy. Chalamet had to learn some 25 songs in the script.",
      "\u201cSometime in 2018 I had my first lesson with this great guitar teacher named Larry Saltzman who at some point became less of a teacher and more a co-sanity artist through COVID,\u201d Chalamet recalled during a recent interview with The Associated Press. \u201cI think we were keeping each other sane. We would Zoom three, four times a week and doing songs that never made it into the movie.\u201d",
      "It helped that Saltzman is a Dylan buff. Focusing on imparting \u201cthe guitar playing of \u2018pre-electric Bob,\u2019\u201d he taught his charge so well that Chalamet was a musical guest as well as host on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d performing obscure Dylan cuts last month. Saltzman says, in the course of their sessions, Chalamet \u201cwent the extra mile\u201d and unearthed \u201cvery early, obscure\u201d Dylan songs that weren't even in the script.",
      "Saltzman generally likes teaching actors more than common folk, in part because there's a specific goal: They need to learn certain songs to inhabit a particular character. When it's open-ended \u2014 someone just wants to learn the guitar \u2014 it can be more of a challenge, he said. Saltzman also believes that it's an advantage to not be a regular teacher, someone who may approach clients with a more rigid style.",
      "Actor Johnny Cannizzaro said he appreciated Saltzman's calming \u201cbedside manner\u201d and felt welcome in an apartment filled with guitars. Cannizzaro has the role of E Street Band member \u201cLittle Steven\u201d Van Zandt in the upcoming Bruce Springsteen biopic, \u201cDeliver Me From Nowhere.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere was never really a moment where he expressed any sort of frustration or impatience with me during a session,\u201d said Cannizzaro, who has background playing keyboards but not guitar. \u201cIf anything, he would express some excitement when you grasped something he was teaching. That put me at ease.\u201d",
      "Saltzman also studied film of Van Zandt so he wasn't just teaching Cannizzaro guitar \u2014 he was showing specifics of how Van Zandt plays, the actor said.",
      "Beyond teaching, Saltzman's time is divided between studio work, playing in New York clubs accompanying different artists and Broadway \u2014 he's just about to begin \u201cSmash.\u201d",
      "It's an eye-opening experience for him to later see his students on screen. That was particularly the case when he saw \u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d and marveled at Chalamet's ability as an actor.",
      "All the more reason to watch the Oscars, and to take some pride in his own work.",
      "\u201cIn my own humble way, I'm a small gear in that machinery,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is rewarding is knowing that in some small way I'm contributing to making a better film.\u201d",

      "Marcelo Rubens Paiva, a popular author in Brazil for four decades, has had intense days and exchanges since the movie based on his 2015 book \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d became a box-office success",
      "SAO PAULO -- Brazilian author Marcelo Rubens Paiva happily swung his wheelchair from side to side, dancing with thousands of Carnival revelers there to celebrate him and his work. Seconds later, an unidentified man showed Paiva his middle finger, then threw a beer can and a backpack that hit him in the head.",
      "Paiva, a popular author in Brazil for four decades, has had intense days and exchanges since the movie based on his 2015 book \u201cI'm Still Here\u201d became a box-office success. The film, a rare blockbuster in the South American nation, garnered three Oscar nominations ahead of the awards ceremony Sunday.",
      "While millions of Brazilians love the story for its long-overdue truth-telling about the country\u2019s 1964-1985 military dictatorship, others see it as left-wing propaganda. Paiva has been dismayed at the outpouring of hatred, mostly online, directed at him.",
      "\u201cIt is simply (our) history being told in the way we believe it must be told, the way our family lived it, so it never happens again,\u201d Paiva, 65, told The Associated Press in his Sao Paulo apartment. \u201cI assure you that some of those on the far-right or on the right have watched it and maybe changed their opinion.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d is up for best picture and best international feature, while Fernanda Torres, who portrayed Paiva's mother Eunice, is competing for best actress. The film centers on the disappearance of Rubens Paiva, the author's father, and Eunice's decadeslong quest to force authorities to confirm his death.",
      "Paiva, one of five siblings, has known success, but not as much controversy. His 1982 book \u201cHappy Old Year\u201d narrating his life before and after a diving accident put him in a wheelchair, sold more than 1.5 million copies. He is also an award-winning playwright, former TV talk show host and political activist.",
      "But he says nothing prepared him for the sudden impact \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d had since it won best screenplay at the Venice Film Festival. Many other awards followed since.",
      "\u201cThis is very different; it is more intense because of social networks,\" Paiva said. \u201cPeople (around the world) react in the same way to this movie, with the same emotion that Brazilians felt.\u201d",
      "After his book about his accident, he knew he still had another important story to tell.",
      "\u201cI was the son of a disappeared politician; few people knew what had happened during the dictatorship,\u201d he said.",
      "That was largely because Congress passed an amnesty law in 1979, as the dictatorship neared its end, sparing perpetrators of political crimes from prosecution.",
      "Cracks started to emerge in 2011 after then President Dilma Rousseff \u2014 a former guerrilla who was tortured during the dictatorship \u2014 established a national truth commission to investigate its abuses. It was one of the seeds for Paiva's book and, later, the film.",
      "\u201cPeople were asking for reparations for families of missing politicians, they sued my father\u2019s torturers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe military showed they were upset, because their colleagues and their fellow coup mongers were under fire. The accusations were being published, so they started to threaten Brazil\u2019s democracy. And little by little it was once again in doubt.\u201d",
      "Past ire toward the Paiva family has notably come from one man: Jair Bolsonaro, the former army captain who rode a wave of anti-establishment populism to his presidency (2019-2022).",
      "In 2014, then-lawmaker Bolsonaro spat on a statue of the late Paiva in Congress, accusing him and his family of being at the service of communist terrorists. His claims date to the 1990s and falsely link a farm the Paiva family owned, near where Bolsonaro grew up, to a guerrilla group.",
      "\u201cEvery year, he made a speech against my father, making up stories,\u201d Paiva said. \u201cOnce, he said my father had been killed by his comrades who were in the armed struggle, because he had revealed things during the torture sessions. It was the first time I heard anyone tell such an absurd story, with no evidence, and people believed it. It was the first time I saw the power of social media in creating a new narrative, a lie.\"",
      "Bolsonaro said in an interview Monday he hasn't seen the film, but his allies have railed against it, saying Paiva died in a war, as did many on both sides. Brazil\u2019s Truth Commission found that at least 434 people died at the hands of the military regime, including 136 who disappeared.",
      "Paiva published \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d as Alzheimer\u2019s disease washed away his mother\u2019s memory. Director Walter Salles bought the rights in 2017, but chose not to make the film during Bolsonaro's presidency. Last week, Brazil's prosecutor-general indicted Bolsonaro for allegedly staging a coup to remain in power. It included inciting a riot in capital Brasilia by encouraging his supporters to riot marking an echo of the Capitol insurrection in the U.S.",
      "\u201cPeople everywhere are afraid of watching their democracies become dictatorships,\" Paiva said. \"This movie glorifies democracy and the understanding that human rights, empathy are in short supply.\u201d",
      "Adding to Paiva's recent achievements since the film premiered, his father\u2019s death certificate, first obtained by his mother in 1996, was updated in January to go beyond mere confirmation to include: \u201cviolent death caused by the Brazilian State in the context of systematic persecution to the population identified as dissidents of the policies of the dictatorial regime installed in 1964.\u201d",
      "Brazil's Supreme Court said earlier this week it will rule whether the sole survivor among Rubens Paiva\u2019s torturers, Gen. Jos\u00e9 Ant\u00f4nio Nogueira Belham, can be tried. Brazilian human rights activists have argued that concealing bodies is a continuous crime not covered by the country\u2019s amnesty law.",
      "\u201cI see literature as a mission, and I feel mine was accomplished,\" said Paiva. \u201cThe movie\u2019s mission is accomplished, even if it doesn\u2019t win any Oscars.\u201d",

      "A routine deep-sea diving mission in the North Sea goes terribly wrong when a young diver is stranded some 300 feet below the surface in the new film \u201cLast Breath.\u201d",
      "A routine deep-sea diving mission in the North Sea goes terribly wrong when a young diver is stranded some 300 feet below the surface in the new film \u201cLast Breath.\u201d His umbilical cable has severed. The support vessel above is aimlessly drifting away from the site through violent, stormy waters. And the diver has only ten minutes of oxygen in his backup tank.",
      "As if that wasn\u2019t enough, it\u2019s also a true story.",
      "If merely reading this is giving you heart palpitations already, you can only imagine the white-knuckle experience of watching this all play out on the big screen. It\u2019s 40ish minutes of pure suspense and anxiety as the story shuffles between the man at the bottom of the ocean, Chris Lemons (Finn Cole), his fellow saturation divers (Woody Harrelson as Duncan and Simu Liu as Dave) in the diving bell below the waters who are unable to help and the crew in the support vessel above (including Cliff Curtis and Mark Bonnar) scrambling to get their systems back online and operational as the clock rapidly runs out. Ten minutes has never felt so short \u2014 and then it just gets worse as the clock starts counting up, showing Chris\u2019s time without oxygen.",
      "At one point, Liu\u2019s character Dave, a no-nonsense, all-business diver says matter-of-factly at that it\u2019s a body recovery, not a rescue. Deep-sea saturation diving is a dangerous business, described at the start of the film as the most dangerous job on earth. Chris tells his fianc\u00e9, in a short introduction, that it\u2019s no more dangerous than going to space. She replies that it\u2019s funny that he thinks that is comforting.",
      "The real incident happened in September 2012 \u2014 Dave, Duncan and Chris were just one team of divers sent to the ocean floor off the coast of Aberdeen, Scotland, to repair oil pipeline.",
      "The seas were particularly rough that day, with winds up to 35 knots, common for the North Sea but also not what one might call safe. Chris and Dave were in the middle of their work when they heard the urgent calls to abort: The dynamic positioning system in the support vessel above had failed and they were in drift. Chris scrambled to maneuver out of the pipeline corridors, but his umbilical got caught. For a brief, awful moment he\u2019s the anchor to the ship above, but soon enough the cord snapped, and he was thrown back to the ocean floor in pitch black with no coms, no heat and very little hope for survival. News articles about the incident clock his backup oxygen supply as being closer to five or six minutes \u2013 perhaps the movie wanted to give the audience a little buffer.",
      "If this sounds at all familiar, it may be because it was made into a documentary, also called \u201cLast Breath\u201d and released in 2019. While it was well-received, some true stories are just too gripping to exist solely in that form. It\u2019s not exactly a surprise that a narrative film was made as well. There\u2019s a good track record of recent complimentary adaptations \u2014 think Ron Howard\u2019s \u201c13 Lives\u201d and \u201cThe Rescue\u201d about the Thai boys soccer team stuck in the cave.",
      "This one was made by Alex Parkinson, the same director who co-directed the doc, and it\u2019s a well-executed narrative interpretation that doesn\u2019t get in its own way with padding. Harrelson gets to be the wise mentor who really doesn\u2019t want to lose someone on his last mission. Liu gets to flex his action muscles (literally and figuratively) in a modest but solid role. And they don't go out of their way to shoehorn in a villain \u2014 this is just a group of people trying their best to save a life.",
      "The only real problem, if one can even call it that, is that it\u2019s so short. The film doesn\u2019t take liberties with stretching out the timeline much at all and after 93 minutes, the whole thing is over. It feels strange to want a movie to be longer, but in the case of \u201cLast Breath\u201d I was both desperate for it to end, for anxiety reasons, and also wanting more.",
      "\u201cLast Breath,\u201d a Focus Features release in theaters Friday, is rated PG-13 Motion Picture Association for \u201cbrief strong language.\u201d Running time: 93 minutes. Three stars out of four."

      "LOS ANGELES -- Often when Robert Pattinson gets a script, one of the first things he does \u2014 to the annoyance of his girlfriend, Suki Waterhouse \u2014 is try on different voices to bring his character to life.",
      "\"I\u2019ve always had that sort of response to a script,\u201d he reflected, but said it became a practice while making his 2014 film, \u201cThe Rover.\u201d \u201cI think I feel very uncomfortable just doing something in my own accent. And for a while I felt like just doing an American accent felt like I was acting more.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s unsurprising, then, that when he was offered a starring role in \u201cMickey 17\u201d \u2014 director Bong Joon Ho\u2019s first feature film since his Oscar-winning \u201cParasite\u201d \u2014 Pattinson\u2019s wheels immediately began turning over what his character(s) would sound like.",
      "\u201cMickey 17,\u201d a Warner Bros. release hitting theaters March 7, tells the story of Mickey Barnes, a naive but sympathetic protagonist who signs up to be an \u201cexpendable\u201d in a world that makes use of \u201chuman printing\u201d for dangerous tasks and research. When an expendable dies on the job, another version of them is printed with their consciousness and memories of their death intact.",
      "But Mickey\u2019s immortality is threatened when a very different version of him is printed while the 17th Mickey is mistakenly believed to be dead.",
      "\u201cI needed to find an actor who could cover both personalities,\u201d Bong said through a translator, recalling Pattinson\u2019s performances in \u201cThe Lighthouse\u201d and \u201cGood Time\u201d as he considered the more sinister and conniving Mickey 18.",
      "The film is based on Edward Ashton's 2022 novel, \u201cMickey7.\u201d But Pattinson, who read the book before he got the script, said he still can\u2019t believe how different they are from one another. \u201cWhen I read the script and Bong\u2019s changes to it, I was like, \u2018How did you see this tone in this book at all?\u2019 It\u2019s very, very different tonally. But I thought it\u2019s fascinating to have that interpretation,\u201d he said.",
      "Although Pattinson was eager to work with the acclaimed Korean filmmaker, he wasn\u2019t given a lot of initial information about the movie or role. \u201cThe only thing I knew was that it was in English and that the part was impossible,\u201d Pattinson said, laughing.",
      "As he eventually gleaned more about the story and his character, ideas for Mickey \u2014 and Mickey\u2019s voices \u2014 began swirling around in his head.",
      "Pattinson envisioned slapstick montages of his myriad deaths \u00e0 la \u201cThe Tom and Jerry Show\u201d \u2014 but that portion of the film turned out to be much darker than he expected. One early idea for voices that Bong shut down was inspired by Steve-O and Johnny Knoxville \u2014 Pattinson was a devout \u201cJackass\u201d fan growing up and even repped a \u201cJackass\u201d T-shirt to school \u201calmost every day.\u201d",
      "But one initial idea the 38-year-old had did stick. \u201cMy first thought, on pretty much the first read of it, was, \u2018It\u2019s like Ren and Stimpy,\u2019\u201d he said of the irreverent animated Nickelodeon series from the 90's about a cat and dog.",
      "The dynamic between the two Mickeys is an apt comparison given Ren\u2019s short temper and diabolical nature (Mickey 18), which stands in stark contrast to Stimpy\u2019s naivete (Mickey 17). The similarities in their voices can also be heard.",
      "\u201cI kind of wanted to do this like cartoon character performance. You start out really, really extreme and then kind of gradually tone it down,\" he said of how he refined the characters. \u201cWhen directors just let you do stuff, you just come out of the box doing whatever and wherever your instinct is taking you.\"",
      "In addition to Pattison, the sci-fi comedy boasts an impressive cast, including Mark Ruffalo,Steven Yeun,Toni Collette and Naomi Ackie. Although Ackie, who plays Mickey\u2019s romantic partner in the film, hadn\u2019t worked with Pattinson before, she said they quickly hit it off.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re both quite similar in how we work, which is very chatty up until the point of \u2018Action,\u2019 and then we do the acting. And I really enjoy that kind of separation between character and self. I find it quite difficult to hold onto characters once there\u2019s no cameras on,\u201d she said.",
      "But it wasn\u2019t just Pattinson who made the experience a positive one for her. \u201cI\u2019m pretty certain you could ask anyone who works with Bong Joon Ho, \u2018Would you go back?\u2019 And they\u2019d be like, \u2018I\u2019d pay money.\u2019\u201d",
      "Despite the notoriety the director has reaped since \u201cParasite\u201d racked up four Oscars in 2020, including best picture and best director, Bong said the experience hasn't changed him.",
      "\u201cIt was fun and exciting to meet with all these famous artists and filmmakers during the campaign, but I didn\u2019t feel like I was like on cloud nine. It was actually very mentally and physically exhausting because the campaign is so long and I just remember thinking, \u2018Wow, this is really tough,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cWe kept just like handing each other vitamins.\u201d"

      "A London judge has dismissed part of a lawsuit against the British band The 1975 over the lead singer\u2019s gay kiss that led Malaysian authorities to shut down a music festival",
      "LONDON -- Members of the British band The 1975 cannot be held personally liable for losses of a Malaysian music festival that was shut down by authorities after lead singer Matty Healy kissed a male bandmate on stage, a London judge ruled Monday.",
      "The organizer of the Good Vibes Festival is seeking 1.9 million pounds ($2.4 million) in losses after Healy criticized the country's anti-homosexuality laws and then kissed bassist Ross MacDonald at the Kuala Lumpur show in July 2023.",
      "Footage of the kiss sparked a backlash in the predominantly Muslim country, where homosexuality is a crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison and caning. Some LGBTQ+ groups also criticized the band for endangering its community and disrupting the work of activists pushing for change.",
      "Future Sound Asia sued The 1975 Productions LLP in the High Court over breach of contract and said its four members owed a duty of care. But the band\u2019s lawyer argued that the suit should only target the company \u2014 not the musicians.",
      "Judge William Hansen said the claims against the band members were \"bad as a matter of law and that there is no good reason why the matter should go to trial.\" He allowed the case to proceed against the company, but ordered FSA to pay 100,000 pounds ($126,000) in legal costs.",
      "Band attorney Edmund Cullen had argued the claim was an \u201cillegitimate, artificial and incoherent\u201d attempt \u201cto pin liability on individuals\u201d because FSA only had a contract with the band's company.",
      "FSA\u2019s attorney Andrew Burns said authorities had initially refused to let the band perform because of reports about Healy\u2019s drug addiction and subsequent recovery. They relented after the band promised he would follow guidelines and regulations, he said.",
      "When the band played the same festival in 2016, they had agreed not to swear, smoke, drink, take off clothes or talk about religion and politics on stage, Burns said.",
      "Burns said the band deliberately provoked Malaysian authorities in 2023 by smuggling a bottle of wine on stage, and through Healy's \u201cobscene speech\u201d and the kiss. He said the band also performed a \u201csecond-rate set of songs\u201d to upset the crowd.",
      "\u201cThey could be argued to have been on a frolic of their own rather than simply acting within the course of their ordinary role as LLP members,\" Burns said.",
      "The band was supposed to be paid $350,000 (276,000 pounds) for a one-hour set, Burns said.",
      "The show wasn't the first time Healy made a political statement in the name of LGBTQ+ rights: he kissed a male fan at a 2019 concert in the United Arab Emirates, which outlaws same-sex sexual activity.",
      "After the show in the Malaysian capital, The 1975 canceled its concerts in Taiwan and Jakarta, Indonesia.",
      "The Malaysian government has blacklisted the band."

      "NEW YORK -- Award-winning singer-musician Rhiannon Giddens has become the latest artist to call off an appearance at the Kennedy Center, which has been in upheaval since President Donald Trump forced out the center's leadership and was elected chair of the board of trustees.",
      "Trump's takeover of the center is part of his broad campaign against \u201cwoke\u201d culture.",
      "\u201cI have decided to cancel my show at The Kennedy Center on May 11, 2025 and move it to The Anthem,\u201d she wrote on social media, referring to a separate Washington, D.C. venue. \u201cThe Kennedy Center show was booked long before the current administration decided to take over this previously bipartisan institution.\u201d",
      "Giddens is an eclectic roots music performer known for co-founding the Carolina Chocolate Drops and for such collaborations with Francesco Turrisi as the Grammy winning \u201cThey're Calling Me Home.\u201d In 2022, she helped write the Pulitzer Prize winning opera \u201cOmar.\u201d She is also a recipient of a MacArthur \u201cGenius\u201d grant.",

      "Supported by government money and private donations and attracting millions of visitors each year, the Kennedy Center is a 100-foot high complex featuring a concert hall, opera house and theater, along with a lecture hall, meeting spaces and a \u201cMillennium Stage\u201d that has been the site for free shows.",

    "story": [
      "The great Roberta Flack has died",
      "NEW YORK -- In an era where popular music is fluid, it is easy to forget the listening world was not always so open. Unless, of course, Roberta Flack's career is closely examined.",
      "Flack, whose intimate vocal and musical style made her one of the top recording artists of the 1970s and an influential performer long after, died Monday. She leaves behind a rich repertoire of music that avoids categorization. Her debut, \u201cFirst Take,\u201d wove soul, jazz, flamenco, gospel and folk into one revelatory package, prescient in its form and measured in its approach.",
      "Flack will likely be remembered for her classics \u2014 \u201cThe First Time I Ever Saw Your Face\u201d and \"Killing Me Softly with His Song\u201d among them. As she should be. But her talents extend well beyond the familiar titles.",
      "Read on and then listen to all of the tracks on our Spotify playlist, here.",
      "Picking one standout from \u201cFirst Take\u201d is a fool's errand, but listeners would be wise to spend time with Flack's cover of the Leonard Cohen classic \u201cHey, That's No Way to Say Goodbye,\u201d a strong case for a reimagination eclipsing the original. Her voice transforms Cohen's lament. It's almost impossible to believe this song, let alone the entire record, was recorded over a period of just 10 hours at Atlantic Studios in New York in February 1969. But it was.",
      "Also from \u201cFirst Take\" is \u201cAngelitos Negros,\" performed entirely in Spanish by Flack. It's a song based on a poem by the Venezuelan writer Andr\u00e9s Eloy Blanco titled \u201cP\u00edntame Angelitos Negros,\" with a title lifted from the 1948 Mexican film of the same name.",
      "The movie navigates interracial relationships when a white couple gives birth to a dark-skinned child. Beyond Flack's soaring vocal performance \u2014 delivered atop a robust string section and nylon-string guitars \u2014 the song serves as an anthem against racial discrimination and a stunning example of the singer's cross-boundary approach to music making.",
      "As the well-documented lore suggests, Roberta Flack's mainstream success story begins when her dreamy cover of \u201cThe First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,\" written by English folk artist Ewan MacColl for his wife Peggy Seeger, was used in a love scene between Clint Eastwood and Donna Mills in his 1971 film \u201cPlay Misty for Me.\"",
      "It quickly topped the Billboard pop chart in 1972 and received a Grammy for record of the year. But her relationship with the song, and her singular ability to bring it to such great heights, was almost kismet. Before recording the ballad, she had real familiarity with it, having taught it while working with a glee club during her years as an educator.",
      "It is Flack's best-known hit and one of the great love songs of the 20th Century. Flack first heard Lori Lieberman\u2019s \u201cKilling Me Softly with His Song\u201d while on a plane and immediately fell in love with it. While on tour with Quincy Jones, she covered the song, and the audience feel in love with it, too, as they'd continue to for decades.",
      "Her voice is otherworldly in her recording \u2014 pinpointing a kind of neo-soul R&B that would dominate for years to come \u2014 and she was recognized for it. Flack became the first artist to win consecutive Grammys for best record with this one.",
      "The song would win again in the \u201890s, when hip-hop trio the Fugees\u2019 would offer their masterful take on Flack's cover and introduce much of the world to singer Lauryn Hill's gift.",
      "A standard for R&B and jazz musicians alike \u2014 no doubt due to the grandeur of Flack's version \u2014 \u201cFeel Like Makin' Love\u201d is her third career No. 1. It's a mediative seduction, Flack embodying each lyrical vignette in her delivery. \u201cStrollin\u2019 in the park / Watchin\u2019 winter turn to spring,\u201d she opens the song, \u201cWalkin\u2019 in the dark / Seein\u2019 lovers do their thing.\u201d",
      "A soulful collaboration with her close friend Donny Hathaway, \u201cThe Closer I Get to You,\" is a reflective romance, both big-voiced and bigger-hearted singers lifting each other up. But despite its splendor, the song's legacy is marred in tragedy: In 1979, Flack and Hathaway started work on an album of duets when he suffered a breakdown during recording and fell to his death from his hotel room in Manhattan.",
      "The '80s brought soft rock detouring for Flack, another experimentation for the innovative performer. \u201cTonight, I Celebrate My Love,\" a duet with the R&B balladeer Peabo Bryson, is at the intersection of a few genres and simultaneously timeless \u2014 a feat for a song anchored in shimmery, synthetized production.",
      "In her later career, Flack continued to meet the current moment. A great example is \u201cSet the Night to Music,\u201d a glossy pop song with English singer Maxi Priest. It was released on her 1991 album of the same name, which also features a then-contemporary cover of Philadelphia soul group The Stylistics' 1970s R&B hit \u201cYou Make Me Feel Brand New.\""

      "According to Grammy Award-winner Chandrika Tandon and other devotional musicians, the melodic repetition of Vedic mantras, often associated with the many names of the tradition\u2019s various deities, has proved to calm the mind for centuries",
      "(RNS) \u2014 The winner of the 2025 Grammy Award for best new age, ambient or chant album \u2014 a category once dominated by Enya \u2014 was an album titled \u201cTriveni,\u201d meaning \u201cthe confluence of three rivers\u201d in Sanskrit, an apt description for its weaving of Vedic chants, melodic flute and cello by India\u2019s Chandrika Tandon, South Africa\u2019s Wouter Kellerman and Japan\u2019s Eru Matsumoto.",
      "The name, which is given to the meeting point of the holy Ganges, Yamuna and Saraswati rivers, said singer Tandon, came to her in one of her daily meditations.",
      "\u201cIt was a beautiful coincidence that our album called Triveni won the Grammy on Vasant Panchami when the Maha Prayag was going on,\u201d Tandon told RNS, referring to the ongoing Maha Kumbh Mela festival held where the three rivers meet in Prayagraj, India, considered one of the holiest pilgrimage sites in the nation. The world\u2019s largest gathering of humanity, with 400 million people attending this year, the Kumbh Mela happens every 12 years, with this year\u2019s celebration, the Maha Kumbh Mela, happening only every 144 years, when the sun, the moon and Jupiter align.",
      "\u201cThink what you like, say what you like, but one has to just smile at this incredible coincidence,\u201d Tandon said.",
      "___",
      "This content is written and produced by Religion News Service and distributed by The Associated Press. RNS and AP partner on some religion news content. RNS is solely responsible for this story.",
      "___",
      "Tandon was a prominent business mogul for more than half her life, the namesake of New York University\u2019s Tandon School of Engineering and sister to former PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi. Twenty-five years ago, however, Tandon faced what she describes as a \u201ccrisis of spirit.\u201d",
      "\u201cI knew I had everything, and yet I felt like I had nothing,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I died today, what is it that I want to have accomplished? Is it just more money, more climbing up the ladder, or was there something else that would just give me happiness and make each day complete?\u201d",
      "That something else, she found, was devotional music. Pulling from the mantras she once heard as a little girl in Chennai, Tandon found a new purpose in creating melodies and \u201cpraying into the notes\u201d as a form of meditation. \u201cMusic helped me find myself,\u201d said Tandon, the creator of six albums of her own.",
      "And according to Tandon, the Grammy win signifies a larger cultural moment, helping young people all over the world discover the \u201cextraordinary gems\u201d of the ancient Vedic traditions. \u201cInstead of a traditional Indian ornate piece of jewelry, I\u2019ve simply put them in a completely Western jewelry setting,\u201d said Tandon. \u201cSuddenly it\u2019s more apparent, it\u2019s more discernible, more relatable. And suddenly there\u2019s this curiosity about, \u2018What is that? It makes me feel so good!\u2019\u201d",
      "According to Tandon and other devotional musicians, the melodic repetition of Vedic mantras, often associated with the many names of the tradition\u2019s various deities, has proved to calm the mind for centuries. The 21st is no different, they say, as they see a burgeoning space for the spiritually curious youth seeking a respite from the fast-paced internet culture they grew up in. Now, a new generation of kirtan artists is leading the charge on Hindu sacred music.",
      "Amid confusing times, says devotional musician Gaura Vani, Generations Z and X have found a way to articulate their complicated emotions and feelings through the call-and-response style of kirtans, the devotional songs commonly associated with the Hare Krishna faith.",
      "\u201cThis is almost a miraculous thing to say, but in this world of social media and phone addiction and all that, the kids in the Krishna community are doing the craziest thing: Without anyone telling them to, they will find a weekend where everyone\u2019s free, they will dress to the nines together, and find a temple or a space where they will do kirtans for, like, 10 hours straight,\u201d he told RNS. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy. It makes no sense in the modern world, but they\u2019re doing it.\u201d",
      "Vani, born into an American Hare Krishna family, just performed his first solo live concert at Mumbai\u2019s Royal Opera House in late January. Once the head of the successful early 2000s \u201cKrishna-conscious\u201d rock band As Kindred Spirits, Vani joined musicians from the East and the West for a fusion of world music, mantra, pop and rock. \u201cIt\u2019s all about spiritual stories and spiritual music from around the globe,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of my jam.\u201d",
      "Some form of singing or chanting takes place in almost every Hindu tradition, says Vani, but the bhakti, or devotional, tradition practiced by members of the International Society of Krishna Consciousness, or ISKCON, places an emphasis on music as a way to connect with the Divine, and \u201cas a way to create harmony, peace in the world, peace in oneself and to heal both spiritually and physically.\u201d",
      "The Maha Mantra, a repetition of the words \u201cHare,\u201d or praise, \u201cKrishna\u201d and \u201cRama,\u201d set to any melody the singer, or kirtaniya, chooses, is an ISKCON staple. This Sanskrit call-and-response, with the names of God sung alongside a harmonium and a mridanga, a type of drum, says Vani, can lead participants to a \u201cflow state\u201d where it may feel like \u201cmusic is kind of descending from the heavens and coming out through you.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the closest thing to ecstasy I\u2019ve ever experienced,\u201d said Vani.",
      "Steeped in this tradition since birth, Vani and his wife, a trained Indian classical dancer, have now surrounded their three teenage children with song and dance. But as Vani has taught his kids, spiritual meaning is not limited to kirtans: \u201cIf you look for it, spiritual music is all around us, in all cultures,\u201d he said, from gospel to Sufi Zikr to praise music from South Africa. And, says Vani, it\u2019s in his daily playlist of Nora Jones, George Harrison, the Talking Heads and The Police. (The latter\u2019s song \u201cSpirits in the Material World\u201d is, he said, a personal family favorite.)",
      "Premanjali Dejager, a 24-year-old \u201cKrishna kid\u201d \u2014 a term of endearment for those raised in a Hare Krishna household \u2014 lives in New York\u2019s Bhakti Center ashram and doesn\u2019t go a day without chanting the Maha Mantra a few times. The kirtaniya, who grew up in Australia, says kirtans can feel like a \u201cspiritual dance party,\u201d where \u201cteenage angst\u201d and \u201cclub dance moves\u201d meet in a safe, nondestructive environment.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re in the midst of it, like, when someone is really singing from their heart and, like, really connecting, you feel that sense of connection in the room,\u201d Dejager, who grew up in Australia, told RNS. \u201cIt\u2019s just contagious.\u201d",
      "Dejager has sung around the world with her guru Indradyumna Swami, known as the Travelling Monk, since graduating gurukul, or \u201cspiritual high school,\u201d in 2018. But, she said, she wasn\u2019t always so musically inclined. \u201cI was actually a really terrible singer,\u201d she said, recalling that she was removed from her primary school\u2019s singing group because she \u201cjust couldn\u2019t sing on key.\u201d",
      "Yet taking singing lessons in jazz and pop music grew Dejager\u2019s confidence, and she started posting devotional singing videos on social media, some of them \u201creally cringy.\u201d Today, she has more than 50,000 Instagram followers and her own virtual kirtan school, where she has, since 2021, taught other aspiring singers over Zoom that what\u2019s important is \u201cbeing real,\u201d or coming as you are to the devotional practice.",
      "\u201cSometimes, if I\u2019m feeling really sad or going through something difficult or having to make a difficult decision, that\u2019s what\u2019s on my mind,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019ll just be a prayer offering of like, \u2018Krishna, I need your help here. I need your guidance.\u2019 And sometimes it does happen where I\u2019m having to catch myself from like spacing out, and my mind goes everywhere. It is a practice of constantly trying to bring the mind back and just trying to bring my heart into the picture.\u201d",
      "Nikita Bhasin, a California native, considers herself more spiritual than religious. A certified yoga instructor since the age of 17, Bhasin was raised attending and singing devotionals at the Kali Mandir in Laguna Beach \u2014 a common story of being \u201cdragged along by my family.\u201d",
      "\u201cI left all the kirtan stuff behind because I was older and I didn\u2019t have to do what my parents told me to do,\u201d Bhasin, 27, told RNS.",
      "But Bhasin eventually found her way back to the music, when she learned yoga from an instructor who began practice with the same chants she heard as a child, but in a \u201cmore digestible\u201d 10-minute format rather than the three hours she spent at the temple. She took up the harmonium and now opens and closes each of her yoga classes in New York, barring if they are in a gym setting, with a Sanskrit chant, often to the theme of the asanas, or postures, such as repeating \u201cJai Ma,\u201d or hail Mother Earth, in a class about \u201cbalancing opposition.\u201d",
      "Many of her students have never chanted before, holding varying beliefs (or no beliefs) about God, some coming only for the physical asanas of yoga. Bhasin invites them to \u201cput their own spin\u201d on the ancient practice.",
      "\u201cA lot of these chants, you are chanting to something higher than yourself,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a lot of interpretations of that. There\u2019s thousands of lineages that think of God or divine as something different: Divine could be a hug from your friend, or it could be feeling like you\u2019re not on autopilot and are grateful and connecting with people in your life.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been interesting, because a lot of people tell me after class that they haven\u2019t sung since they were like 10 years old, and this is how they\u2019re coming back to their body and coming back to this childlike spirit of just letting go,\u201d she said."

      "The stories of two nurses who survived a gunman's attack on an intensive care unit in a York, Pennsylvania, hospital are being shared in Facebook posts that reveal new details",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- A nurse who survived an armed man\u2019s attack on an intensive care unit in a Pennsylvania hospital said in a Facebook post on Wednesday that she was held against him as a shield at gunpoint, arms zip-tied behind her back, as they walked through a doorway and encountered a phalanx of responding police officers.",
      "Nurse Tosha Trostle wrote that she had begged the attacker to let her go and that he pushed the gun against her neck and spine. When they encountered police, she prayed as she heard gunshots and smelled smoke, then heard bullet casings hitting the floor, she wrote.",
      "\u201cI eventually fell into the floor under the weight of the shooter\u2019s body. The officers told me to run. I struggled to get out from under him,\u201d Trostle wrote. \u201cI remember his limp cold hand against my face as I pushed away with my feet.\u201d",
      "She fell twice trying to get to her feet before an officer guided her into another room.",
      "Phone and Facebook messages were left for Trostle on Wednesday. A nurse from the hospital who didn\u2019t want to be identified by name because they weren\u2019t authorized to discuss the events confirmed the posting was from Trostle\u2019s Facebook account.",
      "Authorities say Diogenes Archangel-Ortiz, 49, brought a gun and zip ties to UPMC Memorial Hospital in York on Saturday morning and was holding hostages when responding officers fatally shot him.",
      "West York Patrolman Andrew Duarte, 30, was shot and killed. Two other officers and three hospital employees were wounded, authorities said.",
      "Trostle recounted that she had been drawing blood when she heard a commotion and went into a hallway.",
      "\u201cAfter all I thought I was responding to a staff assist, patient fall, one in a dozen possible occurrences; not an active shooter. When I rounded the corner of the back hall I was met in the distance by the shooter holding my coworker, Jess, at gunpoint,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Her colleague, Jessica Breighner, was forced to zip-tie her.",
      "\u201cI saw the fear in her eyes, fear does not sound like enough really though,\u201d Trostle wrote.",
      "The attacker\u2019s shoes became etched into Trostle\u2019s mind as she lay at his feet, thinking the gun might have jammed and then hearing him reload, she added.",
      "\u201cSo many things happened I cannot recount step by step,\" she wrote, \"but how I remember those red sneakers.\"",
      "Jason Huff, Breighner\u2019s partner of more than 20 years, also described the incident in a separate Facebook post on Wednesday that said the attacker had pulled the trigger three times with the gun against Breighner\u2019s head, but it was apparently out of ammunition.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s when she knew it was time to take her shot,\u201d Huff wrote. \u201cShe broke her zip ties while he reloaded and ran -- thank God.\u201d",
      "Huff told The Associated Press she hopes to talk publicly about it later, with the others who survived the attack.",
      "Huff wrote on Facebook that before fleeing, Breighner had to \u201clisten to this criminal call and warn someone to clean out the apartment and get the jewelry because he\u2019s not coming home and was ready to die.\u201d",
      "York County District Attorney Tim Barker said Saturday that Archangel-Ortiz appeared to have had recent contact with the intensive care unit \u201cfor a medical purpose involving another person\u201d but declined to elaborate.",
      "Asked about the nurses\u2019 accounts, a UPMC spokesperson said the health system prioritizes safety and privacy but referred questions to law enforcement.",
      "Trostle said the attacker \u201chauled me off the floor pushing me into the adjacent wall,\u201d where Breighner's photo was among pictures of the group\u2019s leadership on the wall.",
      "\u201cPushing the gun into my neck and spine. I begged to go home to my children. He petted my head and promised I would that I was doing everything right,\u201d Trostle wrote.",
      "She said he directed her to take him to the floor where the most people were. As they went through a doorway, they encountered what she called \u201ca wall of armed officers aimed at us.\u201d",
      "After the shooting, she was led down a stairway. In the days since, the memory has haunted Trostle and her family, she said.",
      "\u201cMy physical injuries do not even compare fractionally to what injuries are unseen,\u201d Trostle wrote. \u201cI live with immense sadness and guilt of all who responded, their mental and physical injuries. Especially, brave Officer Andrew Duarte that gave his life to bring us home.\u201d",

      "The Department of Veterans Affairs has temporarily suspended billions of dollars in contract cuts after an uproar that critical veterans health services were harmed, lawmakers and veterans service organizations said Wednesday",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Department of Veterans Affairs has temporarily suspended billions of dollars in planned contract cuts following concerns that the move would hurt critical veterans' health services, lawmakers and veterans service organizations said Wednesday.",
      "The pause affects hundreds of VA contracts that Secretary Doug Collins a day earlier described as simply consulting deals, whose cancellation would save $2 billion as the Trump administration works to slash costs across the federal government.",
      "\u201cNo more paying consultants to do things like make Power Point slides and write meeting minutes!\u201d Collins posted to X Tuesday, in a post that was then lauded by Elon Musk, President Donald Trump's cost-cutting chief at the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.",
      "The Associated Press has obtained the full list of 875 affected contracts, which shows the cuts would affect everything from cancer care to the ability to assess toxic exposure. The list underscores how the Trump administration\u2019s approach to broad spending reductions has immediate and potentially unintended consequences, generating significant concern not just among Democrats but also Republican lawmakers.",
      "The VA said in a statement to the AP that its review of the contracts \u201cis ongoing and not final.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will not be eliminating any benefits or services to Veterans or VA beneficiaries, and there will be no negative impact to VA health care, benefits or beneficiaries. We are always going to take care of Veterans at VA. Period,\u201d VA press secretary Pete Kasperowicz said in a statement.",
      "One contract that was on the chopping block supports assessing veterans' disability ratings. Those evaluations are one of the most important steps needed for a veteran to qualify to have their medical care covered and receive financial compensation if they were wounded due to their military service. An inaccurate rating can have a long-term impact on their access to care and financial support.",
      "Another contract is intended to identify and integrate data between the Pentagon, VA and other agencies to support the Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act of 2022, a bill passed in 2022 to increase veterans\u2019 access to care.",
      "Some of the other contracts marked for cancellation also directly affect veterans' care.",
      "At a joint House and Senate hearing Wednesday with veterans services organizations, Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal submitted a partial list of the affected contracts his office had received and submitted it for the congressional record.",
      "If carried out, these cuts \u201cwill harm veterans and taxpayers for years to come,\u201d Blumenthal said in a statement.",
      "In an internal VA email sent Tuesday and seen by the AP, a VA contracting official said DOGE targeted contracts broadly categorized as \u201cconsulting\u201d but they included ones that if terminated would halt chemotherapy and imaging services.",
      "Contracts to calibrate radiation detection equipment, to support cancer care and veterans cemetery management, among others were also targeted. Another would directly affect the ability to assess toxic exposure because it supports more than 24,000 research requests to look through the National Archives and Records Administration and other government sources to validate service and toxic exposure events.",
      "Former VA Secretary David Shulkin, who served in the Trump administration in his first term, said that while the agency has gotten larger and there are likely savings to be found, the VA grew, in part, to meet the large expansion of veterans enrolling to get care under the PACT Act. More than 740,000 veterans signed up for coverage after the law passed, according to a September 2024 VA press release.",
      "\u201cI do think slowing down and pausing to see what the consequences are, even if they are unintended consequences, is important to do,\u201d Shulkin told The Associated Press.",
      "Veterans service organizations called for \u201dimmediate transparency\u201d on what contracts were affected.",
      "\u201cWith funding suddenly stripped from contractors processing claims, conducting medical screenings and expanding outreach, there are growing concerns veterans will face delays, denials and disruptions in accessing critical services,\u201d said Rosie Torres, executive director of Burn Pits 360.",
      "The group advocates for veterans who face life-altering respiratory illnesses and cancers due to toxic exposure to dangerous air particle matter generated from massive trash-burning fires at overseas bases.",
      "The Washington Post was first to report on the cancellations.",

      "\u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe,\u201d starring Natalie Morales and Sonequa Martin-Green, confronts a dark reality of post-combat struggle with as much humor and playfulness as it does trauma and sorrow",
      "Even for a film titled \u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe,\u201d the opening scenes of Kyle Hausmann-Stoke\u2019s movie have a startling rhythm.",
      "First, two female American soldiers are riding in a Humvee in Afghanistan 2016 blasting Rihanna\u2019s \u201cUmbrella.\u201d They are clearly friends, and more concerned with the music coming through loudly than enemy fire. Merit (Natalie Morales) tells Zoe (Sonequa Martin-Green) that they ever set foot in \u201csome dopy group therapy,\" to please kill her.",
      "Cut to years later, they\u2019re sitting in a counseling meeting for veterans and Morales\u2019 character has a sour look at her face. She turns to her friend: \u201cDid we survive the dumbest war of all time just to sit here all broken and kumbaya and ouchie-my-feelings?\u201d",
      "But after this rush of cavalier soldiering and bitter sarcasm comes a sobering moment. Merit blinks her eyes and is instead staring at an empty chair. Zoe isn\u2019t there at all.",
      "\u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe,\u201d co-starring Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris, confronts a dark reality of post-combat struggle with as much humor and playfulness as it does trauma and sorrow. It comes from a real place, and you can tell. Hausmann-Stoke is himself a veteran and \u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe\u201d is dedicated to a pair of his platoon mates who committed suicide. The opening titles note the film was \u201cinspired by a true story.\u201d",
      "Audience disinterest has characterized many, though not all, of the films about the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, and the output has pretty much dried up over the years. \u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe\u201d feels like it was made with an awareness of that trend and as a rebuke to it.",
      "This is an often breezy and funny movie for what, on paper, is a difficult and dark story. But the comic tone of \u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe\u201d is, itself, a spirited rejection to not just the heaviness of many films about veterans but of the grief that can consume those who have dealt with loss and post-traumatic stress disorder.",
      "Throughout the film, Zoe appears only to Merit, ala Brad Pitt in \u201cFight Club,\u201d singing alongside her as she drives or impatiently waiting for Merit to come home from a run. Whether this, following some unspecified end to Zoe, is a healthy thing or not for Merit is increasingly in doubt. Merit needs to cling to her friend, or her memory of her. But Zoe also rolls her eyes at any suggestion of talking through her feelings. Zoe, as an apparition, is both the cause and relief to her pain.",
      "There are a few other points of view, courtesy of two of our finest actors. Freeman plays the counselor of Merit\u2019s mandatory group sessions. He refuses to let Zoe coast. To pressure her to share and participate, he threatens withholding Zoe's certification.",
      "Meanwhile, Merit\u2019s grandfather, Dale (Harris), a Vietnam vet, has just been diagnosed with early Alzheimer\u2019s. Merit is tasked with keeping an eye on him at his rural lakeside cabin and helping him into a retirement community \u2014 a prospect that infuriates him. As Merit\u2019s original inspiration for joining the army, Dale \u2014 stubborn and tight-lipped \u2014 epitomizes an earlier generation of soldier.",
      "In toggling between the present and wartime flashbacks, \u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe\u201d is sometimes a bumpy ride. The interplay between Merit and Zoe also shifts, beginning more like a buddy comedy and veering toward horror-film haunting, especially when Merit hesitantly agrees to a date with a worker at the prospective retirement home (Utkarsh Ambudkar).",
      "But the movie\u2019s earnestness carries it through these less smooth moments. So does the cast. Any opportunity to see Freeman or Harris, still at the top of their games, is a chance to be treasured. Freeman is typically sage and Harris characteristically fiery. But the leads are even better. Morales is at her finest as a cynical soldier, devoted to her friend but little else. And with compelling poise, Martin-Green (\"The Walking Dead\") carries a movie that at times can feel scattershot but never not sincere.",
      "\u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe,\u201d a Briarcliff Entertainment release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for language. Running time: 101 minutes. Three stars out of four."

      "The number of babies born in South Korea has rebounded for the first time in nine years",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- The number of babies born in South Korea rebounded for the first time in nine years in 2024, welcome news for a country grappling with one of the the world\u2019s most serious demographic crises.",
      "South Korea\u2019s statistics agency said Wednesday that 238,300 babies were born last year, an increase of 8,300 from a year earlier. It said the country\u2019s fertility rate \u2014 the average number of babies born to each woman in their reproductive years \u2014 was 0.75 in 2024, up from 0.72 in 2023.",
      "It\u2019s the first time that the yearly number of births has increased since 2015.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say this is a considerably meaningful rebound,\u201d Choi Yoon Kyung, an expert at the Korea Institute of Child Care and Education, said Thursday. \u201cWe still have to see figures in the next few years to find whether it was a temporary rebound or it was driven by structural changes.\u201d",
      "Park Hyun Jung, a senior official at the Statistics Korea, said that her agency assessed the increase in births was partly attributable to an increase in marriages among couples who delayed weddings during the COVID-19 pandemic period.",
      "Park said that another factor behind the rebound was a growing number of people entering their early 30s. She also cited a government survey showing a small increase in the number of young people hoping to have children after marriage.",
      "Official data show South Korea\u2019s fertility rate has been the lowest in the developed world in recent years. In 2022, it was the only country whose fertility rate was below 1 among members of the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.",
      "The low fertility rate poses a major potential threat to South Korea\u2019s economy, Asia's fourth largest, as it will cause labor shortages and greater welfare spendings. South Korea\u2019s central and regional governments have been increasingly offering a variety of financial incentives and other support programs to those who give birth to children.",
      "But experts say that it will be extremely difficult to address the country's demographic challenges as young people don't want to have babies, owing to a mix of factors that make it difficult to raise them in the brutally competitive, fast-changing country. They cite expensive housing, low levels of social mobility, the huge cost of raising and educating children and a culture that requires women to handle far more of childcare.",
      "Park said that the fertility rate will likely stay on an upward trend at least for another year. But observers say it remains to be seen whether the rate will go back down as post-pandemic marriages even out. The country\u2019s demographic structure will also eventually see a drop in people in their early 30s.",
      "Some experts argue that the government should focus on supporting young couples who want to have babies, rather than providing broad programs meant to address diverse social problems.",
      "\u201cThere are still people with solid wills to have a family and babies. When we help them realize their hopes, our fertility rate won\u2019t suffer a steep, 45-degree drop,\u201d Choi said."

      "BANGKOK -- The U.S. registered its first death from measles since 2015 this week, as a child who wasn\u2019t vaccinated died in a measles outbreak in rural West Texas.",
      "Normally, most U.S. cases are brought into the country by people who have traveled overseas. So far, Texas state officials have reported 124 cases. New Mexico has reported nine.",
      "Experts point to declining measles vaccination rates worldwide since the COVID-19 pandemic. In the United States, most states now are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners \u2014 the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.",
      "Britain reported 2,911 confirmed measles cases in 2024, the highest number of cases recorded annually, since 2012.",
      "Measles cases in the United States last year were nearly double the total for all of 2023, raising concerns about the preventable, once-common childhood virus. Health officials confirmed measles cases in at least 18 states in 2024, including in New York City, Philadelphia and Chicago.",
      "\"Measles anywhere is a threat everywhere,\" the U.S. Centers for Disease Control say on their website.",
      "Here's a brief look at the global measles situation.",
      "According to the World Health Organization, an estimated 10.3 million people were infected with measles in 2023 and 107,500 died. Most were unvaccinated people or children younger than five. Cases were most common in parts of Africa, the Middle East and Asia where incomes are low and health services insufficient.",
      "In places where measles have largely been eradicated, cases have been spread by travelers from other countries.",
      "While measles-related deaths declined slightly in 2023, the number of outbreaks increased. Major outbreaks took place in 57 countries in 2023, including India and Indonesia, Russia, Yemen and Iraq. The largest number of cases in 2023 was 311,500 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.",
      "The worldwide rate of childhood vaccinations has fallen in recent years, to 83% in 2023 from 86% in 2019, partly due to disruptions in immunization and health care due to the pandemic.",
      "The WHO estimates that vaccination helped to prevent more than 60 million deaths worldwide between 2000 and 2023, as efforts to get the shots to more people ramped up. In 2000, 800,062 people are estimated to have died of measles. Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, major epidemics caused about 2.6 million deaths a year.",
      "Measles is so highly infectious that 95% immunity is required to prevent epidemics, the WHO says. Put another way, it infects about 9 of 10 people exposed if they lack immunity.",
      "The WHO and others are backing an effort called \u201cImmunization Agenda 2021-2030,\u201d to push for elimination of measles.",
      "Independent experts declared the Americas free of endemic measles in 2016 but that status was lost in 2018 due to measles outbreaks in Brazil and Venezuela. Reduced vaccination rates are undermining efforts to fully eradicate the disease, experts say.",
      "Global health organizations and other groups have increased their efforts to speed up immunization programs and close the gaps in prevention."

      "EL PASO, Texas -- On the Texas border, Dr. Hector Granados treats children with diabetes at his El Paso clinics and makes hospital rounds under the shadow of accusations that have thrown his career into jeopardy: providing care to transgender youth.",
      "In what's believed to be a U.S. first, Texas is suing Granados and two other physicians over claims that they violated the state's ban on gender-affirming care for minors, calling the doctors \u201cscofflaws\u201d in lawsuits filed last fall that threaten to impose steep fines and revoke their medical licenses. He denies the accusations, and all three doctors have asked courts to dismiss the cases.",
      "The cases are a pivotal test of intensifying Republican efforts to prevent such treatments, including President Donald Trump's executive order that would bar federal support for gender-affirming care for youth under 19.",
      "Some hospitals have already begun unwinding services for pediatric patients. But, so far, only Texas is demonstrating what punishing doctors looks like when bans are allegedly broken.",
      "Granados, in an interview with The Associated Press, said he was meticulous in halting transgender care before Texas' ban took effect in 2023. He denied that he continued prescribing puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones to transitioning patients and said he was initially unclear which patients, who are not named in the lawsuit, he is accused of wrongfully treating.",

      "The lawsuits are believed to be the first time a state has brought enforcement under laws that ban or restrict gender-affirming care for minors, which Republicans have enacted in 27 states, including this month in Kansas over the Democratic governor\u2019s veto. Although those accused of violating bans face criminal charges in some states, they do not in Texas.",
      "Nationwide, doctors and hospital executives are reevaluating transgender health programs that carry a widening risk of litigation and losing federal funding. For transgender Americans, the climate has narrowed options for care and deepened fears.",
      "Trump has launched a broad charge against transgender rights quickly in his second term, signing executive orders that include barring schools from using federal education dollars to support students who are socially transitioning. Supporters say restrictions protect vulnerable children from what they see as a \u201cradical\u201d ideology about gender and making irreversible medical decisions.",
      "The Texas lawsuits were brought by Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton, who has previously gone beyond the state's borders to launch investigations into gender-affirming treatment.",
      "His office did not respond to requests for an interview. At a court hearing Wednesday involving the Dallas doctors, an attorney in Paxton\u2019s office declined to comment and referred questions to the agency\u2019s press office.",

      "He opened a gender clinic at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in El Paso before starting his own practice in 2019. Before the ban, Granados said, treating transgender youth was just an extension of his practice that also treats youth with diabetes, growth problems and early puberty.",
      "He said he accepted transgender patients only if they had first received a diagnosis of gender dysphoria from a mental health provider.",
      "\u201cIt was not different from doing everything else that a pediatric endocrinologist does,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just taking care of children who required that specific therapy.\u201d",
      "Emiliana Edwards was among them. Now 18, she called Granados an \u201camazing\u201d caregiver who carefully explained her gender-affirming treatment. But at her first appointment after Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed the ban in 2023, Edwards said the room felt different, \u201clike there were wires everywhere.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt felt like we couldn\u2019t talk about anything really, even the most simple stuff,\u201d she said.",

      "In one instance, the state accuses Granados of prescribing testosterone to a 16-year-old, alleging that although the doctor's records identify the patient as male, the teenager's sex assigned at birth is female. Granados and Lau are also accused of having instructed patients to wait until after the ban was in place to fill prescriptions.",
      "Granados does not dispute that he has continued prescribing puberty blockers and hormone replacement therapy. He said those treatments are not for gender transition but for children with endocrine disorders, which occur when hormone levels are too high or too low.",
      "He said he prescribes testosterone for many reasons, including for patients whose testicles don\u2019t work or had to be removed because of cancer. Others have brain tumors, or surgery or radiation to the brain, that impact puberty. Patients with early onset puberty also need puberty blockers, he said.",
      "Attorneys for Lau said she has always complied with the law and the claims have no merit. Attorneys for Cooper did not respond to requests for comment.",

      "The Food and Drug Administration is reinstating some of the hundreds of staffers it fired last week",
      "Associated Press -- Barely a week after mass firings at the Food and Drug Administration, some probationary staffers received unexpected news over the weekend: The government wants them back.",
      "Beginning Friday night, FDA employees overseeing medical devices and other key areas received calls and emails notifying them that their recent terminations had been \u201crescinded effective immediately,\u201d according to messages viewed by The Associated Press.",
      "Three FDA staffers impacted by the decisions spoke with the AP on condition of anonymity because they planned to continue working for the agency and weren\u2019t authorized to discuss its internal procedures.",
      "The reversal is the latest example of President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk's chaotic approach to cost-cutting, which has resulted in several agencies firing, and then scrambling to rehire, employees responsible for nuclear weapons, national parks and other government services.",
      "The FDA reinstatements followed pushback by lobbyists for the medical device industry, which pays the agency hundreds of millions of dollars annually to hire extra scientists to promptly review products. The industry's leading trade group said Monday \u201ca sizeable number\u201d of device reviewers would apparently be returning to FDA.",
      "\u201cThis would be welcome news, and I appreciate the administration for acting quickly,\u201d AdvaMed CEO Scott Whitaker said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe all share the same goal \u2014 an efficient, effective FDA review process that helps advance the medical technologies American patients depend on.\u201d",
      "FDA staffers said entire teams of five or more medical device reviewers had been reinstated. There did not appear to be a similar effort to rehire staffers in other parts of the agency, including its food and tobacco centers.",
      "The agency hasn\u2019t released official numbers on the terminations, but former FDA officials have pegged the number at roughly 700, with more than 220 coming from the medical device center. That would represent roughly 10% of the program's total staffing.",
      "The FDA did not respond to requests Monday about how many employees were being reinstated.",
      "Like other agencies, the FDA terminations went to employees in their probationary period, typically the first two years of federal employment. But that approach resulted in the terminations across key areas where the agency has been working to beef up staffing, including rapidly evolving fields like artificial intelligence and digital health. The cuts also included agency leaders who were recently hired for senior roles.",
      "\u201cThe disarray caused by the wholesale termination of a wide swath of device center staff was counterproductive and appears to have caused a variety of unintended and negative results,\u201d said Steve Silverman, a former FDA device official who now runs a consulting firm. \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see a shift in the opposite direction that recognizes the critical expertise of these staffers.\u201d",
      "Many reviewers have advanced degrees in specialized medical and technological fields. They can typically earn more in the private sector than in government.",
      "Last week, the lobbying group AdvaMed pushed back on the firings, calling on Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to reverse course. The group warned that the cuts would result in slower approvals for companies and fewer new treatment options for patients.",
      "\u201cFDA will lose hundreds of new employees, the best and most innovative hires under our most recent agreement,\u201d Whitaker wrote in a statement posted online. He noted that the hiring of FDA device reviewers is largely financed through an ongoing five-year agreement between the FDA and medical device companies.",
      "More than half the device program\u2019s $791 million budget last year came from industry fees, according to federal figures. In return, the FDA is obligated to meet certain benchmarks for quickly and predictably reviewing applications for new and updated devices.",
      "FDA staffers who were reinstated said their immediate supervisors received no explanation or advance notice on the decisions. Instead, staffers received calls or emails from the FDA\u2019s \u201cOffice of Talent Solutions,\u201d informing them that their access to FDA computer systems and offices had been restored.",
      "\u201cWe are so grateful to still have you working for the FDA and serving the American public!\u201d the emails concluded.",
      "A week earlier, the same employees received emails stating that they were \u201cnot fit for continued employment because your ability, knowledge and skills do not fit the agency\u2019s current needs.\u201d",
      "Nearly half the FDA\u2019s budget, or about $3.3 billion, comes from fees paid by drugmakers, device and tobacco companies. The result is that broad cuts to those programs won\u2019t add much toward Musk\u2019s stated goal of shrinking the federal budget.",
      "But the financial support of industry fees did not appear to help staffers in other parts of the agency.",
      "The agency\u2019s tobacco center \u2014 which reviews new products like electronic cigarettes and nicotine pouches \u2014 is 100% funded by industry fees. But there did not appear to be an effort to rehire any of the estimated 100 or so employees fired from that center.",
      "Similarly, the recalls did not appear to apply to the agency\u2019s food program, which recently went though a major restructuring to better oversee essential products like infant formula and baby food.",
      "Last week, the FDA\u2019s deputy commissioner for foods, Jim Jones resigned, citing \u201cthe indiscriminate firing\u201d of nearly 90 staffers in his division, according to a copy of his resignation letter obtained by the AP. The employees fired included those with \u201chighly technical expertise in nutrition, infant formula, food safety response\u201d and chemical safety, Jones said.",

      "VANNES, France -- A former surgeon is set to stand trial in France on Monday for the alleged rape or sexual abuse of 299 victims, most of them children who were his patients, in what investigators and his own notebooks describe as a pattern of violence spanning over three decades.",
      "Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec, now 74, will face hundreds of victims during a four-month trial in Vannes, Brittany. He faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted, on top of 15 years he has been serving after being found guilty in 2020 of rape and sexual assault of children.",
      "He does not deny the allegations, though says he doesn't remember everything. Some survivors have no memory of the assaults, having been unconscious at the time.",
      "Le Scouarnec\u2019s trial comes as activists are pushing to lift taboos that have long surrounded sexual abuse in France. The most prominent case was that of Gis\u00e8le P\u00e9licot, who was drugged and raped by her now ex-husband and dozens of other men who were convicted and sentenced in December to prison terms ranging from three to 20 years.",
      "Child protection and women\u2019s rights groups and medical community associations have called for a rally on Monday in front of the courthouse where Le Scouarnec will be tried.",
      "The case began in 2017, when a 6-year-old neighbor said Le Scouarnec had touched her over the fence separating their properties.",
      "A subsequent search of his home uncovered more than 300,000 photos, 650 pedophilic, zoophilic and scatological video files, as well as notebooks where he described himself as a pedophile and detailed his actions, according to investigation documents.",
      "In 2020, Le Scouarnec was convicted of rape and sexual assault of four children, including two nieces, and was sentenced to 15 years in prison.",
      "He had admitted to child abuse dating to 1985-1986, but some cases could not be prosecuted because the statute of limitations had expired.",
      "The Vannes trial will examine alleged rapes and other abuses committed between 1989 and 2014 against 158 men and 141 women who were aged 11 on average at the time.",
      "The doctor sexually abused both boys and girls when they were alone in their hospital rooms, according to investigation documents.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t really remember the operation. I remembered the post-operation, a surgeon who was quite mean,\u201d one of the victims, Am\u00e9lie L\u00e9v\u00eaque, recalled of her time in the hospital when she was 9 years old in 1991. \u201cI cried a lot.\"",
      "Years later, she described feeling overwhelmed when she learned that her name appeared in Le Scouarnec\u2019s notebooks.",
      "\u201cThat was the beginning of the answers to a lifetime of questions, and then it was the beginning of the descent into hell,\u201d she told public broadcaster France 3. \u201cI felt like I had lost control of everything. I wasn\u2019t crazy, but now I had to face the truth of what had happened.\u201d",
      "\u201cI fell into a deep depression. ... My family tried to help, but I felt completely alone.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press does not name people who say they were sexually assaulted unless they consent to being identified or decide to tell their stories publicly.",
      "Le Scouarnec\u2019s lawyer, Thibaut Kurzawa, told Sud-Ouest newspaper his client will \u201canswer the judges\u2019 questions\u201d as he decided \u201cto face up to reality.\u201d",
      "Le Scouarnec had already been convicted in 2005 for possessing and importing child sexual abuse material and sentenced to four months of suspended prison time. Despite that conviction, he was appointed as a hospital practitioner the following year.",
      "Some child protection groups joined the proceedings as civil parties, saying they hope to toughen the legal framework to prevent such abuse.",

      "Utah appears to be the first state ready to put a full ban on fluoride in public water systems under a bill that doesn't allow cities or communities to decide whether to add the cavity-preventing mineral.",
      "A bill sponsor and an organization opposed to fluoridating water said Utah's proposal would set a precedent in the U.S. \u2014 and it would come as new federal health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has expressed skepticism about water fluoridation, which is considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "Utah's bill cleared its final hurdle in the legislature Friday, and heads to Gov. Spencer Cox for his approval. A spokesperson for Cox didn't immediately respond to a question about whether he'd sign it.",
      "Already, some cities across the country have tossed fluoride from their water, and other municipalities are considering doing the same. A few months ago, a federal judge ordered the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to regulate fluoride in drinking water because high levels could pose a risk to kids\u2019 intellectual development.",
      "Utah ranked 44th in the nation for the percentage of residents that receive fluoridated water, according to data published in 2022 by U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. About two in five Utah residents served by community water systems received fluoridated water.",
      "Lawmakers who backed the bill, which was sponsored by state Republican Rep. Stephanie Gricius and state Sen. Kirk Cullimore, said putting fluoride in the water is too expensive.",
      "\u201cI don't dispute that there can be positive benefits from fluoride, which is why the bill also includes a deregulation of the prescription,\u201d Gricius said in a text message to The Associated Press, referencing a fluoride pill. \u201cThis isn't anti-fluoride legislation, it is pro-informed consent and individual choice.\u201d",
      "Fluoridation is the the most cost effective way to prevent tooth decay on a large scale, said Lorna Koci, who chairs the Utah Oral Health Coalition.",
      "\u201cI think the anti-fluoride people, they\u2019re latching onto Kennedy\u2019s opportunity with his beliefs and using that now as a way to kind of get in the door to stop water fluoridation,\u201d Koci said.",
      "She added that fluoridated public water is often the only form of preventive dental care for some people, and the impacts may be most visible in low-income Utah residents.",
      "Fluoride strengthens the teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And nearly two-thirds of the U.S. population drinks fluoridated water.",
      "Out of the 484 Utah water systems that reported data to the CDC in 2024, only 66 fluoridated their water, an Associated Press analysis showed. The largest was the state's biggest city, Salt Lake City.",
      "In 2023, voters in Brigham City, north of Salt Lake City, struck down a measure that would have removed fluoride from its public water supplies. The proposal was defeated by more than a two-to-one margin.",
      "Val Radmall, the executive director of the Utah Dental Association, said he and others met with Gricius to try to get her to rethink the bill. He worked in a non-fluoridated community for three decades, and said the lack of fluoride showed.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d have a patient come in without cavities or anything else like that, and I\u2019d say, \u2019You didn\u2019t grow up here. Where did you grow up?' ... because everybody here has lots of cavities!\u201d he said.",

The total is divided into \"direct\" costs \u2013 covering researchers\u2019 salaries and laboratory supplies \u2013 and \u201cindirect\u201d costs, the administrative and facility costs needed to support that work.",
      "The Trump administration had dismissed those expenses as \u201coverhead\u201d but universities and hospitals argue they\u2019re far more critical. They can include such things as electricity to operate sophisticated machinery, hazardous waste disposal, staff who ensure researchers follow safety rules and janitorial workers.",
      "Different projects require different resources. Labs that handle dangerous viruses, for example, require more expensive safety precautions than a simpler experiment. So currently each grant\u2019s amount of indirect costs is negotiated with NIH, some of them small while others reaching 50% or more of the total grant.",
      "If the new policy stands, indirect costs would be capped at 15% immediately, for already awarded grants and new ones. NIH calculated that would save the agency $4 billion a year.",
      "A motion filed earlier this week cited a long list of examples of immediate harm in blue states and red states. They included the possibility of ending some clinical trials of treatments at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, that could leave \u201ca population of patients with no viable alternative.\"",
      "Officials at Johns Hopkins University were more blunt, saying the cut would end or require significantly scaling back research projects potentially including some of the 600 NIH-funded studies open to Hopkins patients.",
      "\u201cThe care, treatments and medical breakthroughs provided to them and their families are not \u2018overhead,\u2019\u201d university president Ron Daniels and Hopkins Medicine CEO Theodore DeWeese wrote to employees.",
      "Attorneys also argued the cuts would harm state economies. The University of Florida would need to cut \u201ccritical research staffing\u201d by about 45 people, while construction of a new research facility in Detroit expected to create nearly 500 new jobs could be paused or even abandoned, they wrote.",
      "\u201cImplementing this 15% cap will mean the abrupt loss of hundreds of millions of dollars that are already committed to employing tens of thousands of researchers and other workers, putting a halt to countless lifesaving health research and cutting-edge technology initiatives,\u201d the lawsuit said.",

      "Authorities say a gunman entered a Pennsylvania hospital\u2019s intensive care unit and took staff members hostage before he was killed by police in a shootout that also left an officer dead",
      "YORK, Pa. -- A man armed with a pistol and carrying zip ties entered a Pennsylvania hospital's intensive care unit Saturday and took staff members hostage before he was killed by police in a shootout that also left an officer dead, authorities said.",
      "Three workers at UPMC Memorial Hospital, including a doctor, a nurse and a custodian, and two other officers were shot and wounded in the attack, York County District Attorney Tim Barker said. A fourth staffer was injured in a fall.",
      "Gunfire erupted after officers went to engage the shooter, whom Barker identified as Diogenes Archangel-Ortiz, 49. He said Archangel-Ortiz was holding at gunpoint a female staff member who had her hands bound with zip ties when police opened fire.",
      "\u201cThis is a huge loss to our community,\u201d Barker said at a press conference following the shooting. \u201cIt is absolutely clear, and beyond any and all doubt, that the officers were justified in taking their action using deadly force.\u201d",
      "Barker added that while the investigation is in its early stages, it appears Archangel-Ortiz had previous contact with the hospital's ICU earlier in the week for \u201ca medical purpose involving another individual\u201d and he intentionally targeted the workers there.",
      "No one answered the door Saturday at an address in York believed to be that of Archangel-Ortiz.",
      "The officer who died was identified as Andrew Duarte of the West York Borough Police Department.",
      "\u201cWe all have broken hearts and are grieving at his loss,\u201d West York Borough Manager Shawn Mauck told The Associated Press.",
      "Duarte was a law enforcement veteran who joined the department in 2022 after five years with the Denver Police Department, according to his LinkedIn profile. He described receiving a \u201chero award\u201d in 2021 from Mothers Against Drunk Driving for his work in impaired driving enforcement for the state of Colorado.",
      "\u201cI have a type A personality and like to succeed in all that I do,\u201d his LinkedIn profile said.",
      "Duarte also worked as a patrol officer in Denver, was highly regarded for his work and was close friends with other officers, the department there said in a statement.",
      "Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said he met Saturday evening with Duarte's parents and fellow officers who were wounded.",
      "\u201cTheir willingness to run toward danger helped save the lives of others,\u201d Shapiro said on the social platform X. \u201cI'm grateful to them and all law enforcement who answered the call today in York.\u201d",
      "At a makeshift memorial on the front steps of the West York Borough Police Department, Linda Shields dropped off roses Saturday and dabbed tears as she thought of her son, a police officer in Maryland.",
      "\u201cHe was so young,\u201d Shields said of Duarte. \u201cIt makes no sense at all.\u201d",
      "Shapiro called the attack on police and health care workers \u201cthe act of a coward.\u201d",
      "UPMC Memorial is a five-story, 104-bed hospital that opened in 2019 in York, a city of about 40,000 people known for its creation of York Peppermint Patties in 1940.",
      "The shooting is part of a wave of gun violence in recent years that has swept through U.S. hospitals and medical centers, which have struggled to adapt to the growing threats. Such attacks have helped make health care one of the nation's most violent fields, with workers suffering more nonfatal injuries from workplace violence than workers in any other profession, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "In 2023, a shooter killed a security guard in the lobby of New Hampshire\u2019s state psychiatric hospital before being fatally shot by a state trooper. In 2022, a man killed two workers at a Dallas hospital while there to watch his child\u2019s birth. In May of that year, a man opened fire in a medical center waiting room in Atlanta, killing one woman and wounding four. And just one month later, a gunman killed his surgeon and three other people at a Tulsa, Oklahoma, medical office because he blamed the doctor for his continuing pain after an operation.",

    "story": [
      "A U.S. aid freeze is threatening the lives of HIV-positive orphans at Nyumbani Children\u2019s Home in Nairobi",
      "NAIROBI, Kenya -- Two-year-old Evans was brought to the Nyumbani Children\u2019s Home in Nairobi, Kenya a year ago, suffering from HIV and tuberculosis. With no family to care for him, Evans was referred to the orphanage by a health center after he stopped responding to medical treatment.",
      "Nyumbani Children\u2019s Home is the reason Evans is still alive. But political decisions made thousands of miles (kilometers) away might spell the end of his short life. Nyumbani provides him and around 100 other children with antiretroviral medication, which they have been receiving from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) through the Kenyan government.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s recent executive order to freeze USAID\u2019s funding means Nyumbani\u2019s access to life-saving antiretroviral drugs, which stop the HIV virus from replicating in the body, may end soon.",
      "Trump\u2019s order seeks to review almost all U.S. foreign aid for 90 days and his administration has moved to shut down USAID. The effects are beginning to set it in, with thousands of people losing their jobs globally and humanitarian programs around the world disrupted.",
      "For children at Nyumbani Children's Home, it's a life and death situation.",
      "As he plays with other preschoolers, Evans is oblivious to his uncertain future, despite the worry on his caregivers\u2019 faces.",
      "The tiny graves at one end of the orphanage compound are a bleak reminder of what a future without USAID looks like for the children. It's a scenario Sister Tresa Palakudy \u2014 who has been looking after children here for 28 years \u2014 is well familiar with having worked at the orphanage before USAID started helping.",
      "\u201cWhen we started caring for them, they didn\u2019t look like they had life in them,\u201d she said. \u201cOne after another, they died. It was so painful, and I don\u2019t want to see that happen again.\"",
      "When Nyumbani, which means \u201cHome\u201d in Swahili, was started in 1992 by Christian missionaries, antiretroviral medication had not been introduced. Back then, it operated as a rescue center for orphaned and abandoned children living with HIV, offering largely palliative care.",
      "The 2003 inception of the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, provided new hope for children living with HIV around the continent, including the orphans at Nyumbani. PEPFAR\u2019s humanitarian aid to combat HIV in Kenya was funded largely by USAID.",
      "\u201cUSAID started bringing ARVs free of charge,\u201d said Palakudy. \u201cWe put all our children on ARVs and their lives changed. They became healthy and were able to go to school and live like other children.\u201d",
      "Over the last two decades, the U.S government, through PEPFAR, has spent more than $8 billion on HIV/AIDS treatment for close to 1.3 million people in Kenya.",
      "USAID and PEPFAR have been critical to operating Nyumbani, having donated more than $16 million to the home between 1999 and 2023. This has enabled the home to reach up to 50,000 children through the rescue center, as well as its two outreach programs Lea Toto and Nyumbani Village. The aid included direct funds to the home, which was used to run the two outreach programs.",
      "Direct funding from USAID was discontinued in 2023, about the same time the orphanage came under scrutiny over allegations of sexual abuse of children by volunteers and staff members.",
      "According to a Washington Post report, six former residents claimed that administrators at the home covered up allegations of sexual abuse. The home disputed the claims of a cover up, insisting that all allegations were handled according to protocols including reporting to local authorities and providing counseling to affected residents.",
      "Executive Director Judith Wamboye said investigations by the Kenyan police were inconclusive. The discontinuation of the funds was not related to the investigations and was in line with a change in USAID policy to channel aid through the government rather than directly to organizations.",
      "The policy change affected all organizations receiving funding. Rather than giving money directly to non-governmental organizations, funding would be channeled through government programs that catered to similar needs. As a result, Nyumbani scaled down its outreach programs and referred beneficiaries to government institutions.",
      "With the discontinuation of direct funding from USAID, the two outreach programs under Nyumbani were scaled down and children in the program were referred to other centers. However, Nyumbani has still been reliant on USAID to supply the lifesaving PEPFAR HIV treatment drugs for free.",
      "\u201cThe future is uncertain,\u201d said Wamboye. \u201cThe Kenyan government announced that they only have ARV stocks to last six months.\u201d",
      "According to data from amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research, about 1.3 million people are on HIV/AIDS treatment in Kenya, and 1,602 orphans and vulnerable children in Kenya are dependent on PEPFAR. amfAR warns that President Trump\u2019s freeze on foreign aid could sever their access to critical medical care.",
      "One such child is Mercy, who has been under the care of Nyumbani for the last 12 years. The ARVs saved her life. \u201cI had a very weak immune system,\" she said. \"This led me to contracting many serious illnesses like tuberculosis and skin diseases.\u201d",
      "Mercy was placed on HIV treatment, giving her a lifeline, but recent news on the freeze order has her scared for her life.",
      "\u201cI am very afraid that previous illnesses that I experienced when I was young will reoccur. And now that I have finished high school and am ready to join college, I am scared it will ruin everything,\u201d she said.",
      "On average, the children's home requires $1,139 per child annually for HIV treatment. In addition to antiretrovirals, the home needs reagents to enable regular testing of the viral load in the children, as well as medicines to treat opportunistic illnesses, which are common among HIV patients.",
      "Wamboye said that should PEPFAR be discontinued permanently, the cost of ARVs could go up and become unaffordable, which will mean children living with HIV will die.",
      "\u201cThis is a life-saving situation and we cannot sit and wait and bargain on human life. So for us, it\u2019s about human life, the lives that we need to save. Something needs to be done urgently,\u201d she said.",

      "A court in Bosnia has sentenced separatist Bosnian Serb President Milorad Dodik to one year in prison and banned him from politics for six years because of his unconstitutional actions",
      "SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina -- A court in Bosnia on Wednesday sentenced Milorad Dodik, the pro-Russia Bosnian Serb president, to one year in prison and banned him from politics for six years over his separatist actions as tensions mount in the fragile Balkan state.",
      "The landmark ruling by the court in Sarajevo came after a yearlong trial against Dodik on charges that he disobeyed the top international envoy overseeing peace in the Balkan country. The judgment becomes final after the appeal process.",
      "The leader and his lawyers weren't in court during the sentencing. Dodik has said that he would disobey any conviction and threatened \u201cradical measures\u201d in response, including eventual secession of the Serb-run entity in Bosnia called Republika Srpska from the rest of the country.",
      "Dodik has repeatedly called for the separation of the Serb-run half of Bosnia to join it with neighboring Serbia, which prompted the United States and the United Kingdom to impose sanctions against him and his close allies. Dodik is also accused of corruption and pro-Russia policies.",
      "Dodik\u2019s separatist threats stoked fears in Bosnia, where a 1992-95 war left 100,000 people killed and displaced millions. The U.S.-sponsored Dayton Accords ended the war nearly three decades ago and created two regions, Republika Srpska and the Bosniak-Croat Federation.",
      "The two regions were given wide autonomy but kept some joint institutions, including the army, the top judiciary and tax administration. Bosnia also has a rotating three-member presidency made up of Bosniak, Serb and Croat members.",
      "Bosniak official Camil Durakovic said the verdict against Dodik showed that \u201cno individual is above the state and that everyone will be held accountable for their actions.\u201d",
      "Dodik was in the Bosnian Serb administrative capital Banja Luka, where thousands gathered Wednesday in his support.",
      "\u201cThey say I am guilty, but now people here will say why I am not guilty,\u201d Dodik told the crowd shortly after the verdict was announced. \u201cThere is no reason to worry. I have learned to deal with tougher situations. It is important that you are here.\u201d",
      "In neighboring Serbia, populist President Aleksandar Vucic called an urgent session of the national security council there.",
      "Dodik is unlikely to be sent to prison, because he enjoys the full support of Vucic, who can provide shelter to him in Belgrade. Dodik is also expected to appeal the conviction.",
      "Dodik told the crowd in Banja Luka that he spoke on the phone with Vucic and with Hungary\u2019s Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whom he called a friend. He invited Vucic to come to Banja Luka to discuss \u201cwhat we are going to do next.\u201d",
      "Dodik said the Bosnian Serb parliament will vote later Wednesday to reject the legal proceedings against him. Lawmakers will also approve several laws banning the work of central Bosnian legal institutions from the Serb-controlled half of Bosnia, he said.",
      "Dodik has repeatedly clashed with top international envoy Christian Schmidt and declared his decisions illegal in Republika Srpska. The Dayton peace agreement envisages that the high representative can impose decisions and change laws in the country.",
      "The war in Bosnia erupted when the country\u2019s Serbs rebelled against the country\u2019s independence from the former Yugoslavia and moved to form a mini-state of their own with the aim of uniting it with neighboring Serbia."

      "Unidentified illnesses in northwestern Congo have killed more than 50 people over the past five weeks, nearly half of them within hours after they felt sick",
      "KINSHASA, Congo -- KINSHASA, Congo (AP) \u2014 Unidentified illnesses in northwestern Congo have killed more than 50 people over the past five weeks, nearly half of them within hours after they felt sick.",
      "The outbreaks in two distant villages in Congo\u2019s Equateur province began on Jan. 21 and include 419 cases and 53 deaths. Health officials still do not know the cause, or whether the cases in the two villages, which are separated by more than 120 miles (190 kilometers), are related. It\u2019s also unclear how the diseases are spreading, including whether they are spreading between people.",
      "The first victims in one of the villages were children who ate a bat and died within 48 hours, the Africa office of the World Health Organization said this week. More infections were found in the other village, where at least some of the patients have malaria.",
      "Illnesses have been clustered in two remote villages in different health zones of Equateur province, which is 400 miles (640 kilometers) from Kinshasa.",
      "The first outbreak began in the village of Boloko after three children ate a bat and died within 48 hours. More than two weeks later a second and larger outbreak was recorded in the village of Bomate, where more than 400 people have been sickened. According to WHO's Africa office, no links have been established between the cases in the two villages.",
      "Dr. Serge Ngalebato, medical director of Bikoro Hospital, a regional monitoring center, and one of the government experts deployed to respond to the outbreak, says the situations in the two villages are somewhat different.",
      "\u201cThe first one with a lot of deaths, that we continue to investigate because it\u2019s an unusual situation, (and) in the second episode that we\u2019re dealing with, we see a lot of the cases of malaria,\u201d said Dr. Ngalebato.",
      "The WHO Africa office said the quick progression from sickness to death in Boloko is a key concern, along with the high number of deaths in Bomate.",
      "Congo\u2019s Ministry of Health said about 80% of the patients share similar symptoms including fever, chills, body aches and diarrhea.",
      "While these symptoms can be caused by many common infections, health officials initially feared the symptoms and the quick deaths of some of the victims could also be a sign of a hemorrhagic fever such as Ebola, which was also linked to an infected animal.",
      "However, Ebola and similar diseases including Marburg have been ruled out after more than a dozen samples were collected and tested in the capital of Kinshasa.",
      "The WHO said it is investigating a number of possible causes, including malaria, viral hemorrhagic fever, food or water poisoning, typhoid fever and meningitis.",
      "Congo\u2019s government says experts have been sent to the villages since Feb. 14, mainly to help investigate the cases and slow the spread.",
      "Ngalebato said patients have been responding to treatments that target the different symptoms.",
      "The remote location of the villages has hindered access to patients while the weak health care infrastructure has made it difficult to carry out surveillance and manage patients. Such challenges are common in disease outbreaks in Congo. In December, an unknown illness killed dozens.",
      "In the latest outbreaks, several victims died even before experts could even reach them, Ngalebato said.",
      "There needs to be an urgent action \u201cto accelerate laboratory investigations, improve case management and isolation capacities, and strengthen surveillance and risk communication,\u201d the WHO Africa office has said.",
      "The U.S. has been the largest bilateral donor to Congo\u2019s health sector and has supported the training of hundreds of field epidemiologists to help detect and control diseases across the vast country. The outbreaks were detected as the Trump administration put a freeze on foreign aid during a 90-day review.",
      "There have long been concerns about diseases jumping from animals to humans in places where people regularly eat wild animals. The number of such outbreaks in Africa has surged by more than 60% in the last decade, the WHO said in 2022.",
      "Experts say this might be what is happening in Congo, which is home to about 60% of the forests in the Congo Basin, home to the largest expanse of tropical forest on earth.",
      "\u201cAll these viruses are viruses that have reservoirs in the forest. And so, as long as we have these forests, we will always have a few epidemics with viruses which will mutate,\u201d said Gabriel Nsakala, a professor of public health at Congo's National Pedagogical University, who previously worked at the Congolese health ministry on Ebola and coronavirus response programs.",

      "A small group of foreign tourists has visited North Korea in the past week",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- A small group of foreign tourists has visited North Korea in the past week, making them the first international travelers to enter the country in five years except for a group of Russian tourists who went to the North last year.",
      "The latest trip indicates North Korea may be gearing up for a full resumption of its international tourism to bring in much-needed foreign currency to revive its struggling economy, experts say.",
      "The Beijing-based travel company Koryo Tours said it arranged a five-day trip from Feb. 20 to Feb. 24 for 13 international tourists to the northeastern North Korean border city of Rason, where the country\u2019s special economic zone is located.",
      "Koryo Tours General Manager Simon Cockerell said the travelers from the U.K., Canada, Greece, New Zealand, France, Germany, Austria, Australia and Italy crossed by land from China. He said that in Rason, they visited factories, shops, schools and the statues of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, the late grandfather and father of current leader Kim Jong Un.",
      "\u201cSince January of 2020, the country has been closed to all international tourists, and we are glad to have finally found an opening in the Rason area, in the far north of North Korea,\u201d Cockerell said.",
      "\u201cOur first tour has been and gone, and now more tourists on both group and private visits are going in, arranging trips,\u201d he added.",
      "After the pandemic began, North Korea quickly banned tourists, jetted out diplomats and severely curtailed border traffic in one of the world\u2019s most draconian COVID-19 restrictions. But since 2022, North Korea has been slowly easing curbs and reopening its borders.",
      "In February 2024, North Korea accepted about 100 Russian tourists, the first foreign nationals to visit the country for sightseeing. That surprised many observers, who thought the first post-pandemic tourists would come from China, North Korea\u2019s biggest trading partner and major ally.",
      "A total of about 880 Russian tourists visited North Korea throughout 2024, South Korea\u2019s Unification Ministry said, citing official Russian data. Chinese group tours to North Korea remain stalled.",
      "This signals how much North Korea and Russia have moved closer to each other as the North has supplied weapons and troops to Russia to support its war against Ukraine. Ties between North Korea and China cooled as China showed its reluctance to join a three-way, anti-U.S. alliance with North Korea and Russia, experts say.",
      "Before the pandemic, tourism was an easy, legitimate source for foreign currency for North Korea, one of the world\u2019s most sanctioned countries because of its nuclear program.",
      "North Korea is expected to open a massive tourism site on the east coast in June. In January when President Donald Trump boasted about his ties with Kim Jong Un, he said that \"I think he has tremendous condo capabilities. He\u2019s got a lot of shoreline.\u201d That likely refers to the eastern coast site.",
      "A return of Chinese tourists would be key to making North Korea's tourism industry lucrative because they represented more than 90% of total international tourists before the pandemic, said Lee Sangkeun, an expert at the Institute for National Security Strategy, a think tank run by South Korea's intelligence agency. He said that in the past, up to 300,000 Chinese tourists visited North Korea annually.",
      "\u201cNorth Korea has been heavily investing on tourism sites, but there have been not much domestic demand,\u201d Lee said. \u201cWe can assess that North Korea now wants to resume international tourism to bring in many tourists from abroad.\u201d",
      "The restrictions that North Korea has typically imposed on foreign travelers \u2014 such as requirements that they move with local guides and the banning of photography at sensitive places \u2014 will likely hurt its efforts to develop tourism. Lee said that Rason, the eastern coast site and Pyongyang would be the places where North Korea feels it can easily monitor and control foreign tourists.",

      "Venezuelan migrants handed over to Mexico like it\u2019s a U.S. immigration detention facility",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Venezuelan migrants handed over to Mexico like it\u2019s a U.S. immigration detention facility. Families from Central Asia flown to Panama and Costa Rica to await voluntary repatriation to their countries. Venezuelans from Guantanamo Bay handed off on a Honduran tarmac and returned to Caracas.",
      "It all sends the unmistakable message that trying to get to the U.S. border is no longer worth it. U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has laid the groundwork to reverse the region\u2019s migration flow. And while the numbers remain modest, an outline of how the U.S. hopes to overcome limited detention space as it gears up its deportation machine is emerging.",
      "In its first month, the Trump administration has reached deals with Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica and Panama to act as stopovers or destinations for migrants expelled from the U.S. It has brokered deals with Venezuela to pick up its people in Texas, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and Honduras.",
      "But none of the agreements have been detailed for the public, raising concerns about evading international protections for refugees and asylum-seekers. Adam Isacson, a researcher with the Washington-based human rights advocacy organization WOLA, suspects many were little more than improvised \u201chandshake deals.\u201d",
      "They were requests made while Trump threatened tariffs and to take back the Panama Canal. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio moved through the region while U.S. foreign aid was suspended, bestowing exemptions when merited.",
      "Trump made deals during his first presidency with Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to take in asylum-seekers, though only Mexico and Guatemala actually received them.",
      "But the agreements in his second term are more varied, ranging from Honduras letting Venezuelans get off a U.S. plane and board a Venezuelan one in its territory last week, to El Salvador offering to imprison deportees \u2014 and even U.S. citizen prisoners.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re being much more ambitious now,\u201d Isacson said. \u201cThe idea of sending people to be warehoused like goods, to deport them to third countries wasn\u2019t an issue\u201d in Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "The numbers remain relatively small, but images of deportees deplaning in shackles and deportees holding up signs asking for help in the Panama hotel where they\u2019re held are powerful.",
      "This is still a preliminary phase because Congress has not approved a new budget, Isacson said. \u201cWhile they\u2019re at that lowest level of resources they are doing all of the shock and awe possible,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea is to scare them.\u201d",
      "Now the migration flow that is visible is of deportations and migrants boarding boats in Panama to take them south to Colombia rather than migrants riding trains north through Mexico or massing at the U.S. border.",
      "In just a month, Mexico has received more than 3,300 foreign deportees, who advocates say were from at least seven nationalities.",
      "A number of them carried unusual U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement documents that read: \u201cReason for transfer: removal. Name of new facility (immigration): MEXICO.\u201d They appear to have nothing to do with the Remain in Mexico program from Trump\u2019s first term that made asylum-seekers wait out the U.S. process from Mexico.",
      "President Claudia Sheinbaum has said little about Mexico\u2019s participation other than highlighting her administration\u2019s willingness to cooperate. The U.S. Department of State has praised Mexico for receiving deportation flights and for returning migrants from elsewhere to their countries.",
      "Farther south the numbers are smaller, but the imagery has been stronger.",
      "Panama, where more than 500,000 migrants passed en route to the U.S. border in 2023, suddenly became a bridge this month for U.S. efforts to deport asylum seekers. Nearly 300 U.S. deportees from 10 mostly Asian countries were held in a Panama City hotel. Some put signs to their windows that read \u201cHelp\u201d and \u201cWe are not save (sic) in our country.\u201d",
      "About one-third of those in the hotel who refused to voluntarily return to their countries were then sent to a remote camp back in the very jungle they had probably crossed in the other direction. One deportee in the camp told The Associated Press they were not informed of their rights and weren't told how long they would be in the camp, which concerned her because of its poor conditions.",
      "Similar flights landed in Costa Rica last week and they were sent to a remote facility that had also previously received migrants headed north.",
      "In addition to those flights, 50 to 75 migrants are moving south through Costa Rica on their own daily, according to Omer Badilla, Costa Rica\u2019s vice minister of the interior.",
      "He raised the possibility of Panama and Colombia getting involved to organize boat trips south for migrants, but neither of those governments has publicly confirmed their involvement. Panama and Costa Rica say U.N. agencies are assisting with the repatriations and that the U.S. government is paying.",
      "The International Organization for Migration said that it was helping authorities provide basic services and facilitating voluntary repatriations \u201cwhen it is safe to do so.\u201d",
      "\u201cWith the old flow (south to north) the situation is pretty under control,\u201d Panamanian President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino said Thursday. \u201cThat shows that now the problem is coming in the opposite direction and we hope that can be managed in an orderly fashion.\u201d",
      "Even with the involvement of U.N. agencies, concerns abound about vulnerable migrants being passed from country to country and even sent back to countries they fled.",
      "Advocates worry the U.S. may be using third countries to deport migrants from countries where the U.S. may not have diplomatic relations or strained ones, to get around constraints in international law that are supposed to prevent people from being sent back to places they would not be safe.",
      "Gretchen Kuhner, director of IMUMI, a nongovernmental legal services organization in Mexico, said recently a flight carrying Venezuelans from the United States to Venezuela made a stop in Cancun. But IMUMI wasn\u2019t able to speak with the migrants aboard directly to know if they wanted to try to request asylum in Mexico while in the country\u2019s territory.",
      "Isacson said among the Venezuelans sent back to that country have been people who deserted the armed forces, who would now be in the hands of the military. The risks could be even more dire for some migrants from Iran and Afghanistan.",
      "The region\u2019s governments are understandably sensitive about appearing to be aiding in Trump\u2019s deportation efforts, but Isacson said transparency will better shield them from those criticisms.",

      "BEIRUT -- Lebanon\u2019s new government on Wednesday won a confidence vote in Parliament, with the support of Hezbollah\u2019s bloc, even though the government statement adopted took a swipe at the group\u2019s weapons.",
      "Ninety-five out of 128 lawmakers supported the government of Prime Minister Nawaf Salam, a prominent jurist who previously headed the International Court of Justice. He was appointed last month to form a new government after a devastating war between Israel and Hezbollah, which killed over 4,000 people and caused widespread destruction.",
      "The government statement adopted said that only Lebanon\u2019s armed forces should defend the country in case of war. Unlike previous statements, it did not include the phrase \u201carmed resistance,\u201d which had been seen as legitimizing Hezbollah\u2019s possession of weapons outside of state control.",
      "Hezbollah has kept its weapons over the past decades saying they are necessary to defend the country against Israel. Calls for the group's disarmament, however, intensified during the latest war, which ended with a U.S.-brokered ceasefire on Nov. 27, 2024.",
      "Hezbollah did not support Salam's bid to be prime minister. But Hezbollah's parliamentary leader, Mohammad Raad, on Tuesday announced his bloc\u2019s confidence in his Cabinet on Tuesday.",
      "Salam said the government asserts that Lebanon has the right to defend itself in case of any \u201caggression\u201d and only the state has the right to have weapons. He also said the government takes measures to liberate land occupied by Israel \u201cthrough its forces only.\u201d",
      "Legislators from the Amal movement, led by parliamentary speaker Nabih Berri - who brokered the ceasefire and is allied with Hezbollah - also voted for the new government. Hezbollah and the Amal Movement collectively hold about 27 seats designated for the Shi\u2019ite community.",
      "The Marada Movement, a Christian political party aligned with Hezbollah, and the Syrian Social Nationalist Party, a secular nationalist party aligned with Hezbollah, also offered the government their confidence.",
      "The Lebanese Forces and the Kataeb, Christian parties that oppose Hezbollah and call for its disarmament and reduced Iranian influence, also backed Salam\u2019s government.",
      "Meanwhile, 12 legislators withheld support while four others abstained from voting, criticizing the ministerial statement as vague and lacking a clear plan. The \u201cStrong Lebanon\u201d bloc led by Gebran Bassil of the Free Patriotic Movement, previously aligned with Hezbollah, voted against the new government.",
      "Among the key issues raised by parliamentarians for the government to address are Israel\u2019s ceasefire violations and demands for its full withdrawal from Lebanese territory. While Israeli troops pulled out under the ceasefire terms, they remain in five strategic outposts along the border and continue to conduct airstrikes, saying they are targeting Hezbollah fighters and weapons caches.",
      "Legislators also urged the government to tackle reconstruction following the war, Lebanon\u2019s severe economic and banking crisis and implement long-overdue judicial and banking reforms."

      "Germany\u2019s Catholic Church has sharply criticized a carnival float made for a big street parade in the western city of Cologne that linked Jesus with the church abuse scandal",
      "COLOGNE, Germany -- Germany's Catholic Church has sharply criticized a carnival float made for a big street parade in the western city of Cologne that linked Jesus with the church abuse scandal.",
      "The float, which was unveiled Tuesday, shows an altar boy in front of a confessional with an arm sticking out and an outstretched hand luring the boy inside. On the side of the confessional, bold letters read \u201cJesus loves you.\u201d",
      "The Cologne archdiocese condemned the float as \u201ctasteless.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe inscription on the confessional \u2014 \u2018Jesus loves you\u2019 \u2014 directly associates Jesus, the Son of God, with the abuse,\u201d it wrote in a letter published Tuesday on its website.",
      "\u201cIt is suggested that Jesus himself is sitting in the confessional and wants to pull the altar boy into it with a wave of his hand; at the very least, Jesus is being instrumentalized here,\u201d the letter said.",
      "The floats for Cologne's annual Shrove Monday parade are famous for poking fun at the powerful and mockingly referring to controversies. But the church's reaction suggested that the city's carnival committee went too far this time.",
      "\u201cIf one assumes that the Son of God is partly responsible for the terrible acts of abuse that have also and especially occurred in the Catholic Church, a line has been crossed that cannot be justified for any reason in the world,\u201d the archdiocese's letter said.",
      "Several members of the center-right Christian Democratic party, including a former Cologne mayor, also expressed anger over the float. In a letter they said the image, \u201cwhich cannot be surpassed in terms of embarrassment and tastelessness, should not belittle the Cologne Shrove Monday procession and carnival as a whole,\u201d German news agency dpa reported.",
      "Cologne is a traditionally Catholic city, known for its iconic, double-domed cathedral. It was one of the most important European places of pilgrimage in the Middle Ages.",
      "However, many German Catholics, also in Cologne, have turned their backs on the churc h in recent years. Many say they felt betrayed by the scale of the sex abuse allegations and disappointed by what they describe as inadequate prosecution of perpetrators by the church.",
      "In 2018, a church-commissioned report concluded that at least 3,677 people were abused by clergy in Germany between 1946 and 2014. More than half of the victims were 13 or younger, and nearly a third served as altar boys.",
      "The head of the Cologne Carnival Committee, Christoph Kuckelkorn, rejected any criticism of the provocative float.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not the depiction of abuse that is tasteless and embarrassing, but rather the abuse itself and how it is dealt with,\u201d Kuckelkorn told dpa, adding that carnival is all about satire and to make people think.",

      "\u201cCalin Georgescu was about to submit his new candidacy for the presidency,\u201d his team said on Facebook. \u201cHe was taken in for questioning at the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office.\u201d",

      "Georgescu on Facebook said authorities \u201care looking to invent evidence to justify the theft of the elections and to do anything to block my new candidacy for the presidency.\u201d He called on supporters to attend a protest on Saturday in Bucharest.",
      "Hundreds of supporters gathered outside the prosecutor\u2019s office, waving Romania\u2019s flag and chanting: \u201cFree Georgescu!\u201d and \u201cPresident Georgescu!\u201d",

      "The Constitutional Court made the unprecedented move to annul the election two days ahead of the Dec. 8 runoff after Georgescu's surprise first-round win. He had polled in single digits and declared zero campaign spending.",
      "Allegations of Russian interference and electoral violations quickly emerged.",
      "Thousands of protesters took to the streets of Bucharest on Saturday to support Georgescu, who has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and argued the election was \u201ccanceled illegally and unconstitutionally.\u201d",
      "The first round of the rerun of the election is scheduled for May 4. If no candidate gets more than 50% of ballots, a runoff will follow on May 18.",

      "Georgescu sparked controversy in the past for describing Romanian fascist and nationalist leaders from the 1930s and 1940s as national heroes. He has also been criticized for praising Russian President Vladimir Putin in the past as \u201ca man who loves his country\u201d and calling Ukraine \u201can invented state.\u201d",
      "The current Trump administration has criticized Romania for canceling last year's presidential election, with Vice President JD Vance alleging that the court's ruling was based on \u201cflimsy suspicions\u201d and \u201cenormous pressure\u201d from Romania\u2019s neighbors."

      "Mexico\u2019s Supreme Court has ordered a zoo to improve the health of an African elephant named Ely, the first time the country\u2019s highest court has made such a move in favor of an animal",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexico\u2019s Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered a zoo to improve the health of an African elephant named Ely, the first time the country\u2019s highest court has made such a move in favor of an animal.",
      "The court ordered that there be \u201ca constant improvement of her health and physical condition.\u201d",
      "The decision by a panel of four justices upheld a lower court\u2019s order last year in Ely\u2019s favor and experts believe it could set a precedent in Mexico recognizing that animals have rights.",
      "Advocates have argued that Ely suffered from depression, especially since the death of Maggie, the other elephant sharing her habitat, in 2016, as well as illnesses she suffered in captivity. Ely would bang against the walls of her enclosure and lost weight. Her defenders called her \u201cthe world\u2019s saddest elephant.\u201d",
      "That was when Diana Valencia, founder and director of the animal rights group Opening Cages and Opening Minds, met Ely. \u201cIt really moved me to see the state that she was in, it tore my soul and I made Ely a promise,\u201d Valencia said, who has continued to visit the elephant regularly over the years. She told Ely, \u201c'They aren't going to do the same to you.'\u201d",
      "Ely, who estimated to be between 43 and 45 years old, has lived at the San Juan de Aragon zoo in Mexico City for 13 years since being rescued from a circus.",
      "Wednesday\u2019s ruling follows another high court decision last month when it determined that Mexico City laws against animal mistreatment and cruelty were constitutional.",
      "Valencia conceded that the zoo had improved Ely\u2019s living conditions, but only after public pressure.",
      "The zoo expanded the elephant enclosure and added two more elephants in 2023 and 2024.",
      "Veterinarian Gabriela Uribe Acosta, director of zoo, said she was confident the zoo could fully comply with the court\u2019s order to improve Ely\u2019s life.",
      "She said a team of six people are responsible for keeping her enclosure of more than 78,000 square feet clean and another half dozen people are monitoring her health.",
      "Uribe Acosta dismissed assertions that Ely is depressed. She said the elephant was stable and had improved since the other elephants were added. She moves around more and has new vocalizations.",
      "She said that when Ely arrived in 2012, after years in a circus, she had a problem with her rear right leg that limited her mobility, as well as nutritional deficiencies resulting from a poor diet.",
      "But Wednesday\u2019s order could reverberate beyond Ely. Lawyer Sergio M\u00e9ndez Silva, litigation coordinator for the local Foundation for Justice, said \u201cMexico is taking a significant step with a precedent like this and I believe this will mark a before and after.\u201d",
      "Still, Valencia plans to continue fighting for all three of the zoo's elephants to be moved to a sanctuary in Brazil or the United States. \u201cI can't be satisfied because an elephant can't live in captivity, it hurts them mentally,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's one of the animals that most suffers in captivity.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Pope Francis is continuing his slow recovery from double pneumonia and beating back speculation of an imminent death, resignation or conclave",
      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 Pope Francis continued his slow recovery from double pneumonia on Thursday, beating back speculation of an imminent death, resignation or conclave and signaling that he was still very much in charge, albeit in a weakened state.",
      "The 88-year-old pope once again slept well during the night at Rome\u2019s Gemelli hospital, had breakfast and resumed his therapy Thursday morning in good spirits, the Vatican said. The results of more medical tests were expected later Thursday.",
      "Doctors on Wednesday reported further slight improvements in his clinical condition as his hospital stay neared the two-week mark on Friday. They said the kidney insufficiency that had been detected in recent days had receded, blood tests showed a slight improvement and a chest CT scan showed that his complex lung infection was taking the \u201cnormal evolution\u201d as it is being treated.",
      "The prognosis remained guarded, however. The pope, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, is still receiving high flows of supplemental oxygen and respiratory physiotherapy to help his lungs expel fluid. But he hasn\u2019t had any more respiratory crises since Saturday, the Vatican said.",
      "Nevertheless, his near-term upcoming calendar of events was being changed: The Vatican cancelled a Holy Year audience scheduled for Saturday, and it remained to be seen if Francis would skip his Sunday noon blessing for the third week in a row. Longer term, Ash Wednesday loomed on the horizon March 5, the start of the church's Lenten season leading up to Holy Week and Easter, which this year falls on April 20.",
      "In past years, when Francis has battled bronchitis and influenza in winter, he has had to cut back his participation in Ash Wednesday and Holy Week events, which call for the pope to be outdoors in the cold leading services, participating in processions and presiding over prayers in the solemn period in which the faithful commemorate Christ's crucifixion and resurrection.",
      "Beyond that, Francis has a few major events coming up that he presumably would hope to keep if well enough. On April 27, he is due to canonize Carlo Acutis, considered to be the first millennial and digital-era saint. The Vatican considers the Italian teenager, who died of leukemia in 2006 at the age of 15, as an inspiring role model for today's young Catholics.",
      "Another important appointment is the May 24 commemoration of the 1,700th anniversary of the Council of Nicea, Christianity's first ecumenical council. The spiritual leader of the world\u2019s Orthodox Christians, Patriarch Bartholomew I, has invited Francis to join him in what is today's Iznik, Turkey to commemorate the anniversary, which he has called an important sign of reconciliation between the Catholic and Orthodox churches. Before he got sick, Francis said he hoped to go, though the Vatican hasn't confirmed the trip.",
      "Prayers for his heath continued to pour in from near and far, with a group of Mexican pilgrims in Rome for the Holy Year taking a detour to pray for Francis outside the Gemelli hospital.",
      "Lili Iparea Fernandez, from La Cruz, Mexico, had come to Rome with plans to attend Francis' Wednesday general audience this week, but it was cancelled.",
      "\u201cHowever, we firmly believe that the pope will recover because he is a very strong man,\u201d she said Thursday outside Gemelli. \u201cSo I invite everyone to believe firmly, with certainty, with confidence, with hope that the pope is going to be well.\u201d",
      "The dean of the College of Cardinals, Giovanni Battista Re, presided Wednesday night over what has now become a nightly appointment in St. Peter\u2019s Square, the 9 p.m. Rosary prayer.",
      "As is now popularly known thanks to the Oscar-nominated film \u201cConclave,\u201d the 91-year-old Re would have a key role in any papal death or conclave, called to preside over the funeral and organize the secret balloting in the Sistine Chapel to elect a new pope. Francis recently extended Re\u2019s term, keeping him on in the important job rather than naming someone new.",
      "But on Wednesday night, Re was merely one of the Catholic Church\u2019s most senior cardinals, an important point of reference for the men who lead the church, praying for Francis\u2019 speedy recovery.",
      "By now a certain rhythm appears to have emerged from the Vatican\u2019s updates: The pope receives treatments in the morning, including respiratory physiotherapy, and resumes work in the afternoon from his hospital room.",
      "The Vatican said Wednesday that he had appointed four new bishops and approved the creation of a new fundraising initiative to encourage donations to the Holy See, which has been enduring a financial crisis for years.",
      "Francis likely approved the bishop appointments a while back and the new norms for the fundraising entity were approved Feb. 11, before he was hospitalized. But the announcements made them official and suggested Francis was still very much in charge and governing.",

Police officers fired at him as he lunged at them, shouting \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d (God is great) and wielding a knife. He was shot and seriously wounded.",
      "The attack was the third in less than two months that French authorities attributed to Islamic extremists, and prompted the government to raise its security alert to the maximum level. It came while France was holding a trial over the 2015 attacks on satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, which published caricatures of Islam\u2019s prophet. France at the time faced anger from many Muslims around the world for defending the cartoons and for its policies against Islamic radicalism.",
      "France remains on high alert today, notably for domestic extremist threats stoked on online platforms."

      "The administration of President Joe Biden authorized the license in 2022 after Maduro agreed to work with Venezuela\u2019s political opposition toward a democratic election. But the election, which took place in July 2024, was neither fair nor free, and Maduro was sworn in last month for a third six-year term despite credible evidence that his opponent got more votes.",

      "According to the ruling, the woman had told authorities she rejected the suggestion of having sex with multiple partners. However, the suspects persisted in entering the hotel room where the alleged rape took place, disregarding her pleas for them to leave.",
      "Even though the woman was having sex with an Israeli friend of the suspects in that hotel room at the time, the court said investigators didn\u2019t establish whether the suspects had secured her consent. According to testimony, some of them only assumed they would because of her previous behavior.",
      "The court said investigators appeared not to take into account the woman\u2019s capacity to consent in light of testimony that she had consumed alcohol prior to the alleged rape and that traces of cocaine were found in her urine.",
      "Moreover, police and investigators took the suspects\u2019 statements that no rape had taken place \u201cat face value\u201d despite testimony that her Israeli partner \u201csaid he would arrange for his friends to have sex\u201d with her.",
      "This compounded what the court described as a series of flaws investigators in the initial state of the investigation, from a limited search of physical evidence such as fingerprints in the hotel room to failure to track down potential suspects or witnesses.",
      "\u201cThe Court observes that the present case reveals certain biases concerning women in Cyprus which impeded the effective protection of the applicant\u2019s rights as a victim of gender-based violence and which, if not reversed, run the risk of creating a background of impunity, discouraging victims\u2019 trust in the criminal justice system, despite the existence of a satisfactory legislative framework,\u201d the ruling said.",
      "The July, 2019 case made headlines in Cyprus, Britain and Israel when all 12 suspects were released without charge after the woman retracted her rape claims. The Cyprus attorney-general opted not to pursue legal proceedings against the suspects, while the woman was subsequently found guilty on a charge of public mischief and sentenced to a four-month suspended jail term.",
      "In the lower court ruling, the judge said the woman didn\u2019t tell the truth and tried to deceive the court with \u201cevasive\u201d statements. He said the woman had admitted to investigators that she made up the claims because she was \u201cashamed\u201d after finding out that some of the Israelis had videoed her having consensual sex with her Israeli boyfriend on their cellphones.",
      "In 2022, the Cyprus Supreme Court overturned the woman\u2019s conviction, citing among other reasons that she didn\u2019t have a lawyer present when police repeatedly questioned her and that the lower court misconstrued evidence, prejudicing proceedings against her.",
      "The ECHR ruling said given the conditions of the woman\u2019s questioning by police, \u201cthere is force in her argument\u201d that the \u201clong and repeated interviews\u201d prompted her to retract her rape allegations.",
      "Justice Abroad Director Michael Polak, who represented the woman both in Cyprus and at the ECHR, called the ruling a \u201clandmark decision for victims of sexual violence.\"",
      "\u201cThis ruling reinforces the fundamental principle that allegations of sexual violence must be investigated thoroughly and fairly, without institutional obstruction,\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "The tiny island of Yonaguni on Japan\u2019s western frontier is too small for even a chain convenience store",
      "YONAGUNI, Japan -- This tiny island on Japan's western frontier has no chain convenience stores. Nature lovers can dive with hammerhead sharks and watch miniature horses graze on a hill.",
      "But the wooded mountain ranges now carry radar sites. A southern cattle ranch has been replaced with the Japanese Ground Self Defense Force's Camp Yonaguni. Japan and its ally, the United States, hold joint military exercises here. Plans are underway to add a new missile unit and expand a small airport and port.",
      "All of the buildup has cemented the island as a front line in a potential clash over Taiwan, the self-governing democratic island that China claims as its own.",
      "\u201cAs a child, I was so proud of this westernmost border island,\u201d said Fumie Kano, an innkeeper on Yonaguni. \u201cBut recently, we are repeatedly told this place is dangerous, and I feel so sad.\u201d",
      "The militarization has been especially felt as the island's population shrinks. There are less than 1,500 local residents. Supporters say new servicemembers arriving are needed for the island's safety and struggling economy. Opponents like Kano say the military buildup is damaging the environment, making the island's economy dependent on the military and could provoke an attack.",
      "Yonaguni is only 110 kilometers (68 miles) east of Taiwan, around which China has bolstered military activity. Worried about a conflict, Japan has made a \u201csouthwestern shift\u201d in its military posture and accelerated defense buildup and spending around the front line.",
      "Missile units for PAC-3 interceptors have been deployed on Yonaguni and nearby Ishigaki and Miyako islands.",
      "Yonaguni residents find themselves at the center of the geopolitical tension. A recent government plan to deploy more missiles, possibly long-range, has caused unease about the future of the island, even among those who initially supported hosting troops.",
      "Kano, a Yonaguni native, recalls that officials and residents once wanted to improve the economy and environment through commercial exchanges with Taiwan by operating direct ferries between the islands. But that was set aside when a plan to host Japanese troops became an easier alternative to gain government subsidies and protection.",
      "Disagreement about the plan has divided the small community. Support for hosting Japanese troops carried in a 2015 referendum; that meant the island's fate would be largely decided by the central government\u2019s security policy.",
      "A year later a 160-member coast watch unit was set up to monitor Chinese military activity, with radars built on Mount Inbi and elsewhere. Now there are about 210 troops, including an electro-warfare unit. Servicemembers and their families account for one-fifth of the island\u2019s total population.",
      "The local economy largely depends on the servicemembers and their families who use local shops, schools and community services.",
      "There's worry on the island about the pace and extent of the militarization, says Kyoko Yamaguchi, a potter. \u201cEverything is pushed through in the name of the Taiwan emergency, and many feel this is too much.\u201d",
      "A nonfatal crash in October of a Japanese army tilt-rotor aircraft Osprey during a joint exercise with the U.S. military on the island also caused apprehension.",
      "Japan's air and maritime forces in Okinawa\u2019s prefectural capital of Naha are key to protecting the country's southwestern airspace and territorial waters.",
      "The Naha-based Southwestern Air Defense Force is the busiest of Japan\u2019s four regional air forces. In fiscal 2023, the force was scrambled 401 times, or 60% of the national total of 669, mostly against the Chinese, according to the Defense Ministry.",
      "Rear Adm. Takuhiro Hiragi, commander of Fleet Air Wing 5 of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, says his group's mission is to fly P-3C aircraft over the East China Sea near Okinawa and its remote islands, including Yonaguni, and the Japanese-controlled Senkaku island, which Beijing also claims.",
      "\u201cWe have to be mobile, quick and thorough to keep tabs in this region,\u201d Hiragi said, noting the presence of key sea lanes in the area, including those that China uses to navigate the Pacific Ocean. \u201cWe watch over their exercises, not only near Taiwan but wherever necessary.\u201d",
      "Defense officials say China has been accelerating its military activities in the area between Taiwan and Yonaguni.",
      "In August, a Chinese Y-9 reconnaissance plane briefly violated Japanese airspace off the southern main island of Kyushu, prompting Japan\u2019s military to scramble fighter jets and warn the plane. A Chinese survey ship separately violated Japanese territorial waters off a southern island days later. In September, the Chinese aircraft carrier Liaoning and two destroyers sailed between Yonaguni and nearby Iriomote, entering a band of water just outside of Japan\u2019s territorial waters.",
      "Yonaguni fisherfolk, who closely monitor foreign vessels, have been among the first to see the growing Chinese military activity.",
      "In 2022, several ballistic missiles China fired as part of an exercise landed off Japan's southwestern waters following then-U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s Taiwan visit in August. One of them landed just 80 kilometers (50 miles) from Yonaguni while more than 20 local fishing boats were operating.",
      "Though it caused no injuries or damage, the Chinese drills kept fisherfolk from operating for a week, Yonaguni fisheries association chief and town assembly member Shigenori Takenishi said. \u201cIt was an extremely dangerous exercise that really made us feel China's potential threat right next to us.\u201d",
      "Fear of a Taiwan war rekindles bitter memories here of the Battle of Okinawa, in which about 200,000 people, nearly half of them civilians, were killed. Historians say the army sacrificed Okinawa to defend Japan\u2019s mainland. Today Okinawa 's main island hosts more than half of the 50,000 American troops in Japan.",
      "\"Being at the center of this issue is very stressful for residents,\" said shopkeeper Takako Ueno. \u201cI don't want people to imagine this beautiful island turning into a battlefield.\u201d",
      "To keep that from happening Yonaguni needs to be fortified, says Mayor Kenichi Itokazu, a military buildup advocate who has campaigned for the deployment of more Japanese troops for decades.",
      "Some residents feel uneasy about their vulnerability, even amid the military buildup.",
      "A government evacuation plan last year showed moving 120,000 people from five remote islands, including Yonaguni, to Japan's main islands would take at least six days. Some question whether such an evacuation is even possible.",
      "Itokazu, the mayor, wants to build a shelter in the basement of a new town hall and to expand the Higawa port for evacuation by ship, a plan opposed by environmentalists who say there are rare marine species there.",
      "But there's skepticism from some.",
      "\u201cIt's absurd,\u201d Kano said of the evacuation plan, because all of Japan would be in danger if Okinawa is dragged into fighting. \u201cI just hope the money will be spent on policies that will help the people in Yonaguni live peacefully.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A report by the United Nations\u2019 nuclear watchdog says Iran has accelerated its production of near weapons-grade uranium as tensions between Tehran and Washington rise after the election of U.S. President Donald Trump",
      "VIENNA -- Iran has accelerated its production of near weapons-grade uranium as tensions between Tehran and Washington rise after the election of U.S. President Donald Trump, a report by the United Nations\u2019 nuclear watchdog seen by The Associated Press on Wednesday showed.",
      "The report by the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency said that as of Feb. 8, Iran has 274.8 kilograms (605.8 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60%. That\u2019s an increase of 92.5 kilograms (203.9 pounds) since the IAEA\u2019s last report in November.",
      "That material is a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%.",
      "A report in November 2024 put the stockpile at 182.3 kilograms (401.9 pounds). It had 164.7 kilograms (363.1 pounds) last August.",
      "\u201cThe significantly increased production and accumulation of high enriched uranium by Iran, the only non-nuclear weapon State to produce such nuclear material, is of serious concern,\u201d the confidential report stated. According to the IAEA, approximately 42 kilograms of 60% enriched uranium is theoretically enough to produce one atomic bomb, if enriched further to 90%.",
      "The IAEA also estimated in its quarterly report that as of Feb. 8, Iran\u2019s overall stockpile of enriched uranium stands at 8,294.4 kilograms (18,286 pounds), which represents an increase of 1,690.0 kilograms (3725.8 pounds) since the last report in November.",
      "During his first presidential term, Trump unilaterally withdrew the U.S. from Tehran\u2019s nuclear deal with world powers and reimposed sanctions on Iran. He also ordered the 2020 killing of Qassem Soleimani, who led the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps\u2019 Quds Force.",
      "Iran has maintained its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only, but the IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi, has previously warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make \u201cseveral\u201d nuclear bombs if it chose to do so.",
      "Iranian officials have increasingly suggested Tehran could pursue an atomic bomb. U.S. intelligence agencies assess that Iran has yet to begin a weapons program, but has \u201cundertaken activities that better position it to produce a nuclear device, if it chooses to do so.\u201d",
      "Iran\u2019s accelerated production of near weapons-grade uranium puts more pressure on Trump as he\u2019s repeatedly said he\u2019s open to negotiations with the Islamic Republic while also increasingly targeting Iran\u2019s oil sales with sanctions as part of his reimposed \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d policy.",
      "Even Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has final say on all state matters, in a speech in August opened the door to talks with the U.S., saying there is \u201cno harm\u201d in engaging with the \u201cenemy.\u201d",
      "More recently, he tempered that, saying that negotiations with America \u201care not intelligent, wise or honorable\u201d after Trump floated nuclear talks with Tehran.",
      "The IAEA already warned last December that Iran was poised to \u201cquite dramatically\u201d increase its stockpile of near weapons-grade uranium as it has started operating cascades of advanced centrifuges.",
      "That move came as a response to the Board of Governors at the IAEA passing a resolution condemning Iran for failing to cooperate fully with the agency. In the past, Iran has repeatedly responded to resolutions by the IAEA Board of Governors by further enhancing its nuclear program.",
      "Wednesday\u2019s report also said that Iran has also not reconsidered its September 2023 decision to ban some of the agency\u2019s most experienced inspectors from monitoring its nuclear program.",
      "\u201cThe Director General deeply regrets that Iran, despite having indicated a willingness to consider accepting the designation of four additional experienced Agency inspectors, did not accept their designations,\u201d the report said.",

      "Under the ceasefire agreement reached last month, Israel was to begin withdrawing on Saturday and complete the pullout within eight days. Hamas said any attempt to preserve the corridor as a buffer zone would be a \u201cblatant violation\u201d of the ceasefire agreement.",
      "There was no immediate comment from Egypt, a key mediator that is also opposed to any Israeli presence on the Gaza side of the border.",
      "Saturday is also the final day of the first phase of the ceasefire. Negotiations have yet to begin on the second and more difficult phase, in which Hamas is to release dozens of remaining hostages in exchange for a lasting truce. The war could resume if an agreement is not reached.",

Israel\u2019s Haaretz news outlet, citing military officials, said Israeli troops had found nine tunnels running under the Philadelphi corridor, all sealed from the Egyptian side since Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi came to power in 2013 and launched a campaign to destroy tunnels.",
      "It said the army believes most weapons in Gaza were produced locally, using some materials smuggled through the Rafah crossing and the nearby Kerem Shalom crossing, which is controlled by Israel. that the tunnels had not been used for years.

      "In January, Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire and the phased release of hostages, pausing 15 months of war.",
      "Under the first phase, Hamas has freed 25 living Israeli hostages and returned the bodies of eight more, in exchange for the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. Israeli forces have pulled back from most areas and there has been a surge in humanitarian aid.",
      "In the second phase, Hamas was to release the rest of the living hostages in exchange for more prisoners, a full Israeli withdrawal and a lasting ceasefire. The third phase would see the exchange of remains and the start of Gaza's daunting reconstruction.",

      "Netanyahu says he remains committed to bringing back all the hostages and destroying the military and governing capabilities of Hamas. Those aims are likely incompatible, however, as Hamas still rules Gaza and has ordered its fighters to kill hostages if their rescue appears imminent.",

      "Hamas is adamantly opposed to any lasting Israeli presence inside Gaza, which would be widely seen as a military occupation.",
      "Israel captured Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war, territories the Palestinians want for their own state. It withdrew soldiers and settlers from Gaza in 2005 but continued to control the territory\u2019s airspace, its coastline and all of its border crossings except Rafah.",
      "An Israeli decision to stay in the corridor could also further strain relations with Egypt, an American ally that has served as a key mediator with Hamas. Egypt has warned that it could undermine its nearly half century-old peace treaty with Israel, a cornerstone of American influence in the region.",
      "The United States has not taken a position on control of the corridor, and U.S. President Donald Trump has not said how it might figure into his proposal for Gaza\u2019s roughly 2 million Palestinians to be relocated to other countries so the U.S. can redevelop the territory as a tourist destination.",

      "The U.K. government has provided provisional approval to the creation of a second runway at Gatwick Airport outside London",
      "LONDON -- The U.K. government gave its provisional backing Thursday to the creation of a second runway at Gatwick Airport outside London if certain improvements were met, including on noise reduction \u2014 a move that has been met with incredulity from environmental campaigners.",
      "Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said in a written statement that she was \"minded to approve\u201d the expansion, which would involve moderately moving Gatwick's northern standby runway used for planes to taxi or as a backup.",
      "The original Gatwick project, which was rejected but then revised by planning inspectors, means that the final approval may be delayed by nine months.",
      "Under the new plan, Gatwick will have to ensure at least 50% of passengers traveling to and from the airport do so by public transport and take steps to mitigate noise.",
      "Gatwick, which is about 40 miles (65 kilometers) south of London and serves more than 40 million passengers a year, is the country's busiest single-runway airport, and second-busiest overall behind London's Heathrow Airport.",
      "Under the plan, Gatwick will have to move the current emergency runway 12 meters (39 feet) north away from the main runway in order to meet international safety standards. That would allow it to be used for departures of narrow-bodied planes such as Airbus A320s and Boeing 737s.",
      "The project, which will be funded privately, is expected to cost 2.2 billion pounds ($2.8 billion), could be completed by the end of the decade, if construction begins later this year.",
      "The expansion would allow it to cater for another 100,000 flights a year, taking capacity up to more than 380,000. It's projected to create 14,000 new jobs and generate 1 billion pounds ($1.26 billion) in annual economic benefits to the country.",
      "Gatwick, which is majority-owned by France-based VINCI Airports, has until April 24 to formally respond to the new proposals, while Alexander is expected to make a final decision shortly after that date, although a deadline has been extended to Oct. 27.",

      "A spike in demand for electricity from tech companies competing in the artificial intelligence race is upending forecasts for natural gas-fired power in the U.S., as utilities reconsider it as a major new power source",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- A spike in demand for electricity from tech companies competing in the artificial intelligence race is upending forecasts for natural gas-fired power in the U.S., as utilities reconsider it as a major new power source.",
      "That is not what many scientists and climate activists envisioned in the fight against climate change. And it is endangering progress on the greenhouse gas-reduction goals that scientists say are necessary to manage the damage from burning fossil fuels that warms the planet.",
      "Across the nation, tech companies are snapping up real estate and seeking new power projects to feed their energy-hungry operations.",
      "In some cases, Big Tech is building climate-friendlier projects like solar, wind, geothermal or battery storage.",
      "But industry decision-makers are also turning to natural gas for what they say is a cheap and reliable source of power, raising the prospect that gas-fired power will play a bigger role \u2014 and for a longer period of time \u2014 than even they had anticipated.",
      "\u201cGas is growing faster now and in the medium term than ever before,\u201d said Corianna Mah, a power and renewables analyst at data analytics firm Enverus.",
      "Before the spike in electricity demand last year, many in the industry had assumed that there would be few new gas plants and that the nation's fleet would gradually retire in favor of a grid powered by wind, solar, geothermal, batteries and possibly the next generation of nuclear power \u2014 sources that don't emit the planet-warming greenhouse gas carbon dioxide.",
      "For many countries, that ramp down is happening as they work toward the goal of slashing their emissions to zero \u2014 or at least, net zero \u2014 by 2050, which scientists say could help the world avoid the worst effects of climate change.",
      "In the U.S., the electric power sector is the second-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, according to government figures. And the construction of every new natural gas plant \u2014 built to last for decades \u2014 is a setback for climate goals, said John Quigley, a senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania's Kleinman Center for Energy Policy.",
      "\u201cAt a top level, we will not get to net zero by 2050 if we are building new gas plants. Period,\u201d Quigley said.",
      "Burning natural gas emits carbon dioxide, and before that, when it escapes from wellheads or pipelines in its unburned form, it's an even more potent greenhouse gas called methane.",
      "Quigley and others say there is enough solar, wind and battery storage projects on the drawing board to satisfy growing electricity demand. But, they say, utilities and grid operators lack the will to abandon natural gas.",
      "Enverus now projects the next five years will bring roughly 46 gigawatts of gas-fired power online. That compares to 39 gigawatts in the past five years, it said.",
      "Announcements last year alone include:",
      "\u2014 two 705-megawatt plants by Evergy in Kansas;",
      "\u2014 Entergy's 2,300-megawatt plant to serve Meta\u2019s $10 billion AI data center in northern Louisiana, a pair of new plants in Texas and another in Mississippi;",
      "\u2014 a 1,450-megawatt plant by the Tennessee Valley Authority;",
      "\u2014 a 1,400 megawatt Duke Energy project in North Carolina;",
      "\u2014 and Georgia Power's plans for three oil or gas units with a capacity of up to 1,300 megawatts.",
      "And that\u2019s not all.",
      "Calpine said it's exploring new gas-fired capacity in the congested mid-Atlantic region, especially Pennsylvania and Ohio, where analysts say the grid operator is trying to fast-track new gas-fired power plants into service.",
      "In Pennsylvania, the former Homer City coal-fired power plant is being transformed into a massive gas-fired station that's expected to supply a data center \u2014 and got a $5 million state grant to do it.",
      "On top of the artificial intelligence boom, the frenzy for new electricity is fueled by cryptomining, the broader electrification of society and a bipartisan push to bring manufacturing back to the U.S.",
      "It is coinciding with the closure of coal plants and aging nuclear plants, unable to compete with cheaper gas, solar and wind.",
      "Across the U.S., gas pipeline operators are exuberant about the new demand and are reporting strong interest in extending their lines.",
      "Chris Kalnin, the CEO of BKV, the largest natural-gas producer in the Barnett Shale gas reservoir in Texas, said the trend there is toward gas plants being built next to data centers in a booming data center corridor in metropolitan Dallas.",
      "Data center developers there are in an \u201carms race\u201d to secure power, Kalnin said.",
      "\u201cData center guys are trying to source power and trying to get to market with their data centers as fast as possible,\" Kalnin said. The key to signing up cloud-computing customers \"is getting your facility online quickly and getting your facility online quickly requires you to have power and dependable power and a cost-efficient power source.\u201d",
      "Rob Jennings of the American Petroleum Institute, said the sudden growth in actual and forecast electricity demand has put a premium on power sources that can be built fast and cheaply and are reliable.",
      "That means natural gas is once again attractive to investors over solar and wind, he said.",
      "\u201cIn the near term, the reality has dawned on most that it has to be gas,\u201d Jennings said.",
      "Industry officials say they strive to deliver electricity that is clean, reliable and affordable.",
      "For instance, some new gas plants are replacing higher-pollution coal-fired plants, some are designed to run only at times of high demand, some are paired with battery storage or a wind farm nearby and some are designed with carbon-capture technology or to run on a hydrogen blend, said Alex Bond of the Edison Electric Institute, which represents U.S. investor-owned electric companies.",
      "At the very least, building gas-fired capacity will have high-level political support.",
      "In his remarks to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland last month, President Donald Trump declared that he'd issue \u201cemergency declarations\u201d to get coal - and gas-plants built to make the U.S. a superpower of manufacturing, cryptomining and artificial intelligence.",
      "But Amanda Levin of the Natural Resources Defense Council said the U.S. must take big steps by 2035 to reduce its reliance on gas.",
      "That means slashing a fleet of roughly 1,500 gas plants down to about 100 if the U.S. is to meet strong climate commitments and preserve a chance of addressing climate change, she said.",
      "Still, she said there are reasons to be optimistic that gas plant projects on the drawing board won\u2019t get built.",
      "In recent weeks, Chinese tech startup Deepseek released a new AI model that it boasted was on par with similar models from U.S. companies and at a fraction of the cost \u2014 calling into question the need for a massive expansion of energy-hungry data centers.",
      "And some analysts believe utilities overestimate the electricity they\u2019ll need, essentially by double- or triple-counting data center proposals when firms express interest in multiple locations \u2014 but only build in one.",
      "Besides, Levin said, data center operators are getting better at energy efficiency, particularly in how they cool their servers.",
      "Even if all the gas plants are built, they may not get used, she said.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of reasons,\u201d Levin said, \"for why we might not actually see all of this (demand) materialize.\u201d",

      "Offshore wind and new gas projects have proven expensive and difficult. Large solar farms are cheaper and easier to build.",
      "But Vietnam also is emphasizing expansion of large solar farms to meet soaring demand for power generation. It forecasts it will need more than 211 gigawatts of energy by 2030 as its economy grows, 40% more than its previous estimate and more than Germany's current total capacity.",
      "\u201cThis reflects both an overall increase in potential power demand by 2030 and the fact that LNG (or liquefied natural gas) projects are not on track to be completed by 2030,\u201d said Giles Cooper, a partner at the international law firm Allens based in Hanoi who specializes in energy policy.",
      "Solar power expanded rapidly in Vietnam from 2018 to 2020, helped by generous government policies, as it leaped past its neighbors and some richer nations like the United Kingdom. But construction of new solar capacity stalled in 2020 as the Southeast Asian nation realized that its creaky electricity grid was getting overloaded since electricity was only available when the sun shone.",
      "\u201cIt was like the market almost stopped,\u201d said Dimitri Pescia, of Berlin-based thinktank Agora Energiewende.",
      "Use of polluting coal, which releases earth-warming gases into the atmosphere, has surged and Vietnam is set to become of the world's top five coal importers, displacing Taiwan, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "Like many other countries, Vietnam still needs to upgrade its rickety grid, which has failed to keep up with rapid growth of clean power generation. However, it has made improvements and gained experience dealing with energy sources that aren\u2019t always availables, Cooper said.",
      "Last year, authorities allowed electricity-guzzling factories to buy power directly from energy producers, aiming to ease pressure on the overstrained power grid and help big manufacturers like Samsung Electronics meet their climate targets. But that was hindered by a lack of space to build clean energy projects close to factories.",
      "Solar energy is \u201cseen as the most promising technology to kick start\u201d those direct purchases, Cooper said.",
      "But while it's building clean power capacity, Vietnam is also ramping up use of coal. That's partly to make up for lost hydropower capacity due to drought, and also to meet soaring demand as businesses shift factories from China to Vietnam.",
      "Vietnam is Southeast Asia's second-biggest coal producer after Indonesia. It also imported 50 million ton of coal in the first three quarters of 2024 \u2014 a 31% increase, according to government data.",
      "Pescia noted that Vietnam\u2019s coal-fired power plants aren\u2019t very old and operators have yet to recoup their investments.",
      "\u201cPhasing out coal in a country like Vietnam will take more time,\u201d he said.",

      "An attorney for a Texas pipeline company says he will show at trial that various Greenpeace entities coordinated delays and disruptions of a controversial oil pipeline's construction in North Dakota and defamed the company to its lenders",
      "MANDAN, N.D. -- An attorney for a Texas pipeline company said Wednesday at trial that he will prove various Greenpeace entities coordinated delays and disruptions of a controversial oil pipeline's construction in North Dakota, and defamed the company to its lenders.",
      "Attorneys for the Greenpeace defendants told a jury there is no evidence to back up the claims by Dallas-based Energy Transfer, which seeks potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in damages from Greenpeace.",
      "The case is tied to protests in 2016 and 2017 of the Dakota Access Pipeline and its controversial Missouri River crossing upstream of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's reservation. The tribe has long opposed the pipeline as a risk to its water supply. The pipeline was completed in 2017.",
      "Energy Transfer and its subsidiary Dakota Access allege trespass, nuisance, defamation and other offenses by Netherlands-based Greenpeace International and its American branch, Greenpeace USA. The lawsuit also names the group\u2019s funding arm, Greenpeace Fund Inc.",
      "Greenpeace paid professional protesters to come to the area, sent blockade supplies, organized or led protester trainings, passed \u201ccritical intel\u201d to the protesters and told untrue things to stop the pipeline from being built, the plaintiffs' attorney, Trey Cox, told the jury in his opening statement.",
      "\u201cThey didn't think that there would ever be a day of reckoning, but that day of reckoning begins today,\u201d Cox said in opening statements.",
      "Attorneys for the defendants emphasized what they said are distinctions between the various Greenpeace entities, such as what they do and how they're organized.",
      "They said Greenpeace International and Greenpeace Fund Inc. had zero involvement in the protests, while Greenpeace USA had six employees at Standing Rock for five to 51 days. Greenpeace is committed to nonviolence, and only got involved at Standing Rock because of tribal outreach, the attorneys said.",
      "\u201cThis was an Indigenous-led movement by the Native tribes, and we wanted them to have the spotlight,\" said Greenpeace USA attorney Everett Jack Jr.",
      "One of nine alleged defamatory statements \u2014 that Energy Transfer desecrated burial grounds and culturally important sites during construction \u2014 was made many times by the tribe before any of the Greenpeace statements, he said.",
      "Cox said that statement was included in a letter sent to Energy Transfer's banks and signed by the executive directors of Greenpeace International and Greenpeace USA.",
      "He added that Energy Transfer made 140 adjustments to its pipeline route in order to respect sacred sites.",
      "\u201cOur goal was to be a good corporate citizen in North Dakota,\u201d Cox said.",
      "More than 500 organizations from more than 50 countries signed on to that letter, said Greenpeace International attorney Courtney DeThomas, who described it as an act of free expression.",
      "No financial institution will testify that it received, read or was influenced by the letter, which was signed after thousands of protesters were already at Standing Rock, DeThomas said.",
      "Greenpeace representatives have said the lawsuit is an example of corporations abusing the legal system to go after critics and is a critical test of free speech and protest rights. An Energy Transfer spokesperson said the case is about Greenpeace not following the law, not free speech.",
      "Greenpeace says the lawsuit is going after $300 million, citing a figure from a previous federal case. The lawsuit complaint asks for damages in an amount to be proved at trial.",
      "Because of Greenpeace, Energy Transfer incurred over $82 million in security, contractor and property costs, and lost $80 million of profits, Cox told jurors. The pipeline was supposed to be completed by Jan. 1, 2017, but wasn\u2019t moving oil until five months later, he said.",
      "Greenpeace's \u201cdeceptive narrative scared off lenders\" and Energy Transfer lost half its banks, he said. The company suffered over $68 million in lost financing and spent $7.6 million for public relations \"to deal with these problems and lies\u201d from the \u201cwhisper campaign,\" Cox said.",
      "But Jack said Greenpeace had nothing to do with the company's delays in operating or refinancing. He also disputed how Energy Transfer is claiming or calculating its damages. The company also has no expert to back its claim of reputational harm, he said.",
      "Jury selection took place earlier in the week and the estimated five-week trial is now underway. Nine jurors and two alternates will hear the case in Mandan, North Dakota.",
      "The company filed a similar case in federal court in 2017, which a judge dismissed in 2019. Energy Transfer subsequently filed the lawsuit now at trial in state court.",
      "Earlier in February, Greenpeace International filed an anti-intimidation suit in the District Court of Amsterdam against Energy Transfer, saying the company acted wrongfully and should pay costs and damages resulting from its \u201cmeritless\u201d litigation.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Nvidia on Wednesday reported a surge in fourth-quarter profit and sales as demand for its specialized Blackwell chips which power artificial intelligence systems continued to grow.",
      "For the three months that ended Jan. 26, the tech giant based in Santa Clara, California, posted revenue of $39.3 billion, up 12% from the previous quarter and 78% from one year ago. Adjusted for one-time items, it earned 89 cents a share.",
      "\u201cDemand for Blackwell is amazing as reasoning AI adds another scaling law \u2014 increasing compute for training makes models smarter and increasing compute for long thinking makes the answer smarter,\u201d Nvidia Founder Jensen Huang said in a statement.",
      "Wednesday's earnings report topped Wall Street expectations. Analysts had been expecting adjusted earnings of 85 cents a share on revenue of $38.1 billion, according to FactSet.",
      "The fourth-quarter earnings are the company\u2019s first report since Chinese company DeepSeek boasted it had developed a large language model that could compete with ChatGPT and other U.S. rivals, but was more cost-effective in its use of Nvidia chips to train the system on troves of data.",

But the company in a statement commended DeepSeek\u2019s work as \u201can excellent AI advancement\u201d that leveraged \u201cwidely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant.\u201d",
      "The poster child of the AI boom, Nvidia has grown into the second-largest company on Wall Street \u2014 it is now worth over $3 trillion \u2014 and the stock\u2019s movement carries more weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes than every company except Apple.",
      "Nvidia and other companies benefiting from the AI boom have been a major reason the S&P 500 has climbed to record after record recently, with the latest coming last week. Their explosion of profits has helped to propel the market despite worries about stubbornly high inflation and possible pain coming for the U.S. economy from tariffs and other policies of President Donald Trump.",

      "MAE SOT, Thailand -- A new crackdown on online scam centers has led to over 7,000 people from around the world being held in a Myanmar border town awaiting repatriation, and those helping them say the unprecedented number is straining the resources of Thailand just across the border and leading to delays.",
      "The crackdown coordinated among Thailand, Myanmar and China follows Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra's visit to Beijing this month, where she told Chinese leader Xi Jinping that Thailand would act against the scam networks that have drawn in hundreds of thousands of people.",
      "They are often lured under false pretenses to work in scam centers in Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos, where they financially exploit people around the world through false romances, bogus investment pitches and illegal gambling schemes.",

      "Black athletes who speak out for political or social change have often paid a price for their actions.",
      "\u201cOne of the most definitive characteristics of pursuit of social justice, particularly by athletes today, is the idea of sacrifice,\u201d said Len Elmore, a former NBA player and now a senior lecturer in sports management at Columbia University. \u201cThey have to be willing to sacrifice because the broad society for a period of time \u2014 as it did to those past heroes \u2014 is going to penalize you.\u201d",
      "With his attempt to abolish diversity and inclusion programs, Trump has sought to ban transgender athletes from girls\u2019 and women\u2019s sports and has directed schools and universities to eliminate diversity initiatives or risk losing federal money. That includes no longer teaching material dealing with race and sexuality \u2014 part of his effort to end \u201cwokeness\u201d in schools.",
      "Companies \u2014 including Target, Google, Walmart and McDonald's \u2014 have scaled back or set aside diversity initiatives endorsed by much of corporate America during a 2020 nationwide reckoning on race to help root out systemic barriers that have hindered the advancement of marginalized groups.",
      "\u201cOn a basic level, it\u2019s just a fight for human dignity and human rights,\u201d said Joseph N. Cooper, a professor of Counseling, School Psychology and Sport at the University of Massachusetts Boston.",

      "Both the NBA and WNBA featured the \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d rallying cry on the courts in 2020 and partnered with players to find outlets for tangible social justice action. This included creating the NBA Foundation to spur economic growth in the Black community, with an initial contribution of $300 million over the next decade.",
      "Often individual players have taken the first bold steps in mixing sports and politics.",

      "Curry and his wife Ayesha endorsed Joe Biden for president during the 2020 Democratic National Convention. James headlined the \u201cMore Than A Vote\u201d Campaign, formed soon after police shot and killed Floyd and Breonna Taylor, to target systemic voter suppression and encourage Black people to vote.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not saying that their activism and decision to not go to the White House was a primary or even a major factor in the outcome of the 2020 election,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cBut no doubt, those athletes and athletes who have similar profiles as them leveraging their platform to promote freedom, human rights ... it's extremely powerful.\u201d",
      "Jaylen Brown of the NBA's Boston Celtics has more than 4.7 million followers across Instagram and X and for years has used his social media accounts to draw attention to social justice causes and boost small businesses.",

      "On Wednesday, senior U.S. officials set the government downsizing in motion via a memo dramatically expanding President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to scale back a workforce. Thousands of probationary employees have already been fired, and now the Republican administration is turning its attention to career officials with civil service protection.",
      "Government agencies have been directed to submit by March 13 their plans for what is known as a reduction in force, which would not only lay off employees but eliminate positions altogether.",
      "Despite showing some signs of weakening during the past year, the labor market remains healthy with plentiful jobs and relatively few layoffs.",
      "Earlier this month, the Labor Department reported that U.S. employers added 143,000 jobs in January, significantly fewer than December\u2019s 256,000 job gains. However, the unemployment rate ticked down to an even 4%, signaling a still very healthy labor market.",
      "Late in January, the Federal Reserve left its benchmark lending rate alone after issuing three cuts late in 2024. Fed officials are closely monitoring inflation and the labor market for signs of a potentially weakening economy. They expect only two rate cuts this year, down from previous projections of four.",
      "The most recent government consumer prices report that showed that inflation accelerated last month, creating some doubt about whether the Fed will be moved to cut rates at all this year.",
      "The consumer price index increased 3% in January from a year ago, up from a 3 1/2 year low of 2.4% in September. The new data shows that inflation has remained stubbornly above the Fed\u2019s 2% target for roughly the past six months after it fell steadily for about a year and a half.",
      "Overall, while layoffs remain low by historical standards, some high-profile companies have announced job cuts already this year.",
      "Workday, Dow, CNN, Starbucks, Southwest Airlines and Facebook parent company Meta have all trimmed their workforces already in 2025.",
      "Late in 2024, GM, Boeing, Cargill and Stellantis announced layoffs.",

      "Finance Secretary Paul Chan said during a budget speech that there would be a \u201ccumulative reduction\u201d of government recurrent expenditure by 7% from now until 2027-2028. Hong Kong\u2019s deficit had reached $87.2 billion Hong Kong dollars ($11.2 billion) for the financial year of 2024-2025, making it the third straight year of losses.",

      "Authorities have also earmarked $1 billion Hong Kong dollars for an AI research and development institute, and will set up a $10 billion ($1.29 billion) innovation and technology fund to invest in \u201cemerging and future industries of strategic importance.\u201d",
      "Hong Kong\u2019s finances have been impacted by a weak property sector, as home prices plunged some 30% over the last three years. It is also grappling with economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions as U.S.-China relations deteriorate.",

      "In a statement titled \u201cReset BP,\u201d the company said it will reduce its spending on net zero transition businesses by $5 billion a year to up to 2 billion. By contrast, it said it would increase its investments in oil and gas production by about 20% to $10 billion.",
      "CEO Murray Auchincloss said that the company is focusing its spending on BP\u2019s \u201chighest-returning businesses to drive growth\" and that will be \u201cvery selective\" in its investments in renewables.",
      "\u201cThis is a reset BP, with an unwavering focus on growing long-term shareholder value,\" he said.",
      "The strategy represents a pullback from the company's much-vaunted plan five years ago, under then CEO Bernard Looney, to shrink oil and gas production in favor of net zero businesses.",
      "The update, which came before a major shareholder meeting in London later Wednesday, is clearly aimed at bolstering investor support in light of the company's flagging share price.",
      "So far, the heavily-trailed update doesn't appear to have appealed to investors, and the company's share price was down 0.8%. However, the stock has been rallying in recent weeks on speculation that the company was about to change tack.",
      "The company's stock underperformance against its peers such as Shell, ExxonMobil and Chevron, has stoked market speculation that it may move its share listing to New York from London, or even make it a takeover target.",
      "The influential U.S. hedge fund Elliott Management recently took a nearly 5% stake in BP, and it is believed that it has sought to push BP back towards fossil fuels to boost profit.",
      "Auchincloss has already spun off BP\u2019s offshore wind business in a joint venture while he's looking to offload its onshore wind arm. The group has also been slashing costs in the face of tougher trading. Recently, it announced it would cut more than 5% of its workforce.",

      "President Donald Trump pledged a U-turn away from the Biden administration's commitment to fighting climate change and promoting clean energy",
      "President Donald Trump began dismantling his predecessor\u2019s climate change and renewable energy policies on his first day in office, declaring a national energy emergency to speed up fossil fuel development \u2013 a policy he has summed up as \u201cdrill, baby, drill.\u201d",
      "The declaration calls on the federal government to make it easier for companies to build oil and gas projects, in part by weakening environmental reviews, with the goal of lowering prices and selling to international markets.",
      "Democrats say that's a sham. They point out that the U.S. is producing more oil and natural gas than any other country and the Biden administration\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act boosted renewable energy at a critical time, creating jobs and addressing the climate change threat \u2013 2024 was Earth's hottest year on record amid the hottest 10-year stretch on record.",
      "Democrats were expected to offer a resolution in the Senate on Wednesday to terminate Trump's declaration, a move likely to be only symbolic given their minority status. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has already made the U.S. an even friendlier environment for fossil fuels. Congress is helping, too, with the House set to vote on a measure to repeal a Biden administration-era methane fee on oil and gas producers.",
      "Here are some ways the Trump administration has done so:",
      "The Biden administration last year paused evaluations of new liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminals. That pleased environmentalists concerned that a big surge in exports would contribute to planet-warming emissions. The pause didn't stop projects already under construction, but it delayed consideration of new projects.",
      "Trump reversed that pause.",
      "On Tuesday, oil and gas giant Shell said global LNG demand is forecast to rise by around 60% by 2040.",
      "The United States is expected to play a major role in meeting that demand, with its export capacity expected to double before 2030, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.",
      "\u201cI think investors have become much more comfortable that they can move towards final investment decisions without the concerns that they had over the last four years about potential roadblocks,\u201d said Christopher Treanor, an energy and environmental attorney at the law firm Akin.",
      "Trump has opened more land for oil and gas lease sales, shifting away from Biden's efforts to protect environmentally sensitive areas like Alaska\u2019s National Wildlife Refuge and to prevent large swaths of ocean from being available for offshore drilling, including major areas off coasts in the Pacific, Atlantic and parts of Alaska.",
      "Environmental groups are suing to stop Trump's moves.",
      "Expanding the area available for companies to lease and drill doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that more oil and gas will be produced. When leases were made available in the Artic National Wildlife Refuge, for example, only smaller companies bid and there were no buyers for a second lease sale.",
      "The Army Corps of Engineers marked hundreds of Clean Water Act permits for fast-tracking, citing Trump\u2019s order on energy, then removed that notation in its database. The agency said it needed to review active permit applications before publishing which ones will be fast-tracked.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t seem to be backing off,\" said Tom Pelton, spokesman with the Environmental Integrity Project. \u201cThey are just going to refine the list.\u201d",
      "Many of the permit applications that had been listed for expediting are for fossil fuel projects, but some others have nothing to do with energy, including a housing subdivision proposed by Chevron in southern California, according to the Environmental Integrity Project.",
      "David Bookbinder, the organization\u2019s director of law and policy, said the Trump administration is using the \u201cpretext of a national energy emergency\u201d to ask a federal agency to circumvent environmental protections to justify building more fossil fuel power plants. Bookbinder said there\u2019s no shortage of energy.",
      "Pat Parenteau, professor emeritus at Vermont Law & Graduate School, said Trump's policy changes aren't nearly as important as the deep cuts to the federal government that eliminate vital expertise.",
      "\u201cI think they are going to accomplish what no other administration has been able to do in terms of crippling the institutional capacity of the federal government to protect public health, to conserve national resources to save endangered species,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is where we are going to see long-term, permanent damage.\u201d",
      "Trump's energy emergency calls, for example, for undermining Endangered Species Act protections to ensure fast energy development, even assembling a rarely used committee \u2014 the so-called \u201cGod Squad\u201d \u2014 that could have authority to dismiss significant threats to species. That move was coupled with recent deep cuts to the Fish & Wildlife Service, which administers the law.",
      "Parenteau said some species are likely to go extinct.",
      "Trump also targeted wind energy with an order to temporarily halt offshore wind lease sales in federal waters and pause federal approvals, permits and loans for projects both onshore and offshore.",
      "In another order, he listed domestic energy resources that could help ensure a reliable, diversified and affordable supply of energy. Solar, wind and battery storage were omitted, though solar is the fastest-growing source of electricity generation in the United States. Trump has vowed to end tax credits for renewables as well, which would push up prices.",
      "Substantially slowing renewables could leave the U.S. wedded to coal and gas for far longer as coal plants are extended and new gas plants are built, said David Shepheard, partner and energy expert at the global consultant Baringa.",
      "Shepheard said the U.S. is facing unprecedented growth in electricity demand largely to meet needs from data centers and artificial intelligence, and increasingly the deck is stacked against renewables to meet it.",
      "A Baringa analysis found Trump\u2019s policies will drive up emissions and put the agreed-upon international climate threshold further out of reach.",

      "Jaylen, who joined the family on some Zoom calls as coaches pitched away, knows why Mikayla chose a program with only one Final Four berth way back in 1993 and now is on the verge of a second straight NCAA Tournament berth after a 10-year drought.",
      "\u201cShe was just about building something,\u201d Jaylen said.",
      "Thanks to Stanford playing on Wednesdays and Saturdays and the Vanderbilt women on Thursdays and Sundays, the Blakes siblings are able to keep up with each other's games.",
      "In that comeback against Auburn, Mikayla Blakes joined LeBron James as the only basketball players to score 55 or more points playing every second of a game since 2005 whether at the NBA, WNBA, NCAA men or women's basketball level.",
      "She also earned both the SEC player and freshman of the week, something not done in this league since Candace Parker in 2006.",
      "Ralph said while Blakes has not been a secret for a long time now, she liked how the point guard played against South Carolina. Ralph is focused on making sure her freshman doesn't have to score 50 to win as the Commodores host Texas A&M on Thursday night in their final home game of the regular season.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s done it in moments where we\u2019ve really needed it,\" Ralph said. \u201cBut she also has to get a little bit of help.\u201d",

      "Pass rusher Abdul Carter says he should be the No. 1 overall pick in this year's NFL draft",
      "INDIANAPOLIS -- Former Penn State star Abdul Carter made one thing clear Wednesday: He should be the No. 1 overall pick in this year's NFL draft.",
      "Carter was in the first group of players to speak with reporters at the NFL's annual scouting combine in Indianapolis, and he wasted no time declaring himself the top player in the 2025 draft class.",
      "\u201cI feel like I\u2019m the best player in the country and the best player should be picked first,\" he said. \"It\u2019s the work I put in with my dad, who trained me, and all the sacrifices I made, I know I\u2019m the best.\u201d",
      "Of course, such pronouncements have come to be expected during combine week.",
      "Still, Carter certainly has a case after finishing last season with 68 tackles, a Football Bowl Subdivision-leading 23 1/2 tackles for loss and 12 sacks to finish seventh nationally.",
      "He was the Big Ten's top defensive player in 2024 and finished his three-year career with 39 1/2 tackles for loss, 23 sacks and 14 passes defensed.",
      "The question is whether the 6-foot-3, 259-pound Carter is a better fit at defensive end or outside linebacker. Either way, he's likely to be the first or second defensive player selected April 24 in Green Bay, Wisconsin.",
      "Going No. 1 overall remains a challenge, though.",
      "Since 2007 only three defensive players have been chosen No. 1 overall \u2014 Jadeveon Clowney in 2014, Myles Garrett in 2017 and Travon Walker in 2022. Each was chosen primarily because of their pass-rushing ability.",
      "And leapfrogging the top two quarterbacks, Cam Ward of Miami and Shedeur Sanders of Colorado, or Heisman Trophy winner Travis Hunter could prove difficult.",
      "\u201cI think quarterbacks have kind of a lock on that or maybe a great pass rusher,\u201d Cincinnati Bengals director of player personnel Duke Tobin said Tuesday when asked about a non-quarterback being the top overall selection. \u201cOr maybe a guy that plays six positions like the one from my alma mater. We\u2019ll see.\u201d",
      "Tobin, who attended Colorado, was referring to Hunter, who is listed as a cornerback but hopes to also play receiver in the NFL as he did in college.",
      "Yet Carter believes he can defy the odds and become the third Penn State player to hear his name called first on draft weekend. Tennessee holds the No. 1 overall pick.",
      "\"Defensive players impact the game just as much as the quarterback,\u201d the 21-year-old Carter said. \u201cAll the teams that have won Super Bowls, they have that one standout player. I feel like I\u2019m that.\u201d",

      "The movie \u2014 ranked as the No. 1 sports film of all-time by The Associated Press in 2020 \u2014 was released in 1986. Hackman starred as Dale, a man who was given a second chance at coaching after his first one ended after striking one of his players years earlier.",
      "The tale follows the journey of the Hickory Huskers, a team that in the movie version took on big-city South Bend Central in the 1952 state championship game and won with Jimmy Chitwood hitting a buzzer-beater. The story is loosely based on the real-life story of small-school Milan winning Indiana\u2019s 1954 state championship. Bobby Plump was the hero in the actual game.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about change,\" Hackman once said. \"It\u2019s about what happens with change, how we deal with it, where we learn to give up our ideas about who we are as people.\u201d",
      "Since the movie's release, tourists have stopped in Milan and other sites where filming took place.",
      "Susan Cottingham, secretary and treasurer of the Milan \u201954 Hoosiers Museum and lifelong resident of the town of 1,800, said Thursday she expected a steady flow of visitors over the next few days, though the place was quiet hours after news of Hackman\u2019s death broke.",
      "Cottingham said she's watched the movie at least a dozen times \u2014 probably on the low end for Hoosiers aficionados \u2014 and has hazy memories of when Milan High made its real-life run to the championship. Other than to say, \u201cOh, my,\u201d she couldn't put into words what the team's accomplishment and movie have meant to the town.",
      "\u201cI remember the excitement and the celebration and my parents heading to the games,\u201d she said. \"The celebration when they got back from winning state, there was between 30 and 40,000 people here. So even at 5 years old, that was pretty noticeable.\u201d",
      "The museum first opened in the early 1960s with displays from the 1954 Milan High team. The museum moved into its current location in 2013 and features the uniforms worn in the movie and the set from the hospital scene featuring co-star Dennis Hopper.",
      "Hackman never visited the museum though he had a standing invitation. The movie's writer, Angelo Pizzo, and a few of the lesser-known cast members have made several appearances.",

Gary Woodland is a constant inspiration to us all.\u201d",
      "The Courage Award includes a contribution of $25,000 from the tour to a charity of the recipient's choice. Woodland selected Champion Charities \u2014 he and his wife are matching the donation \u2014 an organization dedicated to research and patient support in brain tumor, brain disease and brain trauma.",

I want to be there for my kids and my family, but I want to chase my dreams, too. I\u2019ve got a lot of dreams out here.",

      "\"What do you do with a player like him? And where do you first start him? And where does he help you on all sides of the ball?\" Tennessee coach Brian Callahan said. \u201cHe can return punts. He\u2019s got a really unique skill set. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s many players you can compare him to.\u201d",
      "Sure, some players have been featured in special packages on both sides of the ball. Some of the most prominent names on that list include Mike Vrabel and Troy Brown of the New England Patriots, William \u201cThe Refrigerator\u201d Perry of the Chicago Bears and Hall of Fame cornerback Deion Sanders, whose most productive offensive season came as a receiver with the Dallas Cowboys in 1996.",
      "Most consider Hall of Famer Chuck Bednarik the last true two-way star. He started at linebacker and along the offensive line for the Philadelphia Eagles from 1949 to 1962.",
      "The closest contender to Bednarik probably would be either Sanders or Roy Green, who was drafted as a safety, caught 33 passes while playing both ways in 1981 and then led the league with 1,555 yards receiving in 1984.",
      "But unlike 1997 Heisman winner Charles Woodson, the only other defensive player to win college football's most prestigious award, it appears nothing is out of Hunter's reach.",
      "\u201cHe can be whatever he wants to be, he's that talented,\u201d Denver Broncos general manager George Paton said. \u201cWe're still working through it, you know, but I think he's going to play on both sides of the ball. I'll just leave it at that.\u201d",
      "Hunter certainly thrived in both spots in college, first at Jackson State in Mississippi before following his coach, Sanders, to Boulder, Colorado. In his final two college seasons, Hunter had 153 receptions, 1,979 yards, 20 TDs, broke up 11 passes and had four interceptions.",
      "Combine organizers gave Hunter a defensive backs T-shirt, partly because it gives him the option of doing on-field drills with the defense Friday and offense Saturday \u2014 if he chooses.",
      "The first indication he'll do either, or both, could come Thursday when he's scheduled to speak with reporters.",
      "Sanders is already lobbying publicly for his star player, urging any team that doesn't intend to use Hunter as a cornerback and as a receiver to pass on drafting him.",
      "Yet most executives who fielded questions Tuesday seem to concur with Sanders' assessment that Hunter can excel at both, even if they believe he should start at cornerback as a rookie.",
      "\u201cTravis is obviously an exceptional talent. He can do it all, that\u2019s no secret,\u201d Carolina Panthers coach Dan Morgan said. \"Yes, he can play both sides of the ball. That\u2019s up to the team to decide that, whatever team that drafts him.\u201d",
      "One lingering question is how many snaps can Hunter be expected to play at the pro level without declining production?",
      "He held up relatively well at Colorado, where he logged roughly 2,500 snaps between 2023 and 2024. But he'll be facing bigger, stronger, faster opponents in the NFL, plus a more physical style, a 17-game regular season and even more games if his team makes the playoffs.",
      "Few would argue Hunter is the best athlete in this year's draft or a legitimate top-five talent, but everyone is trying to figure out just how high someone with Hunter's talent will go in a draft where quarterbacks tend to be the first pick, the second pick and last year the top three picks.",
      "That could the case again with Tennessee, Cleveland and the New York Giants holding the top three selections with each presumably looking for new franchise quarterbacks.",
      "\u201cI think quarterbacks have kind of a lock on that or maybe a great pass rusher,\u201d Cincinnati Bengals general manager Duke Tobin said when asked about a non-quarterback being the top overall selection. \u201cOr maybe a guy that plays six positions like the one from my alma mater (Colorado). We'll see.\u201d",

To diminish their achievements \u2014 or women\u2019s sport more broadly \u2014 is not just insulting but shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the importance of our sport in this country.\u201d",

      "NHL players who want to complete their college degrees will have a smoother pathway thanks to an agreement announced Wednesday between their union and Boston College",
      "NHL players who want to complete their college degrees will have a smoother pathway thanks to an agreement announced Wednesday between their union and Boston College.",
      "The deal would ease the way for current and former players to graduate from BC\u2019s Woods College of Advancing Studies, an arm of the university that offers flexible routes to certificates and degrees for non-traditional students. Among the alums: NHL Players Association executive director Marty Walsh.",
      "\u201cIt allowed me the opportunity to get a college degree,\u201d the former Boston mayor and U.S. secretary of labor said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cI went to school with people that were undergrads, that went to school at BC, taking class at night. And I was (also) in class with people in their 70s. Which is amazing.\u201d",
      "Woods College Dean David Goodman said the agreement is \u201cthe next evolution of a relationship that was already there,\u201d by removing \"some of the friction\" that might have prevented players from going back to school. It will make it easier for potential students to transfer previously earned credits, as one example, he said.",
      "Josh Jooris, who played three years at Union College before earning his first NHL contract with the Calgary Flames, is currently enrolled. Brooks Orpik, who played three years for the Eagles before an NHL career in which he won two Stanley Cup championships with the Pittsburgh Penguins, returned to school after he retired and earned his degree in 2022.",
      "\u201cI had promised a lot of people, including my parents and former BC hockey coach Jerry York, that I would finish college at some point,\u201d Orpik said. \u201cThe feeling of pride I had was just so different than anything, athletically, I have accomplished.\u201d",
      "Goodman said the students can study online, on-campus or hybrid. The new agreement doesn\u2019t have a limit on the number of players it can accept, but Goodman said he expects \u201ca couple of dozen\u201d; if there are more, the school would add sections to accommodate them, he said.",
      "The NHLPA agreement with BC comes the same week as the Major League Baseball Players Association announced a similar deal with Syracuse. Walsh said he hadn't talked to his baseball counterparts about it.",
      "\u201cWe all have programs,\u201d said NHLPA head, who needed more than 10 years, taking one or two classes per semester, to get his degree while he was working full-time, including as a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re a union that represents our workers on the on the ice and through to collective bargaining,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we also want to make sure that we\u2019re preparing these players, that when their careers are over, that they're set up for success going forward, too.\u201d",
      "The NHL says more than a third of its players played college hockey in the U.S. or Canada, with the majority of those leaving school before getting their degrees. Both Woods and Walsh noted that even players who go on to a successful NHL career would likely retire in their 30s, leaving a long worklife ahead of them.",
      "\u201cThese players are typically scooped up in their first two years,\u201d Woods said. \u201cWhen they come back after having been successful, coming back to one\u2019s education is not necessarily a sexy move. But it\u2019s finishing something they once started.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s time to rethink the overtime rule,\u201d league executive Troy Vincent said Wednesday at the NFL scouting combine.",
      "Vincent said the Competition Committee agrees overtime rules need to be addressed. Receiving the ball first has become more of an advantage than pre-2011 when it was a sudden death period. Receiving teams won 56.8% of games in overtime from 2017-24, up from 55.4% from 2001-11.",
      "Both teams currently have an opportunity to possess the ball in overtime unless a touchdown is scored on the first possession.",
      "The rules are different in the playoffs. Both teams get a chance to have a possession even if the offense scores a touchdown on the opening drive. That postseason change came after Buffalo\u2019s loss to Kansas City in a divisional round game in January 2022.",
      "Making the overtime rules the same in the regular season is a possible solution along with extending the period to 15 minutes.",

      "Norwegian soccer will vote this weekend on whether to scrap the use of video reviews in its top league after a turbulent couple of years since the technology was introduced in the Nordic country",
      "Norwegian soccer will vote this weekend on whether to scrap the use of video reviews in its top league after a turbulent couple of years since the technology was introduced.",
      "The decision will be noted with plenty of interest around the soccer world, given the video review system \u2014 or VAR, as it is better known \u2014 has had such a huge impact on the sport since being formally written into the laws of the game in 2018.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at how and why Norwegian soccer has reached this stage, what to expect in the vote, and why it is significant.",
      "The Norwegian soccer federation brought in video technology in 2023, in a way some found controversial. That\u2019s because the decision was reached before Norway\u2019s member-run clubs could establish a unified position on whether they wanted VAR, leading to disgruntlement among some fans who felt the democratic process in the Norwegian game had been undermined. Disillusionment increased in the early months of VAR\u2019s adoption, with the technology taking seven minutes to decide on an offside call in one match.",
      "Disillusionment about VAR quickly led to active protests about the use of the technology \u2014 and some were very quirky in their nature. A match between Rosenborg and Lillestr\u00f8m was suspended \u2014 and later abandoned and restaged behind closed doors \u2014 after fans threw fish cakes and then tennis balls onto the field soon after kickoff. In the second tier, fans of Lyn disrupted a game by throwing champagne corks onto the pitch in what was viewed as a protest against VAR. Amid such strident anti-VAR sentiment at certain clubs, the federation agreed to set up a working group to look further into the issue. And in a vote in January of the 32 clubs making up the top two leagues in Norway, 19 voted to scrap VAR and 13 to keep it. A recommendation was sent to the federation to support the clubs' majority decision and remove VAR \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d",
      "In a blow to anti-VAR campaigners, the Norwegian Football Association came out in favor of the technology a week later, with president Lise Klaveness saying the association acknowledged processes needed improving but wanted to retain video officials. \u201cThe governing body unanimously concluded that the best thing for Norwegian football is to maintain and develop it,\u201d Klaveness said. For Anders Kjellevold, chairman of the Norwegian supporters\u2019 alliance, it felt like a betrayal, saying most people thought the vote of the top clubs would be decisive. \u201dIf we end up with a decision where the FA decides not to listen to the affected clubs in this issue, then we are undermining club democracy and club democracy is a bulwark against many of the negative aspects of football,\" Kjellevold told The Associated Press.",
      "The final decision on whether to scrap VAR will be taken at a vote at the federation's congress taking place over Saturday and Sunday. All clubs which are active members of the federation are allowed to vote, along with leaders of the federation's counties and members of the federation board. A majority decision is needed either way. Anti-VAR campaigners fear many clubs who vote will end up siding with the view of the federation, as is the tradition in major decisions in order to maintain good relations with the governing body. The vast majority of clubs which will be voting aren't affected by VAR because the technology is used only in the top division.",
      "According to Kjellevold, anti-VAR sentiment lingers because the technology \u201cis incompatible with the intention of the game of football.\u201d It ruins \u201cthe experience of football as a live spectator,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause it brings up these stoppages in the game, it takes away some of the euphoria of a goal, which is just vital to a game and how we live it when we use so much of our time and effort to follow the game.\u201d Kjellevold is just as unhappy at how the whole process has been handled, chiefly how the teams most affected by VAR might not get their voices heard.",
      "The result of the vote is significant on a wider level because Norway scrapping VAR might influence supporters in other countries to step up protests about the technology in an effort to remove it from their leagues. Premier League clubs voted in June to continue using VAR after being asked to consider scrapping the technology following controversies last season. Sweden is one of the few countries in Europe to have decided against introducing VAR to its league.",

      "Jake Knapp joined the PGA Tour\u2019s sub-60 club on Thursday",
      "PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. -- Jake Knapp joined the PGA Tour's sub-60 club on Thursday.",
      "Knapp \u2014 the No. 99 player in golf's current world rankings \u2014 shot a bogey-free 59 in the opening round of the Cognizant Classic at PGA National, the 15th time that someone has broken 60 in a PGA Tour event.",
      "Knapp finished one shot off the tour scoring record of 58, done by Jim Furyk in the final round of the 2016 Travelers Championship. Knapp became the 14th player to shoot a sub-60 round; it has been done 15 times, with Furyk the one who has carded such a round twice.",
      "Knapp had a putt for eagle at the par-5 18th that would have tied Furyk\u2019s mark of 58 \u2014 18 feet, 8 inches was the measurement given by the PGA Tour. The eagle putt didn\u2019t have the speed and he tapped in for 59.",
      "The 12-birdie round on the par-71 course also broke the previous Cognizant scoring record of 61, first done in 2012 by Brian Harman and matched in 2021 by Matt Jones. There are three rounds of 62 in tournament history \u2014 Tiger Woods in the final round in 2012 on his way to a tie for second, Brandon Hagy in the second round in 2021 and eventual winner Chris Kirk in the second round of the 2023 event.",
      "There was barely any wind and PGA National was largely defenseless in the morning session. The closest there was to any trouble was the seventh hole, where Billy Horschel \u2014 a Florida Gator from his college days \u2014 used a club to poke at an actual alligator that was catching some sun near the green and got it to retreat back to its watery home.",
      "Even that was easy on Thursday morning. But nobody had an easier time than Knapp, who finished no better than a tie for 17th in any of his first seven starts of 2025 \u2014 and then played his way into golf history in Round 1 at PGA National.",
      "Knapp has one PGA Tour win, that coming at last year\u2019s Mexico Open. He\u2019s played the Cognizant only once before and did well, tying for fourth last year after shooting three rounds of 68 or better and finishing at 13 under.",
      "And this year, so far, he\u2019s even better.",
      "He started Thursday with five straight birdies, that stretch highlighted by a 60-foot putt at the par-4 second hole. The birdies kept coming in bunches; three in a row on holes 9 through 11, three more coming on holes 13 through 15 \u2014 the last of those a big breaking putt from 31 feet, going across the green before dropping dead center into the cup.",
      "A 12-footer for birdie on the par-3 17th hit the outside right edge of the cup and spun off, leaving him at 11 under with only the par-5 finishing hole left.",
      "A 335-yard tee shot left him 200 yards to the hole at No. 18, and a simple two-putt was all that remained to cap the history-making round.",

It represents a rare source of badly needed foreign currency to support its fragile economy and fund its nuclear program in the face of intense U.N. sanctions and North Korea's strict border closures during the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "A U.N. experts panel separately said it was investigating 58 suspected cyberattacks by North Korea between 2017 to 2023 that saw some $3 billion stolen to \u201creportedly help to fund the country\u2019s development of weapons of mass destruction.\u201d",

The blockchain analytics firm Certik has described the theft as \u201cthe largest breach\u201d in the history of blockchain transactions.",
      "The theft has seen overall crypto prices drop in recent days as investors in part have been spooked by the hack despite the industry getting a boost from the election of U.S. President Donald Trump.

      "Unwanted phone calls are out of control",
      "LONDON -- Unwanted phone calls are out of control. Whether it's a robocall trying to sell you something or spam calls from scammers trying to rip you off, it's enough to make you want to stop answering your phone. So what can you do to stop them?",
      "The scourge of unwanted phone calls has been branded an epidemic by consumer groups, while the Federal Communications Commission says it's the top consumer complaint. The calls are a nuisance to many ordinary people, some of whom have complained to The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cI need help on getting spam calls to stop,\u201d one reader said in an email. She's getting up to 14 calls a day despite the countermeasures she's employed.",
      "As the name implies, robocalls are automated calls to deliver recorded messages to a large number of phones. A robocall purely to deliver a message or collect a debt is allowed under U.S. regulations, but the Federal Trade Commission says robocalls with a recorded voice trying to sell you something are illegal unless you've given explicit written permission to receive them. Many robocalls are also probably scams, the FTC warns.",
      "If you're flooded by unsolicited calls, here are some ways to fight back.",
      "Smartphone users can turn on some built-in settings to combat unknown calls.",
      "Apple advises iPhone users to turn on the Silence Unknown Callers feature. Go to your \u201cSettings,\u201d then scroll down to \u201cApps,\u201d and then to \u201cPhone,\u201d where you'll see it under the \u201cCalls\u201d section. When you turn this on, any calls from numbers that you've never been in touch with and aren't saved in your contacts list will not ring through. Instead, they'll be sent to voicemail and show up in your list of recent calls.",
      "Android has a similar setting that allows you to block calls from private or unidentified numbers, although you will still receive calls from numbers that aren't stored in your contact list.",
      "Just keep in mind that you could also end up not getting important calls, which sometimes come from unknown numbers.",
      "If an unwanted call does get through, both Android and iPhone users can block the individual phone number by tapping on it in the recent callers or call history list. You can also enter numbers directly into your phone's block list.",
      "Sign up for the national Do Not Call registry, which is a list of numbers that have opted out of most telemarketing calls. The Federal Trade Commission, which runs the registry, says it only contains phone numbers and holds no other personally identifiable information, nor does the registry know whether the number is for a landline or a cellphone.",
      "The FTC says there are some exemptions, including political calls, calls from non-profit groups and charities, and legitimate survey groups that aren't selling anything. Also allowed are calls from companies up to 18 months after you've done \u2014 or sought to do \u2014 business with them.",
      "But it also warns that while having your number on the registry will cut down on unwanted sales calls, it won\u2019t stop scammers from making illegal calls.",
      "Other countries have similar registries. Canada has its own Do Not Call list while the U.K. has the Telephone Preference Service.",
      "Check whether your wireless carrier has a call-blocking service. Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T, three of the biggest U.S. networks, all have their own call filters for customers to block robocalls and report spam. There's typically a free basic version and an advanced version that requires a subscription fee.",
      "If your phone company's filters aren't good enough, try third-party apps to weed out unwanted callers.",
      "There are a host of smartphone apps available that promise to block spam calls, like Nomorobo, YouMail, Hiya, RoboKiller, TrueCaller and others. Many charge a monthly or annual subscription fee but some offer a free basic option. Some also can be installed on landline phones, but only if they use VOIP technology, not copper cables.",
      "The Associated Press hasn't tested any of these apps and isn't making specific recommendations. We recommend you read user reviews and try some out for yourself.",
      "Apple says the apps work by comparing a caller's number with a list of known numbers and labeling them, for example, spam or telemarketing. Then it might automatically block the call. \u201cIncoming calls are never sent to third-party developers,\u201d the company says.",
      "Did you know you can file a complaint with the FCC about specific spam calls? You can do so easily through an online form. It might not give you immediate satisfaction, but the National Consumer Law Center says data on complaints is the best tool federal agencies have for determining how big a problem robocalls are.",
      "While companies you've done business with can make robocalls to you, the National Consumer Law Center says it's probably because you gave consent - possibly hidden in fine print. But you can also revoke your consent at any time.",
      "Just tell the company representative that you want to \u201crevoke consent,\u201d and if that doesn't stop them, contact customer service and tell them that you don't consent to receive calls and want your number added to the company's \u201cdo not call\u201d list, the center says.",
      "You might be tempted to try to engage with the call in an attempt to get your number off the call list or be put through to a real person. The FTC warns against doing this and recommends that you just hang up.",
      "\u201cPressing numbers to speak to someone or remove you from the list will probably only lead to more robocalls,\u201d the agency says on its advice page. \u201cAnd the number on your caller ID probably isn\u2019t real. Caller ID is easy to fake\" and can't be trusted, it says.",
      "Cybersecurity company Kaspersky advises not even saying anything when you receive what you think is a robocall. We've all received scammy calls that start with something like \u201cHello, can you hear me?\u201d to which you've probably replied \u201cyes\u201d without thinking.",
      "Scammers \u201ccan then store the recording of your confirmation and use it for fraudulent activities,\u201d Kaspersky says. \u201cSo, avoid saying yes where possible.\u201d",

The company claims this factory will create \u201cthousands of jobs.\u201d",

      "Officials say a first-of-its-kind project will use a swarm of small, independent submersibles to monitor, protect and provide data on offshore artificial reefs whose purpose is to attract new marine life in otherwise barren sections of sea",
      "AYIA NAPA, Cyprus -- A first-of-its-kind project will use a swarm of small, independent submersibles to monitor, protect and provide data on offshore artificial reefs whose purpose is to attract new marine life in otherwise barren sections of sea, officials said Monday.",
      "The small, autonomous underwater vehicles, or AUVs, hailed as the \u201cfuture of underwater surveillance\u201d will be equipped with sensors and high-definition cameras to give scientists at the Cyprus Marine and Maritime Institute a clear picture on the effectiveness of their intricate artificial reefs designed and built using 3D printing.",
      "Made of an environmentally friendly cement mixture, the artificial reefs will be embedded with a docking station at which the AUVs can recharge and transmit collected data including video, said CMMI CEO Zakarias Siokouros.",
      "The advantage of the AUVs lies in their ability to loiter underwater for as long as a month at a time and provide a continuous flow of data while \u201cprotecting\u201d the reefs by alerting scientists to any disturbance in protected waters from illegal fishing and encroaching boats. Scientists would, in turn, notify local authorities.",
      "A trial run of the project, dubbed EONIOS, is currently underway off Cyprus\u2019 Ayia Napa marina. Scientists plan to place the artificial reefs in waters off Cyprus\u2019 southern coastal town of Limassol at a depth of around 20 meters (66 feet) where sunlight can still reach the seabed.",
      "\u201cThe reefs attract everything from vegetation to large fish and for waters off Cyprus where there isn\u2019t enough food for fish, we aim to create the appropriate environment to bring such fish there,\u201d Siokouros told The Associated Press following a demonstration of the AUVs' capabilities at the Ayia Napa Marina.",
      "EONIOS is a partnership between the CMMI, AUV makers Arkeocean of France, Cypriot tech company SignalGeneriX and French consultancy company Lanego.",
      "Siokouros said the partnership aims to market EONIOS to other countries who would want to build up their fish stocks using artificial reefs.",
      "A key selling point for the AUVs is that they can provide surveillance, 3D data collection and area protection at a significant discount compared to tethered submersibles, said Arkeocean official Tamara Brizard.",
      "\u201cOur goal is to make a system under which six of our mini-drones can do the same work for the price of one conventional drone,\u201d Brizard said.",
      "Arkeocean AUVs can currently pack a maximum 5 kilograms (11 pounds) of sensors and other gear and can operate to a depth of 300 meters (984 feet) although newer versions are being designed to reach 3,000 meters (9,842 feet). The AUVs receive commands through an attached acoustic antenna and can pinpoint their location.",
      "Battery-powered thrusters make the AUVs very stealthy and nearly undetectable, Brizard said, making them extremely useful for defense purposes such as surveillance in restricted waters. The AUVs can operate anywhere in the world thanks to an Iridium satellite antenna.",
      "The AUVs can also use undersea currents to roam, extending battery life. Another application is in the energy field where the submersibles can be used to detect seismic activity for offshore oil and gas exploration as well as finding suitable areas on which to build offshore wind and solar farms, said Brizard."

    "summary": "The House GOP is considering significant cuts to Medicaid, potentially slashing billions. Health policy experts say Medicaid provides vital services to many Americans",
    "story": [
      "Republicans are considering slashing billions of dollars from Medicaid funding.",
      "Earlier this week, the House passed the Republican budget resolution. One goal is to slash $2 trillion over a decade from the federal budget, which could bring significant cuts to Medicaid.",
      "Medicaid is a joint federal and state health insurance program for disabled and low-income Americans. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services works with state programs to administer Medicaid, which enrolls more than 72.1 million people.",
      "Medicaid offers benefits including nursing home care, personal care services and assistance paying for premiums and other costs, according to CMS.",
      "Health policy experts say Medicaid provides vital services to many vulnerable Americans and cuts to the program could put them at risk of losing medical care, either by taking away their coverage or by closing the centers that provide such care.",
      "\"The Medicaid program provides this life-saving coverage for the most vulnerable individuals in our country,\" Mariana Socal, an associate professor of health policy and management at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told ABC News. \"The uncertainty surrounding coverage in the Medicaid program moving forward ... is a big stressor in the lives of these individuals who depend on the program.\"",
      "\"I think we should all agree that protecting the health of vulnerable individuals should be a priority in this country, not seen as an opportunity for savings,\" she continued. \"You can save dollars, but then we are not saving lives.\"",
      "One of the proposals being considered by the GOP to cut down on Medicaid costs includes getting rid of the Medicaid match rates. Under the Affordable Care Act's expansion of Medicaid, the government finances 90% of the costs of those who were made newly eligible under the program.",
      "This could change to the government paying states the same it does for everyone else in the program, which is about two-thirds of total costs.",
      "Additionally, the federal government could implement per capita grants. Currently, the federal government matches what the states spend on payment -- at different levels for different states -- without a budget cap.",
      "The per capita cap would see the federal government set a limit on how much states can be reimbursed per enrollee.",
      "\"What that means then is, in order to live within that fixed budget, you would have to find either individuals to cut out of the program or services that you would not provide to people in the program,\" Dennis Shea, a professor of health policy and administration at Penn State College of Health & Human Development, told ABC News.",
      "Mark Peterson, a professor of public policy at UCLA Meyer and Renee Luskin School of Public Affairs, said the issue is not just cuts in federal spending but also how states would respond if there was a shortfall in funding.",
      "He said Medicaid is currently the single largest expenditure of the states, on average, and dramatic cuts in funding from the federal government would be an enormous hole for the states to fill.",
      "\"If they were to try to fill in, they either have to raise taxes significantly, which is not likely to happen, or they would have to cut, say, their next major spending category, which is also not likely,\" Peterson told ABC News. \"And even very wealthy states, like California, for instance, have been going through their own budget struggles. So, it's not as though they're sitting on a pile of money that's ready to reallocate. There would be extremely serious budgetary consequences.\"",
      "The experts say Medicaid cuts would also impact the health care system. Medicaid provides a great deal of funding for hospitals, long-term care facilities, nursing homes and services for children with special needs.",
      "Shea said one example is that Medicaid pays for more than 60% of nursing home residents. If funds are slashed, then residents won't have money to pay for nursing home care and nursing homes won't receive that revenue, which could lead to the closure of nursing homes.",
      "Rural Americans would also be at risk of losing services. Shea said many rural hospitals and community health centers have already closed and the ones that remain open already face funding challenges.",
      "If they were to lose Medicaid funding, they could face closures, which could deprive rural Americans of vital health services, he explained.",
      "\"In rural areas, Medicaid coverage tends to be a larger proportion of the coverage, so it's not unusual for 30, 40, 50% of people in a rural area to be covered by Medicaid,\" he said. \"And if that source of revenue is not coming into the hospitals or the nursing homes or the physician practices in those areas, it makes it that much harder for those businesses to survive.\"",
      "\"And so, we would probably see thousands of nursing homes close in rural areas \u2026 and you would see hundreds of hospitals closing too,\" he added."

      "Health and Human Services issued new guidance that recognizes only two sexes.",
      "Some major medical associations are pushing back against the Department of Health and Human Services' updated definitions of biological sex in federal policy in the wake of President Donald Trump's executive order.",
      "HHS issued new guidance on Feb. 19 where it said it \"recognizes there are only two sexes: male and female,\" adding: \"HHS will use these definitions and promote policies acknowledging that women are biologically female and men are biologically male.\"",
      "\"There is extensive scientific research that supports the complexity of sex and gender beyond binary classifications,\" American Psychological Association CEO Arthur C. Evans Jr., Ph.D., told ABC News in a statement. \"The new restrictive definition of sex ignores decades of science, increasing harm to youth and families, while undermining critical mental health outcomes.\"",
      "The new HHS guidance for the federal government defines \"sex\" as \"a person's immutable biological classification as either male or female.\" It further defines \"female\" as \"a person of the sex characterized by a reproductive system with the biological function of producing eggs (ova)\" and \"male\" as \"a person of the sex characterized by a reproductive system with the biological function of producing sperm.\" It additionally defines the definition of a \"woman\" as \"an adult human female\" and a \"man\" as \"an adult human male.\"",
      "The updated HHS guidance also includes definitions for \"father\" as describing a \"male parent\" and \"mother\" as describing a \"female parent.\"",
      "The HHS guidance doesn't mention intersex individuals -- people born with sex characteristics that don't fit typical definitions of male or female. The National Institutes of Health estimates that about .018% of the population is considered intersex.",
      "The federal government previously defined \"sex\" in broader terms.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one of HHS' agencies, defines sex as \"an individual's biological status as male, female, or something else. Sex is assigned at birth and associated with physical attributes, such as anatomy and chromosomes.\"",
      "The CDC's website defines gender as \"the cultural roles, behaviors, activities and attributes expected of people based on their sex.\"",
      "After Trump took office, the administration ordered the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration to remove certain public health websites, including the CDC's page with more gender-inclusive definitions, which were then taken offline. A judge granted a temporary restraining order to restore the pages after organizations filed lawsuits.",
      "A banner at the top of the CDC page currently states: \"Per a court order, HHS is required to restore this website as of 11:59PM ET, February 14, 2025. Any information on this page promoting gender ideology is extremely inaccurate and disconnected from the immutable biological reality that there are two sexes, male and female.\"",
      "The HHS did not include its own definition of gender in its updated guidance posted Feb. 19.",
      "The second Trump administration has issued a number of executive orders targeting the transgender population, and a number of lawsuits have been filed to challenge them.",
      "Human biology is complex, and not all individuals fit neatly into binary categories, Evans told ABC News.",
      "\"We cannot just ignore the biological science that some people are born with a difference of sex development (DSD),\" Evans said in his statement. \"DSD are congenital conditions where the development of anatomical, chromosomal or gonadal sex is atypical. It is important that we support access to psychological and medical interventions for such individuals who do not fall into the male or female category, putting them at a higher risk of depression and anxiety.\"",
      "Evans also said the new HHS definitions excluded the concept of gender identity.",
      "\"It is crucial to recognize the psychological science on the validity of gender identity, as it allows for a more accurate understanding of individual experiences beyond the binary framework of biological sex,\" he said. \"Research consistently shows that affirming both sex and gender identity is vital for promoting mental health and well-being.\"",
      "In its updated guidance, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the Trump administration \"is bringing back common sense and restoring biological truth to the federal government. The prior administration's policy of trying to engineer gender ideology into every aspect of public life is over.\"",
      "The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said in a statement that it will not change its current definitions of sex and gender, and will use inclusive language \"to recognize and affirm all people who seek and receive care from obstetrician-gynecologists.\"",
      "The ACOG also called on researchers to diversify studies by including gender-expansive participants and to report study participant characteristics inclusively by using language beyond traditional binary descriptors.",
      "The American Academy of Family Physicians noted its long-standing policy on care for transgender and nonbinary patients, saying in a statement that it will continue to recognize that \"diversity in gender identity and expression is a normal part of human existence and does not represent pathology.\"",
      "The American Academy of Pediatrics said it will comply with all applicable executive orders as the law requires.\u00a0\"The AAP continues to hold that medical decisions are best made by patients, their families and their physicians, supported by medical evidence,\" the organization said in a statement.",
      "The American Medical Association's policy on the Medical Spectrum of Gender, first enacted in 2018, appears to remain unchanged. It \"affirms that an individual\u2019s genotypic sex, phenotypic sex, sexual orientation, gender and gender identity are not always aligned or indicative of the other, and that gender for many individuals may differ from the sex assigned at birth,\" according to the policy.",
      "HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon told ABC News the department has no comment.",
      "ABC News has reached out to the White House for comment.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Thursday, a day after HHS updated its guidance, that Trump \"reestablished the scientific and biological truth that there are only two sexes in this country -- male and female -- that those are biologically based determinations.\u00a0 They are not based and can never be based on gender identity.\"",

      "While Liccardo\u2019s legislation is not expected to become law over the next two years under Republican majorities in the House and Senate, the freshman Democrat said that the president and first lady made a windfall on their respective meme coins and is working to build support that culminates behind a Democrat majority.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s make corruption criminal again,\u201d Liccardo, a former federal and local criminal prosecutor, said. \u201cOur public offices belong to the public, not the officeholders, nor should they leverage their political authority for financial gain. The Trumps\u2019 issuance of meme coins financially exploits the public for personal gain, and raises the specter of insider trading and foreign influence over the Executive Branch.\u201d",
      "The proposal would forbid federal officials from promoting a range of financial assets or from participating in any conduct likely to financially benefit themselves, according to Liccardo. The legislation would impose criminal and civil penalties and includes a prohibition that applies to any financial asset, such as the stock of Truth Social.",
      "Liccardo wants to subject violators to criminal and civil penalties while stopping them from profiting from an asset issued before the bill's enactment -- giving it retroactive element intended to address the launch of $TRUMP.",

      "Republicans getting pressure from Democrats and some moderates in their party.",
      "House Republicans signaled they\u2019re going full steam ahead on significant changes to Medicaid, despite pressure from Democrats and even some moderates in their party.",
      "The suggested overhauls to the program, which provides health care for lower-income Americans and those with disabilities, are part of an effort to slash federal spending and hit the House GOP\u2019s goal of cutting $2 trillion over a decade from the federal budget.",
      "\u201cI support any plan that helps Medicaid be sustainable. And the current trajectory of Medicaid is not,\u201d said Florida Republican Rep. Byron Donalds, who recently declared he's running for governor of Florida -- a state with millions of Medicaid recipients.",
      "\"Medicaid is supposed to be for people who are disabled, for children, for single parents with multiple kids. That's what Medicaid is for. And if we continue down this line where it just becomes a bigger and bigger portfolio of beneficiaries, the federal government is not going to be able to afford the match,\" Donalds added.",
      "In a letter to Speaker Mike Johnson, moderate Republican members of the Congressional Hispanic Conference warned \"slashing Medicaid would have serious consequences, particularly in rural and predominantly Hispanic communities.\"",
      "Asked what he would say to Republican colleagues who are worried cuts to Medicaid will have a serious impact on lower income Americans, Donalds replied, \"I think some of that is, quite frankly, fear-based. We know the Democrats are already running ads about Medicaid and about how what we're trying to do is damaging to people and it\u2019s just simply not true.\"",
      "Some GOP members have floated adding new work requirements to the program and capping the amount of money states receive to run their Medicaid programs -- a pitch that could drastically reduce the number of people on Medicaid and limit the funding available for beneficiaries.",
      "\"I don't consider that a cut,\" Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., said about work requirements. \"I don't consider block-granting to the states a cut. The Democrats are using that but it\u2019s just not right.\"",
      "The exact plan is still unclear. Approving the House budget blueprint Tuesday night was just the first step in a months-long budgeting process that could stretch into the summer.",
      "\"We're very early in this process,\" New York Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, a moderate who represents a Staten Island district with a significant number of Medicaid recipients, said.",
      "\"Maybe you should wait until we actually do the work and highlight what we're going to do,\" she said.",
      "Republicans also believe they can achieve a significant amount of their spending cuts by targeting fraud in Medicaid and Medicare. But eliminating all fraud and waste would likely only chip away at Republicans\u2019 goal.",
      "Asked about that approach, Malliotakis said, \"There's about $50 billion a year in fraud, just within the Medicaid program.\"",
      "But whether Republicans can get to the kinds of numbers they're talking about by just eliminating fraud, Malliotakis said, \"Well, yes. Within the health care. You're going to look at that, you're going to look at the loopholes the states have put in place.",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats are pouncing.",
      "An internal Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee memo first obtained by ABC News shows Democrats aim to make Medicaid cuts \"politically perilous for House Republicans\" in the November 2026 midterm elections.",
      "\u201cRather than delivering on their campaign promises to lower the high cost of living, [Republicans] are poised to pass an extreme budget scheme that would decimate affordable health care and take food off the tables of millions of American families,\u201d the memo reads.",

    "story": [
      "The president and Musk were asked about the confusion at his Cabinet meeting.",
      "After days of confusion over emails asking government workers to detail what they had done over the previous week, President Donald Trump didn't clear things up when asked about them in his Cabinet meeting on Wednesday.",
      "Asked by ABC News' Mary Bruce if the 1million workers who didn't reply to the email risked termination, Trump said, \"I wouldn't say that we're thrilled about it. They haven't responded. Now, maybe they don't exist. Maybe we're paying people that don't exist,\" he said. \"But those people are on the bubble ...they're going to be gone.\"",
      "But despite Trump's assertion, there is still mixed guidance on how employees should respond.",
      "Millions of workers were left in limbo after Musk posted on X Saturday that they could be terminated if they did not respond to a \"What did you do last week?\" email from the Office of Personnel Management. Soon after the e-mail was sent, some agency leaders, particularly those who work with sensitive and confidential information, told their employees not to reply. Others cautioned against replying to the request without guidance.",
      "OPM late Monday afternoon offered guidance saying a reply was not mandatory and to rely on guidance from individual agencies. Then Musk offered another threat in a post Monday night, saying employees were being given \"another chance\" and \"Failure to respond a second time will result in termination\" and set a deadline of Tuesday night.",
      "To add to the confusion, Musk said he intended to send another email without saying when. Asked by Bruce if a response to the next email, Trump didn't answer directly, saying, \"We're trying to figure out, do they exist? Who are they? And it's possible that a lot of those people will be actually fired.\"",
      "It is unclear if Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency have any power to terminate employees over the email request. The previous emails sent from OPM, in essence the government's human relations department, did not have any mention of termination -- those threats were issued only from Musk on his X platform.",
      "Those not following Musk on social media might have not been aware of the threats.",
      "The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), the largest union of federal workers, called the email unlawful and has threatened legal action.",
      "Wednesday's remarks came after a confusing weekend for government workers.",
      "Senior White House officials -- who had not been fully briefed on the plan -- were initially caught off guard, multiple sources told ABC News.",
      "Before OPM weighed in Monday afternoon, some agencies like Health and Human Services first told employees to reply then reversed itself hours later before issuing specific guidelines on what employees could or could not post in their replies.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt claimed Tuesday that the move was to ensure that federal employees were actually working their jobs and declined to comment if this was a tactic to eliminate more federal jobs.",
      "The White House claimed Trump sent Musk an e-mail with five things he had done, but they were generic talking points.",
      "Musk told reporters Wednesday that the email was his idea after the president told him to \"be more aggressive\" with his cuts.",
      "\"I said, 'Can we send out an email to everyone just saying what did you get done last week?' The president said, 'Yes.' So, we did that,\" Musk said.",
      "Musk used similar tactics when he bought Twitter, which he renamed X, making employees submit weekly reports detailing projects and accomplishments and contributions. Replying to a post on Saturday pointing out the simiarities , Musk wrote, \u201cIt works.\u201d",
      "When asked by Bruce if he had a target number of employees he wanted to cut, Musk didn't give a concrete answer.",
      "\"We wish to keep everyone who is doing a job that is essential and doing that job well, but if the job is not essential or they're not doing the job well, they obviously should not,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "It only provides records for $9.6 billion in savings from contract terminations.",
      "Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency have released their second batch of data listing the federal contracts they've terminated as part of their breakneck cost-cutting measures -- claiming that it's saved a total of $65 billion in federal funds.",
      "But the contracts -- and $144 million in lease terminations -- are the only items the website provides numbers for, making it impossible to verify exactly what, and how much, DOGE has slashed in total.",
      "DOGE, on the website, notes that they're working to provide real-time data, but that there's currently a lag in the data due to the federal procurement data system.",
      "The contracts together account for $9.6 billion in savings -- only a fraction of the $65 billion total that DOGE claims to have saved from what it calls a \"combination of fraud detection/deletion, contract/lease cancellations, contract/lease renegotiations, asset sales, grant cancellations, workforce reductions, programmatic changes, and regulatory savings.\"",
      "The new data, posted overnight Monday, showed a total of 2,299 federal contracts across 47 federal departments and agencies that DOGE claims to have terminated, which is roughly double the number of more than 1,100 terminated contracts they had posted last week.",
      "Monday's additions did not include an update to DOGE's list of terminated real estate leases, as the latest data shows the same amount of $144 million from last week.",
      "The website now includes a new disclaimer, after last week's news that DOGE's largest claimed savings contract was revised down from $8 billion to $8 million.",
      "\"There may be discrepencies [sic] between FPDS and the posted numbers, the latter of which originate directly from the agency contracting officials. If you would like to report a potential discrepancy, please DM the @DOGE X account,\" the website reads.",
      "There's no public disclosure that shows the entirety of DOGE's cost cutting measures.",
      "DOGE's newly released data also dropped some of the other top contracts it claimed to have terminated in its data from last week, including three $655 million cuts at the U.S. Agency for International Development, which CBS News reported were erroneously counted three times.",
      "Similar to last week's data, DOGE now lists nearly 800 contracts where contract obligations have already been fully delivered -- meaning 34% of the contracts they claimed to have terminated will not actually result in saving any money.",
      "A White House official told ABC News that DOGE works with agencies to compute the savings and has been liaising directly with specific units within agencies and with contracting officers who are responsible for the individual contracts.",
      "The official also said they're using a conservative methodology of calculating savings because they're subtracting the contracts' obligated dollars from the ceiling amounts. However, for many contracts the ceiling dollars are much higher than what is actually expected to be spent.",
      "\"DOGE is identifying waste that most Americans never knew existed. That is a good thing. Also, many of these contracts were also on auto-renew -- so DOGE is preventing tax dollars from being wasted on these scams in the future,\" a White House official told ABC News.",
      "The DOGE website now also ranks how agencies are doing according to DOGE's own calculations of efficiency -- which Musk, on X, said allows the public see \"who is making the most or least progress.\"",
      "The so-called \"Agency Efficiency Leaderboard,\" which came ahead of Musk and the White House's first meeting with cabinet members Wednesday, currently ranks the Education Department, the General Services Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency as having saved the most amount of money.",
      "The website, however, does not explain what cuts are being counted toward the savings and whether the rankings are by dollar amount or percentage.",
      "The site also provides only rudimentary information about some of the contracts DOGE has terminated.",
      "One of them is an Office of Personnel Management contract that DOGE claims to have saved $318 million by terminating, but it's difficult to trace what the contract was for because DOGE did not include a receipt for the contract like it has with most other contracts it claims to have terminated.",
      "Based on DOGE's description, the contract appears to have been at a \"pre-award\" proposal request stage, for providing \"human resources related products and services to their current and future Recruitment and Branding clients.\"",
      "Another top terminated contract is a National Institute of Health contract to software company Advanced Automation Technologies from which DOGE claims to have saved $149 million, but DOGE's website linked to a different NIH contract for leasing and maintaining refrigerated gas tanks, which was capped at just $118,832.",
      "NIH's contract with Advanced Automation Technologies, with the same contract ID, is capped at just $1.4 million, which is nowhere near the $149 million figure DOGE has touted on its website, according to federal procurement data.",
      "Also being called into question is a contract termination involving the financial management and IT company Centennial Technologies, who told the New York Times last week that the contract was actually canceled last fall, under the Biden administration, and was not canceled by DOGE.",
      "Centennial's CEO Mani Allu told the New York Times that the government's slow-moving contracts database had not been updated to show the cancellation until this month, making the change appear new.",
      "Representatives for Centennial did not respond to a request from comment from ABC News.",
      "Federal contract data shows that no money has been obligated for this contract since last summer when it was signed.",
      "Musk, who has said DOGE will be \"maximally transparent,\" pledged during Wednesday's cabinet meeting to fix any mistakes.",
      "\"We will make mistakes. We won't be perfect. But when we make mistakes, we'll fix it very quickly,\" Musk said, citing an example of how DOGE restored an Ebola prevention program within USAID.",
      "Musk also praised Trump's cabinet members, calling them the \"best cabinet ever.\"",
      "Trump at the meeting also praised Musk and DOGE's work, echoing that they're cutting \"theft and fraud\" and saying there's \"a lot of fraud and probably some fraud that we're not going to be able to prove is fraud.\"",
      "\"But when you hear the names and the places where this money's going, it's -- it's a disgrace,\" Trump said.",

      "On a teleconference Wednesday with the heads of the FBI's 55 field offices, Patel suggested that he wants the FBI to establish a formal relationship with the UFC, which could develop programs for agents to improve their physical fitness, said sources who had been briefed on Wednesday's call.",

      "Both prosecutors and defense attorneys told Judge Jennifer Schiffer that Syed doesn\u2019t pose a risk to public safety. Schiffer also heard from the victim\u2019s family, who urged her uphold Syed\u2019s sentence.",
      "After several hours of testimony, Schiffer indicated that her written order will address Syed\u2019s recent accomplishments and the unimaginable suffering of the victim\u2019s family as well as the horrific nature of the crime. \u201cIt not my intention to leave everyone waiting for too long,\u201d she said.",
      "Syed, now 43, was released from a life sentence in 2022 after Baltimore prosecutors uncovered problems with the case and asked a judge to overturn his murder conviction in the 1999 slaying of his high school ex-girlfriend, Hae Min Lee, who was found strangled to death and buried in a makeshift grave.",

      "The judge acknowledged the \u201clengthy and frankly tortured history of this case.\u201d She described how the grief of Lee\u2019s family has been compounded through decades of litigation and intense media attention.",
      "Syed, however, is not the same person he was at age 17, she said.",
      "\u201cHe has changed. He has matured, and he has had some success in society,\u201d Schiffer said.",
      "Lee never had the chance \u201cto do any of these things,\u201d she added.",
      "The emotional testimony included character witnesses who described Syed as having an even temper, strong communication skills, loving relationships and an impressive ability to remain hopeful during 23 years behind bars.",
      "Eric Simmons, an exoneree who was incarcerated with Syed for many years, said he demonstrated a level of humanity and compassion from the very beginning of his prison term.",

      "But Lee's family and their attorney urged the judge to honor Syed\u2019s conviction and uphold his sentence. They said the recent proceedings \u2014 starting in 2022 when they were shocked to learn of Syed\u2019s abrupt release \u2014 have ripped open old wounds.",
      "Lee\u2019s younger brother, Young Lee, said he endured the pain of sitting through Syed\u2019s original trial. When it was finally over, he said, the guilty verdict meant his sister \u201ccould finally rest in peace.\u201d Learning of the state\u2019s efforts to throw out Syed\u2019s conviction left him in shock, wondering if prosecutors were still on the family\u2019s side, he said through tears.",
      "When he was finished speaking, the judge offered an apology: \u201cI am so sorry for what you\u2019ve been through, and all I can say is that your words are not lost on me, and my heart goes out to you,\u201d she told him.",
      "In a videotaped statement speaking in Korean, Lee\u2019s mother questioned the integrity of the American criminal justice system that she believed had solved her daughter\u2019s murder 25 years ago. She said she took comfort in Syed\u2019s conviction even as she struggled to maintain her will to live.",

      "A state judge tossed out racketeering charges against New Jersey Democratic power broker George Norcross and those charged alongside him",
      "TRENTON, N.J. -- A state judge on Wednesday agreed to toss out racketeering charges against New Jersey Democratic power broker George Norcross and those charged alongside him.",
      "Superior Court Judge Peter Warshaw granted Norcross' and other defendants' motion to dismiss a state grand jury's indictment on racketeering charges brough by Attorney General Matt Platkin.",
      "Platkin said in a statement he plans to appeal the judge's ruling.",
      "The charges stem from a June 2024 indictment, announced by Platkin at a news conference at which Norcross himself took the unusual step of appearing at in person and sitting directly in front of the attorney general. The charges accused Norcross and five other defendants of running \u201can enterprise\u201d going back to 2012 to use their political influence to craft legislation to serve their own interests.",
      "In a nearly 100-page ruling, the judge found the prosecution's allegations did not amount to criminal coercion or extortion and are time-barred.",
      "\u201cDefendants correctly argue that when considering private parties negotiating economic deals in a free market system, threats are sometimes neither wrongful or unlawful. In these situations, there may be nothing inherently wrong in using economic fear to obtain property,\u201d Warshaw wrote.",
      "Among the allegations against Norcross were charges that he threatened a developer who would not relinquish his rights to waterfront property in Camden, New Jersey, on Norcross\u2019 terms. The indictment cites a profanity-laden phone recording of Norcross in which he tells the developer he will face \u201cenormous consequences.\u201d The person asks if Norcross is threatening him, according to the indictment. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Norcross replies.",
      "The indictment also said Norcross and the co-defendants extorted and coerced businesses with property rights on Camden\u2019s waterfront and obtained tax incentive credits, which they then sold for millions of dollars. Platkin described Camden as long suffering from economic decline.",
      "At the time, defense lawyer Michael Critchley had accused Platkin of having a \u201cvendetta\u201d against Norcross, noting that the waterfront development had been investigated for years by several agencies, including federal prosecutors in Philadelphia and New Jersey, as well as Platkin\u2019s predecessor.",
      "Those investigations came to nothing, Critchley said.",
      "Norcross, who served as executive chairman of the insurance firm Conner Strong & Buckelew, had been widely viewed as among the most influential unelected Democrats in the state.",
      "He was a Democratic National Committee member until 2021 and previously served as the head of the Camden County Democratic Party. A close friend to the former state Senate president, he was a behind-the-scenes power player and well-known financial backer to Democrats in the state and nationwide.",
      "In addition to dismissing the indictment against Norcross, the judge's order applied to his brother and co-defendant Philip A. Norcross, a New Jersey lawyer; George Norcross\u2019s longtime lawyer William M. Tambussi; Camden Community Partnership chief executive and former Camden Mayor Dana L. Redd; Sidney R. Brown, chief executive of trucking and logistics company NFI; and development company executive John J. O\u2019Donnell."

      "Musk defended his weekend attempt to require government workers to justify their prior week\u2019s work under penalty of termination \u2014 a move that drew pushback from many in the room on national security and privacy grounds \u2014 as merely a \u201cpulse check\u201d to ensure that those working for the government have \u201ca pulse and two neurons,\" adding that \u201cthis is not a high bar\u201d for workers to meet.",
      "Speculating that some workers are either dead or fictional, Musk added that the goal was to see that workers are real, alive and can \"write an email.\"",
      "Asked if members of the Cabinet were happy with Musk, the DOGE guru started to answer the question. But Trump interjected and said he might want to let Cabinet members answer. Then Trump joked that if anyone disagreed, he might \u201cthrow them out.\u201d",
      "That drew applause from Cabinet members.",

      "\u201cAnd I don\u2019t give false praise,\u201d he added.",

      "After about 15 minutes of focus on Musk and DOGE, Trump shifted the spotlight of the Cabinet meeting back to his own accomplishments in his first weeks in office.",
      "The Cabinet sat mostly silently for more than an hour, as Trump opened the floor to questions from an invited group of reporters.",
      "Asked if he expected his Cabinet to follow his directives without exception, Trump initially scoffed at the question before answering, \u201cof course, no exceptions.\u201d",

      "The Georgia State Election Board has voted to dismiss a lawsuit seeking to enforce a subpoena against a conservative group that had alleged ballot stuffing in the state after the group was unable to produce evidence to support its claims",
      "ATLANTA -- The Georgia State Election Board on Wednesday voted to dismiss a lawsuit seeking to enforce a subpoena against a conservative group that was unable to produce evidence to support its claims of ballot stuffing in the state.",
      "Texas-based True the Vote in 2021 filed complaints with Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, including one in which it said it had obtained \u201ca detailed account of coordinated efforts to collect and deposit ballots in drop boxes across metro Atlanta\u201d during the November 2020 election and a crucial runoff election for two U.S. Senate seats in January 2021.",
      "Investigators with the secretary's office looked into the group's complaints and in April 2022 subpoenaed True the Vote for evidence supporting its allegations. A lawyer for the group wrote to a state attorney in May 2023 that a complete response would require it to identify people to whom it had pledged confidentiality and said it was withdrawing its complaints.",
      "Then-State Election Board chair William Duffey responded that the group had made \u201cserious allegations\u201d and that he wouldn't allow the complaints to be withdrawn. He asked the state attorney general's office to enforce the subpoenas, and the board filed a lawsuit.",
      "A Fulton County judge in November 2023 ordered True the Vote to provide evidence it had collected, including the names of people it said had provided information. The organization said in a subsequent court filing it had no names, contact information or other documentary evidence to provide. The case was administratively closed in January 2024.",
      "Election Board member Janice Johnston on Wednesday proposed dismissing the lawsuit, withdrawing the subpoena and dismissing the group's complaint. She said it is apparent that an alleged whistleblower whom True the Vote said it was relying on for evidence \u201cwill not be identified or cannot be identified\u201d and that the investigation was unlikely to be successful as a result.",
      "After a brief discussion, the board voted to approve Johnston's proposal.",
      "Catherine Engelbrecht, president of True the Vote, said in an emailed statement that the organization welcomes the dismissal of the case, which she described as \u201ca legal dispute that never should have begun.\u201d She said the organization \u201cremains committed to our mission.\u201d",
      "True the Vote's allegations that people engaged in ballot stuffing in Georgia were relied upon heavily for \u201c2000 Mules,\u201d a widely debunked film by conservative pundit and filmmaker Dinesh D\u2019Souza to cast doubt on the results of the 2020 presidential election. A State Election Board investigation found that surveillance camera footage used in the film showed people submitting ballots for themselves and family members who lived with them, which is allowed under Georgia law.",
      "D'Souza in December issued a statement saying \u201cinaccurate information\u201d was provided to him about ballot box surveillance video and apologizing to a Georgia man who was falsely accused of ballot stuffing in the film. Previously, in May, Salem Media Group, the publisher of \u201c2000 Mules,\u201d also publicly apologized to the same man."

      "The judge's order had been widely condemned by free speech advocates as a clear violation of the paper's First Amendment rights.",

      "The board of commissioners dropped the suit Monday at the request of Mayor Chuck Espy, who cited an offer from the paper's owner to run a clarification. However, Emmerich Newspapers president Wyatt Emmerich said he made that offer before the city filed its lawsuit and that it was no longer on the table.",
      "Emmerich had offered to clarify that the council said the lack of notification wasn\u2019t a deliberate attempt to hide the meeting, according to a text message Emmerich sent to the city attorney. The text also offered to clarify that a sentence questioning whether there was \u201ckick-back from the community\u201d should have said \u201cpush back.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s effort to suspend the system for resettling refugees in the U.S. is on hold after a federal judge in Seattle blocked it",
      "SEATTLE -- President Donald Trump's effort to suspend the system for resettling refugees in the U.S. is on hold after a federal judge in Seattle blocked it. U.S. District Judge Jamal Whitehead, a 2023 appointee of former President Joe Biden, found that while the president has broad authority over who comes into the country, he cannot nullify the law passed by Congress establishing the program.",
      "The Justice Department indicated it would consider a quick appeal, saying Trump's actions have been well within his authority.",
      "Here's what to know about the case.",
      "Trump halted the nation's refugee resettlement program as part of a series of executive orders cracking down on immigration, saying cities had been taxed by \u201crecord levels of migration\u201d and couldn't \u201cabsorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees.\u201d He barred refugees from coming to the U.S., and the administration began cutting off funding for agencies that support refugees.",
      "The refugee program, created by Congress in 1980, is a form of legal migration to the U.S. for people displaced by war, natural disaster or persecution \u2014 a process that often takes years and involves significant vetting. It is different from asylum, by which people newly arrived in the U.S. can seek permission to remain because they fear persecution in their home country.",
      "Despite long-standing support from both parties for accepting refugees, the program has become politicized in recent years. Trump also temporarily halted it during his first term, and then dramatically decreased the number of refugees who could enter the U.S. each year.",
      "There are 600,000 people being processed to come to the U.S. as refugees around the world, according to the administration.",
      "The lawsuit filed in Seattle was brought by individual refugees whose efforts to resettle in the U.S. have been halted as well as major refugee aid groups.",
      "Those organizations include International Refugee Assistance Project on behalf of Church World Service, the Jewish refugee resettlement agency HIAS and Lutheran Community Services Northwest. They say they have had to lay off staff because the administration froze funding for processing refugee applications overseas as well as support, such as short-term rental assistance for those already in the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe resettled people days before the inauguration that were just cut off from benefits,\u201d said Lutheran Community Services Northwest CEO David Duea said after Tuesday's hearing. \u201cThat means rent, helping kids get into school, and case management. It was an inhumane act.\"",
      "Justice Department lawyer August Flentje disputed the notion that the plaintiffs had suffered the sort of \u201cirreparable\u201d harms that would warrant granting a broad order blocking the administration\u2019s actions. Most people whose travel to the U.S. was canceled at the last minute had already been moved to a third country where they were out of danger, he said, and the cancellation of funding for refugee aid groups amounted to a contract dispute.",
      "The judge disagreed.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve read the declarations,\u201d Whitehead said. \u201cI have refugees stranded in dangerous places. I have families who have sold everything they\u2019ve owned in advance of travel, which was canceled. I have spouses and children separated indefinitely from their family members in the U.S., resettlement agencies that have already laid off hundreds of staff.\"",
      "Last week, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., refused to immediately block the Trump administration\u2019s actions in a similar lawsuit brought by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. That case faces another hearing Friday.",
      "During Tuesday's arguments, Flentje cited a law that allows the president to deny entry to foreigners whose admission to the U.S. \u201cwould be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\u201d",
      "But Whitehead determined the president\u2019s actions amounted to an \u201ceffective nullification of congressional will\u201d in setting up the nation\u2019s refugee admissions program. He promised to offer a fuller rationale in a written opinion in the next few days.",
      "\u201cThe president has substantial discretion ... to suspend refugee admissions,\u201d Whitehead told the parties. \u201cBut that authority is not limitless.\u201d",
      "Flentje indicated the government might file an \u201cemergency appeal\" to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, a motion that would be considered on an expedited basis. He also asked the Whitehead to pause his ruling pending an appeal, but Whitehead called that request premature since he had not yet issued his written decision.",
      "Attorneys for the plaintiffs said they expected Whitehead's ruling to clear the way for money to begin flowing again to the organizations and for plaintiffs stranded overseas to be able to book new trips to the U.S., though it remained unclear whether any appeal might complicate that.",
      "Outside the courthouse Tuesday, the organizations and their supporters celebrated the ruling, describing refugees as a blessing to the country.",
      "Tshishiku Henry, an activist who works on behalf of refugees in Washington state, called his presence \u201cthe miracle of the second chance.\u201d He and his wife resettled in the U.S. in 2018 after fleeing war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, he said.",
      "\u201cIt was a lifeline,\u201d Henry said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t offer us just safety, but you gave us back our future.\u201d"

      "New York City Mayor Eric Adams is asking a federal judge to toss out the corruption case against him, alleging prosecutorial misconduct, even as the Justice Department seeks dismissal of the charges on the Democrat's behalf",
      "NEW YORK -- New York City Mayor Eric Adams asked a federal judge to toss out the corruption case against him Wednesday, alleging prosecutorial misconduct, even as the Justice Department seeks dismissal of the charges on the Democrat's behalf.",
      "In papers filed in Manhattan federal court, his lawyers alleged that the misconduct occurred when the government publicly leaked a letter then-U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon wrote to Attorney General Pam Bondi explaining why charges should not be dropped.",
      "She wrote the letter, offering to resign as she refused to follow acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove\u2019s directive to drop the charges against the embattled mayor two weeks ago. Bove accepted the resignation.",
      "Bove had written a letter to Sassoon, saying the mayor was needed to assist President Donald Trump's law-and-order priorities, particularly the fight against illegal immigration and violent crime. He also said the charges were interfering with this year's New York City mayoral race.",
      "In their court papers Wednesday, Adams' lawyers wrote that the public release of Sassoon's \u201cunhinged resignation letter\u201d to Bondi was \u201cpart of an extraordinary flurry of leaked internal Justice Department correspondence\u201d that occurred after Bove issued his directive to Sassoon in writing.",
      "The lawyers said Sassoon notified Bondi that prosecutors were planning to add an obstruction charge against Adams in a superseding indictment and made the \u201cwildly inflammatory and false accusation\u201d that Adams and his lawyers had offered to help the Trump administration in return for the dismissal of charges.",
      "Adams was indicted in September on charges alleging he accepted over $100,000 in illegal campaign contributions and travel perks from a Turkish official and others seeking to buy influence while he was Brooklyn borough president. He faces multiple challengers in June\u2019s Democratic primary. He has pleaded not guilty and insisted he is innocent.",
      "The lawyers said the public exposure of the unusual Justice Department internal fight had violated Adams\u2019s constitutional rights and interfered with his ability to receive a fair trial.",
      "They said the leaks also violated statutory and court rules, including the Justice Department\u2019s longstanding policies designed to prevent prosecutorial misconduct.",
      "A request for comment was made to the Justice Department in Washington. Bove and two Justice Department lawyers are currently trying to get a Manhattan judge to dismiss the charges.",
      "The judge, who has canceled an April trial, has appointed outside counsel to advise him as he decides what to do over the next few weeks.",
      "Bove's request to dismiss charges had included the possibility that charges could be reinstated after the mayoral election, but lawyers for Adams said that possibility should be eliminated.",
      "\u201cMayor Adams was prosecuted in the media long before there was ever an indictment. The Court should take a moment to consider this inescapable reality. This case, which was once just a farce, has now become a cancer, and its pendency continues to cause real and irrevocable harm each and every day,\u201d they said."

      "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres is proposing opening a U.N. office that would provide drones, fuel, ground and air transportation and other non-lethal support to a Kenyan-led mission in Haiti struggling to fight gangs, according to a letter obtained Wednesday by The Associated Press.",
      "The letter was sent to the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday night and provides the first details for a proposal that Guterres announced last week at a summit with Caribbean leaders. At the time, Guterres said he would request that the U.N. assume funding for the mission\u2019s structural and logistical expenses but did not provide further information.",
      "In the letter, Guterres assessed the situation in Haiti and warned it was running out of time.",
      "\u201cWe must act quickly,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI am convinced that the phased approach of the United Nations' support\u2026 can reverse the shocking and rising trend in gang violence.\u201d",
      "Guterres said his proposal is a \u201crealistic option,\u201d adding that \u201cat this stage, transitioning to a U.N. peacekeeping operation is not\u2026a feasible option.\u201d",
      "The proposal comes as gangs that already control 85% of Haiti\u2019s capital seized new neighborhoods in Port-au-Prince in recent weeks. The attacks have left more than 6,000 people homeless in the past month, according to the U.N.",
      "\u201cEntire families were killed in their homes, while others, including children and babies, were shot dead as they tried to escape,\u201d the U.N. said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "Guterres said in the letter that the U.N. office he proposes could help strengthen Haiti\u2019s National Police and help gather, store and share sensitive information related to operations, as well as provide a joint operations center, GIS support and surveillance via drones.",
      "In turn, Guterres said BINUH, the latest U.N. political mission in Haiti, could focus on priorities including designing programs to help children and women forced to join gangs defect from them, as well as support authorities in the arrests and prosecutions of \u201chigh-risk individuals.\u201d",
      "The Security Council previously extended the U.N.-backed mission in Haiti led by Kenyan police to October of this year even as the U.S. and other countries warn it is lacking personnel and funding.",
      "Guterres noted in his letter that while the mission has reached 1,000 personnel, the vast majority of them Kenyan police, it still only represents 40% of the 2,500 personnel envisioned.",
      "In addition, a U.N. trust fund that is helping fund the mission has only $110.8 million.",
      "\u201cMuch more is needed,\u201d Guterres wrote.",
      "He also noted that \u201cmany\u201d of the mission\u2019s armored vehicles are ill-equipped for the urban environment in Port-au-Prince and that a lack of spare parts has rendered half of all its combat vehicles inoperable.",
      "Last year, more than 5,600 people were reported killed across Haiti, 1,000 more deaths than reported the previous year. Gang violence also has left more than one million people homeless in recent years, according to the U.N.",

      "Now that House Republicans have passed an ambitious budget blueprint for President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda, its time for hard work",
      "WASHINGTON -- Now that House Republicans have passed an ambitious budget blueprint for President Donald Trump's agenda, its time for the hard work of turning ideas for $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and $2 trillion of slashed spending into a bill that lawmakers warn could bring intense changes to Americans back home.",
      "Republicans are insisting the costs of the tax breaks be partly paid for by the steep reductions in federal government spending as a way to ensure the nation's $36 trillion debt load doesn't not balloon to dangerous levels.",
      "But deciding what to cut \u2014 health care, food stamps, green energy, government regulations or student aid \u2014 is a politically agonizing choice.",
      "And it's not just the House that has to agree. GOP senators have their own plans. Their priority is to make the tax cuts permanent, rather than temporary, which would skyrocket the costs. Eventually the House and Senate must vote on a final package.",
      "\u201cWe have a lot of hard work ahead of us,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson said after the late Tuesday vote.",
      "It's the start of a weeks \u2014 if not months \u2014 long slog that is expected to consume the Congress as Republicans try to deliver on Trump's agenda and their own campaign promises.",
      "Republicans say if they fail to act, the lower tax rates first approved in 2017 will expire, which would amount to a massive tax hike for many Americans. They believe the tax cuts will partly pay for themselves, unleashing economic growth and fresh revenues, though others say those projections are optimistic.",
      "Democrats put up stiff opposition against the House GOP plan \u2014 one lawmaker dashed from California after a week\u2019s stay in the hospital and another returned to Washington for the vote with her newborn son. Democrats will spend the weeks ahead warning Americans what's at stake.",
      "\u201cRepublicans and Trump promised to lower costs on day one, and instead their priorities have been focused on ripping health care away from kids, moms and others who need it most,\u201d said Brittany Pettersen, D-Colo., cradling her 4-week old son, Sam.",
      "\u201cAll to fund tax breaks for billionaires like Elon Musk while increasing our national deficit by trillions of dollars,\" she said. \"How can anyone show their face in their district after voting yes for this?\u201d",
      "Trump, during a free-wheeling Cabinet meeting Wednesday at the White House, insisted he will not touch the nation's premier safety net programs \u2014 Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security \u2014 but seek ways to root out what Republicans call waste, fraud and abuse.",
      "\u201cIt won\u2019t be \u2018read my lips\u2019 anymore,\u201d Trump said, echoing President George H.W. Bush's no new taxes pledge. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to touch it.\u201d",
      "But the math doesn't fully add up.",
      "Without steep cuts to federal programs, Republicans won't be able to claim the savings they need to offset the costs of the tax breaks. And without offsetting the costs, conservative GOP lawmakers won't want to vote for the final package.",
      "GOP senators on Wednesday met behind closed doors with White House chief of staff Susie Wiles on next steps.",
      "Initially approved during Trump's first term, many of the tax cuts were temporary and are expiring later this year. Keeping them would cost $4.5 trillion over the next decade \u2014or more if they are made permanent as Senate Republicans want.",
      "And that's not counting the new tax cuts that Trump is asking for. The president wants to eliminate taxes on tips, which was a signature campaign promise, and has also talked about getting rid of taxes on overtime pay as well as Social Security benefits. Those would add to the price tag.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune said it\u2019s \u201cto be determined\u201d when the Senate would act on the House budget resolution.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\" Thune said. \"It\u2019s hard. Nothing about this is going to be easy.\u201d",
      "With reductions to the Pentagon off the table, Republicans are hunting for cost cutting across the non-defense side of the budget. The next biggest pot of money available is the nation's health care programs.",
      "The House GOP's bill directed the committee that handles Medicaid health care spending to come up with $880 billion in savings over the decade, which would be the bulk of what's needed to offset the cost of the tax breaks.",
      "Republicans insist there will be no direct cuts to people who receive their health care through Medicaid, some 80 million adults and children, and that they only will target waste, fraud and abuse to make it more efficient.",
      "Mostly, Republicans talk about imposing work requirements or removing able-bodied men from the government-run Medicaid program. Doing that would save a small portion of what's needed, some $100 billion over the decade.",
      "For a bigger savings, Republicans consider altering the way the federal government provides Medicaid money to the states. Some 40 states expanded their Medicaid programs with the Affordable Care Act, when Obamacare provided money to enroll people in the program.",
      "The Republicans have also directed the House Agriculture Committee to come up with some $230 billion in savings. One likely place it will turn is the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. GOP chair Rep. Glenn Thompson of Pennsylvania said food stamps won't be cut.",
      "Democrats are having none of this, and advocacy groups have started showing up at town hall meetings to protest what's happening.",
      "\u201cThe enormity of program cuts called for by the House budget stand as a singular threat to the well-being of people in every state, city, and rural community,\u201d Sharon Parrott, president of the center-left Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, said in a statement after the vote.",
      "As Senate Republicans push to make the tax cuts permanent, chair of the Senate Finance Committee Mike Crapo has leaned into the idea of using a different accounting process.",
      "It involves essentially treating the tax cuts as what's called \u201cexisting policy,\u201d which would mean they are not a new cost, and therefore would not need to be offset by cuts elsewhere.",
      "But Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, top Democrat on the Finance committee, said Republicans are engaging in \u201cfunny math.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s all a big game in order to get more money to the billionaires through their tax breaks,\u201d Wyden said.",
      "Thune, Johnson, Crapo, and Rep. Jason Smith, R-Mo., chair of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, are scheduled to headed to the White House on Wednesday for discussions with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.",
      "At the same time, key GOP senators are still pushing their smaller $340 billion package to provide the Trump administration with money it needs for border security and its mass deportation agenda. Their idea was to include the tax cuts in a second package later in the year."

      "The billionaire owner of The Washington Post, Jeff Bezos, narrowed the topics covered by its opinion section Wednesday to defending personal liberties and the free market, a pivot away from the traditional broad focus and prompting the news outlet\u2019s opinion editor to resign.",
      "Bezos, who also is the founder and largest individual shareholder of Amazon, said on X that \u201cviewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others.\u201d",
      "The move was received by some as an indication that Bezos is making decisions for the Post with an eye toward avoiding retaliation by President Donald Trump. Bezos, though, cast the change as a modernization from the days when newspapers offered opinions on a broad range of topics. Now, he said, \u201cthe internet does that job.\u201d",

      "A federal appeals court is considering whether to dismiss a massive effort to force a vote on an Atlanta-area police and firefighter training center that city officials say is nearly complete",
      "ATLANTA -- A federal appeals court is considering whether to dismiss a massive citywide effort to force a vote on an Atlanta-area police and firefighter training center that city attorneys say is now \u201csubstantially complete.\u201d",
      "The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had been silent for more than 14 months after hearing arguments in December 2023 over whether to overturn a lower court ruling that let nonresidents collect signatures as part of the \u201cStop Cop City\u201d referendum effort. The facility is on land the city of Atlanta leased to the Atlanta Police Foundation. Opponents, who collected more than 108,000 signatures in 2023, say voters should be able to revoke that lease.",
      "In the meantime, construction on the 85-acre (34-hectare), $115 million project continued apace last year. A spokesperson for Mayor Andre Dickens told The Associated Press on Wednesday that training has begun at the facility and classrooms are expected to be fully utilized by late March.",
      "The debate over the training center embroiled the city and captured national attention, especially after state troopers fatally shot an activist protesting near the project in January 2023. Opponents say the facility will worsen police militarization and harm the environment in a flood-prone, majority-Black neighborhood. They say the city\u2019s fight against the referendum is anti-democratic and dovetails with their concerns about a violent police response to protests and a prosecution on racketeering charges of dozens of opponents.",
      "In response to a recent appeals court request over whether the issue is now moot, city attorneys on Tuesday urged the court to toss the issue.",
      "The city's attorneys wrote that police officers, firefighters and first responders have begun training at the \u201cstate-of-the-art facility\u201d and \u201cany referendum on the ground lease ordinance will not remove the Center from the site or prevent its use by the City for these purposes.\u201d",
      "Even if a referendum took place, \u201cany outcome of such a referendum would be merely academic at this point \u2014 the Center has been built and will not be torn down,\u201d they added.",
      "But attorneys for four people who live outside the city and sued for the right to collect signatures say that just because the training center has been built does not negate the primary issue \u2014 whether voters can revoke the city's 50-year lease to the Atlanta Police Foundation, the nonprofit that runs the facility.",
      "\u201cThe lease does not terminate upon completion of construction of the training center,\u201d the attorneys wrote. \u201cThat alone should end the mootness inquiry.\u201d",
      "The attorneys for the facility opponents also argued that the case has an underlying First Amendment issue that must be resolved: Can nonresidents collect signatures for a referendum effort they are not eligible to vote on?",
      "Keyanna Jones, one of the plaintiffs, said she formerly lived near the training center site, which is just outside Atlanta city limits in unincorporated DeKalb County. She said collecting petitions was one of the few ways neighbors outside the city could fight the project.",
      "The debate over nonresidents' rights to collect signatures has meant the city has not begun the costly, laborious work of analyzing the approximately 108,500 signatures that activists turned in to City Hall in September 2023. If the court tosses the case, they likely never will.",
      "Even if the appeals court does not dismiss the case because of the training center's completion, the judges could still kill the petition drive by ruling it illegal under state law, or rule all of the signatures are void because none were submitted by the original 60-day deadline of Aug. 21, 2023.",
      "A ruling just narrowing which petitions are accepted could also doom the chances that opponents will have enough signatures from eligible registered Atlanta voters to force a referendum, an analysis by The Associated Press, Georgia Public Broadcasting, WABE and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution found. Statistical sampling of 1,000 entries found it\u2019s possible opponents gathered the required 58,231 signatures if all entries are counted. But excluding signatures collected after Aug. 21, 2023, or by people who weren\u2019t Atlanta voters would disqualify 20% of potentially eligible sampled entries \u2014 likely defeating the effort.",

      "A preliminary economic agreement between Ukraine and the United States would ensure long-term U.S. involvement in rebuilding the country, but the deal leaves the question of security guarantees sought by Kyiv to future negotiations",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- A preliminary economic agreement between Ukraine and the United States would ensure long-term U.S. involvement in rebuilding the country, but the deal leaves the question of security guarantees sought by Kyiv to future negotiations.",
      "According to the final version of the deal obtained by The Associated Press, the United States and Ukraine will establish a co-owned and jointly managed investment fund aimed at financing the reconstruction of Ukraine and its war-damaged economy.",
      "The agreement comes after two weeks of back-and-forth between Kyiv and Washington over how the U.S. could gain access to Ukraine's natural resources. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has insisted that specific assurances for Ukrainian security must accompany a deal on those resources.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump planned to meet with Zelenskyy on Friday at the White House to sign the pact, which will closely tie the two countries together for years to come.",
      "Here's more about what the agreement says, and what it doesn't say.",
      "While the preliminary agreement references the importance of Ukraine's security, it leaves that matter to a separate agreement to be discussed between the leaders of the two countries.",
      "According to wording in the deal, the United States \u201csupports Ukraine\u2019s efforts to obtain security guarantees needed to establish lasting peace,\" and the U.S. has \u201ca long-term financial commitment to the development of a stable and economically prosperous Ukraine.\u201d",
      "\u201cParticipants will seek to identify any necessary steps to protect mutual investments as defined in the Fund agreement,\u201d it states. \"The American people desire to invest alongside Ukraine in a free, sovereign and secure Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Speaking at a news conference Wednesday in Kyiv, Zelenskyy said his country \u201cneeds to know first where the United States stands on its continued military support.\u201d He said he expects to have a wide-ranging conversation with Trump during his visit to Washington.",
      "The economic agreement \"may be part of future security guarantees, but I want to understand the broader vision. What awaits Ukraine?\u201d Zelenskyy said.",
      "A senior Ukrainian official familiar with the matter told the AP on Wednesday that those discussions would take place independently from the establishment of the joint fund.",
      "The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive negotiations, said Kyiv believes the establishment of the fund would itself serve to bolster Ukraine\u2019s security since U.S. and Ukrainian investments would need to be protected amid continuing Russian attacks.",
      "Under the agreement, Ukraine will contribute 50% of future revenues to the joint fund from national assets including minerals, hydrocarbons, oil, natural gas and other extractable materials. Kyiv has hoped that access to those materials would incentivize the Trump administration to help secure a fair and lasting end to the war.",
      "The idea to involve the U.S. in Ukraine\u2019s natural resource wealth was initially proposed last fall by Zelenskyy as part of his plan to strengthen Kyiv\u2019s hand in future negotiations with Moscow.",
      "Ukraine would also contribute half of its revenues from infrastructure relevant to the extraction, processing or transportation of its natural resources, but those contributions would not apply to assets that are already part of the Ukrainian government\u2019s budget revenue, such as state-owned oil and gas companies.",
      "Contributions to the fund will be reinvested annually in Ukraine to promote its \u201csafety, security and prosperity,\u201d the agreement says.",
      "The agreement states that revenues from its natural resources will go into the fund and be used for reconstruction of the country, not that ownership or control of those resources would be transferred to the United States.",
      "On Wednesday, a senior Ukrainian official told the AP that the U.S. will not own Ukraine's mineral and other resources. The official added that the fund would receive 50% of the revenues that come from natural resource deposits once they\u2019re developed.",
      "The deal does away with earlier Trump demands that Ukraine pay $500 billion as compensation for Washington\u2019s assistance until now. The senior Ukrainian official said that contributions to the fund do not constitute a repayment of any debt to the U.S. for its previous support during the war with Russia, but an investment in the future.",
      "The agreement states that the U.S. will maintain a long-term financial commitment to Ukraine\u2019s stability and economic prosperity, and could make further contributions outside the fund in the form of financial instruments and other assets critical for Ukraine\u2019s reconstruction.",
      "Ukrainian payments into the fund could provide a mechanism for any future U.S. assistance to be recouped in the long term, the Ukrainian official said.",
      "\u201cWe are not debtors,\u201d Zelenskyy said Wednesday, adding that, while he is grateful for previous U.S. support, Ukraine had not entered into any agreements that would require previous U.S. assistance to be repaid.",
      "\u201cThere were no such agreements in the past, so there is nothing to discuss in this regard,\u201d he said.",
      "The agreement will also seek to avoid conflict with any obligations Ukraine has to the European Union as it seeks membership in the bloc, or any potential conflicts with obligations to other financial institutions or creditors.",

      "MEXICO CITY -- The Nicaraguan government has dismantled the last remaining checks and balances and was \u201csystematically executing a strategy to cement total control of the country through severe human rights violations,\" a panel of United Nations experts warned Wednesday.",
      "The report by human rights experts is the latest and strongest rebuke of the government of President Daniel Ortega and first lady and now co-president Rosario Murillo, which has for years cracked down on dissent and civil society.",
      "The crackdown started with violent government repression of 2018 protests. Since then, the Nicaraguan government \u201chas deliberately transformed the country into an authoritarian state,\" the experts said. The crackdown has forced tens of thousands of people to flee the country in exile.",
      "\u201cThe state and the ruling Sandinista party have virtually fused into a unified machine of repression with domestic and transnational impact,\u201d said Jan Simon, chair of the U.N. Group of Experts, in a statement. \u201cOrtega and Murillo operate a wide intelligence machine, surveilling the population and selecting the targets for the violation of rights, acting as \u2018the eyes and ears\u2019 that allow (the Nicaraguan government) to obtain and maintain total control over people.\u201d",
      "The Nicaraguan government did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "The experts said that the final democratic blow was dealt last month with a constitutional reform passed by the Nicaraguan congress, which is firmly controlled by Ortega and Murillo's Sandinista party.",
      "The reform, which entered into force on Feb. 18, effectively put all branches of government under the power of the presidency, and also officially made Ortega and Murillo \u201cco-presidents,\u201d which would guarantee presidential succession for Murillo and their family.",
      "The reform also expanded the presidential term to six years from five in a move that further consolidated the family\u2019s firm grip on power.",
      "The report by UN experts said that in addition to government control, Ortega and Murillo have expanded their use of arbitrary detention, forced expulsions, confiscation of private property and stripping their opposition of Nicaraguan citizenship.",
      "The experts said they compiled a list of people they believed were responsible for the repression, which will be shared with the Nicaraguan government and made public through the UN Human Rights Council. They also urged the international community to take legal action and expand targeted sanctions against those individuals, and provide greater protections for Nicaraguan exiles."

      "UNITED NATIONS -- Latvia's foreign minister warns that Russian President Vladimir Putin will try to achieve in peace talks what he hasn\u2019t been able to accomplish in his war against Ukraine \u2014 weaken the United States and restore control over his smaller neighbor.",
      "Baiba Bra\u017ee spoke to The Associated Press on Tuesday during a week of intense diplomacy between Europe and the United States following President Donald Trump\u2019s upending of U.S. policy with his decision to hold direct talks with Russia, while excluding Ukraine and its European allies from the initial discussions.",
      "Bra\u017ee notes that Russia, with a population of 140 million, has managed to gain control of less than 20% of Ukraine, population 40 million, since it seized Crimea in 2014 and launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022. Putin has failed to weaken the U.S. and the NATO military alliance it leads, or to oust the democratic government in Kyiv.",
      "So, when it comes to seeking peace, \u201cI think the difficulty is with the Russians, because Russians are the ones who want to weaken U.S. power, and who want to weaken the U.S. in the world overall,\u201d Bra\u017ee said.",
      "What the world is seeing, she said, is that when Putin interferes in other countries he wants to control both territory and the political choices of their governments. In Syria, for example, he supported the authoritarian regime of Bashar Assad and got military bases on the Mediterranean.",
      "But Putin hasn't gotten what he wanted during the three-year war in Ukraine and \u201che will try to get it through the peace talks,\u201d Bra\u017ee said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s important to clearly remember that perspective in whatever deal we negotiate or strike.\u201d",
      "She said although only U.S. and Russian officials took part in last week's talks in Saudi Arabia, \u201cEurope is included\u201d in the peace discussions because of constant communications with both the Ukrainians and the Americans. She has been in Washington three times since mid-December and said she was heading there later Tuesday for talks with lawmakers and administration officials.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron met with Trump at the White House on Monday, and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer was due to meet with him on Thursday.",
      "Bra\u017ee stressed that Europe\u2019s task now is to strengthen the transatlantic alliance and build up its own militaries and defense industries.",
      "Last week, Latvia announced it will increase defense spending to 4% of GDP next year and continue to move toward 5%. NATO members have agreed to spend at least 2% of their GDP on defense.",
      "\u201cWe are investing in our own capability,\u201d she said. \u201cWe wish all Europeans would do that. That\u2019s one of the issues we are discussing.\u201d",
      "As NATO members, Bra\u017ee said, Latvia and the neighboring Baltic states of Estonia and Lithuania need to make sure they are prepared for any future aggression from Russia. She said their focus is on deterrence \u2014 early warning, rapid response, military capability and political will.",
      "The three Baltic states were occupied by Nazi Germany during World War II and fell under Soviet control after the war. Like Ukraine, they became independent countries with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.",
      "Bra\u017ee stressed Monday to the U.N. Security Council that \u201conly Ukraine\u2019s victory can ensure lasting security and put an end to Russia\u2019s imperialist aggression.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe strongly believe that a rushed ceasefire will not lead to sustainable peace; instead, it will only embolden Russia, encouraging further expansion and putting global security at grave risk,\u201d she said.",
      "Macron said he had spoken to 30 European and allied leaders, with some saying they are willing to be part of security guarantees for Ukraine in a peace deal.",
      "Bra\u017ee said that while there have been preliminary discussions, there is no peace process yet.",
      "When there is, she said, \u201cWe will be guided very much by the needs of Ukraine.\"",
      "\u201cFor any security force, we need military guidance,\u201d Latvia's top diplomat said. \u201cWe need military advice. What type of force is there? Where? Are the troops withdrawn on the Russian side from the contact line? How far? What is the location of any security force?\"",
      "But Bra\u017ee said the most important thing is peace must be long-lasting, not just a ceasefire where war can restart again. \u201cNobody wants that,\u201d she said."

      "The museum said in a statement Tuesday that the dismissal ends all litigation between it and the estate of its former director, Aaron De Groft, who died Jan. 18. The museum had accused De Groft of not fulfilling his fiduciary duty to the museum by championing the exhibit, while he claimed that his firing was unjust.",

      "There were persistent questions about the authenticity of the works, culminating in the FBI's 2022 raid of the museum. In 2023, former Los Angeles auctioneer Michael Barzman agreed to plead guilty to federal charges of making false statements to the FBI, admitting that he and an accomplice had created the fake artwork and falsely attributed the paintings to Basquiat."

      "Baltimore prosecutors have announced their decision to withdraw a motion to vacate Adnan Syed's murder conviction even as they support his recent request for a sentence reduction",
      "BALTIMORE -- Despite documented problems with the evidence against him and an earlier request from prosecutors to clear his record, Adnan Syed will remain convicted of murder, according to court papers filed Tuesday night.",
      "The decision from Baltimore prosecutors comes ahead of a scheduled hearing Wednesday morning where a judge will consider whether to reduce Syed\u2019s sentence, but this means the conviction itself is no longer in question.",
      "It\u2019s the latest wrinkle in an ongoing legal odyssey that garnered a massive following after being featured in the \u201cSerial\u201d podcast over a decade ago.",
      "Syed\u2019s attorneys recently filed the request for a sentence reduction under Maryland\u2019s Juvenile Restoration Act, a relatively new state law that provides a potential pathway to release for people serving long prison terms for crimes committed when they were minors. That request is supported by prosecutors.",
      "Meanwhile, Baltimore State\u2019s Attorney Ivan Bates announced Tuesday that his office is withdrawing a previously filed motion to vacate Syed\u2019s conviction in the 1999 killing of his high school ex-girlfriend, Hae Min Lee, who was found strangled to death and buried in a makeshift grave.",
      "\u201cI did not make this decision lightly, but it is necessary to preserve the credibility of our office and maintain public trust in the justice system,\u201d Bates said in a statement.",
      "Syed\u2019s attorney Erica Suter issued a statement late Tuesday, criticizing the move and reasserting Syed\u2019s innocence.",
      "\u201cTonight, the state\u2019s attorney got it wrong,\u201d Suter said. \u201cHis decision to withdraw his office\u2019s motion to vacate Adnan\u2019s conviction ignores the injustices on which this conviction was founded. We will continue to fight to clear his name through all legal avenues available to him.\u201d",
      "The original motion to vacate \u2014 which was filed by Bates\u2019 predecessor Marilyn Mosby \u2014 won Syed his freedom in 2022. But his conviction was reinstated following a procedural challenge from Lee\u2019s family. The Maryland Supreme Court ordered a redo of the conviction vacatur hearing after finding that the family didn\u2019t receive adequate notice to attend in person.",
      "Since the prosecutor\u2019s office changed hands in the meantime, the decision of whether to withdraw the motion fell to Bates.",
      "Instead of asking a judge to again consider Syed\u2019s guilt or innocence, Bates chose a different path. He supported Syed\u2019s motion for a reduced sentence \u2014 without addressing the underlying conviction.",
      "Bates said that since his release in 2022, Syed has demonstrated he is a productive member of society whose continued freedom is \u201cin the interest of justice.\u201d He said the case \u201cis precisely what legislators envisioned when they crafted the Juvenile Restoration Act.\u201d",
      "The legislation was passed amid growing consensus that such defendants are especially open to rehabilitation, partly because brain science shows cognitive development continues well beyond the teenage years. Syed was 17 when Lee was killed.",
      "Now 43, he has been working at Georgetown University\u2019s Prisons and Justice Initiative and caring for aging relatives since his release, according to court filings. His father died in October after a long illness.",
      "Bates was facing a Friday deadline to decide on the motion to vacate.",
      "After reviewing the motion filed by his predecessor, Bates concluded that it contained \u201cfalse and misleading statements that undermine the integrity of the judicial process,\u201d he said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "Bates wrote in an executive summary released Tuesday that his decision \u201cdoes not preclude Mr. Syed from raising any new issues that he believes will support his innocence in the proper post-trial pleadings.\u201d",
      "\u201cHowever, properly shifting this burden back to Mr. Syed will re-instill the adversarial nature of proceedings that are the hallmark of the truth-seeking function of our criminal justice system,\u201d the summary says.",
      "Attorneys for the victim\u2019s family had argued that prosecutors should address the integrity of Syed\u2019s conviction before the court considered reducing his sentence. Prosecutors \u201cshould not be allowed to duck the issue by hiding behind\u201d his motion for a reduced sentence, attorneys wrote in a recent filing.",
      "Syed has maintained his innocence from the beginning, but many questions remain unanswered even after the \u201cSerial\u201d podcast combed through the evidence, reexamined legal arguments and interviewed witnesses. The series debuted in 2014 and drew millions of listeners who became armchair detectives.",
      "Rife with legal twists and turns, the case has recently pitted criminal justice reform efforts against the rights of crime victims and their families, whose voices are often at odds with a growing movement to acknowledge and correct systemic racism, police misconduct and prosecutorial missteps.",
      "When prosecutors sought to vacate Syed\u2019s conviction in 2022, they cited numerous problems with the case, including alternative suspects and unreliable evidence presented at trial. A judge agreed to vacate the conviction and free Syed. Prosecutors in Mosby\u2019s office later chose not to refile charges after they said DNA testing excluded Syed as a suspect.",
      "Even though the appellate courts reinstated his conviction, they allowed Syed to remain free while the case continued."

      "LOS ANGELES -- Attorneys for Lyle and Erik Menendez said Wednesday that California Gov. Gavin Newsom has ordered the state parole board to investigate whether the brothers would pose a risk to the public if they are released after nearly three decades in prison for the 1989 killing of their parents.",
      "The board will undertake a \u201ccomprehensive risk assessment\u201d into whether the brothers have been rehabilitated, according to Mark Geragos and Cliff Gardner. The defense attorneys said they were grateful for Newsom's decision.",
      "\u201cThe family realizes that the Governor\u2019s action does not mean he will commute the sentences. Instead, this initial step reflects the Governor\u2019s considered decision to at least obtain the information required to make a fair decision as to whether Erik and Lyle, after 35 years in prison, have done the hard work necessary to have a chance at a life outside prison,\u201d Geragos and Gardner said in a statement.",
      "No timeline was given for the board's investigation. A message seeking further details was sent Wednesday to the governor's office.",
      "The brothers are pursuing multiple avenues to win their freedom: Clemency from Newsom, a resentencing hearing, and a new trial. Los Angeles District Attorney Nathan Hochman said Friday that he opposes a new trial for the brothers, but he hasn\u2019t made up his mind on whether to support a resentencing bid that could lead to their freedom. Newsom has said he will not make a clemency decision until Hochman finishes reviewing the case.",
      "The brothers were found guilty in the murders of their entertainment executive father, Jose, and their mother, Kitty Menendez, and sentenced to life in prison without parole. They began their latest bid for freedom in recent years after their attorneys said new evidence of their father\u2019s sexual abuse emerged, and they have the support of most of their extended family.",
      "Hochman said he has filed an informal response urging the Los Angeles County Superior Court to reject a habeas petition filed by the brothers\u2019 attorneys in 2023 that seeks a reexamination of their case that centers in part the allegations that Jose Menendez sexually abused Erik Menendez.",
      "Hochman cast doubt on the evidence of abuse and said it was not pertinent to the case, disputing the claims that killings constituted self-defense. He also characterized the brothers\u2019 own testimony of sexual abuse as untrustworthy because they had told five different explanations for why they committed the murder.",
      "The Menendez family called Hochman\u2019s decision \u201cabhorrent\u201d and said he \u201cdiscredited the trauma\u201d experienced by the brothers.",
      "The family said in a statement last week that new evidence should not be needed, as the justice system failed the brothers back then and \u201ccontinues to fail them now.\u201d",
      "Lyle Menendez, who was then 21, and Erik Menendez, then 18, admitted they killed their parents with a shotgun, but they said they feared their parents were about to kill them to prevent disclosure of their father\u2019s long-term molestation of Erik.",
      "Prosecutors said at the time there was no evidence of molestation, and many details in the brothers\u2019 story of sexual abuse were not permitted in the trial that led to their conviction in 1996. Prosecutors accused the brothers of killing their parents for money.",
      "The proposed resentencing for the brothers is still set to be taken up at a March hearing and would make them immediately eligible for parole.",
      "Former Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n recommended last year the brothers be resentenced to 50 years to life. Gasc\u00f3n lost his bid for reelection in November to Hochman.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A planned meeting between European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas and Secretary of State Marco Rubio was abruptly canceled Wednesday due to \u201cscheduling issues,\u201d coming as political tensions have increased between Europe and the United States.",
      "Officials from both sides blamed scheduling challenges for preventing the pair, who last met at the Munich Security Conference in Germany last month, from meeting in Washington.",
      "However, European officials said they were caught off guard, and, notably, Kallas had previewed her planned talks with Rubio just two days earlier.",
      "In recent weeks, President Donald Trump has thrown the partnership between the U.S. and Europe into turmoil by pledging to charge higher taxes on imports from Europe that he says will match tariffs faced by American products. EU officials have traveled to Washington trying to head off a trade war.",
      "Top Trump administration officials also have warned Europe that it must start taking responsibility for its own security, including Ukraine, and sidelined the Europeans from their initial talks with Russia on ending the war. In a remarkable shift, the U.S. split with its European allies by refusing to blame Russia for its invasion of Ukraine at the United Nations this week and joined Moscow in voting against a Europe-backed Ukrainian resolution.",
      "In a bid to mend relations, French President Emmanuel Macron was in Washington on Monday for a White House meeting with Trump seeking support. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, whose country is no longer a member of the EU but often aligns itself with the continental bloc on foreign policy, is due to visit Thursday.",
      "Kallas herself had said Monday that she would be holding talks with Rubio \u201con the issues that are of interest to both of us,\u201d which for the EU are chiefly Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine and transatlantic relations.",
      "\u201cIt is clear that the statements coming from the United States make us all worried,\u201d she told reporters after chairing a meeting of EU foreign ministers.",

      "\u201cSo far, we do not have any indication that it would not. Of course it is going to change, that is very clear. But we should not throw something out the window that has worked well so far,\u201d she said.",
      "In a terse text message, her office referred all questions about why the meeting was canceled at short notice to the State Department.",
      "A senior U.S. official said the planned meeting, which had never appeared on Rubio\u2019s public schedule, had been pulled down due to \u201can unavoidable scheduling conflict.\u201d The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.",
      "Rubio attended Trump\u2019s Cabinet meeting at the White House, which began late Wednesday morning.",
      "The cancellation came less than a week after the State Department\u2019s policy planning office sent an internal memo instructing officials who deal with Europe to highlight two specific issues in interactions with European counterparts. The Feb. 21 memo, seen by The Associated Press, also mentioned tentative plans for an upcoming Rubio meeting with Kallas.",
      "The two issues of concern identified in the memo were \u201cFreedom of Speech and Free Opposition\u201d and \u201cMigration.\u201d",
      "On the former, the memo said Rubio and other U.S. diplomats should emphasize in their discussions with European officials the importance that the Trump administration attaches to free speech.",
      "It noted that Vice President JD Vance had said in a speech at the Munich Security Conference this month that the West should \u201cunite around free speech, halt censorship, reject suppressing opposition, jailing people for tweets and memes, etc.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe United States cannot continue supporting a continent that drifts in an authoritarian direction,\u201d the memo said. \u201cIt\u2019s bad for Europe and bad for us.\u201d",
      "On migration, the memo said U.S. officials, including Rubio, should refer to Europe\u2019s \u201cde facto open borders policy\u201d as a \u201cdisaster\u201d that must end. Trump has made cracking down on illegal immigration and carrying out mass deportations a signature priority.",
      "\u201cThe United States is changing course on migration policy under Trump,\u201d it said. \u201cIt\u2019s well past time for Europe to do the same. We want you to remain civilization partners and to do that, you must get this under control.\u201d",
      "It was not clear if the blunt language in the memo contributed to the cancellation of the Rubio-Kallas meeting.",
      "Although her meeting with Rubio was pulled down, Kallas was due to meet with U.S. senators and members of Congress to discuss the war in Ukraine and EU-U.S. ties during her two-day trip to Washington and to take part in a talk about those issues at the Hudson Institute research organization.",

      "A second runway at Gatwick Airport has been backed by government, providing measures to reduce noise are put in place.",
      "Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said she was \"minded to approve\" the expansion. Some MPs, local authorities and residents are strongly opposed.",
      "The airport wants to move its northern runway, which is currently only used for taxiing or as a back up, and make it operational by the end of the decade.",
      "The transport secretary's support does not guarantee the expansion will go ahead as it would still need planning permission.",
      "If permission is granted, work would start almost immediately, the BBC understands. The \u00a32.2bn expansion will be funded through private investment.",
      "\"I am issuing a minded to approve decision that provides some additional time to seek views from all parties on the provisions, prior to a final decision,\" Alexander said in a written ministerial statement on Tuesday.",
      "Gatwick has until 24 April to respond to demands for it to include measures, such as noise mitigation and having a proportion of passengers travelling to the airport via public transport, in its overall plans before a final decision will be made in October.",
      "Stewart Wingate, Gatwick Airport chief executive, said following the latest announcement that the government has \"outlined a clear pathway to full approval later in the year\" and that the airport would \"engage fully\" in the process.",
      "The Transport Secretary's support for expansion comes as the government is looking at ways to boost economic growth in a bid to boost living standards, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves backing a third runway at Heathrow last month.",
      "Gatwick, in West Sussex, is Europe's busiest single runway airport, with more than 40 million passengers using it last year.",
      "On Tuesday, Alexander told industry leaders aviation was good for economic growth and said she was \"not some sort of flight-shaming eco warrior\".",
      "The growth arguments for expanding Heathrow and Gatwick, the UK's two largest airports, differ with the former catering for more freight traffic relating to international goods trade.",
      "An extra runway at Gatwick would see capacity increased for holidaymakers and business travellers, particularly for short-haul destinations, as opposed to Heathrow's longer-haul flights.",
      "Gatwick managers have said that with 55 take-offs and landings in a busy hour, the airport is \"full\".",
      "Being able to use both runways could increase the number of departures by 50,000 a year by the end of the 2030s, the airport argued.",
      "It said some 30,000 of those flights are planned to depart from the north runway which will only be used for departures and not landings.",
      "But there is strong opposition to any expansion, particularly from climate campaigners.",
      "Greenpeace UK policy director Douglas Parr said the extension would not drive economic growth. \"The only thing it's set to boost is air pollution, noise, and climate emissions,\" he added.",
      "Alex Chapman, senior economist at left-of-centre think tank New Economics Foundation, also argued the move would not create new jobs, but would just shift them from other parts of the country.",
      "\"People are already perfectly able to catch cheap flights on holiday or travel for business,\" he added.",
      "Union Unite general secretary Sharon Graham backed Gatwick having a second runway, but warned it would need \"to come with guarantees of well paid, unionised jobs and proper facilities for workers\".",
      "Bronwen Jones, development director at Gatwick, said a second runway would be \"a win for everyone\".",

      "The group would take legal action through a judicial review if the expansion goes ahead, she added.",
      "Gatwick said it has committed to reducing noise levels to below those of 2019 - which CAGNE says was one of the worst years for noise.",
      "On Wednesday the government's independent advisers, the UK climate change committee (UKCCC), recommended that to meet the country's climate goals the amount of planet-warming gases released by the country's aviation sector needed to fall by 17% compared to 2003 levels.",

      "But experts think it could be challenging to obtain the feedstock, like corn grain or food waste, needed to make SAF.",
      "The UKCCC said the best way to reduce the industry's impact on climate change would be to significantly slow the demand for flying.",

      "China, Mexico and Canada are America's top three trade partners, together accounting for more than 40% of imports into the US last year.",
      "During the presidential campaign last year, Trump had threatened to hit imports from China with tariffs as high as 60%, and also floated an across-the-board tariff of at least 10%.",
      "Tariffs are a tax collected by the government and paid for by the business bringing the goods into the country.",

      "He will acknowledge the tensions between different regulators, the increasing demands place on the system by climate and population growth, and making the sector attractive to private investors.",
      "Sir Jon told the BBC the commission's report would be \"as radical as we need to be to reset the system\".",

      "US President Donald Trump has said he is planning to hit goods made in the European Union with tariffs of 25%, claiming the bloc was created to \"screw the United States\".",
      "\"We'll be announcing it very soon,\" he told reporters at an appearance with members of his cabinet. \"It'll be 25% generally speaking and that will be on cars and all other things.\"",
      "The European Union said it would react \"firmly and immediately against unjustified tariffs\".",
      "Trump's appearance sparked questions about his trade plans, as he also appeared to raise the possibility that looming tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, set to come into force on 4 March, might be postponed again.",
      "An administration official later said the deadline remained in place, with the president planning to review Mexico and Canada actions related to border security over the coming days.",
      "Trump made clear on Wednesday that trade with Europe also remained in his sights, repeating his criticism of European policies, which he said put American exporters of food products and cars at a disadvantage.",
      "\"The European Union was formed to screw the United States - that's the purpose of it and they've done a good job of it,\" he said.  \"But now I'm president.\"",

      "Trump has vowed to use the levies to boost US manufacturing, raise money and push other countries to change policies he opposes.",
      "But there are concerns such measures could fuel inflation, with warnings that Americans could face higher prices for goods as businesses may choose to pass on some or all of the cost of tariffs to customers.",
      "Since taking office, he has raised tariffs of 10% on goods from China and taken steps to hit other imports with duties, including directing his staff to develop recommendations for custom \"reciprocal\" tariffs for each country.",
      "But he has also suspended some of those plans, leaving many businesses and analysts guessing as to whether he is prepared to carry out his threats.",
      "\"The 25% threat that he threw out today is in line with the high end of the range that he previously indicated,\" said Tobin Marcus, head of US policy and politics at Wolfe Research.",

      "'Worried, not afraid'",
      "Antonin Finkelnburg, of the Federation of German Wholesale, Foreign Trade and Services which represents businesses, told the BBC that a 25% tariff on EU goods entering the US would created a \"difficult\" but \"not an impossible\" situation for Germany's economy.",

      "But his take home salary was much, much less.",
      "His income placed him in a tax bracket which meant up to 40% of this gross salary went to the state.",

      "But specialists say it likely won't be enough to keep the young from going abroad.",
      "\"It is unlikely that, on its own, the tax regime will make young workers remain in the country, whether because professional opportunities are more abundant in foreign countries, or due to the fact this tax benefit applies only to yearly incomes under \u20ac28,000,\" says S\u00e9rgio Vasques, professor of tax law at the Cat\u00f3lica Lisbon School of Law.",

      "The environmental group Greenpeace UK said the latest move was \"proof that fossil fuel companies can't or won't be part of climate crisis solutions\".",
      "Alexander Kirk from Global Witness added BP \"cannot be trusted to deliver the clean energy transition\", adding that it was \"focusing on short-term profits to shareholders while energy prices are high, with the rest of the world picking up the tab from its climate-wrecking products\".",

      "\"The climate change issue has not gone away, the science hasn't changed,\" he said.",
      "'Not just down to one company'",
      "Challenged on the reduced commitment to investing in renewable energy, Louise Kingham, BP's senior vice president for Europe and the UK, said none of the changes announced on Tuesday would alter the UK's green energy plans, which include three wind farms and carbon capture projects.",
      "She said the shift to renewable energy sources had slowed but that BP's ambition had \"not changed\" to become a net-zero company.",
      "According to the International Energy Agency, no new fossil fuel projects are compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5C compared to pre-industrial levels,",
      "\"We just have to do this transition more smartly and more efficiently and try to get those returns for our owners because they are helping us to do that. If we don't generate the returns, we can't invest and do more,\" Ms Kingham told the Scottish Affairs committee of MPs.",

      "In the five years since former chief executive Bernard Looney first unveiled his strategy, shareholders have received total returns including dividends of 36%.",
      "In contrast, shareholders in rivals Shell and Exxon have seen returns of 82% and 160% respectively.",
      "BP's under performance has prompted speculation that it may be a takeover target or may consider moving its main stock market listing to the US where oil and gas companies command higher valuations.",

      "Energy costs are one of a number of bill rises which will come into force at the start of what some commentators have described as \"awful April\".",
      "The exact amount you pay will depend on your individual circumstances, and where you live.",
      "Although minimum wages will increase from April, and wages on average have been outpacing inflation, household finances could still come under extra pressure.",
      "Here are seven ways in which you could be affected.",
      "1. Water bills",
      "Water bills for households are due to go up in England and Wales by \u00a310 more per month on average, but there's a lot of variation depending on the company.",
      "For example, the annual Southern Water bill will jump 47% to \u00a3703, while Anglian Water customers will pay 19% more, or \u00a3626.",
      "Factors including whether households have a meter and how much water used will also impact bills, which are being front-loaded for the next five years, meaning the big increase is coming in April.",
      "Water companies in England and Wales have said the increases are needed to invest in creaking infrastructure, including sewage, and to build more reservoirs.",
      "In Scotland, water bills are set to rise by almost 10%. Scottish Water, which is a public body, said spending was needed to cope with periods of \"drought and intense rainfall\" brought on by climate change.",

      "How much will I have to pay for my water?",
      "How much will I have to pay for my water?",
      "2. Energy bills",
      "The annual energy bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will go up \u00a3111 a year to \u00a31,849 from April.",
      "Regulator Ofgem increased the energy price cap because of higher wholesale costs and inflation.",
      "The cap is set every three months and limits the amount suppliers can charge for each unit of gas and electricity, but not the total bill, so if you use more, you will pay more.",
      "It affects 22 million homes in England, Wales and Scotland.",
      "Standing charges - fixed fees to connect to a gas and electricity supply and vary by region - are rising again for gas but dropping for electricity, but it depends on where you live.",

      "3. Council tax",
      "It is likely the tax you pay to your local authority will go up from April.",
      "In England, local authorities with responsibility for delivering social care can increase council tax every year by up to 4.99% without triggering a referendum or local vote.",
      "Smaller councils without social care duties can increase bills by up to 2.99%.",
      "For 2025-26, the government is allowing Bradford, Newham, Birmingham, Somerset, and Windsor and Maidenhead to bypass the 4.99% cap, meaning they could raise council tax by more.",
      "Council tax rates in Scotland have been frozen or had limited increases since 2007, but they are expected to go up in April, in some cases by as much as 10%.",
      "The Scottish government says it is offering local authorities an extra \u00a31bn in 2025-26 to help reduce the scale of any rise.",
      "In Wales, council tax rates could jump by as much 15% in some areas. Local authorities were given \u00a3253m by the Welsh government in its draft budget, but council leaders say more money needed.",

      "The exact amount for your road tax will depend on the year your car was registered and the type of fuel it uses.",
      "One big change is that electric vehicles (EVs) will no longer be tax exempt. EVs registered from April 2025 will pay the lowest rate of \u00a310 in the first year, then move to the standard rate. The standard rate will also apply to EVs first registered after April 2017.",
      "5. Broadband, phone and TV licence",
      "Rule changes introduced by the telecoms regulator this year mean that mobile and broadband providers must now tell customers \"in pounds and pence\" about any price rises, as well as when they occur.",
      "The new rules typically only apply to new customers, so any price rise will depend on when you took your contract out.",
      "For instance, under the new rules, someone with a mobile Sim only contract with EE will see their bill go up by \u00a31.50 a month, or \u00a318 a year.",
      "But for the majority of customers who took their contract out before 10 April 2024, they will face an increase of 6.4%, based on the inflation rate last December, plus an additional charge.",
      "Similarly, most Virgin Media broadband customers will face a 7.5% rise in bills, but for anyone who took out a contract after 9 January this year, their monthly bill will go up by \u00a33.50.",
      "The cost of a TV licence will also go up by \u00a35 to \u00a3174.50, and for a black and white TV it will go up by \u00a31.50 to \u00a358.50.",
      "6. Stamp duty",

    "summary": "The tech giant's decision has prompted questions and concerns about reduced protections for UK iCloud users.",
    "story": [
      "Apple has made headlines by pulling its most advanced data security tool for UK customers.",
      "It is removing Advanced Data Protection (ADP) after the Home Office asked for the right to be able to access data which it is applied to - something even Apple itself cannot currently do.",
      "Rather than comply with that request, on Friday the tech giant said it would halt new UK sign-ups to the tool and remove existing user access at a later date.",
      "The move has prompted criticism of the UK government's actions - but also confusion about what protections remain for UK Apple customers.",
      "What is Apple's Advanced Data Protection?",
      "ADP is an opt-in data security tool designed to provide users of devices such as iPhones with a more secure way to protect data stored in their iCloud accounts.",
      "Items including back-ups, photos, notes and voice memos are given standard encryption by default.",
      "The company can be ordered to hand over this data by law enforcement.",
      "ADP, meanwhile, applies an extra level of protection through what's known as end to end encryption, which means Apple cannot see or access the data - only the user can.",
      "Because Apple does not have a key, losing access to your account can mean losing your data altogether.",
      "It also means law enforcement agencies have no way of accessing such data either.",
      "The tool is independent of the protections for blue messages sent with iMessage, passwords stored in iCloud keychain, Health app data and Facetime, which are end to end encrypted by default.",
      "What does this mean for my iCloud data?",
      "If you are in the UK and have not turned on ADP, you will not see a change to the way your data is protected as a result of Apple disabling it.",
      "Your iCloud data will remain protected by standard encryption and, as before, can still be accessed by Apple.",
      "But it does mean you now cannot apply to protect iCloud storage with end to end encryption, even if you want to.",
      "Meanwhile, people in the UK who had ADP enabled prior to Friday's change will lose access to it a later date.",
      "Apple has not said when, nor how many UK users will be affected.",
      "Some experts have raised alarm over its removal, saying it will leave users less protected and also have wider, global consequences.",
      "Graeme Stewart of cybersecurity firm Check Point said it would not mean \"a complete free-for-all\" as law enforcement must have a warrant to request iCloud data.",
      "But he said other governments may look to replicate the UK's demand of Apple for a so-called \"backdoor\" to encrypted cloud data.",
      "Cybersecurity experts have likened the idea of creating a backdoor to someone leaving their house keys under their doormat - essentially creating a vulnerability which anyone, including bad actors, can exploit.",
      "Digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation said that if Apple had complied with the request, it would have created a backdoor not just for UK users \"but for people around the world, regardless of where they were or what citizenship they had\".",
      "Apple told the BBC in a statement that it had \"never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products, and we never will\".",
      "What protections do Google and Android offer?",
      "Like Apple, Google says it uses standard encryption across a range of its services to protect data as it moves between users' devices, its services and data centres.",
      "The search giant, which owns Android, has provided further protections for Android phone system back-ups since 2018.",
      "It uses a mechanism that generates a random security key on a device, which is encrypted by a user's lock-screen passcode, pattern or pin.",
      "Google says it cannot see this security key and that the passcode-protected information is sent securely to high security chips in its data centres.",
      "But the same protections do not extend to Google Photos or content stored in Google Drive - which are not end to end encrypted.",
      "It also has an Advanced Protection Program for people who want further security for their account.",
      "This relies on using passkeys to verify the account holder.",
      "Some Samsung Galaxy smartphones also have \"enhanced data protection\" which encrypts back-ups of messages, call logs, apps and settings and more end to end.",

      "His comments came just minutes after a majority of shareholders rejected a proposal calling on the tech giant to consider ending its diversity policies, such as the use of race and sex in hiring decisions.",
      "Apple had urged shareholders to vote against the measure, which the company had argued was  \"inappropriately\" trying \"to micromanage\" its business.",
      "The scrutiny of the firm comes as US President Donald Trump has called for an end to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes in the government and private sector, including at Apple.",
      "In a social media post the day after the meeting, Trump ramped up the pressure on the company.",
      "\"Apple should get rid of DEI rules, not just make adjustments to them,\" he wrote in a all-capital-letters post. \"DEI was a hoax that has been very bad for our country. DEI is gone!!!\"",
      "Trump's DEI orders have run into legal roadblocks, but many companies in the US, including big names such as Meta, Amazon and Goldman Sachs, have already ended or rolled back their own policies, citing legal risks.",

      "Shareholder measures opposed by companies rarely succeed, so the outcome of Tuesday's vote was expected.",
      "It marked the second high-profile defeat of shareholder proposal targeting DEI, after a similar rejection at retailer Costco.",
      "However, despite the vote, Mr Cook on Tuesday acknowledged that the firm may have to alter some of its practices.",
      "\"As the legal landscape around this issue evolves, we may need to make some changes to comply, but our north star of dignity and respect for everyone and our work to that end will never waver,\" Mr Cook said during a question-and-answer session at the company's annual shareholder meeting.",
      "He noted that Apple did not use \"quotas\" for hiring - a practice that has come in for some of the fiercest criticism - while saying the firm's strength came from a culture where \"people with diverse backgrounds and perspectives come together\".",
      "\"We'll continue to work together to create a culture of belonging where everyone can do their best work,\" he added, saying the company would remain \"committed to the values that have always made us who we are\".",
      "The proposal targeting Apple's DEI policies was backed by the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank, which had also put forward the proposal at Costco.",
      "It argued that the existence of Apple's diversity and inclusion programmes exposed the firm to \"litigation, reputational and financial risks\", pointing to the wider corporate retreat and noting that recent lawsuits have made it easier for workers to sue over discrimination.",
      "Stefan Padfield of the organisation's Free Enterprise Project, who presented the proposal at Tuesday's meeting, said the risks to Apple had increased after the Trump administration recently ordered staff to investigate DEI in the private sector.",
      "\"The vibe shift is clear,\" he said. \"DEI is out and merit is in.\"",
      "Apple's decision to push back against the shareholder proposal, while simultaneously opening the door to changing its policy is an effort to satisfy both sides of the fight, said Angela Jackson, a senior advisor to the Project on Workforce at Harvard University and author of the forthcoming book, The Win-Win Workplace.",
      "But she warned that it left Apple \"playing defence\". She said she wanted to see the company lead by making a more robust business case for the programmes.",
      "\"They've made the right moves. The one step they could go further... is to really say, 'Yes it's our values, we believe it's the right thing to do, but it's also an economic imperative.\"",
      "The fight over DEI in the US has raised questions about whether such policies in other countries will face similar challenges.",
      "Catherine Howarth, chief executive of the responsible investment charity ShareAction, said she thought that Apple - a global, consumer-facing firm - had made the bet that the benefits of pushing back against the shareholder proposal outweighed the risks.",
      "\"It's not popular with consumers and it's not popular with employees to abandon what were supposedly your principles in this area until very recently,\" she said.",
      "\"They think it would go down very badly - and it would - with their global consumer base.\"",
      "Shareholders also rejected proposals that would have required Apple to report about its AI privacy practices, charitable giving and policies to combat child sex abuse.",

    "story": [
      "Households are being encouraged to consider a fixed price deal on their energy bills by the regulator ahead of costs rising again in April.",
      "Ofgem is increasing the energy price cap by 6.4%, meaning a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will see their bill rise by \u00a3111 a year, or \u00a39.25 a month, to \u00a31,849.",
      "The cap, which is set every three months and limits the amount suppliers can charge for each unit of energy, affects 22 million homes in England, Wales and Scotland.",
      "Ofgem said switching to a fixed tariff provided certainty over payments and could reduce costs, although analysts predict prices could fall in July.",
      "The seven bills due to go up in April",
      "The rise in April will hit people's finances at the same time as water and council tax increases, although average wages are also going up.",
      "The regulator said rising wholesale costs and inflation were behind the latest energy price hike - the third consecutive increase in the quarterly cap and more than the 5% analysts had forecast.",
      "While the cost of each unit of gas and electricity is capped, the total bill is not, so bills will vary depending on how much energy is used.",
      "Ofgem illustrates the cap by showing the impact on the annual bill of a household with typical energy usage.",
      "Standing charges - fixed fees to connect to a gas and electricity supply and vary by region - are rising again for gas but dropping for electricity. Some customers in London and the North Wales and Mersey region will see an overall increase of up to \u00a320 a year.",
      "Ofgem's chief executive Jonathan Brearley accepted another increase in energy costs was \"unwelcome\".",

      "Some people in debt to their supplier will not be able to switch firms, but should still be able to fix with their current provider on their best fixed deal.",

      "Martin Lewis, founder of Money Saving Expert, told the BBC that moving to a fixed deal was a \"no-brainer\".",

      "Ofgem director general of markets, Tim Jarvis, said the latest price rises were driven by international gas prices, which have gone up \"significantly\" recently.",
      "However, analysts at Cornwall Insight said energy prices have dipped in the past couple of weeks following US-Russia talks on a potential end to the Ukraine war.",
      "As a result, the consultancy has forecast the price cap in July will fall to \u00a31,756 a year for a typical consumer, although it noted this would still be hundreds of pounds above the pre-conflict level.",

    "story": [
      "While drinking tree sap does not immediately sound appealing, Canadian producers are hoping that it will be the next must-try soft drink around the world.",
      "We have all heard of maple syrup, which is made by boiling down the sap of maple trees to produce a thick, sweet, golden-to-brown coloured syrup that is typically poured over pancakes.",
      "What is far less well known is that you can drink the sap itself, which is called maple water. Clear in colour, it contains just 2% natural sugars, so it is only slightly sweet.",
      "A small but growing number of producers in Canada are now selling this maple water in bottles or cartons, after first giving it a filter and pasteurisation to kill off any microbes.",
      "\"People feel like they're drinking the wild Canadian forest,\" says Yannick Leclerc of Maple3, a producer of maple water drinks, based in Quebec City.",
      "Advocates point to the fact it is a natural drink, and makers hope that it can steal some sales from the existing similar product \u2013 coconut water. The latter is made from water that naturally forms inside coconuts.",
      "As Canada is far and away the world's largest producer of maple syrup \u2013 accounting for more than 80% of production \u2013 it is understandable that the nascent maple water sector is also Canadian. Furthermore, it is centred on the province of Quebec, which makes 90% of Canada's maple syrup.",
      "Mr Leclerc says that Maple3 is one of the pioneers of the sector. \"Nobody [previously] thought about keeping the sap for its hydration purposes verses just boiling it into syrup.\"",
      "He joined the company back in 2016, three years after it was founded by his business partner St\u00e9phane Nolet. In recent years an increasing number of other producers have entered the marketplace.",
      "Mr Leclerc claims that Maple3 has doubled its annual profits since 2021, with sales not just rising across Canada, but in 12 other countries, including France, Japan, Singapore and South Korea. Some 75% of its sales now come from overseas, and it sells both still and sparkling maple water, and fizzy versions with added natural fruit flavourings.",
      "\"It's more than just a local product at this point,\" adds Mr Leclerc.",
      "For the maple water industry as a whole, one recent report predicts big growth. It estimated that global sales in 2024 totalled $506m (\u00a3409m), with that expected to jump to $2.6bn by 2033.",
      "By comparison, worldwide sales of coconut water reached $7.7bn in 2023, with that expected to grow to $22.9bn by 2029. So maple water has a long way to catch up.",
      "Meanwhile, the global value of the maple syrup market was $1.7bn last year, according to one study.",
      "Beth Czerwony, a dietician with the non-profit medical centre Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, says the growing popularity of maple water is linked to its perceived health benefits.",
      "\"When the sap itself is filtered through the tree, it ends up absorbing a bunch of antioxidants,\" she says. \"So they're gonna end up having a better performance and a faster workout recovery.\"",
      "However, one medical study from 2019 concluded that maple water was \"was not superior in rehydration\" to normal water.",
      "Jeremy Kinsella owns The Soda Pop Bros in Windsor Ontario, which sells soft drinks under its own brand name, as well as imports from around the world.",
      "His family have been in the industry for nearly a century, and in his lifetime he has seen a fair share of trends come and go.",
      "He says that if maple water is to go mainstream it needs the financial backing and promotion of one of the huge global soft drinks firms.",
      "\"It will take a larger soda manufacturer for it to really catch on,\" he says.",
      "Mr Kinsella also says that the price of maple water is currently too high. \"When it comes down to it, someone's looking at a can of Coke for a buck and they're looking at a can of maple water for three bucks, they're going to try it a couple of times and go back to Coke,\" he says.",
      "Marketing maple water more would certainly help it increase sales, says John Tomory, who helps run Pefferlaw Creek Farms in Uxbridge, Ontario. He and his brothers have been making maple syrup commercially for almost 10 years, and for the past four they have also been selling the sap to a Canada brand called Sap Sucker. This makes sparkling sap water with different added flavours, from lime to grapefruit, and lemon to orange.",
      "Mr Tomory says he agrees with this approach to make the sap more interesting. \"I know a lot of people have tried just selling the sap as it is, just basic sap from the tree and it's still, but they haven't really caught on,\" he says.",
      "\"So I think carbonating it and adding fruit flavour makes it more interesting. That's the real innovation.\"",
      "Back at Maple3 in Quebec, Mr Leclerc also thinks that the sparkling version of the drink could be the more popular: \"It has perks that a normal sparkling water doesn't have,\" he says, such as a more interesting flavour, without having all the bad stuff that [regular] soda has.\""

      "In December, Google said its new quantum chip incorporates key \"breakthroughs\" and \"paves the way to a useful, large-scale quantum computer\".",
      "Some estimates say a quantum device capable of breaking current encryption would require 10,000 qubits, while others say millions would be needed. Today\u2019s systems have a few hundred at most.",
      "But businesses and governments face a problem right now, as attackers could harvest encrypted information and decrypt it later when they do gain access to suitably powerful devices.",
      "Greg Wetmore, vice president for software development at security firm Entrust, says if such devices could emerge in the next decade, technology leaders need to ask, \u201cWhat data in your organization is valuable for that period of time?\u201d",
      "That could be national security information, personal data, strategic plans, and intellectual property and secrets - think of a soft drink company\u2019s \u201csecret\u201d formula or the precise balance of herbs and spices in a fast food recipe.",
      "Mr France adds, if quantum computing becomes widespread, the threat becomes more immediate with the encryption that protects our daily banking transactions, for example, potentially trivial to break.",
      "The good news is that researchers and the technology industry have been working on solutions to the problem. In August, the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the US released three post quantum encryption standards.",
      "The agency said these would \u201csecure a wide range of electronic information, from confidential email messages to e-commerce transactions that propel the modern economy.\u201d It is encouraging computer system administrators to transition to the new standards as soon as possible, and said a further 18 algorithms are being evaluated as backup standards.",
      "The problem is this means a massive upgrade process touching virtually all our technology infrastructure.",
      "\u201cIf you think about the number of things out there with asymmetric encryption in them, it's billions of things. We're facing a really big change problem,\u201d says Mr France.",
      "Some digital infrastructure will be relatively easy to upgrade. Your browser, for example, will simply receive an update from the vendor says Mr France. \u201cThe challenge really comes in discrete devices and the internet of things (IOT),\u201d he continues.",
      "These might be hard to track down, and geographically inaccessible. Some equipment \u2013 legacy devices in critical national infrastructure such as water systems, for example \u2013 might not be powerful enough to handle the new encryption standards.",
      "Mr Wetmore says the industry has managed encryption transitions in the past, but \u201cIt's the sharper discontinuity that makes this threat more serious.\u201d",
      "So, it is trying to help customers build \u201ccrypto agility\u201d by setting out policies now and using automation to identify and manage their cryptographic assets. \u201cThat's the secret to making this transition an orderly one and not a chaotic one.\u201d",
      "And the challenge extends into space. Prof Sastry says many satellites \u2013 such as the Starlink network \u2013 should be relatively straightforward to upgrade, even if it means briefly taking an individual device offline temporarily.",
      "\u201cAt any given point in time, especially with the LEO (low earth orbit) satellites, you've got 10 to 20 satellites above your head,\u201d Prof Sastry says. \u201cSo, if one can't serve you, well so what? There are nine others that can serve you.\u201d",
      "More challenging, he says, are \u201cremote sensing\u201d satellites, which include those used for geographical or intelligence purposes. These carry a lot more compute power on board and typically include some sort of secure computing module. A hardware upgrade effectively means replacing the whole device. However, says Prof Sastry, this is now less of a problem thanks to more frequent and lower cost satellite launches.",
      "While the impact of the millennium bug might have been minimal in the first days of 2000, that's because an immense amount of work had gone into fixing it ahead of a known deadline, says Fran\u00e7ois Dupressoir, associate professor in cryptography at the University of Bristol.",
      "By contrast, he adds, that it is not possible to predict when current encryption will become vulnerable.",

    "story": [
      "A 14-year-old boy has lost a court case he brought against his own parents after they moved him from London to Ghana to go to boarding school.",
      "The boy, described in court as shy, articulate, a keen cook and footballer, said his parents had tricked him into going to Africa, saying it was to visit a sick relative.",
      "He said had he known he was being sent to boarding school \"there would have been no way I would have agreed to it\".",
      "But the High Court in London also heard his parents were worried he was being \"groomed\" into criminal activity.",
      "In a written statement to the court, he said: \"I feel like I am living in hell. I really do not think I deserve this and I want to come home, back to England, as soon as possible.\"",
      "In his judgment, High Court judge Mr Justice Hayden said he recognised that \"this is, in many ways, both a sobering and rather depressing conclusion.\"",
      "He said that he was satisfied that the parents' wish for their son to move to Ghana was \"driven by their deep, obvious and unconditional love\".",
      "The boy was at risk of suffering greater harm returning to the UK, he said.",
      "He said that the boy's parents believe \"and in my judgement with reason\" that their son has \"at very least peripheral involvement with gang culture and has exhibited an unhealthy interest in knives\".",
      "The boy's father told the judge the couple did not want their son to be \"yet another black teenager stabbed to death in the streets of London.\"",
      "The boy, who had lived in the UK since birth, said he was \"mocked\" and \"never settled in\" at the school in Ghana.",
      "He said he \"could also barely understand what was going on and I would get into fights\".",
      "The boy wrote that he was \"so scared and desperate\" that he emailed the British High Commission in Accra as well as contacting the charity Children and Family Across Borders, who it is believed put him in touch with lawyers at the International Family Law Group.",
      "\"I am from London, England, and I want to go back home,\" he wrote.",
      "He said he had been \"mistreated\" at the school, adding: \"I'm begging to go back to my old school.\"",
      "However the High Court heard that the boy's parents had sent him because they feared for his safety in London.",
      "In a statement, his mother said sending him to Africa was \"not a punishment but a measure to protect him\".",
      "She referred to the murder of Kelyan Bokassa, the 14-year-old boy who was stabbed to death on a bus in Woolwich in January. That was \"every parent's worst nightmare\", she said.",
      "She said she did not believe her son would survive in the UK and did not want to be part of her son's \"destruction\".",
      "Rebecca Foulkes, representing the boy's father, said the boy met 11 of the points on a checklist produced by the children's charity NSPCC to indicate whether a child might have joined a gang or was being criminally exploited.",
      "That included being absent from school, having unexplained money, buying new things, and carrying weapons.",
      "She said it was not only the parents who were worried.",
      "His school claimed it had \"suspicions about him engaging in criminal activities\" and had observed him in expensive clothes and with mobile phones.",
      "The boy said he had never been part of a gang, nor \"involved in gangs in any way\". He said he \"does not know anyone involved in a gang\" and he does not carry a knife.",
      "He acknowledged in his statements that \"my behaviour wasn't the best\" and said he thought that was the reason his parents sent him to Africa.",
      "The case centred on the question of parental responsibility, and whether the parents acted unlawfully by sending their son to boarding school without his consent.",
      "In a statement issued after the judgement, his parents said: \"This has been a really difficult time for us all.\"",
      "They added: \"Our priority has always been protecting our son and our focus now is on moving forward as a family.\"",
      "James Netto from the International Family Law Group, who represented the boy, said the court judgment had been a \"real shock\" to the teenager.",
      "\"He was obviously incredibly disappointed, incredibly upset and is considering his next steps carefully.\"",
      "'I want to have an education'",
      "The boy's barrister, Deirdre Fottrell KC, pointed out the school was not simply far from home - but a completely different jurisdiction.",
      "The boy wrote that his education was suffering. He felt the Ghanaian classes were not as challenging as those in his English school, and he had been out of formal education entirely since last summer, studying online.",
      "He wrote: \"I want to have an education again and grow up like a normal person. I feel like my brain is hurt here. I feel like now I am dumber than people I used to be smarter than.\"",
      "The boy's father has recently visited him in Africa, and he told the court that he and his son had got on well.",
      "He said he would like his son to remain in Ghana, and said they visited a different boarding school where the boy could be considered for a place.",

      "The attainment gap between the proportion of school leavers from the most and least deprived areas who had one pass or more in National 5s or equivalent qualifications was 22.7% last year \u2013 up from 20.2% in 2022/23.",
      "The gap in the proportion of school leavers who achieved one pass or more in Highers or equivalent qualifications was 38.4% in 2023/24, up from 36.9% the previous year.",
      "Education Secretary Jenny Gilruth told BBC Scotland News the statistics showed \"positive signs for the future\" despite the attainment gap increase.",
      "The figures also show that 8,084 pupils left school after S4. That accounted for about one in seven of those leaving school, and was the highest number since 2010.",
      "The proportion of pupils who left school last year with one or more pass at National 5s, or equivalent and one or more pass at Higher level or equivalent has also dropped.",
      "Last year 83.5% of school leavers had one pass or more at National 5 level, while 57.4% had one pass or more at Higher level. Both were lower than in 2022/23.",
      "'A deeper problem'",
      "Prof Lindsay Paterson, from Edinburgh University, said the closure of schools during the Covid pandemic was one reason for the attainment gap getting worse in Scotland.",
      "\"Unlike in England and other countries, there has never been a proper programme of educational recovery here,\" he told BBC Scotland News.",
      "\"The harm is greatest to those children who have not been able to get help at home, or whose parents can't afford to pay for extra tutoring.",
      "\"But behind this is a deeper problem. The Scottish government has never had a coherent strategy for dealing with the educational effects of poverty.\"",
      "He added that there was nothing intrinsically wrong with pupils leaving after S4 as long as they have something worthwhile to go to.",
      "Just under 56,000 young people left school last year \u2013 the highest number since 2010.",
      "More than 95% went on to positive destinations such as university, college, employment, some training and voluntary work. This was slightly lower than the previous year but one of the highest levels since 2010.",
      "More than 67% of school leavers last year were in higher or further education three months later.",
      "Gilruth told BBC Scotland News progress on closing the attainment gap was being made, but that the increase was \"disappointing\".",
      "She said: \"It is important to distinguish today's statistics on S4 leavers from overall progress made to close the attainment gap in Scotland.",
      "\"There are clearly positive signs for the future as we are seeing a record low poverty-related attainment gap in primary school literacy and in S3 literacy and numeracy.",
      "\"While it is disappointing that the attainment gap has widened slightly at SCQF Levels 4, 5 and 6, it's important to note that we have reduced the gap between the most and least deprived young people entering positive destinations by two thirds since 2009-10, the second lowest gap on record.\"",
      "Gilruth added that the number of school leavers at S4 had remained stable, and that the government was exploring reasons why teenagers chose to leave school at that time.",
      "Scottish Conservative education spokesman Miles Briggs said: \"After years of insisting that education is their priority, the SNP have been missing in action while ministers have let down pupils and teachers at every turn.",
      "\"Under John Swinney's government, it's our most deprived students who now face the narrowest options and the worst prospects.\""

    "summary": "From April, a pilot scheme will offer free breakfasts for 180,000 pupils before class.",
    "story": [
      "The government has announced the first 750 schools to provide free daily breakfast clubs as part of a pilot scheme ahead of a planned England-wide rollout.",
      "Starting in April, 180,000 pupils in England will be offered \"healthy, varied and nutritious breakfasts\" in schools before class, Labour said - with over a third of schools in the pilot scheme in deprived areas.",
      "But some MPs and head teachers' unions have raised concerns the funding is too low.",
      "Labour campaigned on a promise of free breakfast clubs in every English primary school and later tripled funding to \u00a330m.",
      "Cautious welcome for free school breakfast clubs",
      "Free school meals 'would tackle child poverty'",
      "Parents will be able to drop off children 30 minutes before their usual school time, knowing they will be offered a free breakfast, the government says.",
      "Shadow Education Minister Neil O'Brien told the House of Commons there were \"a number of questions\" about the plans, including \"the difference in the planned spend and the much larger benefits ministers are claiming\".",
      "Analysis from the Institute for Fiscal Studies said the funding proposed for the breakfast clubs could be enough to fund all primary school pupils under a food-only model, or 60% of pupils if it had some childcare element.",
      "O'Brien questioned how the education secretary was planning to close that funding gap.",
      "But Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson told the House of Commons she was \"confident\" the funding would be adequate.",
      "One in seven schools involved in the pilot had no before-school provision already in place, Phillipson said, and the rest either have paid-for provision or have their numbers capped.",
      "\"These breakfast clubs that we are introducing will be free to every child and every parent who seeks to take them up,\" she said.",
      "Phillipson did not confirm when the national rollout of the scheme would take place, but said it would be \"as soon as possible\".",
      "'Really worried'",
      "The Association of School and College Leaders general secretary Pepe Di'Iasio  said head teachers were \"really worried\"  the basic daily rate of just 60p per pupil was far too low.",
      "\"We strongly urge the government to be more realistic about the costs involved, before it attempts to roll out this policy nationally,\" he said.",
      "The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) has welcomed the news but also voiced concern that funding could fall short.",
      "\"It will be crucial that these concerns are addressed before the programme is rolled out across the country, to ensure that it does not place further pressure on already strained school budgets,\" said NAHT general secretary Paul Whiteman.",
      "Announcing the first 750 schools to join the pilot scheme, the Department for Education said breakfast clubs had \"an important role to play in the government's commitment to remove the stain of child poverty\".",
      "Devon tops the list with 25 schools in the programme, followed by England's largest local authority, Birmingham, with 24.",
      "Both Wales and Scotland have programmes to provide free breakfasts to children in primary schools.",
      "Guidance sent to schools taking part in the pilot scheme says they will receive a set-up payment to cover equipment and material.",
      "Under the scheme, schools will then be reimbursed by the government based on attendance at the clubs - a school with 50% participation in the pilot scheme could get \u00a323,000 a year, the government said.",

    "summary": "The pair, who murdered their wealthy parents in 1989, are pursuing three possible routes that could see them leave prison.",
    "story": [
      "After 35 years behind bars, Lyle and Erik Menendez are closer than ever to a potential second chance at freedom.",
      "The brothers, who were convicted of killing their parents, Jos\u00e9 and Kitty Menendez, in 1989, have long maintained that the murders in their Beverly Hills mansion were driven by years of sexual and physical abuse, rather than hopes of inheriting their fortune.",
      "They are currently serving life in prison without the possibility of parole in California.",
      "A mix of new evidence and public interest has thrown the case, one that has both gripped and divided the nation for decades, upside down.",
      "It's all reached a pivotal moment.",
      "A resentencing hearing is set in March, which could lead to their sentences being reduced - or even their freedom. Separately, California Gov Gavin Newsom has ordered the state's parole board to conduct a risk assessment, a key step toward possible clemency, which could take form in a reduced sentence or a pardon.",
      "The movement in the historic criminal case is significant, but not everyone is happy at the prospect of them potentially walking free.",
      "Three paths to freedom?",
      "There are three possible routes the brothers have been trekking in hopes of gaining their freedom.",
      "1. Clemency from the Governor of California",
      "Clemency could mean a reduced sentence or even a pardon, but it would not overturn the brother's convictions.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom has ordered the parole board to conduct a risk assessment to determine if the brothers pose a danger to society. Depending on the results, the governor could grant clemency, commuting their sentences to make them eligible for parole or even releasing them outright.",
      "The probe will examine the factors behind their crimes and their rehabilitation while in prison. It marks the first step in a broader process that could lead to clemency.",
      "2. A new trial",
      "The brothers' defence attorneys have also asked for a new trial.",
      "They pointed to new evidence about the alleged sexual abuse by their father and argued jurors should be able to consider a lesser sentence, such as manslaughter.",
      "But newly elected Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said his office will oppose the request.",
      "3. Resentencing",
      "The last avenue is likely the most significant. The brothers are being vetted for resentencing, a legal process that could reduce their life sentences and grant them eligibility for parole.",
      "A hearing is scheduled for 20 March and 21 March to discuss this possibility.",
      "This effort centres on whether the brothers have rehabilitated after 35 years in prison and whether recent changes in California law apply to their case.",
      "In October 2024, then-LA County District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n recommended resentencing for the brothers, citing California's evolving approach to juvenile offenders and abuse survivors.",
      "Shortly after the announcement, he lost a re-election campaign. The decision now rests with current DA Nathan Hochman, who was elected in November, and is examining the case before making a decision on whether to back the effort in court.",
      "One key argument for resentencing stems from a change in California law that allows offenders who were under the age of 26 at the time of their crime to be sentenced as minors rather than adults.",
      "Since Lyle was 21 and Erik was 18 when they killed their parents, their defence attorneys argue that this law should apply to them. If they had been sentenced under today's legal framework, they might have received lighter sentences or had the possibility of parole from the beginning, their attorneys argue.",
      "Why is this happening - 35 years after the killings?",
      "Neama Rahmani, a criminal defence attorney and former federal prosecutor, told the BBC that a \"perfect storm of PR and politics\" has led to the Menendez brothers having a real shot at freedom.",
      "He noted the recent attention the case has gotten from celebrities, a Netflix drama and docuseries on the case, and an \"embattled\" district attorney who was vying to remain in office.",
      "\"You're never going to see another case like this. It's a unicorn.\"",

      "Gasc\u00f3n, who was the top prosecutor in LA at the time, announced just 12 days before a tough re-election in November 2024 that he would back the resentencing request. He has denied the announcement was political and argued it was a long-time coming.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n lost his re-election bid and was replaced by voters with the more moderate Hochman, whose view of the case remains unclear.",

      "They told the court they feared their parents would kill them if they didn\u2019t act first. Lyle and Erik testified they confronted their parents about the sexual abuse and things had become combative in their household and they believed their parents were planning to kill them.",
      "Family members testified about the abuse they witnessed - but none said they saw sexual abuse first-hand.",
      "Their life in prison",
      "Both brothers married while serving life sentences without the possibility of parole.",

      "Two years later, in 2003, he married Rebecca Sneed, a magazine editor. Sneed has remained out of the public eye but has maintained her commitment despite the challenges of prison life.",
      "Erik Menendez also found love behind bars. In 1999, he married Tammi Saccoman after a pen-pal romance developed into a deeper connection.",
      "In 2005, she published a memoir, They Said We'd Never Make It, chronicling their unconventional marriage and the difficulties of loving someone serving a life sentence. She has described their relationship as \"fulfilling and deeply emotional,\" despite never being able to share a traditional life together.",
      "Court records also detail more about their lives behind bars.",
      "A motion filed in support of their resentencing bid details they both received educational degrees. It also details various programmes they launched behind bars that aimed to help other inmates, including those who were victims of childhood trauma and disabled or elderly inmates.",

      "US actor John Lithgow has said he is \"excited\" to be playing Dumbledore in the forthcoming Harry Potter TV series, adding that the role is \"going to define me for the last chapter of my life\".",
      "The makers of the new show are currently assembling their cast, and while no official announcements have been made yet, the veteran Oscar-nominated star appears to have confirmed he will play the Hogwarts headmaster.",
      "Lithgow is known for starring in sitcom 3rd Rock From the Sun, with other roles ranging from voicing Lord Farquaad in Shrek to playing Winston Churchill in The Crown.",
      "It now looks like he will follow in the footsteps of Richard Harris and Michael Gambon, who played Albus Dumbledore in the Harry Potter films.",
      "On Tuesday, Lithgow confirmed to ScreenRant that he had said yes to playing the character in the small screen adaptation.",
      "The 79-year-old said the suggestion \"came as a total surprise to me\".",
      "\"I just got the phone call up at the Sundance Film Festival... and it was not an easy decision because it's going to define me for the last chapter of my life, I'm afraid,\" he added. \"But I'm very excited.\"",
      "The Hollywood stalwart has the required combination of gravitas, warmth and levity to make a success of the Dumbledore role, although if the in-depth series does last for a decade, he'd be almost 90 by the time it ends.",
      "He continued: \"Some wonderful people are turning their attention back to Harry Potter. That's why it's been such a hard decision.",
      "\"I'll be about 87 years old at the wrap party, but I've said yes.\"",
      "'Faithful adaptation'",
      "The TV series will feature a brand new cast and is expected to start filming this summer.",
      "It will be \"a faithful adaptation of the iconic books\" by author JK Rowling, and is due to last for a decade, streaming service HBO Max has said.",
      "Lithgow is the first actor to appear to have officially confirmed his involvement, but an open casting call has been held to find the three young stars.",
      "\"We appreciate that such a high-profile series will draw a lot of rumour and speculation,\" HBO told Deadline earlier this month, in response to the reports about Lithgow.",
      "\"As we make our way through pre-production, we will only confirm details as we finalise deals.\"",
      "Who is John Lithgow?",
      "He's been one of the most popular and respected actors in America for several decades, with roles that span both drama and comedy.",
      "Lithgow earned two Oscar nominations in the 1980s (for The World According to Garp and Terms of Endearment) and won three Emmys for playing Dick Solomon in 3rd Rock from the Sun from 1996 to 2001.",
      "He won another Emmy and got a Bafta nomination for playing Churchill in Netflix's The Crown - proving he can master a British accent - with more memorable TV roles in Dexter and Perry Mason.",
      "He has recently been seen as an FBI boss in The Old Man, and as a scheming cardinal in Conclave, which is up for a string of Oscars this year."

    "summary": "When was the last time two musicals were up for best picture? And could Adrien Brody break a record?",
    "story": [
      "Hollywood has had another eventful year: Deadpool faced off with Wolverine, Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni sued each other, Inside Out 2 conquered the box office and Joker's sequel emphatically did not.",
      "The Oscars race, meanwhile, played out against the grim backdrop of wildfires which devastated Los Angeles and left thousands of homes destroyed.",
      "Awards season had its fair share of scandal. While The Brutalist's use of AI and Anora's lack of an intimacy co-ordinator were storms in a Twitter teacup, there was one genuine controversy when some historic tweets nearly brought down Emilia P\u00e9rez.",
      "Ahead of the Academy Awards on Sunday (2 March), here are 17 of the quirks, trends, patterns, and record breakers from this year's batch of nominees.",
      "- - - - -",
      "1. This is the first time two musicals have been nominated for best picture in more than five decades.",
      "Wicked and Emilia P\u00e9rez are the first tuneful twosome to be up for the top prize since Funny Girl and Oliver! in 1969.",
      "The musical resurgence is partly down to it being twice as easy to score a best picture nomination nowadays, after the top category was expanded to 10 slots.",
      "The last musical to win best picture was Chicago in 2003.",
      "2. Adrien Brody already holds one Oscars record, and he could break another.",
      "The US star is currently the youngest ever winner of best actor - he was 29 when he won for his performance in 2002's The Pianist.",
      "But Brody wasn't nominated again until this year, with his nod for The Brutalist. If he wins again, he will become the first person to win the leading actor category with his first two nominations.",
      "Only seven other actors currently have a 100% win rate at the Oscars from two or more nominations - Vivien Leigh, Hilary Swank, Kevin Spacey, Luise Rainer, Christoph Waltz, Helen Hayes and Mahershala Ali.",
      "3. But Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is a major threat.",
      "The Dune and Wonka star is Brody's toughest competition in best actor, thanks to his acclaimed portrayal of Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown.",
      "If he won, not only would Chalamet halt Brody's winning streak, he would also take Brody's record as the youngest-ever winner. There isn't much in it - Chalamet would be just 10 months younger than Brody was when he won.",
      "4. Netflix's Emilia P\u00e9rez could follow a dubious pattern for streaming films.",
      "It might have the most nominations, but the Spanish-language musical could share the same fate as other recent streaming films which were heavily nominated, but failed to follow through with many wins.",
      "The Irishman (Netflix) won zero Oscars, from 10 nominationsMank (Netflix) won two out of 10The Power of the Dog (Netflix) won one out of 12Killers of the Flower Moon (Apple) won zero out of 10",
      "The Irishman (Netflix) won zero Oscars, from 10 nominations",
      "Mank (Netflix) won two out of 10",
      "The Power of the Dog (Netflix) won one out of 12",
      "Killers of the Flower Moon (Apple) won zero out of 10",
      "Emilia P\u00e9rez is strong in a couple of categories, but it's similarly unlikely to sweep the board.",
      "Only one streaming film has ever won best picture - Apple's Coda - which only had three nominations overall.",
      "5. Two Succession stars share a disadvantage.",
      "Kieran Culkin and Jeremy Strong are both nominated for best supporting actor, for their performances in A Real Pain and The Apprentice respectively.",
      "But the pair are the only two nominees in the category who don't come from best picture-nominated films.",
      "A Real Pain's absence in best picture shouldn't stop frontrunner Culkin from winning. The last person to win the category without a best picture nomination was Christopher Plummer in 2012, for Beginners.",
      "Every actor in the category this year is Oscar-nominated for the first time, except Edward Norton, who has three previous nods.",
      "6. The Substance is the first body horror to be nominated for best picture, and only the seventh horror overall.",
      "The other six were The Exorcist, Get Out, The Silence of the Lambs, Jaws, The Sixth Sense and Black Swan.",
      "The Substance is a strong contender in best make-up and hairstyling, a category where the winner often overlaps with the acting winners. That could work in Demi Moore's favour in a tight best actress race.",
      "7. Isabella Rossellini is nominated for an eight-minute performance in Conclave, but that isn't the shortest in Oscars history.",
      "Beatrice Straight won the same category, best supporting actress, for her role in Network, which lasted 5min 02sec.",
      "Dame Judi Dench is only marginally ahead, winning for a performance in Shakespeare in Love which lasted 5min 52sec.",
      "Winners aside, the shortest nominee is thought to be Hermione Baddeley's performance in 1959's Room at the Top, lasting 2min 19sec.",
      "On the subject of durations, The Brutalist (3hrs 35mins including an intermission) would be the fourth-longest best picture winner of all time, after Gone With the Wind, Lawrence of Arabia and Ben-Hur.",
      "8. Sing Sing star Colman Domingo is nominated for best actor, just a year after his last nomination in the same category for Rustin.",
      "Quite an achievement, no doubt. But he has some way to go to catch up with Bette Davis and Greer Garson, who both managed five consecutive Oscar nominations in the 1930s and 40s.",
      "Just behind them are Al Pacino, Elizabeth Taylor, Marlon Brando, Thelma Ritter and Jennifer Jones, who each scored four back-to-back nods.",
      "Bradley Cooper, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, Russell Crowe, Glenn Close, Jane Fonda, Meryl Streep, Jack Nicholson, William Hurt, Richard Burton, Deborah Kerr, Gregory Peck, Ingrid Bergman, Gary Cooper and Spencer Tracy all managed three in a row.",
      "9. All five best actress nominees come from films which are also nominated for best picture.",
      "That might not sound like much, but it's the first time it's happened since 1977.",
      "The historic lack of overlap between the two categories has often been attributed to the Academy being less likely to give female-focused films the top prize.",
      "But that trend has shifted in recent years, with films featuring female leads such as Nomadland, Coda and Everything Everywhere All At Once scoring best picture.",
      "10. Before Sebastian Stan's nomination for The Apprentice, only seven other actors had been Oscar-nominated for playing a US president.",
      "Frank Langella was recognised for his portrayal of Richard Nixon, while Daniel Day-Lewis and Raymond Massey were both nominated for playing Abraham Lincoln.",
      "Sam Rockwell was nominated for playing George W Bush, Alexander Knox for Woodrow Wilson, and James Whitmore for Harry Truman.",
      "Perhaps most notably, Sir Anthony Hopkins has been nominated twice for portraying two different presidents in separate films - once as Nixon and another as John Quincy Adams.",
      "Stan is slightly different in that he portrays Trump in his younger years as a real estate tycoon, rather than during his tenure as president, but we're still chalking that up as worthy of induction into this exclusive club.",
      "11. Robbie Williams' biopic Better Man is nominated for best visual effects, but he also has a connection to two other films in the race.",
      "The British singer's track Swing Supreme features in a pivotal scene of Emilia P\u00e9rez, while his former Take That bandmates feature at the beginning of Anora as a remix of Greatest Day plays in a nightclub.",
      "Its prominence in the film led to the remaining members of Take That performing the song at this year's Bafta Film Awards.",
      "12. Ralph Fiennes could be a good omen for Conclave.",
      "The last two times the British star was nominated for acting, for Schindler's List and The English Patient, his film won best picture.",
      "If Conclave wins, Fiennes would set a record for having appeared in the most best picture winners, becoming the only actor with roles in four (the other being The Hurt Locker).",
      "However, Edward Berger's absence in the best director category significantly weakens Conclave's chances. Only six films have ever won best picture without a corresponding director nomination.",
      "On the plus side, three of those have been in the last 12 years (Argo, Coda and Green Book), suggesting this is less of an obstacle than it used to be.",
      "Why wasn't Berger nominated? One possible factor is that, unlike the five directors who were, he didn't write or co-write his film's screenplay. Conclave was adapted from Robert Harris's novel by British screenwriter Peter Straughan.",
      "13. Diane Warren really wants to win.",
      "The songwriter scored her 16th best original song nomination this year, for writing The Journey, from The Six Triple Eight.",
      "But Warren has never won. With Emilia P\u00e9rez's campaign damaged and potentially splitting votes with two songs in the category, could this finally be her year?",
      "She certainly hopes so. Earlier this month, when a film account on X asked followers: \"Which Oscar winner would make you happiest?\" Warren brilliantly replied: \"Me!\"",
      "14. Wicked has a tall hill to climb to win best picture, having missed both a directing and screenplay nomination.",
      "It did score several technical nods as well as acting nominations for Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, but neither are frontrunners in their category.",
      "The last film to win best picture without a corresponding win in a director, screenplay or acting category was Rebecca in 1942.",
      "15. Two nominees are following in their mothers' footsteps.",
      "I'm Still Here star Fernanda Torres is nominated for best actress - after her mother Fernanda Montenegro became the first Brazilian nominee in the same category in 1999 for Central Station.",
      "Meanwhile, Conclave star Isabella Rossellini's mother, Ingrid Bergman, was nominated for best actress six times in her career, winning twice, and won best supporting actress.",
      "16. Anora's director could become the first person to win four Oscars for the same film.",
      "As Sean Baker was involved in so many aspects of the film's production, he could personally win best picture, editing, director and screenplay.",
      "Nobody has ever done this before.",
      "Walt Disney did win four Oscars in the same night in 1953, but for four different films.",
      "And Parasite's Bong Joon-Ho came incredibly close in 2020, but as the best international film prize technically goes to the country that submitted it rather than the director, he only took home three for his own trophy cabinet.",
      "If Anora does win the top prize, it will be the second consecutive year the director of best picture co-wins with his wife. Baker and wife Samantha Quan would follow Oppenheimer's Christopher Nolan and Emma Thomas.",
      "Anora would also be the first 18-rated film to win best picture since The Departed in 2007.",
      "17. It's official: The cat in Flow is named Flow.",
      "The delightful movie about a cat who survives a flood is a dark horse in the animated film category, having beaten box office juggernauts Inside Out 2 and The Wild Robot to the prize at the Golden Globes.",
      "\"While we worked on Flow the cat didn't have a name,\" the film's director Gints Zilbalodis said earlier this month. \"We just called it the cat.",
      "\"I've heard from multiple people that they think that its name is Flow. People have even named their cats Flow now! So I think we can call the cat Flow.\"",

      "Ariana Grande, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Demi Moore were among the Oscar nominees who gathered in Los Angeles on Tuesday for the annual \"class photo\".",

      "17 facts you need to know before the Oscars",
      "17 facts you need to know before the Oscars",
      "The class photo, a highlight of the film calendar, is usually taken much earlier in awards season, at the nominees luncheon, but that event was cancelled this year due to the LA wildfires.",
      "Here are 12 things we spotted in this year's class photo:",
      "1. Ariana and Cynthia held space at the front",
      "Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande have spent the last few months crying, holding space and stroking each other's fingers as they promoted the screen adaptation of Wicked.",
      "The two actresses have redefined the film press tour in recent weeks thanks to their absolute adoration for each other - an energy they will have to recreate later this year when they do it all again for the release of part two.",
      "Before the photo was taken, instead of saying cheese, Erivo shouted: \"Everyone say 'Oscar nominee!'\"",
      "Last week, it was confirmed the pair will perform a medley of songs from the film during the Oscars ceremony which will last a reported 10 minutes long.",
      "Wicked is the closest thing the Oscars have this year to a box office smash in the shape of last year's Barbie, and they'll be hoping the medley will recreate the energy of Ryan Gosling's viral performance of I'm Just Ken last year.",
      "2. We absolutely need this woman's jumper",
      "We're aware the weather is getting warmer and the sun is rising earlier as we hurtle towards Spring, but we are nevertheless always on the lookout for a colourful cosy jumper and we need to investigate the origin of this one as an urgent priority.",
      "The woman with the impeccable sweater selection in the class photo is Maya Gnyp - a producer of I Am Ready, Warden - which is nominated for best documentary short.",
      "The film follows Texas death row inmate John Henry Ramire in his final days.",
      "3. A-listers packed out the front row",
      "Joining Ariana and Cynthia on the front row were fellow acting nominees Zoe Salda\u00f1a, Mikey Madison and Monica Barbaro.",
      "Salda\u00f1a is almost certain to win best supporting actress for Emilia P\u00e9rez, having taken the trophy at a string of precursor events including the Baftas, SAG Awards and Golden Globes.",
      "As a result, her fellow category nominees such as Barbaro, who plays Joan Baez in Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown, have had to practise their best \"I'm just happy to be nominated\" faces this year.",
      "Madison, however, is a co-frontrunner in a tight race for leading actress. The Anora star is up against Demi Moore for The Substance in a category seen as a dead heat.",
      "4. James Mangold turned up just in time",
      "James Mangold, nominated this year for A Complete Unknown, is one of Hollywood's most respected and loved directors.",
      "So why is he sitting on an aisle seat in the second-back row, away from all his pals, looking sheepish?",
      "It's probably because he only just made the class photo by the skin of his teeth, arriving late to the event to an affectionate collective groan followed by cheers from his fellow nominees.",
      "Despite a distinguished Hollywood career, Mangold is a first-time nominee in the best director category, as are his fellow nominees Coralie Fargeat, Sean Baker, Brady Corbet and Jacques Audiard.",
      "5. We'd like to be the fifth member of this gang",
      "In a year where disappointingly few of the stars pulled funny faces or made eye-catching hand gestures while the photo was being taken, we applaud the team from Black Box Diaries for joining hands and celebrating.",
      "They are the film's director Shiori Ito (second left), editor Ema Ryan Yamazaki (far right) and producers Hanna Aqvilin and Eric Nyari.",
      "The movie, nominated in the documentary feature category, examines a sexual assault investigation in Japan.",
      "6. The biggest stars were in the back row",
      "Sitting in the back row, so far from the photographer that their faces are somewhat blurry and out of focus, are three of the biggest stars in this year's awards race.",
      "In the centre is The Substance star Demi Moore, nominated for playing an ageing aerobics instructor who takes a black-market drug to create a younger, more beautiful version of herself.",
      "She is joined on either side by supporting actor nominees Guy Pearce (left), who is recognised for his role in The Brutalist, and Edward Norton, who is nominated for playing Pete Seeger in A Complete Unknown.",
      "7. Bernie and Brandi appeared without Elton",
      "Also hanging out in the front row were songwriter Bernie Taupin and singer-songwriter Brandi Carlile.",
      "The pair are nominated in the best original song category for writing Never Too Late, the title track from Sir Elton John's recent documentary.",
      "Sir Elton himself wasn't there, however, despite co-writing the song with the pair.",
      "It's likely he will attend the Oscars on Sunday, but he won't be singing his song as the Academy has done away with having the original song nominees perform during the ceremony this year.",
      "Instead, Doja Cat, Lisa from Blackpink, Queen Latifah and Raye will be among the other performers during the ceremony alongside the Wicked medley.",
      "8. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet looked a little lonely",
      "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet joined his fellow nominees just days after springing a surprise win at the SAG Awards for A Complete Unknown.",
      "In his speech, the actor talked about his desire to be \"one of the greats\" of Hollywood.",
      "However, the actor has not been campaigning as aggressively as frontrunner Adrien Brody, and for the class photo, Chalamet took an aisle seat, leaned out and put his fist to his chest.",
      "Seated just in front of him are Anora's director Sean Baker and his producer wife Samantha Quan.",
      "9. The leading actors led from behind",
      "Adding further star power to the blurry back row were best actor contenders Adrien Brody, Colman Domingo and Sebastian Stan.",
      "Brody is the frontrunner to win, for his role in the Brutalist as a Hungarian architect who moves to the US after World War Two and is taken under the wing of a wealthy businessman.",
      "Sing Sing star Domingo plays a prison inmate who joins a performing arts programme, while Stan is nominated for portraying a young Donald Trump.",
      "10. Ralph represented for the Brits",
      "The Brits nominated in the acting categories this year are The Brutalist's Felicity Jones, Wicked's Cynthia Erivo, and Conclave's Ralph Fiennes.",
      "The actor was on Fiennes form, sitting in the back row alongside Sing Sing's John \"Divine G\" Whitfield.",
      "Fiennes is unlikely to win best actor, but if Conclave wins the top Oscar, he'll become the first actor ever to have appeared in four best picture winners.",
      "11. Some nominees were conspicuous by their absence",
      "Understandably, not every nominee was available to attend the dinner - best supporting actor frontrunner Kieran Culkin was among the stars missing from the class photo.",
      "But others were conspicuous by their absence, most notably Emilia P\u00e9rez star Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n.",
      "The actress is persona non grata in Hollywood at the moment, after some historic tweets she posted resurfaced in recent weeks, severely damaging the film's awards chances in many categories.",
      "However, it's been confirmed she will attend the Oscars ceremony itself on Sunday - although it remains to be seen if she will walk the red carpet and sit with her co-stars.",
      "12. Clarence Maclin knows what time it is",
      "Sing Sing star Clarence Maclin was widely considered the most notable absence in the best supporting actor category this year.",
      "But he is still nominated at the Oscars thanks to his story credit on the film, which means he is recognised in the best adapted screenplay category.",
      "Maclin was one of the real-life inmates at the Sing Sing jail, after being sentenced to 17 years in jail for robbery, aged 29, and was a member of the prison's Rehabilitation Through the Arts (RTA) programme.",
      "In the class photo, Maclin, who plays a version of himself in Sing Sing, is either checking his watch or possibly about to sneeze.",

      "Here is everything you need to know about the show and the real events in the Northamptonshire town that inspired it.",
      "What happened in Corby?",
      "Netflix said Toxic Town focused on mothers who fought a \"David and Goliath battle for justice\".",
      "In 1979, about 10,000 people worked at Corby's steelworks, but, with Britain experiencing a decline in heavy industry, steel production became uncompetitive, leading to the site's closure in 1980.",
      "Thousands were left unemployed, prompting the local council to launch a regeneration project.",
      "The British Steel Corporation demolished the works, and using government and European grants, the council began reclaiming the land.",
      "The project involved moving millions of tonnes of contaminated waste to Deene Quarry, on the outskirts of the town.",
      "Years later, concerns arose when mothers living near the reclamation site gave birth to children with upper limb deformities.",
      "A 1999 Northamptonshire Health Authority study found no unusual cluster of birth defects.",
      "However, solicitor Des Collins, after reading about the cases, conducted his own investigation, revealing birth defects in Corby were three times higher than in the surrounding area.",
      "Mr Collins assembled a team of experts, including toxicologists and pollution specialists, to argue that the council's mismanagement of toxic waste had spread contaminated dust throughout the town.",
      "The heavy metal cadmium was identified on the former steel site, and a medical expert cited research linking it to birth defects in animals.",
      "After a three-month civil court hearing, Justice Akenhead ruled in favour of the claimants, marking the first time a UK court recognised airborne pollutants harming unborn babies.",
      "Corby Borough Council disputed the verdict and prepared an appeal, but reached a private settlement with the families in 2010.",

      "James says this appears to have taken hold on the High Street, too, and he has been finding it harder to shop for clothes in his size and been advised to search online instead.",
      "Some people criticise body positivity campaigners as promoting unhealthy lifestyles, but James rejects this.",
      "\"Everyone should be healthy,\" he says.",

      "\"It felt like I was going home with strangers who said they were my mum and dad \u2013 my mum was showing me my room they had done up for me for after my surgery \u2013 but none of it looked like it belonged to me.",

      "Back at high school, she struggled. She did not recognise any of her friends, and, starting over, she gravitated to different people.",

      "At the urology department of Burnley General Hospital, 26-year-old Ryan (not his real name) is having a drug solution inserted through a catheter - part of his treatment for a condition known as ketamine bladder. This procedure will not completely reverse the damage inflicted by Ryan's previous addiction to the Class B drug, but it will help him manage the symptoms.",
      "Ketamine, a powerful horse tranquiliser and anaesthetic, is a licensed drug and can be prescribed medically. However, when misused, it can cause serious and sometimes permanent damage to the bladder. The hospital is watching Ryan for signs of kidney failure, too. He worries about finding a girlfriend and having children. But he is stoical when he talks about passing blood and having to urinate numerous times a day.",
      "\"You could not be a ketamine addict for 30 years, 20 years,\" he says. \"You'd die.\"",
      "He is under the care of consultant urologist Haytham Elsakka, who says he has witnessed a rise in young patients whose bladders have been damaged by ketamine use. \"Some of them are in their 30s, but most of them are 16 to 24,\" says Dr Elsakka. Around half of young patients end up needing surgery, he adds. Other risks from recreational use include liver failure, damage to the urethra, incontinence and impotence.",
      "\"We have seen young people under the age of 25 who've completely lost control of their bladders, who have had to have surgery, including bladder removal,\" says Abigail Wilson, lead clinical pharmacist for national drug and alcohol charity WithYou.",
      "In and around the town of Burnley, Ryan is far from alone. Lancashire County Council says it is helping a growing number of families affected by ketamine addiction in the Burnley area. According to WithYou, which runs a ketamine support service for young people aged 11 to 24, the number seeking help across Lancashire increased from 32 in 2018-19 to 123 by the end of 2024.",
      "And the area is not unusual. In England, the number of under-18s entering drug treatment who describe ketamine as one of their problem substances rose from 335 to 917 between 2020-21 and 2023-24, according to the National Drug Treatment Monitoring System.",
      "An anonymised 2023 survey of more than 13,000 secondary schoolchildren from 185 schools across England reported 11% of 15-year-olds had been offered ketamine at some point. The same study, conducted for NHS England, suggested the use of ketamine among schoolchildren had more than doubled in the last decade from 0.4% in 2013 to 0.9% in 2023.",
      "The drug came into the spotlight following the death of Friends actor Matthew Perry aged 54, after which a coroner found ketamine had been the primary cause. Doctors and experts subsequently described how the market for the drug in the US has exploded as it has grown in popularity among Hollywood celebrities.",
      "And thousands of miles away, among ordinary young people in UK towns, ketamine \u2013 also known as special K, vitamin K, or kit kat - has also become fashionable. Although highly dangerous, it is often seen as a sociable way to get high, with users buying it in powder form and snorting it.",
      "Now, just 11 years after ketamine was reclassified from Class C to Class B, the UK government is seeking expert advice on whether to make ketamine a Class A drug. This would mean anyone supplying it could be handed a life sentence.",

      "'It's in the schools, it's in the parks'",
      "One Saturday afternoon in September 2023, the hottest day of the year, a 16-year-old called Preston McNally took ketamine with three friends in Burnley. High on the drug, he fell into the Leeds and Liverpool canal that flows through the town. Preston's friends had also taken the drug and did not call for help straight away, an inquest was later told.",

      "Those on the front line are well aware of the scale of the problem. \"The amount of mums that have said to me, 'It's everywhere',\" says Fr Alex Frost from St Matthews Church in the town. He runs a support group for parents of ketamine users. \"It's in the schools, it's in the parks.\"",
      "Across Lancashire, recorded offences for possession and supply of ketamine rose by nearly 70% from 54 in 2023 to 91 in 2024. \"What we have seen, probably within the last 12 months, is the upturn in the use, particularly around children,\" says Insp Matt Plummer of Lancashire Police. \"Sometimes the parents have no idea.\"",
      "Once ketamine was known as a party drug, associated with the club scene. But there's evidence to suggest that has changed. In a 2024 report into drug trends in Greater Manchester, school-aged children recounted how they used it with friends to \"chill\" in the local parks or at home.",
      "Those who go on to use it away from social settings are often doing so \"to self-medicate unmet mental health support needs such as anxiety and trauma\", says the author of the report, Robert Ralphs, a professor of criminology and social policy at Manchester Metropolitan University.",
      "'Everybody else is doing it'",
      "One mother, who we are calling Claire, told the BBC she was oblivious to the fact that her 14-year-old daughter Lexi (not her real name) was addicted to ketamine until the teenager ended up in hospital with severe stomach cramps.",
      "Lexi, who lives on a neat, well-cared-for street in Burnley, loved sport and dancing. But after she started secondary school, she says, a friend introduced her to ketamine.",
      "\"I knew it was illegal\u2026 and it was a horse tranquiliser,\" says Lexi. \"That's all I knew. I didn't really want to do it, but I just thought, well, everybody else is doing it and I didn't really want to be the odd one out.\"",
      "One reason that so many young people are gravitating towards ketamine is they can buy it for pocket-money prices, according to Lexi. \"It were easy to get \u2013 like, really easy,\" she says.",
      "In Burnley, friends will chip in for the \u00a315 to \u00a330 it costs for a gram and share it.",
      "To feed her habit, Lexi would ask her mum for a couple of pounds for the bus or some make-up - or sometimes she would steal a \u00a310 note. If Lexi had been coming home drunk or smelling of weed, her mother Claire would have twigged. Claire says: \"I was absolutely gobsmacked, just distraught, really, thinking: how did I not know?\"",
      "'You're doing stupid amounts'",
      "What makes ketamine especially dangerous is that lots of people, particularly young people, wrongly see it as a lower-risk drug, says Mrs Wilson of the WithYou charity.",
      "At lower doses, she says, it has a similar effect to alcohol. \"The effects can wear off from about 40 minutes to just over an hour after taking it,\" she adds. \"If you want to keep those effects, then repeat dosing is required to continue them.\"",
      "And this means users' habits can escalate rapidly, according to Aaron (not his real name), who lives in a small town outside Burnley and took his first snort of ketamine when he was just 16.",
      "\"Your tolerance goes up extremely quickly and within the first month you're doing stupid amounts,\" he says. Soon he was spending \u00a3200 month on the drug.",
      "Higher doses can lead to a state known as a K-hole, \"which is where you become completely detached from reality and also paralysed\", says Mrs Wilson.",
      "Then there is the psychological impact. The WithYou charity is helping Lexi recover from dependence on the drug, but also trauma and self-harm. Once, when she was high, she was the victim of a sexual assault. When kids are on ketamine, they are extremely vulnerable.",
      "'Extremely dangerous'",
      "Some of the families of ketamine addicts the BBC has spoken to want the drug reclassified as Class A. But this would also mean children caught in possession of ketamine could face up to seven years in jail rather than five. Putting ketamine in the same bracket as heroin and cocaine \"may increase the stigma and make young people less likely to discuss their use and seek help\", warns Prof Ralphs.",
      "The government is currently seeking expert advice from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) on whether the drug should be reclassified. \"Ketamine is an extremely dangerous substance and the recent rise in its use is deeply concerning,\" says Dame Diana Johnson, the policing minister. \"It is vital we are responding to all the latest evidence and advice to ensure people's safety and we will carefully consider the ACMD's recommendations before making any decision.\"",
      "Families in the Burnley area say the authorities also need to do more to help those suffering as a result of what Fr Frost calls an \"epidemic\" of ketamine use.",
      "In response, Lancashire County Council says it is \"dedicated to supporting children and young people affected by ketamine use in our community\" and that it \"will continue to work tirelessly to address the challenges posed by ketamine use and to provide the necessary support to those in need\".",
      "'The urge is always there'",
      "There is scepticism from those on the frontline that increased enforcement will solve the issue.",
      "\"It's not a case that we can just arrest our way out of the ketamine issue,\" says Insp Plummer. \"You could arrest 10, 15 people a day for the possession of ketamine if you found them, but it's not going to change the cycle, particularly with kids.\" He adds that generally children caught with ketamine are given informal words of advice and referred for support, not charged.",
      "And some experts query how effective reclassification would be.  These include Prof Ralphs, who observes that the 2014 shift from Class C to Class B has not prevented the recent rise in usage among young people. He also suggests that would have no impact on people's decisions to supply it either, as most ketamine dealers already supply Class A substances as well. He adds that reclassification \"will not deter young people from using it if their underlying mental health and wellbeing needs continue to be unmet\".",
      "In the meantime, no one yet knows what the long-term effects will be for children who start taking ketamine at 12, 13 or 14. Community leaders and the families the BBC spoke to say they cannot wait for change, and that urgent action is needed now to try to prevent more young people suffering.",
      "Lexi says she is trying to move forward with her life. Since the doctors at the hospital told Lexi where her life could be heading, she has not used ketamine.",
      "Getting the drug out of her head is still not easy. She insists she will never take another dose of ketamine. But, she says, \"the urge is always there for me to do it again\".",

    "summary": "Cheshire MP Mike Amesbury, convicted of a street assault, was originally sent straight to jail.",
    "story": [
      "MP Mike Amesbury, who admitted repeatedly punching a constituent in the street, has had his 10-week prison sentence suspended following an appeal.",
      "The Runcorn and Helsby MP assaulted Paul Fellows, 45, following a row in Frodsham, Cheshire, last year and was jailed by magistrates on Monday.",
      "Amesbury, who had the Labour whip removed in October, launched an appeal and a judge said that while the length of the sentence had been \"spot on\", it should be suspended for two years.",
      "Judge Steven Everett, sitting with two magistrates at Chester Crown Court, also ordered Amesbury to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work.",
      "Amesbury must also undertake an alcohol monitoring programme, go on an anger management course, and carry out 20 days of rehabilitation work.",
      "His sentence still leaves the 55-year-old MP, who now sits as an independent, at risk of being ousted.",
      "If at least 10% of his constituents back a recall petition, a by-election will take place.",
      "Leaving court, Amesbury refused to answer questions from the waiting media about whether he would resign as an MP.",
      "But he said: \"I'd like to reiterate that I sincerely apologise once again to Mr Fellows and his family.",
      "\"I'm now going to go and see my family, and go home, and I'll give a statement at a later stage.\"",
      "Video footage of the assault, which happened near a taxi rank in the early hours of 26 October, which was played in court.",
      "It showed Amesbury punching Mr Fellows in the head, knocking him to the ground.",
      "The politician then hit him at least five more times and swore at him.",
      "Amesbury was then heard saying: \"You won't threaten your MP again, will you?\"",
      "Judge Everett told Amesbury the facts showed him \"in a truly unfavourable light\" and, as an MP, he \"should be showing an example\".",
      "While acknowledging it would be wrong to sentence him differently because he was an MP, the judge added: \"That doesn't mean we can't take into account that your behaviour as an MP was simply disgraceful.\"",
      "He said he also could not ignore Amesbury's \"heavy drinking and fighting\".",
      "'Pack of lies'",
      "The former Labour politician had arrived at court in a prison van and wore handcuffs as he was led into the building.",
      "The court heard that, in a prepared statement given in a police interview, Amesbury claimed he had been approached by a man \"shouting and screaming\" about local and national matters.",
      "The MP said that, because he was terrified and the other man's \"arms were swinging\", he felt he had no option but to \"defend\" himself.",
      "But the judge told him the CCTV pictures revealed a very different story.",
      "\"In reality, you told the police a pack of lies. Nothing more, nothing less,\" he said.",
      "Judge Everett questioned why a charge of affray - which can carry a longer sentence - had not been brought by the prosecution.",
      "Daniel Travers, defending Amesbury, told the court: \"He's now had three nights in prison which is an experience he will never forget, certainly.\"",
      "He said the \"public shaming\" and \"embarrassment\" had had a huge impact on his client.",
      "\"This is a man who will certainly rehabilitate,\" said Mr Travers. \"He will learn a very painful lesson.\"",
      "'Parliamentary rules'",
      "The confirmation of Amesbury's prison sentence, even though it has now been suspended, could still result in him being ousted from the Commons.",
      "The long-time Labour politician has been sitting as an independent MP for the last four months, following his suspension by party bosses.",
      "Under parliamentary rules, if an MP receives a custodial sentence a \"recall petition\" is triggered.",
      "After hearing from Chester Crown Court, the Speaker of the House of Commons will contact the returning officer for Amesbury's Runcorn and Helsby constituency.",
      "Constituents will then have six weeks to ask for their MP's removal by registering at 10 nominated places.",
      "If at least 10% of them vote to remove Amesbury, a by-election will be called.",
      "It would be the first by-election since Labour came to power following the July 2024 general election.",
      "Having first been elected as a Labour MP in the Cheshire constituency of Weaver Vale in 2017, Amesbury comfortably won the Runcorn and Helsby seat which was created following boundary changes.",

      "The government's use of hotels to house asylum seekers has continued to rise, with more than 38,000 in hotels at the end of December. That figure was still lower than the peak of 56,000 hit in September 2023.",

      "Degrading, violent and misogynistic pornography should be banned, a review of the industry has recommended.",
      "The review, commissioned by the previous government and headed by the Conservative peer Baroness Gabby Bertin, urges ministers to give regulator Ofcom sweeping powers to police porn sites deemed to contain \"harmful\" material.",
      "It proposes outlawing \"degrading, violent and misogynistic content\", including making it illegal to possess or publish pornography showing women being choked during sex.",
      "Non-fatal strangulation is already an offence if someone does not consent but its depiction online is not illegal and the review finds it is \"rife on mainstream platforms\".",
      "All porn sites must 'robustly' verify UK user ages by July",
      "The 'incredible' number of UK adults watching porn",
      "The review proposes that porn videos considered too harmful for any certificate in the offline world should be banned online.",
      "Baroness Bertin argues that online pornography contributes to some of the \"gravest issues in our society, from domestic violence to toxic masculinity to the mental health crisis among young people\".",
      "She told the BBC: \"I'm not saying that people shouldn't watch porn. I'm not saying porn shouldn't exist. I'm not a prude.\"",
      "However, her 32 recommendations on what government should do about the \"high-harm sector\" of legal online pornography are likely to initiate a debate about how far the state should police people's sex lives.",
      "Baroness Bertin said online porn was not \"properly scrutinised and regulated\" in the same way as offline content.",
      "\"It strikes me as incredible that to buy a DVD, which sounds so sort of retro, the BBFC [British Board of Film Classification] has to put a stamp on it, has to check that certain standards have been met. That there's no sense you are encouraging child sexual abuse. No harmful, degrading, humiliating practices which is not through consensual roleplay,\" she told the BBC.",
      "\"You just have to go on the homepages of some of these mainstream sites and you will see of all that degrading content \u2013 particularly violent towards women \u2013 and it's all there for everyone to see.\"",
      "Her report suggests pornography websites depicting the non-fatal choking of women during sex has normalised such behaviour in the real world, with violent and degrading material rife on mainstream platforms amid a \"total absence of government scrutiny\".",
      "The review cites research suggesting that over a quarter of the nation regularly accesses online porn with a third of all men watching material at least once a week. It concludes that increasingly disturbing content is \"rewiring\" the way young people think about gender, sex and their role in society.",
      "The Department for Science Innovation and Technology said it would look at the links the review highlighted.",
      "\"We have already announced we will ban the creation of intimate deepfakes without consent and from next month under the Online Safety Act platforms will have to proactively tackle illegal content including extreme pornography and sexual abuse material,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "\"But further action is needed to address the review's shocking finding that graphic strangulation is increasingly appearing in pornography, despite being illegal, and is becoming normalised in real life.",
      "\"We will urgently ensure that platforms, law enforcement and prosecutors take all necessary steps to tackle this disturbing harm.\"",
      "Downing Street also described the findings of a report into the porn industry as \"shocking\", and suggested it would \"act swiftly\" to address gaps in the law - but stopped short of saying it would be banned.",
      "The review's recommendations were welcomed by the End Violence Against Women Coalition, which called for action from the government to address the harms arising from the current state of the porn industry.",
      "\"We know these companies are profiting enormously from sexual violence, and until they are forced to clean up their act, they won't,\" the group's director Andrea Simon said.",
      "Madelaine Thomas, an adult content creator, also welcomed the review but added: \"If we look to police people's sexual interests that's problematic.",
      "\"I don't think prohibition has ever eliminated demand in any way but I do think there are ways that we can work together to come up with frameworks that prioritise both consent and compassion and allow people to create and view what they would like to view on the internet,\" she told BBC Two's Politics Live.",
      "'Confusing world'",
      "Baroness Bertin argues that her proposals for sweeping new controls in currently legal pornography online would prevent real-world violence against women and girls.",
      "The review relates how a 14-year-old boy asked a teacher how to choke girls during sex and suggests online porn has created \"such a confusing world for our sons\".",
      "\"They are, quite rightly, encouraged and taught to reject sexist attitudes, while a subterranean online world of pornography is simultaneously showing them that anything goes,\" Baroness Bertin writes.",
      "Ministers are urged to fund programmes for boys and young men which encourage positive masculinity and counter misogynistic culture.",
      "The report quotes BBC research suggesting up to 38% of British women had experienced being strangled during intercourse, but notes that nearly half of those women wanted to be choked. \"This is important in demonstrating freedom of sexual expression and its nuance,\" the review says.",
      "Nevertheless, the report concludes that society has decided that \"enough is enough\" of harmful online pornography and its impact on young people.",
      "Measures to increase regulation of pornography, including to prevent children accessing explicit content, are already part of the Online Safety Act, which became law in October 2023.",

    "summary": "The prime minister announced the UK will reallocate aid funds to boost military spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027.",
    "story": [
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has challenged Sir Keir Starmer over the hike in defence spending, after the PM said the rise amounted to \u00a313.4bn.",
      "The PM announced the UK will reallocate aid funds to boost military spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, following President Trump's demand that all European allies increase their defence contributions.",
      "The decision comes as Sir Keir is set to fly to the US for talks with Trump in the White House, to discuss the war in Ukraine, later.",
      "Badenoch questioned Sir Keir over the exact amount, which Defence Secretary John Healey said could be calculated as \u00a36bn when inflation was taken into account, and whether the Chagos deal would be funded from it.",
      "Chris Mason: PM confronts Europe's new reality",
      "Will Starmer's defence hike win over Trump?",
      "Can Europe still count on the US coming to its defence?",
      "At Prime Minister's Questions, Badenoch asked whether any of the new funding would be going towards the multi-billion pound Chagos deal twice.",
      "The UK plans to hand over the territory to Mauritius, but under the terms of the deal, the UK will continue to lease one of the islands, Diego Garcia, which contains a UK-US military airbase, for a period of 99 years.",
      "The PM responded saying the increase in defence spending that was announced on Tuesday was for \"our capability on defence and security in Europe\", adding: \"The Chagos deal is extremely important for our security and for US security.\"",
      "Badenoch focused her questions to the prime minister on which figure for the defence rise - his initial \u00a313.4bn or \u00a36bn, which Healey said was the increase \"in real terms\"  - was correct.",
      "Sir Keir responded: \"If you take the numbers for this financial year and then the numbers for the financial year 2027-28, that's a \u00a313.4bn increase.",
      "\"That's the largest sustained increase in defence spending since the Cold War which will put us in a position to ensure the security and defence of our country and of Europe.\"",
      "Badenoch pressed him again, saying: \"The IFS said today that the government is playing silly games with numbers. How does he find this difference in numbers?\"",
      "Repeating himself, the PM then said they had already been \"going through the same question over and over again\" at previous PMQs and said \"if you ask again I'll give the same answer again\", to loud cheers from his backbenchers.",
      "Objecting, Badenoch pointed out that \"being patronising is not the same as answering the question\".",
      "When Badenoch suggested Sir Keir had listened to her advice on using international aid money for defence, he said: \"I'm going to have to let the leader of the opposition down gently... She didn't feature in my thinking at all.",
      "\"I was so busy over the weekend I didn't even see her proposal.",
      "\"She has appointed herself I think saviour of the western civilisation in a desperate search for relevance.\"",
      "Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey urged the prime minister to back the idea of a European rearmament bank \"so that we can finance a big increase in manufacturing capacity without the need to cut Britain's vital soft power\".",
      "The prime minister replied that there was \"an ongoing discussion\" with allies about future funding and he would share details with MPs \"as it evolves\".",
      "Earlier, a former defence chief of staff said he believed the decision to hike UK defence spending has been \"accelerated\" by President Donald Trump's actions on Ukraine.",
      "General Sir David Richards said the decision to raise defence spending over the next two years was a sound strategic move, but one that \"almost certainly would not\" be happening if not for Trump.",
      "\"It was going to happen, it's now been accelerated by Donald Trump's actions, and all of us, I think, would say not before time,\" he told  BBC Radio 4's Today programme.",
      "Lord Richards stressed the British Army was currently \"very hollowed out indeed\" and suggested the \"army isn't big enough\" currently for British troops to be part of a rotation of European peacekeeping forces.",
      "Questions have been raised about the Labour government's U-turn on its manifesto pledge to raise international development funding to 0.7% of gross national income, with unease among some Labour MPs about the move.",
      "Speaking at PMQs, Labour backbencher Diane Abbott suggested the decision could increase the risk of conflict abroad, telling the PM that \"there is also a view that taking money from aid and development to spend on armaments and tanks makes people less safe, not more safe, because the desperation and poverty that so often leads to warfare is what aid and development money is supposed to counter.\"",
      "The PM defended the decision in the chamber, and earlier Healey had said \"hard power is now more important than soft power\".",
      "Asked whether the increase announced on Tuesday is linked to Sir Keir's visit to the White House, Healey told the Today programme: \"President Trump, over the last two weeks, has been very direct in his challenge.",
      "\"He's reinforced the imperative and the importance of Britain making this commitment and helping other European countries to step up in a similar way.\"",
      "The US has been warning European leaders it wants to see a significant increase in their defence contributions to Nato for at least a decade.",
      "Trump's rapprochement with Russia's Vladimir Putin, and the US siding with Russia on a UN resolution on Ukraine, has sent shockwaves through European allies.",
      "Asked whether he believed the UK increasing its defence contribution would bring Trump on side, Healey said that the PM could now tell Trump: \"You are challenging Europe and the UK to step up on European security, on Ukraine, on defence spending, on reinforcing our industrial base.",
      "\"We are, and we will step up further.\"",

      "Seven organisations criticised in wake of the Grenfell Tower disaster could be banned from bidding for public contracts, the government has said.",
      "Cladding and insulation firms are among those set to be investigated, Housing Secretary Angela Rayner said, as she announced all recommendations of a public inquiry into the fire will be met.",
      "\"The bereaved and the survivors and members of the Grenfell community are still waiting for the justice they need and deserve,\" Rayner said, \"and justice must be done\".",
      "The government said it is already working on a list of reforms to building safety which came from the cladding crisis following Grenfell, and that it will begin implementing the changes from 2028.",
      "The fire in the west London tower block killed 72 people in 2017. The inquiry found all their deaths were avoidable.",
      "It concluded that the fire was the result of a chain of failures by governments, \"dishonest\" companies and the fire service, which lacked a strategy for dealing with high rise cladding fires.",
      "Rayner, who is also deputy prime minister, said the Grenfell Inquiry had uncovered \"serial incompetence and negligence, complacency and inaction, and blatant dishonesty and greed\" which led to the fire.",
      "She said the government was acting on its findings and would take \"tough action\" to reform the system and \"ensure no community will ever have to face a tragedy like Grenfell ever again\".",
      "\"That means greater accountability, stronger regulation, and putting residents at the heart of decision-making,\" she added, saying it was owed \"to the memory of those who lost their lives\".",
      "Ed Daffarn, who survived the fire, told the BBC the announcement left him feeling frustrated, adding the government's intentions \"may be good but the wait is torturous\".",

      "The announcement is part of a continuing effort to strengthen the regulations and oversight of construction.",

      "Grenfell Next of Kin, which represents some of the bereaved, said it welcomed the measures being put in place but that these \"should have been basic requirements for a developed country such as ours\".",
      "The group said it was concerned that there so far had been no charges related to the fire, and claimed the \"immense\" delay was \"primarily because the inquiry was allowed to overshadow the necessary criminal process\".",
      "The Grenfell disaster was caused by the use of highly flammable cladding backed by insulation which also contributed to the spread of the fire.",
      "Manufacturers either concealed evidence of the risks their products posed or made false and misleading claims, the inquiry found.",

      "Sir Keir will be making the case for Ukraine's direct involvement in any peace talks, warning that an insecure settlement without security guarantees for Kyiv could embolden Russia to attack again.",
      "Badenoch raised her concerns that the world may be seeing \"a return to the world of the strong and the weak\" with the threat from \"a new axis of authoritarian powers\" including Russia, China and Iran.",
      "On Trump's negotiations with Putin, she said: \"The danger is that aggression does not simply go unpunished but ends up being rewarded.\"",

      "The treaty was also recently cited in a case that allowed a Palestinian family the right to live in the UK, after they originally applied through a scheme designed for Ukrainians.",
      "During the Conservative leadership election, Badenoch said leaving the treaty would not be a \"silver bullet\" to tackling immigration but last week said her party would review the ECHR and Human Rights Act.",

    "summary": "The environment secretary is met with blaring tractor horns as he tries to win over farmers.",
    "story": [
      "Farmers protesting at government changes to agricultural inheritance tax rules have briefly disrupted a minister's speech at a national conference.",
      "Environment Secretary Steve Reed was met with horns from tractors parked outside and protesters who silently unfurled banners in front of him as he outlined farming reforms, which included plans to focus on food production and make the industry more resilient to disruption.",
      "Reed told the hundreds gathered at the National Farmers' Union (NFU) conference that he could not give them \"the answer many of you want on inheritance tax\" but he understood the strength of feeling in the room.",
      "NFU president Tom Bradshaw told the annual conference on Tuesday the inheritance tax changes were \"morally wrong and economically flawed\".",
      "Under the government's planned changes, from April 2026, inherited agricultural assets worth more than \u00a31m, which were previously exempt, will be liable to the tax at 20% - half the usual inheritance tax rate.",
      "Other allowances could mean a couple who are married or in a civil partnership could pass on a farm worth as much as \u00a33m.",
      "The government has previously said that the changes will only impact the wealthiest 500 farms each year, a number disputed by farmers unions which estimate up to 70,000 farms could be affected overall.",
      "Mr Bradshaw, whose speech was also briefly interrupted by two protesters who appeared to be urging people to be vegan, said the government had broken promises made before the election and had increased the mental health pressures on farmers, calling for it to correct the tax policy \"urgently'.",
      "\"We will fight this family farm tax until ministers do the right thing,\" he said.",
      "\"Frankly, this government needs a reset moment with farming, where they face up to the reality of how much the industry is struggling.\"",
      "Many farmers argue that while they are asset rich, for example in terms of their land or livestock, they are cash poor and the proposed changes would mean they would have to sell up in order to pay the tax.",
      "What is inheritance tax, who pays it and what's changing for farmers?",
      "How many farms will be affected by Budget tax rises?",
      "In his speech, Reed had also outlined plans for a 25-year farming roadmap and food strategy, which would put food production at its core and make farm businesses more resilient to challenges such as severe flooding, drought and animal disease.",
      "He said it would ensure farming is a \"sector which recognises restoring nature is not in competition with sustainable food production, but is essential to it\".",
      "As farmers outside the conference centre sounded their tractor horns, he announced measures including extending the seasonal worker visa scheme for five years, support for precision breeding and new technology.",
      "He also announced new requirements for government catering contracts to favour \"high quality, high welfare products that British producers are well placed to meet\".",
      "Earlier in the day, a multi-generational farming family - Martin Towler, his daughter and son-in-law, Hazel and Tom Church, and their five-year-old son Bertie - went to the Treasury to handover a collection of pre-loved farming toys donated by farmers who might be hit by the government's proposed changes to agricultural inheritance tax.",
      "The family have been farming Scald End Farm, a mixed beef and sheep farm in north Bedfordshire, since the 1940s but they all now also have to work off farm to supplement their income.",
      "They say the impact of the proposed inheritance tax changes will leave them facing a \u00a3400,000 bill and the prospect of selling off so much of the 210-acre farm that it would become unviable as a business.",
      "Mr Church said he hoped the government would listen to farmers' concerns and try to find a compromise on its inheritance tax policy.",
      "He told the BBC the changes, as currently proposed, would have a \"detrimental\" impact on the family's ability to run a profitable business.",
      "\"We are struggling at the moment as it is. There's no two ways about that,\" he said.",
      "\"Farming is incredibly low return on investment when you look at the asset values of the land and the income generated.",
      "\"If we are saddled with further debt through death - is it viable? Selling land is going to make it even less viable.\"",
      "Shadow environment secretary Victoria Atkins has said the Conservatives would reverse the inheritance tax on farmers \"straight away\".",
      "During Tuesday's conference in Westminster - the first time it has been held outside Birmingham for years - Reed, took questions from the audience.",
      "There was clear anger among those questioning him on the tax changes and he was told many older farmers \"were wishing their lives away\" and now felt they would benefit their families by dying before the 2026 tax change.",

      "Under the bill, police would gain the power to enter and search a property without a court warrant for a stolen mobile phone or other items that have been electronically tracked, such as laptops or Bluetooth-tagged bikes.",
      "The power would mean that victims of mobile phone thefts who track their device while it is in the hands of a criminal could call on police to recover it quickly.",
      "Cooper told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she understood the \"incredible frustration\" of phone theft victims who say \"I can track it, I can see where it is - it's in this particular house, it's in this particular location\".",
      "\"And yet the police can't act fast enough to be able to track it down,\" she added.",
      "Cooper said \"we have to have the stronger powers and action [and] the police say they welcome this\".",
      "Asked about the reliability of locator apps, where people can use another device to help track down the location of their missing or stolen phone, being used in police searches, Cooper told BBC Breakfast: \"Police will have to make decisions [and] it will need to be signed off by a police inspector, and [they will] need to make decisions about where the evidence is good enough for them to be able to act.\"",
      "She added that the bill would include scrapping a \"ludicrous\" \u00a3200 threshold for shoplifting, which meant lower value thefts were not currently prioritised by police.",
      "Shadow environment secretary Victoria Atkins told Sky News she was \"deeply concerned\" that no longer treating shoplifting below \u00a3200 as a summary-only offence would have significant long-term effects on crown courts, saying \"victims of rape will find it even harder and longer to get their day in court\".",
      "But Cooper said addressing lower value thefts which were not likely to lead to prison would stop criminal behaviour escalating to the stage where such sentences would apply.",
      "The bill also includes the government's proposed \"Respect Orders\" - court-imposed restrictions that will be similar to the Asbo developed in the Tony Blair era, then scrapped by the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats coalition a decade ago.",
      "While Asbos were popular with voters, critics say the restrictions often became unworkable or poorly enforced.",
      "The proposed Respect Orders allow courts to impose restrictions on an individual's behaviour, just like an Asbo.",

      "Cooper refused to be drawn on whether introducing new criminal offences would add unwelcome extra pressure on police, prisons, and the court system.",
      "Several police forces across England and Wales have previously warned they will have to make cuts to existing officers this year despite receiving extra funding, and Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood said in December that prisons were at risk of running out of space.",

      "She took up the post in 2021 and played a central role in the official response to the Covid pandemic.",
      "Before that, she was NHS England's chief operating officer, head of Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Trust in London and an adviser in Tony Blair's government.",
      "Her departure comes less than a month after two influential House of Commons committees discussed her suitability to lead the NHS through a period of what Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said will be the biggest overhaul of the service.",
      "As to the timing of her resignation, some words in her letter are significant.",
      "She noted that there is due to be radical reform of the size and functions of NHS England and the Department of Health and Social Care to \"drive the government's reform priorities\" and that the \"step change required\" would be best served by new leadership.",
      "Sources have indicated that the government wants to bind NHS England closer to the Department of Health to push ahead with changes, including shifting the focus from hospitals to community care.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting may well have felt the need to find a new leader, and Amanda Pritchard possibly felt that after several years at NHS England she did not want to be on a tighter rein.",
      "Amanda Pritchard joined NHS England in 2019 as number two to the then chief executive Sir Simon, now Lord Stevens. Senior health sources have indicated that the organisation had a degree of autonomy at the time, and the top job she then took on in 2021 was different to what was now envisaged by the Labour Government.",

      "'Turbulent waters'",
      "NHS England said Amanda Pritchard had decided it was the right time to stand down, now that the NHS has turned a corner on recovery from the pandemic and the foundations are in place to make further changes to support the NHS.",
      "Ms Pritchard said in a statement: \"We always knew the recovery period after a once-in-a-century pandemic was going to be incredibly challenging, and whilst the timeliness and experience of care is still not good enough for too many people, the NHS has achieved a great deal in the face of historic pressure thanks to a relentless focus on innovation and reform.\"",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting thanked her for her integrity and unwavering commitment.",

    "summary": "It comes after the government rejected compensation for women hit by changes to the state pension age.",
    "story": [
      "Campaigners have threatened the government with legal action unless it reconsiders the decision to refuse compensation to millions of women affected by an increase in the state pension age.",
      "The Women Against State Pension Inequality (Waspi) group is demanding payouts for 3.6 million women born in the 1950s who were not properly informed of changes first introduced in the 1990s.",
      "The government apologised that the changes were not communicated quickly enough but told the BBC it \"cannot justify paying for a \u00a310.5bn compensation scheme at the expense of the taxpayer\".",
      "Waspi chair Angela Madden said: \"We believe this is not only an outrage but legally wrong.\"",
      "The \"letter before action\" that has been sent to the government is a formal mechanism to allow it a chance to respond before the campaigners seek a judicial review at the High Court in two weeks time.",
      "Last year the parliamentary ombudsman recommended payouts of up to \u00a32,950 each because of a 28-month\u00a0delay\u00a0in\u00a0writing\u00a0to\u00a0inform\u00a0the women affected of the changes.",
      "Waspi\u00a0campaigners\u00a0have\u00a0claimed\u00a0women\u00a0suffered\u00a0financial\u00a0hardship\u00a0and\u00a0had\u00a0to rethink\u00a0retirement\u00a0plans.",
      "However in December, Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall apologised for the delayed communications but said there was \"considerable awareness\" of the changes to the pension age. She said sending letters earlier would not have made a difference to their ability to make retirement choices.",
      "Her claim there was no direct financial loss could now be examined in court if the campaigners get approval for their judicial review.",
      "What is the row about women's pensions?",
      "'I want the \u00a345,000 state pension that was stolen from me'",
      "Ms Madden said: \"We will not allow the DWP's gaslighting of Waspi women to go unchallenged.",
      "\"The government has accepted that 1950s-born women are victims of maladministration, but it now says none of us suffered any injustice.\"",
      "With no compensation forthcoming she said: \"The alternative is continued defence of the indefensible but this time in front of a judge.\"",
      "The Waspi group has also launched a crowd-funding campaign to try to cover an estimated \u00a375,000 in legal fees.",
      "If the women were to win their case it is estimated it could cost the government as much as \u00a310.5bn.",
      "With government finances already under strain because of weak economic growth and higher borrowing costs, Sir Keir Starmer has said \"the taxpayer simply can't afford the burden\" of compensation.",
      "The changes were first decided in 1995 when the then-Conservative government sought to equalise the age at which men and women received their state pensions, aiming that by 2020 everyone would have to wait until their 65th birthday.",
      "However in the aftermath of the global financial crisis in 2010, the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition decided to speed up the changes, to reduce the overall cost of the state pension.",
      "Other countries have made similar decisions in recent years - however the UK government did not communicate its change quickly enough and the impact of that could now be examined in court.",
      "A government spokesperson told the BBC on Sunday it accepted the ombudsman's finding of maladministration and had apologised for the 28-month delay in writing to 1950s-born women.",
      "\"However, evidence showed only one-in-four people remember reading and receiving letters that they weren't expecting and that by 2006, 90% of 1950s-born women knew that the state pension age was changing,\" they said.",

      "India and the UK have restarted free trade talks, nearly a year after negotiations were paused ahead of general elections in both countries.",
      "Jonathan Reynolds, the UK's business and trade secretary, met his Indian counterpart Piyush Goyal in Delhi on Monday and kicked off the two-day discussions.",
      "The talks focused on \"advancing\" the negotiations and ensuring that the deal was \"balanced, ambitious and mutually beneficial\", Goyal wrote on X.",
      "The countries have held more than a dozen rounds of negotiations since 2022, but an agreement has remained out of reach.",
      "Sticking points include high tariffs in India on Scotch whisky and relaxing fees and visa rules for Indian students and professionals going to the UK.",
      "Talks are being held for the first time after the Labour Party came to power in the UK and Reynolds says securing a deal is a \"top priority\" for his government.",
      "\"Growth will be the guiding principle in our trade negotiations with India and I'm excited about the opportunities on offer in this vibrant market,\" he said in a statement ahead of the meeting.",
      "India is forecast to become the world's third-largest economy in a few years.",
      "The ministers held a joint press conference after the meeting, but neither side offered a deadline for talks to conclude. Deadlines set by former ministers Boris Johnson and Liz Truss had passed without an agreement being finalised.",
      "For Delhi, the trade talks have assumed renewed significance on the back of US President Donald Trump's decision to impose reciprocal or tit-for-tat tariffs on imported goods from countries, including India.",
      "The UK is also a high-priority trading partner for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, which has an ambitious target to grow exports by $1 trillion by FY30.",
      "The UK had announced in November last year - soon after Sir Keir Starmer met PM Modi at the G20 summit in Brazil - that talks would restart in the new year.",
      "The two countries share a trade relationship worth \u00a341bn ($52bn) currently, according to a UK government statement, and a trade deal could unlock new opportunities for both countries.",
      "London has identified sectors that could benefit, which include advanced manufacturing, clean energy and professional and trade services. An agreement could also potentially unlock a valuable market for British cars, Scotch whisky and financial services worth billions of dollars.",
      "India is seeking greater mobility for its working professionals and students to the UK, while pushing for faster visa processing times.",
      "It may also seek concessions for its residents working temporarily in the UK on business visas, who are required to pay national insurance but are still ineligible for social benefits.",
      "Speaking at the joint conference, Goyal said that immigration was not a part of the discussions.",
      "\"India has never ever discussed immigration in any free trade negotiations,\" he said. Reynolds added that business mobility was a \"separate issue\" from immigration.",
      "During Reynolds' visit, he and Goyal will also visit the BT office in the northern Indian city of Gurugram.",
      "UK Investment Minister Poppy Gustafsson is also in India and will be participating in events in India's two big business hubs - Mumbai and Bengaluru.",
      "After years of scepticism over free trade deals, India has been signing agreements or is in talks with several countries or blocs. Last year, it signed a $100bn free trade agreement with the European Free Trade Association - a group of four European countries that are not members of the European Union - after almost 16 years of negotiations.",
      "It is also set to resume negotiations with the European Union this year.",

    "summary": "Sir Keir Starmer's meeting with the US president comes at a pivotal moment for Europe, our political editor writes.",
    "story": [
      "A big moment and a big decision, ahead of a big meeting.",
      "The government's announcement that it will crank up defence spending and shrivel the international aid budget amounts to a big shift in strategy, posture and political positioning.",
      "Take a look at the Labour Party's election manifesto, written less than a year ago, if you would like proof of that.",
      "On page 125, it says: \"Labour is committed to restoring development spending at the level of 0.7 per cent of gross national income as soon as fiscal circumstances allow.\"",
      "The party is now committing to doing the precise opposite \u2013 cutting development spending by the same amount by which it had promised to raise it.",
      "There is nothing like an outspoken American president and an imminent visit to the White House to sharpen the mind \u2013 and hey presto, along came this announcement just as the prime minister packs his shirts for his trip across the Atlantic.",
      "Along came the thumbs-up from the Trump administration not long later.",
      "But it is also true that there has been a growing recognition for some time and across several parties that more money had to be spent on defence.",
      "The prime minister has taken to recalling how the Berlin Wall coming down made him feel. \"It felt as if we were casting off the shackles of history, a continent united by freedom and democracy,\" as he puts it - contrasting that with the reality of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "A wider critique along these lines has been crystallising for some time: the sense that the 1990s were a holiday from history, as Jonathan Freedland called it, and that the end of the Cold War had created a peace dividend where defence budgets could atrophy and the money could be spent on hospitals and schools, for instance.",
      "Instead, not only is there war in Europe, there is an occupant of the White House with seemingly little regard for the American security umbrella this continent has relied upon since World War Two.",
      "Little wonder, then, that we have seen a blitz of the jitters in European capitals as presidents and prime ministers try to work out what it may or may not mean.",
      "The task facing Starmer - the second strand of the European tag team of leaders to visit Washington, after President Emmanuel Macron on Monday - is to attempt to mould President Donald Trump's position.",
      "Over the coming weeks and months, can a deal be done where the war stops, Ukraine does not feel defeated, Europe does not feel imperilled and transatlantic relations are as near to conventional as possible?",
      "It is not going to be easy.",
      "The prime minister's trip to the White House is but one building block in developing answers to these questions.",
      "And then, over the following weekend, Starmer will host a gathering of European leaders to reflect on where the conversations so far have taken us.",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Feb 2025 20:53:29 GMT",
    "summary": "The prime minister has set out plans to increase defence spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027.",
    "story": [
      "Sir Keir Starmer's promise to increase defence spending will have several consequences.  It may one day actually strengthen the UK's ability to defend itself. More immediately it will mean billions less spent on foreign aid.",
      "But what will it buy the prime minister diplomatically in Washington?",
      "In times past visiting dignitaries would give emperors gifts and tributes. Starmer  will now turn up at the White House on Thursday with a large goodie bag marked \"more defence spending\".",
      "Donald Trump is just the latest in a long line of US presidents urging European powers to spend more on their own defence.",
      "The prime minister will be able to say to the president that he has heard the call and acted. He might not want Trump to ask too many detailed questions: What does an added 0.2% of GDP mean in real money? When will the UK actually spend 3% on defence?",
      "But Starmer will want to land the idea that the UK is responding to Trump's agenda.",
      "Early signs are positive. Peter Hegseth, the US Secretary of Defence, said he had spoken to his UK counterpart, John Healey, and described the increase as \"a strong step from an enduring partner\".",
      "So Starmer's announcement may well get his foot in the door at the White House and a hearing from the president.",
      "But will it help him make the case for the security of Ukraine and Europe? Will Trump now be more amenable to allowing both a seat at the negotiating table? Will Trump be more open to the idea that the United States should play a role guaranteeing post-war Ukraine's security, giving air, logistics and intelligence cover to European forces helping to keep the peace on the ground?",
      "The answer to those questions is not clear cut. The prime minister may suggest the UK is showing leadership, pointing the way for other European allies to follow suit.",
      "He may also argue that the defence hike shows the UK will not have to make what he calls the \"historic mistake\" of having to choose between Europe and the US, something made much harder by the US decision to vote with Russia against Ukraine and Europe at the United Nations on Monday.",
      "Starmer cuts aid to fund hike in defence spending",
      "What is Nato and why isn't Ukraine a member?",
      "How much do Nato members spend on defence?",
      "The problem is that Trump and his administration have made it clear that their security priority is China and Europe will just have to do more to look after itself.",
      "Malcolm Chalmers, deputy director of the Royal United Services Institute, told the BBC: \"The reality is that whatever we do on defence, the US is going to pivot elsewhere, it is not going to take the lead role in European security that it has done for more than half a century.\"",
      "In that context, the government's promised increase in defence spending may be seen as a short-term tactical move ahead of Starmer's visit to Washington, rather than an historic response to the existential geopolitical changes posed by Trump's election.",
      "European diplomats told me they were underwhelmed by the UK defence offer, saying it was not enough to have a real impact. They said the UK would have to spend at least 3% of national wealth soon to give itself a chance to develop the capability it would need.",
      "To do that, the government would have to do more than raid the development budget. Aid charities noted that their spending was a soft target compared to those of massive spending departments such as welfare, health and education.",
      "But few politicians of any political colour appear prepared to start making an argument for a transformation of the post-war European welfare model and prepare voters for a massive change in defence spending.",
      "For now, the government is cutting foreign aid and international charities are furious.",
      "The reduction from 0.5% of national income to 0.3% means \u00a36bn less will be spent on foreign aid each year. Given that billions of this budget still pays for asylum seekers' hotels here in the UK, the actual amount spent on aid overseas will be about 0.15%.",
      "The prime minister said the UK would use this remaining aid money to help Sudan, Ukraine and Gaza, tackle climate change, and support multinational efforts on global health.",
      "Aid charities were stunned. Save the Children said it was betrayal of the world's most vulnerable children. The One campaign said it would create huge problems for the delivery of vital humanitarian assistance. The aid network BOND said there would be devastating consequences for millions of marginalised people.",
      "All this after Donald Trump froze America's development spending arm, USAID.",
      "By cutting foreign aid, the government has broken a manifesto commitment to protect the budget. It has also damaged its policy of using aid to engage more closely with countries in the global south.",
      "David Miliband, head of the International Rescue Committee and former Labour foreign secretary, said the cut was \"a blow to Britain's proud reputation as a global humanitarian and development leader\".",

    "summary": "What could happen when Sir Keir Starmer visits the White House next Thursday?",
    "story": [
      "The next seven days really matter.",
      "\"The most negative thing would be a gruesome sell-out of Ukraine and we get slapped with tariffs,\" says a source involved in working out the best moves for No 10 as Sir Keir Starmer prepares to head to the White House to meet President Donald Trump.",
      "\"The better version is Trump returns to a bit more robust behaviour with the Russians, Britain gets patted on the back for making a move on defence spending and we avoid all the tariffs \u2013 a Trumpportunity.\"",
      "With Whitehall-style understatement, a different official predicts the PM \"has a really big decision to make about what to say to Trump in private\" \u2013 remember, just this week the president accused Sir Keir of \"doing nothing\" to try and stop the Ukraine conflict.",
      "So what options does Sir Keir have?",
      "A decision on defence spending is the big focus. The drumbeat of demands for the UK to boost spending was getting louder even before Trump moved into the White House.",
      "The government hasn't yet committed to when it will hit its target of spending 2.5% of the size of the economy, let alone if it will go a lot further as military leaders, Nato, Trump, and now even the Liberal Democrats are calling for.",
      "A senior government source says the PM is \"pushing the system\" to get to a stronger position on spending, but in recent days it's suggested the Treasury's still asking about the spending consequences. The dilemma is obvious: public money is tight as a drum, and Downing Street doesn't want to take cash from the NHS or other priorities at home.",
      "But a Treasury source acknowledged \"the world is changing\", and sources describe a \"phenomenal\" opportunity to take the European lead and please Trump with cash promises.",
      "A Trump backer warns against anything lukewarm: \"a proper commitment, not just a road map, or a path \u2013 be more specific, say 'Yes we'll hit it by this date,' and throw in some more\".",
      "\"He's going to have to do 3% [or more],\" one Whitehall insider suggests, \"so the choice is, does it do it now, for the right reasons, make a virtue of it, or does he end up getting browbeaten into it by Trump?\"",
      "I'm told that there is no final decision on what to say \u2013 and crucial meetings are planned between ministers, officials and military advisers at the start of next week to decide.",
      "What next for Ukraine?",
      "Ukraine is, clearly, central to the talks, and the question looms over what happens if Trump gets the ceasefire he wants.",
      "In the last week UK and French military planners have been working on options, all of which are at an early stage. One idea is  that a \"reassurance\" force of perhaps 20,000 or 30,000 UK and French troops could be deployed after a ceasefire around Ukrainian infrastructure, ports, nuclear power stations, even in some of the key cities.",
      "The model of a joint UK-French force already exists \u2013 the Combined Joint Expeditionary Force, a deal signed by the two countries several years ago. Another source suggests the best option for a monitoring force would be under the badge of the UN, if the Russians could be persuaded to accept that, with Ukraine's allies stepping up training and support for Ukraine inside the country.",
      "These options in broad terms, given a public airing by Sir Keir Starmer this week, aren't new, one adviser says, and have been suggested in private for a long time. Another source in government says the plan for 30,000 troops is \"not yet an actual thing\" \u2013 there's no detailed blueprint.",
      "But European leaders know they have to prove to Trump they are serious about contributing to a lasting peace, rather than leaving it to the United States.",
      "I'm told when French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump and Zelensky met in the margins of the fanciest international get together of recent times, the reopening of Notre Dame, Trump said that he'd get Russia to the table, Zelensky said that he would go to the negotiating table, and Macron promised he'd make sure Europe played a real part.",
      "It's worth noting that Trump said \"that's great, I'm all for that\", when asked earlier this week about the idea of European troops being deployed was mentioned.",
      "'We know who the goodies are'",
      "But as the talks approach, uncertainty about the US' true view is the fundamental, and some in government are nervous. Does Trump really believe that Zelensky is a \"dictator\" \u2013 or, as Trump's Ukraine envoy suggested yesterday, a \"courageous leader\"? Does Trump want the \"sugar rush\" of a quick deal that might favour Russia asks one former defence minister, more than achieving something long-term?",
      "A Trump backer said it is \"obscene\" to suggest that the president is a Putin sympathiser, pointing to his previous decisions to approve the sale of Javelin missiles to Ukraine.",
      "In No 10, \"we don't think there is a cut and run\", a senior source says. In private, US figures have reassured the UK that the United States is not about to turn its back on Ukraine.",
      "Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.",
      "In Brussels last week the US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth made headlines when he signalled the US would reduce its support for Ukraine \u2013  but a source in the room during the private talks after his controversial public remarks told me Hegseth said \"we know who the goodies are and who the baddies are\".",
      "There is though anxiety in government that Trump might be tempted to just force a deal to end the conflict, then Russia could \"just reload then go again\", according to another source.",
      "But there is a shaky faith \u2013 perhaps more accurately a fervent hope \u2013 that whatever the president's public remarks, that the US will try to involve Ukraine in the talks and does think the peace has to be a deal that lasts, with a force that looks credible, potentially with some form of American support.",
      "Emmanuel Macron, and then Sir Keir, will try to persuade Trump that a deal with security guarantees for Ukraine is the only true victory for the White House.",
      "Remember why all this matters so much back home. What Trump decides to do about the conflict has an effect not just on the security of our continent but our prosperity too: the Ukraine war has shaken our economy through the effect it's had on energy bills.",
      "There is also, of course, the simple and awful human cost of lives lost \u2013 Ukrainians and Russians \u2013 hundreds of thousands of casualties, with terrible suffering on the edge of Europe. Thousands of families in the UK opened their homes to Ukrainian refugees at the start of the war.",
      "The former defence minister notes: \"Sometimes when there is all this noise, we have to still find a way to keep supporting them. Who knows when it is going to end, the only thing we know is they are still being attacked.\"",
      "As the war's three-year anniversary approaches you can expect to hear this message from government too.",
      "And of course what happens matters enormously to the fortunes of this government. Sir Keir might have a huge majority, but he has battled to retain political momentum and his popularity has plunged since taking office.",
      "He may even want to bring other things to the famous Resolute desk beyond defence and Ukraine: Trump is, a senior government source says, notoriously unpredictable and may swerve off topic.",
      "A source familiar with Trump's thinking suggests the PM could turn Trump's freewheeling style to his advantage by putting other issues on the table \u2013 an offer to buy more American Liquid Natural Gas perhaps, revising the deal on the Chagos Islands, a tougher position on China, or a discussion about tech regulation perhaps, with Apple in a huff with the UK government.",
      "Starmer might not have chosen \u2013 few prime ministers do \u2013 to have to confront complicated foreign policy tangles early in office. But one Whitehall observer notes \"kudos to No 10 for handling Trump\" so far, not reacting to his every outburst.",
      "And Brexit, ironically, helps Sir Keir the Remainer carve out a separate role to the rest of Europe.",
      "Working with Trump might be like handling a live firework. But the international jeopardy does present opportunities for the PM, as one former senior official suggests.",
      "If \"you don't have much of a compelling agenda, your social policy is looking hard, your economic policy is looking hard, you can see why he might think,  do you know, the air miles are starting to look pretty attractive\".",

    "story": [
      "Nearly 2,000 years after a young man died in the Vesuvius volcanic eruption, scientists have discovered that his brain was preserved when it turned to glass in an extremely hot cloud of ash.",
      "Researchers found the glass in 2020 and speculated that it was a fossilised brain but did not know how it had formed.",
      "The pea-sized chunks of black glass were found inside the skull of the victim, aged about 20, who died when the volcano erupted in 79 AD near modern-day Naples.",
      "Scientists now believe a cloud of ash as hot as 510C enveloped the brain then very quickly cooled down, transforming the organ into glass.",
      "It is the only known case of human tissue - or any organic material - turning to glass naturally.",
      "\"We believe that the very specific conditions that we have reconstructed for the vitrification [the process of something turning into glass] of the brain make it very difficult for there to be other similar remains, although it is not impossible,\" Prof Guido Giordano from Universit\u00e0 Roma Tre told BBC News.",
      "\"This is a unique finding,\" he said.",
      "The brain belonged to a man killed in his bed inside a building called the Collegium on the main street of the Roman city Herculaneum.",
      "The fragments of glass found by the scientists range from 1-2 cm to just few millimetres in size.",
      "The massive eruption of Vesuvius engulfed Herculaneum and nearby Pompeii where up to 20,000 people lived. The remains of about 1,500 people have been found.",
      "Scientists now think the hot ash cloud descended from Vesuvius first, probably causing most of the deaths.",
      "A fast-moving current of hot gas and volcanic matter, also called a pyroclastic flow, followed, burying the area.",
      "Experts believe the ash cloud turned the man's brain into glass because the pyroclastic flow would not have reached high enough temperatures or cooled quickly enough.",
      "The process of glass formation requires very specific temperature conditions and rarely occurs naturally.",
      "For a substance to turn to glass, there must be a huge temperature difference between the substance and its surrounding.",
      "Its liquid form has to cool fast enough not to crystallise when it becomes solid, and it must be at a much higher temperature than its surroundings.",
      "The team used imaging with x-rays and electron microscopy to conclude that the brain must have been heated to at least 510C before cooling rapidly.",
      "No other parts of the man's body are believed to have turned to glass.",
      "Only material containing some liquid can turn to glass, meaning that the bones could not have vitrified.",
      "Other soft tissues, like organs, were likely destroyed by the heat before they could cool down enough to turn to glass.",
      "The scientists believe the skull gave some protection to the brain.",

    "summary": "The energy giant has announced its strategy after rivals also rowed back on green energy plans.",
    "story": [
      "BP has announced it will cut its renewable energy investments and instead focus on increasing oil and gas production.",
      "The energy giant revealed the shift in strategy on Wednesday following pressure from some investors unhappy its profits and share price have been lower than its rivals.",
      "BP said it would increase its investments in oil and gas by about 20% to $10bn (\u00a37.9bn) a year, while decreasing previously planned funding for renewables by more than $5bn (\u00a33.9bn).",
      "The move comes as rivals Shell and Norwegian company Equinor have also scaled back plans to invest in green energy and US President Donald Trump's \"drill baby drill\" comments have encouraged investment in fossil fuels.",
      "Murray Auchincloss, BP's chief executive, said the energy giant had gone \"too far, too fast\" in the transition away from fossil fuels, and that its faith in green energy was \"misplaced\".",
      "He said BP would be \"very selective\" in investing in businesses working on the energy transition to renewables going forward, with funding reduced to between $1.5bn and $2bn per year.",
      "He said this was part of a strategy \"reset\" by the company to focus on boosting returns for shareholders.",
      "Helge Lund, chair of BP, added that the new direction of the firm had \"cash flow growth\" at its heart.",
      "Shares in the company climbed before Tuesday's announcement but fell shortly after.",
      "BP is one of several firms in the energy industry to return focus on oil and gas production, which has seen an increase in profits as prices have increased following lows seen during the Covid pandemic.",
      "The firm said it plans to increase its production to between 2.3 million and 2.5 million barrels of oil per day by 2030, with hopes of \"major\" oil and gas projects starting by the end of 2027.",
      "BP shareholders want it to make money, not climate policy",
      "BP set to scale back green investments as profits drop sharply",
      "BP to cut 4,700 jobs to reduce costs",
      "'Science hasn't changed'",
      "Mr Auchincloss is under pressure to boost profits from some shareholders, including the influential activist group Elliot Management, which took a near \u00a34bn stake in the \u00a370bn company to push for more investment in oil and gas.",
      "In 2024, BP's net income fell to $8.9bn (\u00a37.2bn), down from $13.8bn the previous year.",
      "However, some other shareholders, as well as environmental groups have voiced concerns over switching focus back to fossil fuel production.",
      "Last week, a group of 48 investors called on the company to allow them a vote on any potential plans to move away from commitments to renewables.",
      "The environmental group Greenpeace UK said the latest move was \"proof that fossil fuel companies can't or won't be part of climate crisis solutions\".",
      "Alexander Kirk from Global Witness added BP \"cannot be trusted to deliver the clean energy transition\", adding that it was \"focusing on short-term profits to shareholders while energy prices are high, with the rest of the world picking up the tab from its climate-wrecking products\".",
      "Global Witness drove a lorry around central London with messages criticising BP's decision.",
      "Sir Ian Cheshire, who has held many executive roles at companies such as B&Q owner Kingfisher and Barclays bank, questioned whether BP's latest move would work.",
      "\"I do wonder whether this sort of decision will look right in 10 years,\" he told the BBC's Today programme.",
      "\"The climate change issue has not gone away, the science hasn't changed,\" he said.",
      "'Not just down to one company'",
      "Challenged on the reduced commitment to investing in renewable energy, Louise Kingham, BP's senior vice president for Europe and the UK, said none of the changes announced on Tuesday would alter the UK's green energy plans, which include three wind farms and carbon capture projects.",
      "She said the shift to renewable energy sources had slowed but that BP's ambition had \"not changed\" to become a net-zero company.",
      "According to the International Energy Agency, no new fossil fuel projects are compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5C compared to pre-industrial levels,",
      "\"We just have to do this transition more smartly and more efficiently and try to get those returns for our owners because they are helping us to do that. If we don't generate the returns, we can't invest and do more,\" Ms Kingham told the Scottish Affairs committee of MPs.",
      "\"It's going to take everybody to move in concert to make this happen. It's not just the decision of one company and what it chooses to do.\"",
      "The decrease in renewables will cover biogas, biofuels and electric vehicle charging projects, while BP will look to \"capital-light partnerships\" in other green energy such as wind and solar.",
      "BP has already placed its offshore wind business in a joint venture with Japanese company Jera and is looking to find a partner to do the same with its solar business.",
      "Five years ago, BP set some of the most ambitious targets among large oil companies to cut production of oil and gas by 40% by 2030, while significantly ramping up investment in renewables.",
      "But in 2023, the company lowered this oil and gas reduction target to 25%.",
      "In the five years since former chief executive Bernard Looney first unveiled his strategy, shareholders have received total returns including dividends of 36%.",
      "In contrast, shareholders in rivals Shell and Exxon have seen returns of 82% and 160% respectively.",
      "BP's under performance has prompted speculation that it may be a takeover target or may consider moving its main stock market listing to the US where oil and gas companies command higher valuations.",

    "story": [
      "Skywatchers are in for a treat this week as seven planets - Mars, Jupiter, Uranus, Venus, Neptune, Mercury, and Saturn will all be briefly visible in the evening sky.",
      "This phenomenon, known as a 'planetary parade' is a rare sight, and it will be the last time seven planets can be seen simultaneously so well until 2040.",
      "The best chance to see as many planets as possible will be just after sunset on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.",
      "Four of the planets - Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, and Mars - will be visible to the naked eye. Saturn will be harder to see because it will be low in the horizon. You will need a telescope to spot the other two planets - Uranus and Neptune.",
      "A good view of the horizon and clear skies will offer the best chance of spotting them all. However, the window to see all seven planets will be very brief.",
      "Dr Edward Bloomer, astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich said: \"There's a rare opportunity to have seven planets in essentially a convenient place for you to look for them.\"",
      "As the sun sets, Saturn and Mercury will also be setting, making them particularly difficult to see.",
      "\"You really only have a few minutes after sunset to catch them before they drop below the horizon. After that, you'll still be able to see Venus, Jupiter, and Mars clearly for a much longer time,\" Dr Bloomer added.",
      "The planets in our solar system orbit the Sun within roughly the same flat plane as the Earth.",
      "As they orbit at different speeds and distances from the Sun, there are moments when they appear to line up from Earth's perspective creating a spectacular visual display, although the planets remain separated by vast distances in space.",
      "Send us your pictures of the planetary parade.",
      "Send us your pictures of the planetary parade.",

      "\"Uranus is technically visible with the naked eye, but you'd need perfect eyesight and ideal conditions,\" Dr Bloomer explains.",
      "To improve your chances of seeing as many planets as possible, Dr Bloomer advises heading to a location with a clear view of the horizon and minimal light pollution.",
      "\"If you just pop out of your kitchen into your back garden, you will take time to adjust to the light levels. Give it a bit of time - your eyes take about half an hour to fully adjust,\" said Dr Bloomer.",
      "\"Avoid looking at your phone, get comfortable, and ensure you have an unobstructed view of the horizon.\"",
      "While this is an exciting opportunity, Dr Bloomer encourages people to make a habit of gazing at the night sky.",
      "\"See how things change,\" he said, adding that observing the heavens is \"a chance to witness the ongoing mechanics of the solar system at work.\"",
      "Will the skies be clear enough to see them all this week?",
      "On Wednesday night, skies will be generally cloudier with showery rain at times.",
      "By Thursday, expect a drier, clearer view of the night sky. Earlier in the evening is best, as mist and fog patches may develop further into the night.",
      "For Friday high pressure is expected to dominate, keeping dry conditions for most with clear spells. Soon after sunset is most favoured as mist and fog patches may develop later.",

    "published": "Sat, 22 Feb 2025 21:33:02 GMT",
    "summary": "Since a potentially hazardous asteroid was detected in December, tens of others objects have come close to Earth.",
    "story": [
      "A large asteroid known as 2024 YR4 has grabbed headlines this week as scientists first raised its chances of hitting earth, then lowered them.",
      "The latest estimate says the object has a 0.28% chance of hitting Earth in 2032, significantly lower than the 3.1% chance earlier in the week.",
      "Scientists say it is now more likely to smash into the Moon, with Nasa estimating the probability of that happening at 1%.",
      "But in the time since 2024 YR4 was first spotted through a telescope in the desert in Chile two months ago, tens of other objects have passed closer to Earth than the Moon, which in astronomical terms sounds like a near miss.",
      "It is likely that others, albeit much smaller, have hit us or burned up in the atmosphere but gone unnoticed.",
      "This is the story of the asteroids that you never hear about \u2013 the fly-bys, the near-misses and the direct hits.",
      "The vast majority are harmless. But some carry the most valuable clues for unlocking mysteries in our universe, information we are desperate to get our hands on.",
      "Asteroids, also sometimes called minor planets, are rocky pieces left over from the formation of our solar system about 4.6 billion years ago.",
      "Rocks routinely orbit close to Earth, pushed by the gravity of other planets.",
      "For most of human history, it has been impossible to know how close we have come to being struck by a large asteroid.",
      "Serious monitoring of objects near Earth only started in the late 20th century, explains Professor Mark Boslough from the University of New Mexico. \"Before that we were blissfully oblivious to them,\" he says.",
      "We now know that quite large objects - 40m across or more - pass between Earth and the Moon several times a year. That's the same size of asteroid that exploded over Siberia in 1908 injuring people and damaging buildings over 200 square miles.",
      "The most serious near-miss, and the closest comparison with YR4, was an asteroid called Apophis which was first spotted in 2004 and measured 375 meters across, or around the size of a cruise ship.",
      "Professor Patrick Michel from French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) tracked Apophis and recalls it was considered the most hazardous asteroid ever detected.",
      "It took until 2013 to get enough observations to understand that it was not going to hit Earth.",
      "But he says there was one big difference with YR4. \"We didn't know what to do. We discovered something, we determined an impact probability, and then thought, who do we call?\" he says. Scientists and governments had no idea how to respond, he says.",
      "A large asteroid strike could be catastrophic if it hits an area where humans live.",
      "We don't know exactly how big YR4 is yet, but if it is at the top end of estimates, about 90m across, it would likely remain substantially intact rather than break up as it enters the Earth's atmosphere.",
      "\"The surviving asteroid mass could create a crater. Structures in the immediate vicinity would likely be destroyed and people within the local region (dozens of kilometers) would be at risk of serious injury,\" explains Professor Kathryn Kunamoto from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Some people could die.",
      "But since Apophis, there have been huge advances in what is called planetary defence.",
      "Prof Michel is part of the international Space Mission Planning Advisory Group.",
      "Its delegates advise governments on how to respond to an asteroid threat and run rehearsal exercise for direct hits. There is one going on right now.",
      "If the asteroid was on course for a town or city, Dr Boslough compares the response to preparations made for a major hurricane, including evacuations and measures to protect infrastructure.",
      "The Space Mission Planning Advisory Group will meet again in April to decide what to do about YR4.",
      "By then most scientists expect the risk to have almost entirely gone, as their calculations of its trajectory become more precise.",
      "We do have options beyond \"taking a hit\", as Dr Kumamoto puts it.",
      "Nasa and the European Space Agency have developed technologies to nudge dangerous asteroids off course.",
      "Nasa's Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) successfully slammed a spacecraft into the asteroid Dimorphos to change its path.",
      "However scientists are sceptical if that would work in the case of YR4 due to uncertainty about what it is made of and the short window of time to successfully deflect it.",
      "And what about the asteroids that do hit Earth? An awkward truth for scientists is that a direct strike on land far from humans is the ideal scenario for asteroids.",
      "That gives them actual pieces from distant objects within of our solar system, as well as insights into Earth's impact history.",
      "Nearly 50,000 asteroids have been found in Antarctica. The most famous, called ALH 84001, is believed to have originated on Mars and contains minerals with vital evidence about the planet's history, suggesting it was warm and had water on its surface billions of years ago.",
      "In 2023 scientists detected an asteroid called 33 Polyhymnia which could have an element denser than anything found on Earth.",
      "This superheavy element would be something entirely new to our planet. 33 Polyhymnia is at least 170 million kilometers away, but it's an indication of the incredible potential of asteroids for our understanding of science.",
      "Now that the chances are higher that YR4 will hit the Moon, some scientists are getting excited about that.",
      "An impact could give real-world answers to questions they have only been able to simulate using computers.",
      "\"To have even one data point of a real example would be incredibly powerful,\" says Prof Gareth Collins from Imperial College London.",
      "\"How much material comes out when the asteroid hits? How fast does it go? How far does that travel?\" he asks.",
      "It would help them test the scenarios they have modelled about asteroid impacts on Earth, helping create better predictions.",
      "YR4 has reminded us that we live on a planet vulnerable to collisions with something the solar system is full of \u2013 rocks.",
      "Scientists warn against complacency, saying it is a matter of when, not if, a large asteroid will threaten human life on Earth, although most expect that to be in the coming centuries rather than decades.",
      "In the meantime, our ability to monitor space keeps improving. Later this year the largest digital camera ever built will begin working at the Vera Rubin Observatory in Chile, able to capture the night sky in incredible detail.",

    "story": [
      "Four in five cars should be electric and half of homes should have heat pumps within 15 years, say the government's independent climate advisers.",
      "By law the UK must reach \"net zero\" - no longer adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere - by 2050.",
      "UK greenhouse gas emissions have more than halved since 1990, largely thanks to less electricity coming from fossil fuels and more from renewables. But the Climate Change Committee (CCC) says that to reach the 2050 target we will also need to change how we drive and heat our homes.",
      "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said the government would consider the advice and respond in due course.",
      "\"We owe it to current generations to seize the opportunities for energy security and lower bills, and we owe it to future generations to tackle the existential climate crisis,\" he said.",
      "Under UK law, the CCC provides independent advice on how much the UK should emit over five-year periods, known as \"carbon budgets\", and how it might get there.",
      "Each carbon budget is a stepping stone to net zero by 2050. The latest advice is that by 2040, emissions should be 13% of their 1990 levels, for the UK to stay on track.",
      "The CCC advice is not policy, but the government has historically accepted it. If it does, the target will become legally binding, but government will still decide how to achieve it.",
      "Meeting these long-term goals will mean significant changes in the years ahead. One-third of emissions cuts between now and 2040 need to come from households making low-carbon choices, the CCC says.",
      "This will mainly be through switching from petrol and diesel cars to electric vehicles and from fossil fuel boilers to heat pumps, making use of growing supplies of clean electricity. Smaller contributions will come from other choices, such as eating less meat and dairy.",
      "As the graph below shows, these changes are ambitious. But they are deliverable, argues the CCC, without people having to scrap their existing boiler or car early.",
      "Other emerging technologies, like mobile phones and internet connections, have achieved similar rates of increases previously.",
      "\"For electric vehicles, the market is already pretty much at parity with internal combustion engine vehicles, so we think just naturally that will start to be a choice people make,\" Emma Pinchbeck, chief executive of the CCC, told the BBC's Today programme.",
      "\"For heat pumps, we're saying it's different, the costs are still higher than a fossil fuel boiler and the government will need to act to help people get those technologies.",
      "\"But the rollout rate that we've looked at is similar to what happened to our neighbours in Ireland but also to much colder countries in Europe.\"",
      "Emissions cuts will be needed in other areas too, such as farming and flying, two of the hardest sectors to decarbonise.",
      "The CCC no longer directly advises against net airport expansion, which it has previously. But it warns the costs of decarbonising aviation will need to be picked up by airlines, which will probably drive up ticket prices.",
      "It says we will need to eat less meat and dairy too. In the CCC's pathway, sheep and cattle numbers fall by 27% by 2040, and the area covered by woodland rises from 13% to 16%.",
      "Cost of net zero",
      "The costs of tackling climate change have become highly politicised in recent years.",
      "The CCC estimates most of the expense will be borne by the private sector and calculates the savings from moving to more efficient technologies should outweigh costs by the early 2040s.",
      "\"We are crystal clear in this analysis, in this carbon budget, for the first time we start to see the economy making savings from this investment, and they make savings over and above what we would do if we stay dependent on fossil fuels,\" Ms Pinchbeck told BBC News.",
      "This should improve energy security and filter down to lower bills in the long term, the CCC argues, provided the government acts to make electricity cheaper.",
      "It advises removing policy costs \u2013 funding for social and environmental schemes \u2013 from electricity bills. That would cut them by about 19% based on expected 2025 prices, the CCC says, making it more cost-effective for people to switch to electric vehicles or heat pumps.",
      "These costs could instead sit on gas bills or general taxation.",
      "\"Regardless of what you think about climate change, what we are laying out today is a massive industrial revolution,\" said Ms Pinchbeck.",
      "\"It will save the economy money by 2040, it saves people money on their energy bills, it saves people money on their driving costs, but all of that is underpinned by a cheaper electricity price.\"",

    "story": [
      "BP has announced it will cut its renewable energy investments and instead focus on increasing oil and gas production.",
      "The energy giant revealed the shift in strategy on Wednesday following pressure from some investors unhappy its profits and share price have been lower than its rivals.",
      "BP said it would increase its investments in oil and gas by about 20% to $10bn (\u00a37.9bn) a year, while decreasing previously planned funding for renewables by more than $5bn (\u00a33.9bn).",
      "The move comes as rivals Shell and Norwegian company Equinor have also scaled back plans to invest in green energy and US President Donald Trump's \"drill baby drill\" comments have encouraged investment in fossil fuels.",
      "Murray Auchincloss, BP's chief executive, said the energy giant had gone \"too far, too fast\" in the transition away from fossil fuels, and that its faith in green energy was \"misplaced\".",
      "He said BP would be \"very selective\" in investing in businesses working on the energy transition to renewables going forward, with funding reduced to between $1.5bn and $2bn per year.",
      "He said this was part of a strategy \"reset\" by the company to focus on boosting returns for shareholders.",
      "Helge Lund, chair of BP, added that the new direction of the firm had \"cash flow growth\" at its heart.",
      "Shares in the company climbed before Tuesday's announcement but fell shortly after.",
      "BP is one of several firms in the energy industry to return focus on oil and gas production, which has seen an increase in profits as prices have increased following lows seen during the Covid pandemic.",
      "The firm said it plans to increase its production to between 2.3 million and 2.5 million barrels of oil per day by 2030, with hopes of \"major\" oil and gas projects starting by the end of 2027.",

      "In 2024, BP's net income fell to $8.9bn (\u00a37.2bn), down from $13.8bn the previous year.",
      "However, some other shareholders, as well as environmental groups have voiced concerns over switching focus back to fossil fuel production.",
      "Last week, a group of 48 investors called on the company to allow them a vote on any potential plans to move away from commitments to renewables.",
      "The environmental group Greenpeace UK said the latest move was \"proof that fossil fuel companies can't or won't be part of climate crisis solutions\".",
      "Alexander Kirk from Global Witness added BP \"cannot be trusted to deliver the clean energy transition\", adding that it was \"focusing on short-term profits to shareholders while energy prices are high, with the rest of the world picking up the tab from its climate-wrecking products\".",
      "Global Witness drove a lorry around central London with messages criticising BP's decision.",
      "Sir Ian Cheshire, who has held many executive roles at companies such as B&Q owner Kingfisher and Barclays bank, questioned whether BP's latest move would work.",
      "\"I do wonder whether this sort of decision will look right in 10 years,\" he told the BBC's Today programme.",
      "\"The climate change issue has not gone away, the science hasn't changed,\" he said.",
      "'Not just down to one company'",
      "Challenged on the reduced commitment to investing in renewable energy, Louise Kingham, BP's senior vice president for Europe and the UK, said none of the changes announced on Tuesday would alter the UK's green energy plans, which include three wind farms and carbon capture projects.",
      "She said the shift to renewable energy sources had slowed but that BP's ambition had \"not changed\" to become a net-zero company.",
      "According to the International Energy Agency, no new fossil fuel projects are compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5C compared to pre-industrial levels,",
      "\"We just have to do this transition more smartly and more efficiently and try to get those returns for our owners because they are helping us to do that. If we don't generate the returns, we can't invest and do more,\" Ms Kingham told the Scottish Affairs committee of MPs.",
      "\"It's going to take everybody to move in concert to make this happen. It's not just the decision of one company and what it chooses to do.\"",
      "The decrease in renewables will cover biogas, biofuels and electric vehicle charging projects, while BP will look to \"capital-light partnerships\" in other green energy such as wind and solar.",
      "BP has already placed its offshore wind business in a joint venture with Japanese company Jera and is looking to find a partner to do the same with its solar business.",
      "Five years ago, BP set some of the most ambitious targets among large oil companies to cut production of oil and gas by 40% by 2030, while significantly ramping up investment in renewables.",
      "But in 2023, the company lowered this oil and gas reduction target to 25%.",

      "Card-holding Liberals will now choose between former governor of the banks of Canada and England Mark Carney, former finance minister Chrystia Freeland, House government leader Karina Gould and businessman and former MP Frank Baylis.",
      "Whoever wins the vote on 9 March will become Canada's next prime minister and will lead the Liberals in the forthcoming general election, which must be held on or before 20 October of this year.",
      "A big focus of the debates has been how Canada should respond to US President Donald Trump, who has threatened steep tariffs on America's northern neighbour and has suggested that Canada become the \"51st state.\"",
      "Here are five big takeaways from the two Liberal leadership debates.",
      "The Trump Factor",
      "How Canada should respond to what many have dubbed an \"existential threat\" from US President Donald Trump has unsurprisingly dominated the agenda at both debates.",
      "Trump has said he plans to impose a 25% tariff on all Canadian exports, with the exception of energy that would be tariffed at a lower 10% - a move that economists say would be devastating for Canada while increasing prices for Americans.",
      "He has also repeatedly proposed that the US should annex Canada, which has been met with alarm and anger from large swathes of the Canadian population.",
      "Freeland, a former top minister who served during Trump's first term, positioned herself as an experienced negotiator who has fought - and won - against the US president and his previous tariffs.",
      "But Carney warned that the Trump of today was not the Trump of the past. \"He is more isolationist. He is more aggressive,\" Carney said. \"In the past he wanted our markets. Now he wants our country.\"",
      "Gould, the youngest candidate, suggested that Canada should \"put everything on the table\" to protect its sovereignty, and that the federal government should help businesses diversify their portfolios to depend less on the US.",
      "Baylis, meanwhile, said Canada needed to forge closer economic ties with the UK, New Zealand and Australia, saying all four were like-minded countries with shared values, culture, and government systems.",
      "How Canada can fix its economy",
      "Trump's threats are made more alarming by Canada's current economic situation.",
      "Canadians have voiced frustrations over the stubborn high cost of living.",
      "Carney - an economist by trade - promised a plan that would balance Canada's operational budget in three years and proposed that Canada rethink the way it spends its money.",
      "But he has also noted his support for key Liberal programmes, like affordable childcare and dental care.",
      "As the former finance minister, Freeland defended her track record, saying the country's finances were still \"very strong\". She added that Canada should capitalise on the surge of patriotism in the face of Trump's threats, using that momentum to support Canadian industries and promote job growth.",
      "Baylis drew on his expertise as a businessman to say that Canada should work on building its productivity.",
      "Gould, on the other hand, said the Liberal Party should be \"realistic with Canadians\" and that balancing the budget in three years was not possible without significant cuts, which she did not support. She said Canada should instead focus on \"modernising its social safety net\" to help those who are struggling.",
      "\"We are facing extreme threats from the US, so we have to be able to invest in our people and in our businesses to protect them,\" Gould said.",
      "Defeating Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre",
      "The four candidates were debating with each other but they often presented a united front against their shared opponent, Conservative party leader Pierre Poilievre, whose party is favoured in the polls as the most likely to form Canada's next government.",
      "Liberal leadership hopefuls threw several jabs at Poilievre throughout the debate. Gould called him \"our little version of Trump here at home\" while Freeland said Poilievre was looking to \"imitate\" Trump.",
      "Carney criticised Poilievre as \"irresponsible\" and added that Canada could \"not afford\" to have him as prime minister.",
      "Poilievre, who has enjoyed a sizable lead in the polls ahead of an unpopular Trudeau, has had to pivot his pitch to Canadians since Trudeau's resignation.",
      "His message changed from criticising the sitting prime minister for leading a \"broken\" Canada to putting \"Canada First\" in the face of threats from the US. He has also shifted his focus to attacking Carney, who is favoured to win the Liberal leadership race.",
      "Poilievre is still polling ahead nationally, but some polls suggest that the lead between him and the Liberals has shrunk since Trudeau's exit.",
      "Supporting Ukraine and Nato",
      "Responding to shifting US policy on the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, all four candidates affirmed their commitment to continuing Canada's support for Ukraine.",
      "All of them also backed the need for Canada to hit its 2% military spending target as set out in its commitments to the Nato alliance, though they disagreed on the timeline and how to get there.",
      "Freeland said Canada should hit the target by 2027, and should do so by investing in the \"next generation of warfare\". Baylis and Carney have said their plan would be for Canada to reach that target by 2030.",
      "Both Freeland and Carney said Canada needed to invest that money into Canadian military ventures instead of into the US.",
      "Freeland noted that Canada should reduce its reliance on the US, and should look to work with the EU and other Nato partners on security assurances.",
      "A rethink of the consumer tax on carbon",
      "A tax on carbon for consumers and businesses has been the cornerstone of the Trudeau government's policy on climate change.",
      "But that tax has proven to be unpopular with Canadians, forcing Carney and Freeland to promise that they would ditch the policy.",
      "Carney, a former UN special envoy on climate action and finance, has long been a proponent of the carbon tax. In the debates, however, he acknowledged the tax on consumers had become divisive, and said he would instead focus on taxing big polluters and growing clean energy projects in Canada.",
      "Freeland, who resigned from Trudeau's government because of disagreements with the prime minister on spending, said that history would judge his climate action favourably despite his policies' unpopularity. But she, too, vowed to scrap the carbon tax.",
      "\"Democracy is about listening to people, and Canadians were very clear with us that they did not think that policy worked for them,\" she said.",
      "Gould and Baylis, on the other hand, said they would keep some version of the consumer tax on carbon in place, saying that fighting climate change comes with a price.",

      "The firm has unveiled Ocelot a prototype chip built on \"cat qubit\" technology - an approach that derives its name from the famous \"Schr\u00f6dinger's cat\" thought experiment.",
      "The chip seeks to address one of the biggest stumbling blocks to the development of quantum computers - making them error free.",
      "Amazon says, taken alongside other recent breakthroughs in the industry, its work means useful quantum computers are likely to be with us sooner than previously thought.",
      "But how quickly these machines will be powerful enough to be practically useful for a range of commercial applications is a matter of debate among experts.",
      "Oskar Painter of Amazon Web Services (AWS) Center for Quantum Computing at the California Institute of Technology, where the work was carried out, told the BBC that recent progress meant an \"aggressive date\" of a decade was now \"looking more and more realistic\".",
      "\"Five years ago I would have said maybe 20 or 30 years\", he said but added \"this timeline's come in quite a bit.\"",
      "Ultimately AWS, which provides cloud computing services, would like to offer quantum computing services to its customers, but Mr Painter also said he believed the advanced machines could eventually help optimise the vast global logistics of Amazon's retail business.",
      "\"You know, a company like Amazon, you make a one percent improvement in that and you're talking large dollars right? Quantum computers could enable you to do that more effectively, more real time - and that's the real value there,\" he explained.",
      "What is a cat qubit?",
      "Quantum computers solve problems by exploiting the strange properties of matter and energy at very small scales, as described by the science of quantum physics.",
      "Quantum computers won't replace so-called \"classical\" computers, but promise to be able to solve problems even the most powerful modern computers cannot - yielding new discoveries such as better batteries and new medicines.",
      "But that potential is being held up by the problem of errors.",
      "Quantum computers are extremely sensitive to noise in their environment - vibrations, heat, electromagnetic interference from mobile phones and WIFI networks, or even cosmic rays and radiation from outer space can all cause them to make errors, which then need to be corrected.",
      "Cat qubits are one attempt at solving this problem by engineering error resistance into the design of the qubits it uses.",
      "Qubits are the fundamental elements of quantum computers, the equivalent of bits in the computers most of us use today.",
      "Cat qubits are named in honour of Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, whose cat-in-a-box question in 1935 helped illuminate some of the thinking behind quantum theory.",
      "Amazon believes the new chip, which has just five cat qubits out of a total of 14 key components, could reduce the costs of correcting quantum errors by up to 90%, compared to current approaches.",
      "The technology of cat qubits isn't exclusive to Amazon, a French company named Alice & Bob carried out pioneering work on the tech and continues to evolve the technology.",
      "Mazyar Mirrahimi director of research at the French national technology research institute, Inria said Ocelot was \"an important step forward towards hardware-efficient fault-tolerant quantum computation\".",
      "Amazon believes the new chip offers a path to scaling up to more powerful machines with this type of error proofing built in, but researchers admit there are many challenges ahead.",
      "Michael Cuthbert director of the UK's National Quantum Computing Centre welcomed the progress Amazon had made but told the BBC it remained to be seen the effect it would have on the speed with which the industry is able to develop really useful quantum computers:",
      "\"Error correction is a vital step necessary in the long-term development of quantum computing. It is the crucial step that turns quantum computing into a practical and commercial tool we can use to solve complex problems in chemistry, materials science, medicine, logistics and energy.\"",
      "\"Part of the challenge is how to scale the revolutionary technology efficiently \u2013 mechanisms that enable error correction without huge overheads in chip size, energy consumption and systems complexity are really welcome.\"",
      "Amazon researchers have published their findings in a research paper in the scientific journal Nature",
      "Pivot point",
      "Amazon joins Microsoft and Google in announcing a new experimental chip. But is this flurry of announcements the result of clever research or clever PR? Or is it  coincidence, the tech equivalent of the saying buses always come in threes?",
      "Heather West follows the quantum computing industry as a research manager for the International Data Corporation and was briefed on the new chip by Amazon in advance of publication.",
      "She describes Amazon's results as an \"advancement\" rather than a breakthrough.",
      "All three recent announcements have focused on reducing errors, and she tells me the industry is \"pivoting\" from a focus on the number of qubits to a focus the \"ability to use these these systems at scale to solve real world life problems. And by doing so we need to be able to solve the error correction within the quantum systems\".",
      "However Mr Painter agreed \"100%\" that it wouldn't be easy to scale up today's experimental systems.",

    "story": [
      "Technicolor, the visual effects (VFX) group which has worked on films ranging from Disney's 1940 classic Pinocchio to 2024 blockbuster Mufasa The Lion King, has collapsed into administration in the UK.",
      "The group owned several leading visual effects studios including MPC, Mikros Animation and The Mill, with operations in the US, UK, Canada and India.",
      "Technicolor's directors had been looking to sell the business, but were not able to find a buyer.",
      "Its administrators said \"the majority\" of the more than 440 people it employed in the UK have been made redundant. The appointment of administrators relates only to the UK arm of its business.",
      "\"The economic headwinds which are affecting companies right across the creative industries have proved too challenging to overcome, which has led to Technicolor's UK business being placed into administration today,\" the firm's joint administrator Nick Holloway said.",
      "Technicolor was founded in 1915 and worked on its first film in 1917. In its early days it worked on projects with major studios including Disney.",
      "It subsequently acquired major VFX studios including The Mill, which won an Oscar in 2001 for its work on Gladiator, and MPC, which recently delivered big budget remakes of Disney's The Lion King and Jungle Book.",
      "Recent projects include \"Kraven the Hunter,\" \"Young Woman and the Sea\" and \"Emilia Perez\" according to Variety.",
      "Mikros Animation projects include two recent Mutant Ninja Turtles titles and the Paw Patrol series of films.",
      "'Render in peace'",
      "Visual effects studios play a key role in film production.",
      "Most modern big-budget movies and television shows will rely heavily on visual effects to transport actors and audiences into outer space, the distant past or the deep sea.",
      "And the appearance and non-vocal performances of characters and creatures, fantastic and otherwise will often be partly or fully the creation of animators and other specialist staff.",
      "As well as purely animated films and TV, many live action releases are in large part the work of the employees of VFX studios.",
      "Many staff work film-to-film on fixed-term contracts, so redundancies may not reflect the total impact of the business' troubles on jobs.",
      "According to animation news publisher Cartoon Brew an email sent over the weekend by chief executive Caroline Parot said \"external headwinds\" had exacerbated problems caused by factors including post-covid recovery.",
      "She also said the US writers' strike which led to a slow-down in demand for VFX work causing \"severe\" pressure on cashflow.",
      "Those same issues will add to the anxiety of staff and may fear re-entering what has been a relatively lean jobs market for VFX professionals.",
      "\"Render in peace\" one self-described 13-year veteran of The Mill wrote on Reddit - a reference to the computationally intense process of producing final, film grade images, a process known as rendering."

      "\"Jack Ma's attendance, his seating in the front row, even though he did not speak, and his handshake with Xi are clear signs he has been rehabilitated,\" China analyst Bill Bishop wrote.",
      "Social media was abuzz with users praising Mr Ma for his return to the public spotlight.",
      "\"Congratulations [Jack] Ma for the safe landing,\" said one user on Chinese social media platform Weibo.",
      "\"The comeback of [Jack] Ma is a shot in the arm to the current Chinese economy,\" said another.",
      "It is unsurprising that observers have attached so much significance to an appearance by Mr Ma.",
      "Before his disappearance from public life in 2020 - following comments at a financial conference that China's state-owned banks had a \"pawn-shop mentality\" - Mr Ma was the poster boy for China's tech industry.",
      "An English teacher with no background in computing, Mr Ma co-founded Alibaba in his apartment more than two decades ago after convincing a group of friends to invest in his online marketplace.",
      "He went on to build one of China's largest tech conglomerates and become one of the country's richest men.",
      "That was before his \"pawn shop\" comment, when he also lamented the \"lack of innovation\" in the country's banks.",
      "It led to the cancellation of his $34.5bn (\u00a327.4bn) stock market flotation of  Ant Group, his financial technology giant.",
      "This was seen at the time as an attempt by Beijing to humble a company that had become too powerful, and a leader who had become too outspoken.",
      "Analysts agree that the fact he's back in the spotlight, at a symposium where Xi Jinping himself presided, is a very good sign for Mr Ma.",
      "Some caution, however, that the fact he was not among the speakers may show that he has not fully returned to the exalted status he once enjoyed.",
      "Also, the lack of coverage his attendance received in Chinese media outlets seems to confirm he has not been completely rehabilitated.",
      "Is the crackdown on the tech industry over?",
      "Xi Jinping told participants at the symposium that their companies needed to innovate, grow and remain confident despite China's economic challenges, which he described as \"temporary\" and \"localised\".",
      "He also said it was the \"right time for private enterprises and private entrepreneurs to fully display their talents\".",
      "This has been widely interpreted as the government telling private tech firms that they too are back in good graces.",
      "Mr Ma's downfall had preceded a broader crackdown on China's tech industry.",
      "Companies came to face much tighter enforcement of data security and competition rules, as well as state control over important digital assets.",
      "Other companies across the private sector, ranging from education to real estate, also ended up being targeted in what came to be known as the \"common prosperity\" campaign.",
      "The measures put in place by the common prosperity policies were seen by some as a way to rein in the billionaire owners of some of China's biggest companies, to instead give customers and workers more of a say in how firms operate and distribute their earnings.",
      "But as Beijing imposed tough new regulations, billions of dollars were wiped off the value of some of these companies - many of them tech firms - rattling international investors.",
      "This, along with a worsening global economy that was affected by the pandemic as well as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, has contributed to considerable changes in China's economic situation.",
      "Growth has slowed, jobs for the country's youth have become more scarce and, amid a property sector downturn, people are not spending enough.",
      "As rumours that Mr Ma would attend Monday's meeting began to spread, so did a glimmer of hope. Richard Windsor, director of technology at research firm Counterpoint, said Mr Ma's presence would be a sign that China's leadership \"had enough of stagnation and could be prepared to let the private sector have a much freer hand\".",
      "Aside from Mr Ma and Mr Liang, the list of guests also included key figures from companies such as telecommunications and smartphone firm Huawei, electric-vehicle (EV) giant BYD, and many others from across the tech and industrial sectors.",
      "\"The [guest] list showcased the importance of internet/tech/AI/EV sectors given their representation of innovation and achievement,\" said a note from market analysts at Citi.",
      "\"[It] likely indicates the importance of technology... and the contribution of private enterprises to the development and growth of China's economy.\"",
      "Those present at the meeting seemed to share that sentiment. Lei Jun, the chief executive of consumer electronics giant Xiaomi, told state media that he senses the president's \"care and support\" for businesses.",
      "Is it because of US sanctions?",
      "The symposium took place after the country experienced what some observers have described as a \"Sputnik moment\": the arrival of DeepSeek's disruptive R1 artificial intelligence (AI) model at the end of last month.",
      "Soon after its release, the Chinese-made AI chatbot rose through the ranks to become one of the most downloaded in the world. It also triggered a sudden sell-off of major US tech stocks, as fears mounted over America's leadership in the sector.",
      "Back in China, the app's global success has sparked a wave of national pride that has quickly spread to financial markets. Investment has been pouring into Chinese stocks - particularly those of tech companies - listed in Hong Kong and mainland China.",
      "Investment banking giant Goldman Sachs has also upgraded its outlook for Chinese stocks, saying rapid AI adoption could boost companies' revenues and attract as much as $200bn of investment.",
      "But the biggest significance of this innovation was that it came as a result of DeepSeek having to innovate due to a ban on the export of advanced chips and technology to China.",
      "Now, with Trump back in the White House and his fondness of trade tariffs, Mr Xi may have found it necessary to recalibrate his approach to China's entrepreneurs.",
      "Instead of a return to an era of unregulated growth, some analysts believe Monday's meeting signalled an attempt to steer investors and businesses toward Mr Xi's national priorities.",
      "The Chinese president has been increasingly emphasising policies that the government has referred to as \"high-quality development\" and \"new productive forces\".",
      "Such ideas have been used to reflect a switch from what were previously fast drivers of growth, such as property and infrastructure investment, towards high-end industries such as semiconductors, clean energy and AI.",
      "The goal is to achieve \"socialist modernisation\" by 2035 - higher living standards for everyone, and an economy driven by advanced manufacturing and less reliant on imports of foreign technology.",
      "Mr Xi knows that to get there he will need the private sector fully on board.",
      "\"Rather than marking the end of tech sector scrutiny, [Jack Ma's] reappearance suggests that Beijing is pivoting from crackdowns to controlled engagement,\" an associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney, Marina Zhang told the BBC.",
      "\"While the private sector remains a critical pillar of China's economic ambitions, it must align with national priorities - including self-reliance in key technologies and strategic industries.\""

      "A little over a year later, he joined a team at Microsoft's headquarters in Seattle, where he still works.",
      "Even though he misses the Portuguese laid-back approach to life, and the family-like team spirit of the work environments there, he does not regret, not for one second, his choice of pursuing an international career.",
      "Mr Dias's decision was made easier by all the financial impact of moving.",
      "The verdict of the spreadsheet was clear: staying in Portugal would be financially ruinous.",
      "\"I did simulations of how much money I would save a year in Portugal, and I quickly realised that I wouldn't be able to have a comfortable life financially, even if I got one of the most well-paying jobs available in engineering for my experience level,\" says.",
      "A two-year job experience in Portugal while Mr Dias was concluding his masters at Lisbon's Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico cemented his conviction: his yearly income amounted to \u20ac35,000 ($36,000; \u00a329,000).",
      "But his take home salary was much, much less.",
      "His income placed him in a tax bracket which meant up to 40% of this gross salary went to the state.",
      "\"Financially it was bad. It would be very hard to save money if I didn't live with my parents,\" he recalls.",
      "Moving to Ireland meant an immediate hike in his salary prospects, almost doubling to \u20ac60,000.",
      "The money is even better in the US, where he now earns upwards of $160,000 before a 20% income tax rate, much lower than at home.",
      "Mr Dias intends to return to Lisbon in two years' time with \"with many more savings\".",
      "Keeping skilled workers like Mr Dias in Portugal has been a concern for recent governments.",
      "In 2020, the administration led by the Socialist Party's Antonio Costa launched IRS Jovem, a programme of tax reductions for workers less than 30 years old and tiered by level of education.",
      "In 2022, 73,684 taxpayers benefitted from this incentive, according to official data.",
      "After a snap election in March, the new centre-right Portuguese government led by Luis Montenegro doubled down on the idea and expanded it from five to 10 years, and to all workers under 35 independently of their educational levels.",
      "The proposal, passed by the Portuguese parliament in late November, is due to benefit up to 400,000 workers, according to the Portuguese Ministry of Finance.",
      "But specialists say it likely won't be enough to keep the young from going abroad.",
      "\"It is unlikely that, on its own, the tax regime will make young workers remain in the country, whether because professional opportunities are more abundant in foreign countries, or due to the fact this tax benefit applies only to yearly incomes under \u20ac28,000,\" says S\u00e9rgio Vasques, professor of tax law at the Cat\u00f3lica Lisbon School of Law.",
      "He points out that the Portuguese government still takes more of the average worker's salary than most richer nations.",
      "Known as the tax wedge, the ratio between the amount of taxes paid by an average single worker without children and the corresponding total labour cost for the employer, stands at 42.3% in Portugal.",
      "That's the 8th highest among the 38 member countries of the OECD.",
      "\"This is a tax regime that is an enemy of qualified work and professional success. This regime will not solve this problem,\" adds Mr Vasques.",
      "Mr Vasques, also a former secretary of state for tax affairs in the early 2010s, adds: \"I also cannot imagine a young professional deciding to move to Portugal just because of an extra couple hundred euros at the end of the year.",
      "\"Not even a low-skilled worker will make a decision based on that. Portuguese food works probably better as an incentive to move here than that tax regime\".",
      "Rita de La Feria, chair of tax law at the University of Leeds, reminds that the exodus of young people isn't just a Portuguese problem, and that Europe is grappling with the challenges of young emigration.",
      "According to a study requested by the Portuguese Parliament, as of July, in the European Union Portugal, Poland and Croatia had special tax regimes based on the taxpayers' ages.",
      "\"The challenges are very obvious: worker mobility is higher. The problem is that the country spends very large amounts on training for them to leave for other countries as soon as they enter the workforce,\" she said.",
      "Ms de La Feria, who moved to the UK at a young age, told the BBC that when she left Portugal she did not intend to \"leave for good: many leave their countries of origin thinking they will come back at some point. But once they form a family, it's almost impossible to return.\"",
      "Antonio Almeida, a software engineer like Mr Dias, left Portugal during the pandemic in late 2020 for a job in Berlin, right after finishing his degree. He would change the German capital for Brussels two years later. All his work experience was done abroad.",
      "\"Back in 2020, we were offered monthly salaries of \u20ac1,300, gross, in Lisbon. Berlin offered me \u20ac4,200 for a junior role.\"",
      "Even with a 40% income tax rate in Germany, there was a considerable net gain. \"It wasn't a difficult decision,\" says Mr Almeida.",
      "Now in Belgium - where taxes are higher, he stresses - returning to his homeland isn't a priority. \"I think of returning eventually, mainly for family reasons.",
      "\"But at the moment my life standards are very high and I like the way of life of central Europe. And the main problem in Portugal is low salaries, not taxes.\"",
      "Mr Almeida does not consider the Portuguese tax changes as a major factor when thinking of the pros and cons of coming back home.",
      "\"Up until today I never thought about it.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:40:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Quantum computers will be able to crack existing encryption and threaten critical infrastructure.",
    "story": [
      "Twenty five years ago computer programmers were racing to fix the millennium bug amidst fears that it would cause banking systems to crash and planes to fall out of the sky.",
      "Much to everyone's relief the impact turned out to be minimal.",
      "Today, some fear there is a new critical threat to the world\u2019s digital infrastructure. But this time, we cannot predict exactly when it will move from theory to reality, while the ubiquity of digital technology means fixing the problem is even more complicated.",
      "That\u2019s because the arrival of quantum computing means that many of the encryption algorithms that underpin and secure our hyperconnected world will be trivially easy to crack.",
      "Quantum computing is radically different to the \u201cclassical\u201d computing used today. Instead of processing binary bits which exist in one of two states \u2013 one or zero, on or off \u2013 quantum computing uses qubits, which can exist in multiple states, or superpositions.",
      "\u201cThe reason why it's so powerful is because you're doing all those possible computations simultaneously,\u201d Prof Nishanth Sastry, director of research for computer science at the University of Surrey, explains. This means it's \u201cmuch, much more efficient, much, much more powerful.\u201d",
      "This means quantum systems offer the possibility of solving key problems that are beyond classical computers, is areas such as medical research and materials science, or cracking particularly complex mathematical problems.",
      "The problem is some of those same mathematical problems underpin the encryption algorithms that help to ensure trust, confidentiality and privacy across today\u2019s computer networks.",
      "Today\u2019s computers would take thousands, even millions of years, to crack current encryption standards, such as RSA. A suitably powerful quantum computer could, theoretically, do the job in minutes.",
      "This has implications for everything from electronic payments and ecommerce to satellite communications. \u201cAnything that's protected by something that's vulnerable becomes fair game for people that have access to quantum relevant computers,\u201d says Jon France, chief information security officer at non-profit cybersecurity organization ISC2.",
      "Quantum computers capable of breaking asymmetric encryption are thought to be years away.",
      "But progress is being made.",
      "In December, Google said its new quantum chip incorporates key \"breakthroughs\" and \"paves the way to a useful, large-scale quantum computer\".",
      "Some estimates say a quantum device capable of breaking current encryption would require 10,000 qubits, while others say millions would be needed. Today\u2019s systems have a few hundred at most.",
      "But businesses and governments face a problem right now, as attackers could harvest encrypted information and decrypt it later when they do gain access to suitably powerful devices.",
      "Greg Wetmore, vice president for software development at security firm Entrust, says if such devices could emerge in the next decade, technology leaders need to ask, \u201cWhat data in your organization is valuable for that period of time?\u201d",
      "That could be national security information, personal data, strategic plans, and intellectual property and secrets - think of a soft drink company\u2019s \u201csecret\u201d formula or the precise balance of herbs and spices in a fast food recipe.",
      "Mr France adds, if quantum computing becomes widespread, the threat becomes more immediate with the encryption that protects our daily banking transactions, for example, potentially trivial to break.",
      "The good news is that researchers and the technology industry have been working on solutions to the problem. In August, the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the US released three post quantum encryption standards.",
      "The agency said these would \u201csecure a wide range of electronic information, from confidential email messages to e-commerce transactions that propel the modern economy.\u201d It is encouraging computer system administrators to transition to the new standards as soon as possible, and said a further 18 algorithms are being evaluated as backup standards.",
      "The problem is this means a massive upgrade process touching virtually all our technology infrastructure.",
      "\u201cIf you think about the number of things out there with asymmetric encryption in them, it's billions of things. We're facing a really big change problem,\u201d says Mr France.",
      "Some digital infrastructure will be relatively easy to upgrade. Your browser, for example, will simply receive an update from the vendor says Mr France. \u201cThe challenge really comes in discrete devices and the internet of things (IOT),\u201d he continues.",
      "These might be hard to track down, and geographically inaccessible. Some equipment \u2013 legacy devices in critical national infrastructure such as water systems, for example \u2013 might not be powerful enough to handle the new encryption standards.",
      "Mr Wetmore says the industry has managed encryption transitions in the past, but \u201cIt's the sharper discontinuity that makes this threat more serious.\u201d",
      "So, it is trying to help customers build \u201ccrypto agility\u201d by setting out policies now and using automation to identify and manage their cryptographic assets. \u201cThat's the secret to making this transition an orderly one and not a chaotic one.\u201d",
      "And the challenge extends into space. Prof Sastry says many satellites \u2013 such as the Starlink network \u2013 should be relatively straightforward to upgrade, even if it means briefly taking an individual device offline temporarily.",
      "\u201cAt any given point in time, especially with the LEO (low earth orbit) satellites, you've got 10 to 20 satellites above your head,\u201d Prof Sastry says. \u201cSo, if one can't serve you, well so what? There are nine others that can serve you.\u201d",
      "More challenging, he says, are \u201cremote sensing\u201d satellites, which include those used for geographical or intelligence purposes. These carry a lot more compute power on board and typically include some sort of secure computing module. A hardware upgrade effectively means replacing the whole device. However, says Prof Sastry, this is now less of a problem thanks to more frequent and lower cost satellite launches.",
      "While the impact of the millennium bug might have been minimal in the first days of 2000, that's because an immense amount of work had gone into fixing it ahead of a known deadline, says Fran\u00e7ois Dupressoir, associate professor in cryptography at the University of Bristol.",
      "By contrast, he adds, that it is not possible to predict when current encryption will become vulnerable.",
      "\"With cryptography,\" says Mr Dupressoir \"If somebody breaks your system, you will only know once they've got your data.\"",

      "He said the movement - banned as a terrorist group in Turkey, the EU, UK and US - was formed primarily because \"the channels of democratic politics were closed\".",
      "However, Devlet Bahceli, backed by positive signals from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and other political parties, had created the right environment for the PKK to lay down its arms, he added.",
      "Bahceli has for years pushed for tough military action against the PKK, but last October he surprised colleagues by shaking hands with MPs from the Dem party in parliament. He then suggested Ocalan could be given parole if he gave up violence and dissolved his armed group.",

      "During the presidential campaign last year, Trump had threatened to hit imports from China with tariffs as high as 60%, and also floated an across-the-board tariff of at least 10%.",

      "\"Because of me, countries stay connected,\" Shuru Arendse, a cable jointer from South Africa who has been working on the ship for more than a decade, tells the BBC.",
      "\"IT people at home have work because I bring the main feed in,\" he says.",
      "\"You have heroes that save lives - I'm a hero because I save communication.\"",
      "His pride and passion reflect the sentiment of the skilled crew on the L\u00e9on Th\u00e9venin, which stands eight floors high and carries an assortment of equipment.",
      "The internet is a network of computers servers - to read this article it is likely that at least one of 600 fibre optic cables across the world collected the data to present it on your screen.",
      "Most of these servers are in data centres outside of Africa and the fibre optic cables run along the ocean floor linking them to coastal cities on the continent.",
      "Data travels through hair-thin fibreglass wires, often grouped in pairs and protected by different layers of plastic and copper depending on how close the cables are to the shore.",
      "\"As long as the servers aren't in the country, you need a connection. A cable runs from one country to the next, linking users to servers that store their data - whether it's accessing Facebook or any other online service,\" says Benjamin Smith, the L\u00e9on Th\u00e9venin's deputy chief of mission.",
      "Undersea fibre optic cables are designed to work for 25 years with minimal maintenance, but when they are damaged, it is usually due to human activity.",
      "\"The cable generally doesn't break on its own unless you're in an area where there are pretty high currents and very sharp rocks,\" says Charles Heald, who is in charge of the ship's remotely operated vehicle (ROV).",
      "\"But most of the time it's people anchoring where they shouldn't and fishing trawlers sometimes scrape along the seabed, so typically we would see scars from trawling.\"",
      "Mr Smith also says natural disasters cause damage to cables, especially in parts of the continent with extreme weather conditions. He gives an example of the seas off the coast of the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the Congo River empties into the Atlantic.",
      "\"In the Congo Canyon, where they have a lot of rainfall and low tide, it could create currents that damage the cable,\" he says.",
      "Deliberate sabotage is difficult to identify - but the L\u00e9on Th\u00e9venin crew say they not seen any obvious evidence of this themselves.",
      "A year ago, three critical cables in the Red Sea - Seacom, AAE-1 and EIG - were severed, reportedly by a ship's anchor, disrupting connectivity for millions across East Africa, including Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Mozambique.",
      "Just a month later, in March 2024, a separate set of breaks in the Wacs, Ace, Sat-3, and MainOne cables off the coast of West Africa caused severe internet blackouts across Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast and Liberia.",
      "Anything that required the internet to function felt the strain as repairs stretched on for weeks.",
      "Then in May, yet another setback: the Seacom and Eassy cables suffered damage off the coast of South Africa, hitting connectivity in multiple East African nations once again.",
      "Such faults are detected by testing electricity and signal strength transmitted through cables.",
      "\"There may be 3,000 volts in a cable and suddenly it drops to 50 volts, this means there's a problem,\" explains Loic Wallerand, the ship's chief of mission.",
      "There are local teams with the capacity to deal with faults in shallow waters, but if they are detected beyond a depth of 50m (164ft), the ship is called into action. Its crew can fix cables deeper than 5,000m below sea level.",
      "The repair witnessed by the BBC off Ghana took over a week to deal with, but most internet users did not notice as traffic was redirected to another cable.",
      "The nature of every repair depends on the part of the cable that is damaged.",
      "If the fibreglass at the core breaks, it means the data cannot travel along the network and needs to be sent to another cable.",
      "But some African countries have only one cable serving them. This means a cable damaged this way leaves the affected area without the internet.",
      "At other times, the protective layers of the fibre could be damaged, meaning data transmission still occurs, but with a lower efficiency. In both cases, the crew must find the exact location of the damage.",
      "In the case of broken fibreglass, a light signal is sent through the cable and through its point of reflection, the crew can determine where the break is.",
      "When the problem is with the cable's insulation - known as a \"shunt fault\" - it becomes more complicated and an electrical signal has to be sent along the cable to physically track where it is lost.",
      "After narrowing down the possible area for the fault, the operation moves to the ROV team.",
      "Built like a bulldozer, the ROV, weighing 9.5 tonnes, is lowered under water from the ship where it is guided down to the ocean floor.",
      "About five crew members work with a crane operator to deploy it - once it is released from its harness, called the umbilical cord, it floats gracefully.",
      "\"It doesn't sink,\" says Mr Heald, explaining how it uses four horizontal and vertical thrusters to move in any direction.",
      "The ROV's three cameras allow the team onboard to look for the precise location of faults as it moves to the ocean bed.",
      "Once found, the ROV cuts the affected part using its two arms, then ties it to a rope that is dragged back to the ship.",
      "Here the faulty section is isolated and replaced by splicing and joining it to a new cable - a process that looks like welding and which took 24 hours in the case of the operation witnessed by the BBC.",
      "Afterwards the cable was carefully lowered back to the ocean bed and then the ROV made one final journey to inspect that it was well placed and take coordinates so maps could be updated.",
      "When an alert is received about a damaged cable, the L\u00e9on Th\u00e9venin crew is ready to sail within 24 hours. However, their response time depends on several factors: the ship's location, the availability of spare cables and bureaucratic challenges.",
      "\"Permits can take weeks. Sometimes we sail to the affected country and wait offshore until the paperwork is sorted,\" Mr Wallerand says.",
      "On the average, the crew spends more than six months at sea every year.",
      "\"It's part of the job,\" says Captain Thomas Quehec.",
      "But talking to the crew members between tasks, it is hard to ignore their personal sacrifices.",
      "They are drawn from different backgrounds and nationalities: French, South African, Filipino, Malagasy and more.",
      "Adrian Morgan, the ship's chief steward from South Africa, has missed five consecutive wedding anniversaries.",
      "\"I wanted to quit. It was difficult to stay away from my family, but my wife encouraged me. I do it for them,\" he says.",
      "Another South African, maintenance fitter Noel Goeieman, is worried he may miss his son's wedding in a few weeks if the ship is called out to another mission.",
      "\"I've heard we might go to Durban [in South Africa]. My son is going to be very sad because he doesn't have a mum,\" says Mr Goeieman, who lost his wife three years ago.",
      "\"But I'm retiring in six months,\" he adds with a smile.",
      "Despite the emotional toll, there is camaraderie onboard.",
      "When off-duty, crew members are either playing video games in the lounge or sharing meals in the ship's mess hall.",
      "Their entry into the profession is as diverse as their background.",
      "While Mr Goeieman followed his father's footsteps, chief cook, South African Remario Smith, went to sea to escape a life of crime.",
      "\"I was involved in gangs when I was younger,\" Mr Smith says, \"My child was born when I turned 25, and I knew I had to change my life.\"",

      "Gaming companies have long had an issue with the second-hand market, and Mr Ishihara says it \"prevents new products from being sold\".",
      "\"When the second hand market becomes more valuable because of rarity, that is problematic because our business is affected.\"",
      "Fans have suggested The Pok\u00e9mon Company could produce a greater volume of hard-to-find or limited-run items but Mr Ishihara says it cannot do much to control the resale market.",

      "\"This trio settled in my heart, and I believe in all of our hearts,\" a woman called Neta told Channel 12. She said she had come from the north to pay her final respects to the Bibas family at the procession.",
      "\"I set out this morning at 04:30. I saw that I couldn't fall asleep, so I headed south. I wanted to come here to be as close as possible to the Gaza border communities, to be part of this farewell.\"",
      "Kfir, aged nine months, from Kibbutz Nir Oz, was the youngest of the 251 hostages snatched in the Hamas-led 7 October 2023 attacks. His brother, Ariel, was just four.",

      "There was deep anguish in Israel at the sight of Yarden Bibas, Shiri's husband, being released by Hamas at the start of this month without his immediate family.",

      "A haunting video of Shiri Bibas was filmed during the Hamas assault in southern Israel over 16 months ago.",
      "She appears terrified as she clutches onto her children surrounded by armed men before they are taken away from their home. Hours later, surveillance camera footage showed them in Khan Younis.",
      "In November 2023, Hamas said that an Israeli air strike in Gaza had killed Shiri and her sons. However, that was never verified by the Israeli military, which only expressed \"serious concern\" for them.",
      "As recently as last week, the Bibas family continued to hold out hope that the mother and her sons could be returned to Israel alive. They asked the public to \"refrain from eulogising our loved ones\" until a government post-mortem examination was completed.",

      "The Bibas boys were dead, their identities confirmed by DNA tests. The Israeli military spokesman said pathological exams and intelligence showed they had been murdered by their captors \"with their bare hands\".",
      "In addition, the remains of Shiri Bibas were not found in the coffin labelled with her name that had been handed to the International Committee of the Red Cross.",
      "This was said to contain the remains of a Palestinian woman from Gaza instead.  Hamas suggested that there may have been a mix up in the aftermath of the Israeli bombardment.",
      "Two days later, the Bibas family announced that Shiri's body had been returned to Israel and that she too had been murdered in captivity.",
      "The upsetting confusion over the bodies, along with the grim handover ceremony for the dead hostages staged by Hamas, were among what Israel said were truce violations, leading it to postpone the agreed release of some 600 Palestinian prisoners last Saturday.",
      "Hamas responded that this was a \"serious violation\" by Israel which threw the ceasefire process into a new crisis.",
      "Hours before the funeral, Israeli and Hamas officials said the crisis had been resolved by mediators, with the bodies of another four Israeli hostages now expected to be returned later on Wednesday or on Thursday at the same time as the Palestinian prisoners are freed.",
      "However, the fallout triggered fresh anxiety for the relatives of some 60 remaining hostages who remain unsure if their loved ones - or their bodies - will ever be returned from Gaza.",
      "A pledge by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to avenge the Bibas family's deaths only increased their relatives' worries.",
      "The family have criticised the Israeli media and Netanyahu for ignoring their wishes not to release more details of the circumstances of their loved ones' deaths.",
      "In a Facebook post on the eve of the funeral, Ofri Bibas Levy, the sister of Yarden Bibas, told the prime minister to \"shut up\" after he repeatedly described the murders. She said publication of the information was \"outright abuse of a family that has gone through 16 months of hell and still has the worst ahead\".",
      "The Bibas funeral came a day after that of Oded Lifshitz, who was also from Nir Oz and was 83 when he was abducted. His body was also returned last week. Netanyahu has said he was murdered in captivity by Palestinian Islamic Jihad.",
      "Shiri Bibas and her children were buried in a single casket next to the final resting place of her parents, Yossi and Margit Silberman, who lived in the same kibbutz and were killed there on 7 October.",
      "In total, some 1,200 people were killed on Israel's deadliest ever day. It ignited the deadliest ever war in Gaza, in which more than 48,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",
      "At the funeral, Ofri Bibas Levy called on Israeli officials seeking forgiveness for their failure to protect Shiri, Ariel and Kfir that day to instead hold themselves accountable.",

    "summary": "His comments came as shareholders rejected a call for the firm to consider ending its diversity practices.",
    "story": [
      "Apple boss Tim Cook has said his company may have to change its diversity practices as the US legal landscape shifts.",
      "His comments came just minutes after a majority of shareholders rejected a proposal calling on the tech giant to consider ending its diversity policies, such as the use of race and sex in hiring decisions.",
      "Apple had urged shareholders to vote against the measure, which the company had argued was  \"inappropriately\" trying \"to micromanage\" its business.",
      "The scrutiny of the firm comes as US President Donald Trump has called for an end to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes in the government and private sector, including at Apple.",
      "In a social media post the day after the meeting, Trump ramped up the pressure on the company.",
      "\"Apple should get rid of DEI rules, not just make adjustments to them,\" he wrote in a all-capital-letters post. \"DEI was a hoax that has been very bad for our country. DEI is gone!!!\"",
      "Trump's DEI orders have run into legal roadblocks, but many companies in the US, including big names such as Meta, Amazon and Goldman Sachs, have already ended or rolled back their own policies, citing legal risks.",
      "Apple's decision to fight the shareholder proposal had bucked that tide.",
      "Shareholder measures opposed by companies rarely succeed, so the outcome of Tuesday's vote was expected.",
      "It marked the second high-profile defeat of shareholder proposal targeting DEI, after a similar rejection at retailer Costco.",
      "However, despite the vote, Mr Cook on Tuesday acknowledged that the firm may have to alter some of its practices.",
      "\"As the legal landscape around this issue evolves, we may need to make some changes to comply, but our north star of dignity and respect for everyone and our work to that end will never waver,\" Mr Cook said during a question-and-answer session at the company's annual shareholder meeting.",
      "He noted that Apple did not use \"quotas\" for hiring - a practice that has come in for some of the fiercest criticism - while saying the firm's strength came from a culture where \"people with diverse backgrounds and perspectives come together\".",
      "\"We'll continue to work together to create a culture of belonging where everyone can do their best work,\" he added, saying the company would remain \"committed to the values that have always made us who we are\".",
      "The proposal targeting Apple's DEI policies was backed by the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank, which had also put forward the proposal at Costco.",
      "It argued that the existence of Apple's diversity and inclusion programmes exposed the firm to \"litigation, reputational and financial risks\", pointing to the wider corporate retreat and noting that recent lawsuits have made it easier for workers to sue over discrimination.",
      "Stefan Padfield of the organisation's Free Enterprise Project, who presented the proposal at Tuesday's meeting, said the risks to Apple had increased after the Trump administration recently ordered staff to investigate DEI in the private sector.",
      "\"The vibe shift is clear,\" he said. \"DEI is out and merit is in.\"",
      "Apple's decision to push back against the shareholder proposal, while simultaneously opening the door to changing its policy is an effort to satisfy both sides of the fight, said Angela Jackson, a senior advisor to the Project on Workforce at Harvard University and author of the forthcoming book, The Win-Win Workplace.",
      "But she warned that it left Apple \"playing defence\". She said she wanted to see the company lead by making a more robust business case for the programmes.",
      "\"They've made the right moves. The one step they could go further... is to really say, 'Yes it's our values, we believe it's the right thing to do, but it's also an economic imperative.\"",
      "The fight over DEI in the US has raised questions about whether such policies in other countries will face similar challenges.",
      "Catherine Howarth, chief executive of the responsible investment charity ShareAction, said she thought that Apple - a global, consumer-facing firm - had made the bet that the benefits of pushing back against the shareholder proposal outweighed the risks.",
      "\"It's not popular with consumers and it's not popular with employees to abandon what were supposedly your principles in this area until very recently,\" she said.",
      "\"They think it would go down very badly - and it would - with their global consumer base.\"",
      "Shareholders also rejected proposals that would have required Apple to report about its AI privacy practices, charitable giving and policies to combat child sex abuse.",
      "They backed the board members supported by the company, as well as its executive compensation, including a pay package for Mr Cook worth more than $74m."

      "A one-year prison sentence and a six-year ban on holding public office might seem like a heavy penalty for a politician.",
      "But the Bosnian-Serb leader Milorad Dodik made light of the verdict at the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina.",
      "The president of the country's majority-Serb Republika Srpska region told supporters at a rally in the regional capital Banja Luka there was \"no reason to worry\".",
      "His conviction on charges of ignoring the rulings of the international High Representative was \"nonsense\", he said.",
      "Dodik said he had \"learned to deal with more difficult things\" and called on the crowd in Republika Srpska's de facto capital to \"be cheerful\".",
      "The verdict was the culmination of a long-running conflict between Dodik and the international High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Christian Schmidt.",
      "Schmidt is still the supreme authority in Bosnia, 30 years on from the Dayton Agreement which ended the Bosnian War of the 1990s.",
      "The high representative has the power to impose or annul laws \u2013 and sack officials ranging from judges to political leaders.",
      "One former holder of the post, Paddy Ashdown, the former leader of the UK's Liberal Democrats, sacked almost 60 Bosnian-Serb officials in a single day in 2004, in a crackdown on their protection of war criminals.",
      "But the high representative's powers have been used much more sparingly in subsequent years, as Bosnia's international supporters stepped back in the hope that local leaders would work together to create a viable and prosperous country.",
      "The strategy has not been a success. Ethno-nationalist leaders remain entrenched in a country which is divided into two \"entities\" \u2013 the majority-Serb Republika Srpska and the Federation, where the population are mostly Bosniaks and Croats.",
      "The central government is weak \u2013 and there is little incentive for parties to cooperate. Instead, their guiding philosophy is simple and self-interested: divide, rule and profit.",
      "As a result, the country is struggling with low wages, a sluggish economy and a constant flow of emigration by talented people seeking a better future elsewhere.",
      "\"Bosnians of all ethnicities are united by their disdain for their own leaders,\" says Toby Vogel, co-founder of the Democratisation Policy Council think tank.",
      "\"They would love not to vote for these guys, but it's structurally almost impossible for cross-community politicians and parties to emerge.\"",
      "Instead, leaders like Dodik get elected, time after time. The leader of the SNSD party has previously served as the Serb representative of the three-person national presidency and first became prime minister of Republika Srpska in 1998.",
      "A constant theme of his leadership has been the threat to trigger the secession of the majority-Serb region.",
      "Dodik and his government have consistently worked to undermine Bosnia's national institutions, introducing a series of laws to withdraw Republika Srpska from the armed forces, judiciary and tax system.",
      "Such efforts eventually pushed the high representative to take action and annul the secessionist legislation.",
      "Christian Schmidt warned that a renewal of conflict was possible, but insisted that he would \"not sit still while others seek to dismantle [decades] of peace, stability and progress\".",
      "Dodik apparently viewed that as a challenge. He approved a law declaring that Republika Srpska would no longer recognise Schmidt's rulings. The high representative had already annulled the legislation \u2013 and made it a criminal offence to contradict his decisions.",
      "That led to the prosecution of the Bosnian-Serb leader \u2013 with prosecutors calling for a maximum five-year prison sentence and 10-year ban from holding elected office. Dodik warned he would take \"radical measures\" if found guilty.",
      "His conviction has not brought any fireworks so far. At this point, Dodik is insisting that he will not appeal. Instead, Republika Srpska's government is once again proposing legislation to withdraw from national institutions \u2013 including the court which passed the guilty verdict.",
      "But Dodik is facing problems beyond Bosnia's borders. The US and UK have imposed sanctions on him and his family for corruption - threatening the unity of Bosnia and Herzegovina - and connections with Russia.",
      "Toby Vogel believes that is more likely to threaten the Bosnian-Serb leader than the court conviction.",
      "\"The conflict with the high representative will intensify,\" he says. \"But Dodik might well be running out of road.\"",
      "\"He is running out of cash to pay his bloated administration\u2026 and he can no longer raise money on international markets. So, he is in very deep trouble indeed.\"",
      "None of this will be much comfort to the long-suffering people of Bosnia and Herzegovina. They are still enduring the interminable wait for the prosperity promised by ethno-nationalists like Dodik. This latest court battle shows how distant that prospect remains."

That basically means India's wealthy population is not really growing in numbers, even though those who are already rich are getting even wealthier.",

      "Companies that have adapted to these shifts have thrived, Sajith Pai, one of the report's authors, told the BBC. \"Those who are too focused at the mass end or have a product mix that doesn't have exposure to the premium end have lost market share.\"",
      "The report's findings bolster the long-held view that India's post-pandemic recovery has been K-shaped - where the rich have got richer, while the poor have lost purchasing power.",
      "In fact, this has been a long-term structural trend that began even before the pandemic. India has been getting increasingly more unequal, with the top 10% of Indians now holding 57.7% of national income compared with 34% in 1990. The bottom half have seen their share of national income fall from 22.2% to 15%.",

      "The country's central bank has also cracked down on easy unsecured lending that propped up demand after the Covid pandemic.",
      "Much of the consumption spending of the \"emerging\" or \"aspirant\" class of Indians was led by such borrowing and \"turning off that tap will definitely have some impact on consumption\", says Pai.",
      "In the short run, two things are expected to help boost spending - a pick-up in rural demand on the back of a record harvest and a $12 billion tax give-away in the recently concluded budget. It will not be \"dramatic\" but could boost India's GDP - largely driven by consumption - by over half a percent, says Pai.",

      "More than eight million households across Chile were left without power on Tuesday afternoon after an electricity transmission line failed, cutting off the electricity supply to much of the country.",
      "In the capital, Santiago, the entire underground train system was suspended almost immediately. Thousands of people had to be evacuated and stations were plunged into darkness.",
      "\"We were like sardines in the dark,\" one passenger described the moment their underground train stalled.",
      "Many of those who had been in lifts inside the stations when the power cut happened had to be freed by firefighters.",
      "One woman in her 70s was trapped in a lift between two floors in a building in Santiago.",
      "She told local media that she had \"kicked the door\" of the lift to draw attention to her plight and her screams eventually alerted the concierge.",
      "\"I'm brave, I told myself 'I'm not going to die here',\" she said.",
      "Videos shared on social media also showed metro passengers using their mobile phones' flashlights to find their way out of dark stations.",

      "The 150 extra buses deployed to ferry passengers were not nearly enough to make up for the suspension of the metro, which transports an average of 2.3m passengers every day.",
      "Long queues formed at bus stops, where passengers grew increasingly angry when packed buses did not stop.",
      "Their numbers soon swelled with workers sent home early because most offices were paralysed by the lack of electricity.",
      "\"The power went out at 3:00pm, so we had no power at all,\" one shopkeeper in Santiago said. \"People started closing up at around 4 or 5pm.\"",
      "Traffic in the capital was further disrupted by the failure of several traffic lights.",
      "A truck collided with a car at one crossing where the traffic lights were out and there were reports of at least one other accident also caused by the lack of functioning traffic lights.",
      "With the gridlock getting worse, thousands of people were forced to walk to their destinations in summer temperatures of around 30 Celsius (86 Fahrenheit).",
      "One of them, Sharon Ortiz, a 28-year-old waitress, told AFP news agency that the public transport system had \"collapsed\".",
      "\"I got to work two hours late, I got stuck in the middle of the Costanera [shopping centre] and from there I had to walk,\" she said.",
      "Some people hitched lifts on the back of trucks.",
      "Restaurants and cafes were among the businesses affected by the power cut.",
      "Some remained open to offer those walking home a place to rest, but many closed because cash machines, card machines and fridges were not working.",
      "Some of the most dramatic scenes unfolded in Fantasilandia, an amusement park in Santiago, where at least a dozen people were stuck on top of a rollercoaster.",
      "Fantasilandia's manager said that while the park had backup generators, the attractions would not immediately restart for security reasons.",
      "Hospitals relied on emergency generators for power.",
      "As the sun set, the government declared a state of emergency and imposed a curfew from 22:00 to 06:00 local time.",
      "Soldiers and police were deployed to maintain order.",
      "Some Chileans tried to see a positive in the power cut - with several posting photos of the night sky on social media, pointing out that the lack of light pollution had made the milky way easier to see.",

      "\"We monitor the entire city of Kabul from here,\" says Khalid Zadran, a spokesperson for the Taliban police chief, pointing to one of the screens.",
      "The authorities say such surveillance will help fight crime, but critics fear it will be used to clamp down on dissent and to monitor the strict morality code enforced by the Islamist Taliban government under their interpretation of Sharia law.",
      "The BBC are the first international journalists allowed to see the system in action.",
      "Inside the control room, police officers sit in rows watching the live streams from thousands of cameras, keeping tabs on the lives of the six million people who live in Kabul.",

      "\"They arrive swiftly to investigate the nature of the gathering.\"",
      "Under the previous government, Kabul was threatened daily with attacks from the Taliban and so-called Islamic State militants, as well as high profile kidnappings and car-jackings. When the Taliban retook power in 2021, they promised to crack down on crime.",
      "The dramatic increase in the number of surveillance cameras in the capital is a sign of growing sophistication in the way the Taliban enforce law and order. Before their return, just 850 cameras were in place in the capital, according to a spokesman for the security forces that were driven from power.",
      "However, in the past three years, the Taliban authorities have also introduced a range of draconian measures limiting people's rights and freedoms, especially those of women. The Taliban government has not been formally recognised by any other country.",
      "The surveillance system the BBC is shown in Kabul features the option to track people by facial recognition. On the corner of one screen images pop up with each face categorised by age range, gender, and whether or not they have a beard or a face mask.",
      "\"On clear days, we can zoom in on individuals [who are] kilometres away,\" says Zadran, highlighting a camera positioned up high that focuses on a busy traffic junction.",
      "The Taliban even monitor their own personnel. At a checkpoint, as soldiers popped open the trunk of a car for inspection, the operators focused their lenses, zooming in to scrutinise the contents within.",
      "The interior ministry says the cameras have \"significantly contributed to enhancing safety, curbing crime rates, and swiftly apprehending offenders\". It adds the introduction of CCTV and motorcycle controls have led to a 30% decrease in crime rates between 2023 and 2024 but it is not possible to independently verify these figures.",
      "However, rights groups are concerned about who is being monitored and for how long.",
      "Amnesty International say installing cameras \"under the guise of 'national security' sets a template for the Taliban to continue their draconian policies that violate fundamental rights of people in Afghanistan - especially women in public spaces\".",
      "By law women are not allowed to be heard outside their houses, although in practice this is not being strictly enforced. Teenage girls are prevented from accessing secondary and higher education. Women are barred from many forms of employment.

      "But Fariba is concerned the cameras will further endanger those opposed to Taliban rule.",
      "\"Many individuals, especially ex-military members, human rights advocates and protesting women, struggle to move freely and often live in secrecy,\" she says.",
      "\"There is significant concern that surveillance cameras will be used to monitor women's hijabs too,\" she says.",
      "Human Rights Watch, meanwhile, says Afghanistan does not have the data protection laws in place to regulate how the collected CCTV footage is held and used.",
      "The police say the data is kept only for three months, while, according to the interior ministry, the cameras do not pose a threat to privacy as they \"are operated from a special and completely confidential room by a specific and professional person in charge\".",

      "They are among the thousands of people who have been freed from the notorious scam compounds that have thrived on the border for years, in what appears to be the toughest action so far against the industry along the Thai-Myanmar border.",
      "But many of them are now stranded in Myanmar in makeshift camps because the process of assessing them and arranging flights back to their own countries is so slow.",
      "The armed militia groups who are holding them have a very limited capacity to support so many people \u2013 more than 7,000. One of them has said they have stopped freeing people from the compounds because they are not being moved to Thailand fast enough.",
      "The BBC understands that conditions in the camps are unsanitary, food barely sufficient, and many of the freed workers, like Mike, are in poor health. He is suffering from panic attacks, after working for a year in a scam centre where he was routinely beaten.",
      "He told us they got two very basic meals a day, there were only two toilets for 450 people, who he said were now relieving themselves wherever they could.",

      "Instead he found himself subjected to a brutal regime, forced to work long hours every day to meet the target for defrauding people online set by his Chinese bosses.",
      "\"It was the worst experience of my life. Of course I was beaten. But believe me I have seen a lot worse done to other people.\"",
      "Mike is one of an estimated 100,000 people who are believed to have been lured to work in the scam operations along the Thai-Myanmar border, most of them run by Chinese fraud and gambling operatives who have taken advantage of the lawlessness in this part of Myanmar.",
      "Despite horrifying accounts of abuse from those who escaped in the past, thousands still come from parts of the world where good jobs are scarce, enticed by promises of good money.",
      "China, where many of the scam victims come from, has acted to shut down scam operations along its own border with Myanmar, but until this year neither China nor Thailand had done much about the Thai-Myanmar border.",
      "Ariyan, a young man from Bangladesh, has come back to Thailand to try to help 17 friends who are still there. He said he made a promise to himself to do this after his own gruelling escape from one of the most notorious scam centres last October.",
      "He showed us a brief, shaky video of the compound, still under construction in a remote, forested valley, where he was held, and remembers the terrible treatment he and his friends suffered at the hands of their Chinese boss.",
      "\"They gave us a target every week, $5,000. If not, they gave us two electric shocks. Or they put us in a dark room, with no windows. But if we earned a lot of money, they were very happy with us.\"",
      "Ariyan had to approach men in the Middle East and lure them into transferring funds to fictitious investments. Using AI, the scammers made him appear on the screen to be an attractive young woman, altering his voice as well.",
      "He says he hated doing it. He remembers one man who was willing to sell his wife's jewellery to fund the fraudulent investment, and wishing he could warn him. But he said the bosses monitored all their calls.",
      "The release of the scam workers started more than two weeks ago after Thailand, under pressure from China and some of its own politicians, cut power and telecommunications links to the compounds on the border.",
      "It limited banking access to the scam bosses and issued arrest warrants for some of the militia leaders who had been protecting the business.",
      "That hit the business, but it also hit the ordinary Karen people who live nearby even harder, putting pressure on the militia commanders to show willingness in ending the abuses in the scam centres. They began helping those trying to escape, and completely evacuating some compounds.",
      "The camp Mike is housed in is now being guarded by the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army, DKBA, a breakaway insurgent faction of the ethnic Karen community.",
      "Until recently, it was protecting the many scam compounds which have sprung up in its territory. You can see them easily as you drive along the Moei River which divides the two countries - unlikely expanses of new buildings over in war-torn Karen State contrasting with the rural landscape on the Thai side of the border.",
      "Thailand insists it is moving as fast as it can to process the former scam workers and get them home.",
      "A group of 260 freed workers were brought over the Moei River on a raft earlier this month. And around 621 Chinese nationals were flown straight back to China with a police escort on chartered planes. Otherwise, the movement of freed workers to Thailand seems to have stalled.",
      "The problem is that they are from many different countries, some of which are doing little to help get their people home. Around 130 of the first 260 who came over are from Ethiopia, which does not have an embassy in Bangkok.",
      "The BBC has been told that some other African countries will only fly their people home if someone else pays. Most of the freed workers have nothing; even their passports were withheld by the compound bosses.",
      "Thailand fears bringing over thousands of people it will then have to look after indefinitely. It also wants to screen them to find out which are genuine victims of human trafficking and which may have committed criminal acts, but does not have the capacity to do this with such a large group of people.",
      "Different ministries and agencies, including the army, are involved in managing this problem, and have to agree who does what. It does not help that several senior police and immigration officers have been transferred over their alleged involvement in the scam business.",
      "\"If this issue is not resolved, then we will not stop working on it \u2013 we must work seriously,\" said Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra on Tuesday in Bangkok. But she was referring to the wider problem of the scam business, not the growing humanitarian crisis among the freed workers.",
      "\"Unfortunately, it seems we're in a bit of a standstill,\" says Judah Tana, an Australian who runs an NGO which has for years been helping the victims of trafficking in the scam centres.",
      "\"We are hearing distressing information about the lack of sanitation and toilets. Many of the 260 who already came were screened for TB and tested positive. We are hearing from those who are still inside that people are coughing up blood. They are very happy that they have been liberated from the scam compounds, but our worry is that we're not engaging fast enough.\"",

      "Zelensky said he hoped the \"preliminary\" agreement with the US \"will lead to further deals\", but confirmed no American security guarantees have been agreed yet.",
      "Trump said a deal would help American taxpayers \"get their money back\" for aid sent to Ukraine throughout the war but said the responsibility of Kyiv's security should fall to Europe.",
      "What are the terms of the deal?",
      "Key details have not yet been made public, but on Wednesday Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Ukraine and the US had finalised a version of the agreement.",
      "Speaking to Ukrainian TV, Shmyhal said the preliminary agreement envisages that an \"investment fund\" would be set up for Ukraine's reconstruction.",
      "Kyiv and Washington would manage the fund on \"equal terms\", the prime minister added.",
      "He said Ukraine would contribute 50% of future proceeds from state-owned mineral resources, oil and gas to the fund, and the fund would then invest in projects in Ukraine itself.",
      "Zelensky has acknowledged the fund but told the BBC on Wednesday it was \"too early to talk about money\".",
      "The New York Times reported, citing a draft document, that the US would own the maximum amount of the fund allowed under US law, but not necessarily all of it.",
      "Disagreement over the terms of a minerals deal formed part of what was seen as a deepening rift between Trump and Zelensky in recent weeks.",
      "The Ukrainian president had rejected an initial request from the US for $500bn (\u00a3395bn) in mineral wealth, but media reports say this demand has now been dropped.",
      "\"The provisions of the deal are much better for Ukraine now,\" a source in Ukraine's government told the BBC.",

      "Asked by the BBC if he would be prepared to walk away from the agreement if Trump did not offer the guarantees he wanted, Zelensky said: \"I want to find a Nato path or something similar.",
      "\"If we don't get security guarantees, we won't have a ceasefire, nothing will work, nothing.\"",
      "Despite this, Shmyhal said on Wednesday the US supported \"Ukraine's efforts to obtain security guarantees to build lasting peace\".",
      "He said Ukraine would not sign the deal until Zelensky and Trump \"agree on security guarantees\" and decide on how to \"tie this preliminary agreement\" to a US security guarantee.",
      "Trump said on Wednesday that the US would not provide security guarantees \"beyond... very much\", saying responsibility for this fell to Europe.",
      "But he added that the presence of American workers on Ukrainian soil would provide \"automatic security\".",
      "The prospect of a minerals deal was first proposed by Zelensky last year as a way to offer the US a tangible reason to continue supporting Ukraine.",
      "Trump said on Tuesday that Ukraine would get \"the right to fight on\" in return for access to its minerals and suggested the US would continue to supply equipment and ammunition \"until we have a deal with Russia\".",
      "The US president has also said Russia is open to accepting European peacekeepers in Ukraine, but Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the Kremlin would not consider this as an option.",
      "When will the deal be signed?",
      "Shmyhal said the US and Ukraine have prepared a final version of the agreement, which Ukraine's government will authorise for signing on Wednesday.",
      "Zelensky said he would be \"very direct\" with Trump by asking whether the US would continue supporting Ukraine or not.",
      "Trump has confirmed he will be meeting Zelensky in Washington on Friday to sign the agreement.",
      "What minerals does Ukraine have?",
      "Kyiv estimates that about 5% of the world's \"critical raw materials\" are in Ukraine.",
      "This includes some 19m tonnes of proven reserves of graphite, which the Ukrainian Geological Survey state agency says makes the nation \"one of the top five leading countries\" for the supply of the mineral. Graphite is used to make batteries for electric vehicles.",
      "Ukraine also has significant deposits of titanium, lithium and rare earth metals - a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world.",
      "But some of the country's mineral deposits have been seized by Russia. According to Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economy minister, resources worth $350bn (\u00a3277bn) remain in occupied territories today.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62e36jm4jro",
    "published": "Wed, 26 Feb 2025 22:32:33 GMT",
    "summary": "Tamil Nadu\u2019s iron artefacts may predate Turkey's Anatolia, reshaping early Iron Age history.",
    "story": [
      "For over 20 years, archaeologists in India's southern state of Tamil Nadu have been unearthing clues to the region's ancient past.",
      "Their digs have uncovered early scripts that rewrite literacy timelines, mapped maritime trade routes connecting India to the world and revealed advanced urban settlements - reinforcing the state's role as a cradle of early civilisation and global commerce.",
      "Now they've also uncovered something even older - evidence of what could be the earliest making and use of iron. Present-day Turkey is one of the earliest known regions where iron was mined, extracted and forged on a significant scale around the 13th Century BC.",
      "Archaeologists have discovered iron objects at six sites in Tamil Nadu, dating back to 2,953\u20133,345 BCE, or between 5,000 to 5,400 years old. This suggests that the process of extracting, smelting, forging and shaping iron to create tools, weapons and other objects may have developed independently in the Indian subcontinent.",
      "\"The discovery is of such a great importance that it will take some more time before its implications sink in,\" says Dilip Kumar Chakrabarti, a professor of South Asian archaeology at Cambridge University.",
      "The latest findings from Adichchanallur, Sivagalai, Mayiladumparai, Kilnamandi, Mangadu and Thelunganur sites have made local headlines such as \"Did the Iron Age Begin in Tamil Nadu?\" The age marks a period when societies began using and producing iron widely, making tools, weapons and infrastructure.",
      "Parth R Chauhan, a professor of archaeology at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (ISSER), urges caution before drawing broad conclusions.  He believes that iron technology likely emerged \"independently in multiple regions\".",
      "Also, the \"earliest evidence remains uncertain because many regions of the world have not been properly researched or archaeological evidence is known but has not been dated properly\".",
      "If the Tamil Nadu discovery is further validated through rigorous academic study, \"it would certainly rank amongst the world's earliest records\", Mr Chauhan says. Oishi Roy, an archaeologist at ISSER, adds that the find \"suggests parallel developments [in iron production] across different parts of the world\".",
      "Early iron came in two forms - meteoritic and smelted. Smelted iron, extracted from ore, marked the true beginning of iron technology with mass production. The earliest known iron artefacts - nine tubular beads - were made from meteoritic iron, which comes from fallen meteorites.",
      "Identifying iron-bearing rocks is the first challenge. Once located, these ores must be smelted in a furnace at extremely high temperatures to extract the metal. Without this process, raw iron remains locked within the rock. After extraction, skilled ironsmiths shape the metal into tools and implements, marking a crucial step in early ironworking.",
      "Most sites in Tamil Nadu where iron has been found are ancient habitation areas near present-day villages. Archaeologists K Rajan and R Sivanantham say that excavators have so far explored a fraction of over 3,000 identified Iron Age graves containing sarcophagi (stone coffins) and a wealth of iron artefacts. In the process, they uncovered hoe-spades, spears, knives, arrowheads, chisels, axes and swords made of iron.",
      "At burials excavated at one site, over 85 iron objects - knives, arrowhead, rings, chisels, axes and swords - were found inside and outside burial urns. More than 20 key samples were robustly dated in five labs worldwide, confirming their antiquity.",
      "Some finds are particularly striking.",
      "Historian Osmund Bopearachchi of the Paris-based French National Centre for Scientific Research highlights a key discovery - an iron sword from a burial site, made of ultra-high-carbon steel and dating to 13th\u201315th Century BC.",
      "This advanced steel, a direct evolution of Iron Age metallurgy, required sophisticated knowledge and precise high-temperature processes.",
      "\"We know that the first signs of real steel production date back to the 13th Century BC in present-day Turkey. The radiometric dates seem to prove that the Tamil Nadu samples are earlier,\" he said. Ms Roy adds that the early steel in Tamil Nadu indicates the people there \"were iron makers, not just users - a technologically advanced community evolving over time\".",
      "Also, in a site called Kodumanal, excavators found a furnace, pointing to an advanced iron-making community.",
      "The furnace area stood out with its white discolouration, likely from extreme heat. Nearby, excavators found iron slag - some of it fused to the furnace wall - hinting at advanced metalworking techniques. Clearly the people at the site were not just using iron, but actively producing and processing it.",
      "To be sure, the Tamil Nadu excavations are not the first in India to uncover iron. At least 27 sites across eight states have revealed evidence of early iron use, some dating back 4,200 years. The latest Tamil Nadu digs pushes back the antiquity of Indian iron by another 400 years,\" archaeologist Rajan, who has co-authored a paper on the subject, told me.",
      "\"The Iron Age is a technological shift, not a single-origin event - it develops in multiple places independently,\" says Ms Roy, noting earlier discoveries in eastern, western and northern India.",
      "\"What's clear now,\" she adds, \"is that indigenous iron technology developed early in the Indian subcontinent.\"",
      "Experts say the excavations in Tamil Nadu are significant and could reshape our understanding of the Iron Age and iron smelting in the Indian subcontinent. Also, \"what these digs testify is to the existence of a distinctly sophisticated style of civilisation,\" notes Nirmala Lakshman, author of The Tamils - A Portrait of a Community.",
      "However, archaeologists caution that there is still a lack of excavations needed to collect fresh data from all over India. As one expert put it, \"Indian archaeology is in silent mode outside Tamil Nadu.\"",
      "Katragadda Paddayya, a leading Indian archaeologist, said this was \"just the starting point\".",
      "\"We need to delve deeper into the origins of iron technology - these findings mark the beginning, not the conclusion. The key is to use this as a premise, trace the process backward and identify the sites where iron production truly began.\"",

    "summary": "As Syria's interim leader plans its future, Kurds in the north-east are battling Turkish-backed forces.",
    "story": [
      "To reach north-east Syria, we cross a rickety floating bridge over the River Tigris. Our minibus rattles as it takes us from Iraqi Kurdistan through Syrian oil fields, where jacks pumping crude oil line the roads.",
      "This part of Syria is controlled by Kurds, who call it Rojava - meaning western Kurdistan. Since 2012, after the outbreak of civil war, they have run it as a self-declared autonomous region, protected by Kurdish-led armed forces.",
      "But Bashar al-Assad's regime never recognised it and, despite his fall from power, its future remains uncertain.",
      "As well as more than a decade of civil war, the Syrian Kurds have faced years of conflict with its northern neighbour, Turkey - a battle they are still fighting.",
      "The fight against IS",
      "A decade ago, the Islamic State group (IS) swept through this region, capturing cities and villages with little resistance - until it reached the city of Kobane, next to the Turkish border, in September 2014.",
      "IS militants didn't manage to enter the city, but they imposed a brutal siege that lasted for months.",
      "Kurdish-led factions, supported by the US-led military coalition, broke the siege in early 2015. This January, I join the city's residents as they mark the 10-year anniversary.",
      "At the entrance to Kobane, women in their 50s, armed with AK-47 assault rifles, guard the checkpoints. Women played a crucial role in the fight against IS - many volunteered in the all-female Women's Protection Units (YPJ).",
      "As we drive around the city, the scars of war are still visible, along with posters of young men and women who lost their lives.",
      "But in the main square, the mood is festive. Young girls and boys, dressed in colourful Kurdish outfits dance hand in hand, singing as they celebrate.",
      "For the older generation, though, it is a bittersweet moment. \"Last night I lit candles for my martyred brother and others killed in Kobane,\" says Newrouz Ahmad, a 45-year-old mother of four. \"It is a joyful day, but also a painful one. I wish he was here to see it.\"",
      "Conflict with Turkey",
      "The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) declared victory over IS in north-east Syria in 2019. But freedom from IS hasn't brought lasting peace.",
      "Turkey and a coalition of Turkish-backed rebel groups known as the Syrian National Army (SNA) have launched several military operations against SDF-controlled territories since 2016, and captured a swathe of territory running along hundreds of kilometres of the border.",
      "Turkey considers the largest component in the SDF - the People's Protection Units (YPG) - an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought for Kurdish rights in Turkey for decades and is listed by Ankara as a terrorist organisation. The country wants to push the SDF back from its border.",
      "As the Assad regime collapsed in late 2024, the Turkish-backed SNA launched a new offensive to capture territory west of the River Euphrates from the SDF.",
      "Now battles have reached areas near Kobane. A Kurdish commander in the city quietly tells me: \"Don't film here, we have built tunnels beneath the city to prepare for another siege.\"",
      "In the city, the smell of gasoline fills the air, and the deafening sound of generators can be heard everywhere. Locals tell me that most of the power stations, refineries, and even telecommunications antennas have been destroyed by Turkish air strikes over the past two years.",
      "Newrouz Ahmad says that having \"defeated IS in Kobane\u2026 we won't allow Turkey and its proxies to occupy our city, we will defeat them too\".",
      "At a restaurant, the moment people realise we are not locals, they surround us. I ask an old man with grey hair and a stick in his hands how old he is. I guess he is about 80, but the answer he gives embarrasses me. \"I am 60,\" he says.",
      "It's clear that people here have been exhausted by war, having witnessed so much death and bloodshed.",
      "And now the threat of another battle is looming.",
      "Reported attacks on civilians",
      "Turkish-made drones and Turkish jets have targeted SDF positions and supply routes around the city. Even civilians protesting have been hit.",
      "In a regional hospital, I find one of the wounded - Lea Bunse, a 28-year-old German peace activist who has been volunteering at a women's shelter in Rojava for over two years.",
      "She shows me a video of an attack on a demonstration she says she was part of in January. The footage shows two projectiles dropping from the sky and hitting a crowd of people dancing.",
      "The protest was held near the strategic Tishreen Dam, where fighting has been ongoing.  The SDF says six civilians were killed, and dozens more injured.",
      "\"An old man next to me was also injured,\" she tells me from her bed.",
      "\"I lost some blood\u2026 but when we got into the ambulance, another drone attack was carried out next to our ambulance,\" she adds.",
      "Human Rights Watch has condemned an attack that hit a Kurdish Red Crescent ambulance as an \"apparent war crime\" by the Turkish-SNA coalition.",
      "The Turkish foreign ministry told the BBC that \"reports claiming Turkey is involved in the attacks against civilians and critical infrastructure do not reflect the truth\" adding that the SDF sends civilians to a \"conflict-ridden area on purpose\" to use them as \"human shields\u2026 in order to not to lose control on the said dam\".",
      "It accused the SDF of using \"violence and terror\" to pursue \"its own separatist agenda\", violating a ceasefire and stopping technical teams from getting access to the dam for repairs.",
      "The Damascus dilemma",
      "Syria's new leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, is stuck between a rock and a hard place.",
      "The interim president - whose Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) led the rebel offensive that overthrew Assad - has been promising to form an inclusive government in Damascus, and he has asked all armed factions to lay down their weapons. Negotiations are reportedly being held with the SDF to find a solution for the north-east.",
      "But the inclusion of the Kurdish factions puts Sharaa in a difficult position with one of his main allies \u2013 Turkey.",
      "And when Sharaa opened a conference for national dialogue on Syria's future on Tuesday, the Kurdish autonomous administration was absent - it said it had not been invited.",
      "Speaking to me from a discreet location near an American base in Hassakeh province in the north-east of Syria, SDF commander Gen Mazloum Abdi tells me he has met Sharaa in Damascus before.",
      "But the two sides have still not reached an agreement.",
      "\"In reality, we are still at war with Turkey and its proxies. Turkish jets and drones continue to bomb us,\" he says, adding: \"In Damascus, it remains unclear what steps the new government will take. Their statements are positive, but they are under pressure from Turkey to act against the areas under our control.",
      "\"But the US, France, and some Arab nations are pushing them to recognize Kurdish rights,\" he says.",
      "For the US, SDF fighters have been the most reliable allies in the fight against IS.",
      "Today, hundreds of US troops remain in Kurdish-controlled areas, to counter IS sleeper cells.",
      "But the Kurds now fear President Donald Trump might withdraw these troops, leaving the region vulnerable to any Turkish military operation, and a possible IS resurgence.",
      "It's estimated that there are still about 40,000 IS family members and up to 10,000 jihadist fighters held in SDF-controlled camps and prisons in the north-east, says Gen Abdi.",
      "\"If Turkey attacks, we will have no choice but to redirect our forces,\" he warns. \"That would give IS an opportunity to attack prisons and free its fighters.\"",
      "Uncertain future",
      "There is further uncertainty for the women who fought against IS in the all-female YPJ ranks.",
      "The walls in the office of 29-year-old YPJ spokesperson Roksana Mohamed are covered with pictures of fellow female commanders killed in battle.",
      "\"So far, we haven't seen any roles given to women in Damascus' new leadership,\" she says. \"Why shouldn't a woman be defence minister?\"",
      "Ms Mohamed says women fought for their rights in this region. They have been actively involved in every aspect of political, social, and military life.",
      "\"If our rights are not respected, how can we be expected to lay down our arms?\" she asks.",
      "So while some believe stability in Syria is on the horizon, for the Kurds, the future remains unclear. Will they be recognised as partners in a new Syria, or face another existential battle?"

      "Card-holding Liberals will now choose between former governor of the banks of Canada and England Mark Carney, former finance minister Chrystia Freeland, House government leader Karina Gould and businessman and former MP Frank Baylis.",
      "Whoever wins the vote on 9 March will become Canada's next prime minister and will lead the Liberals in the forthcoming general election, which must be held on or before 20 October of this year.",
      "A big focus of the debates has been how Canada should respond to US President Donald Trump, who has threatened steep tariffs on America's northern neighbour and has suggested that Canada become the \"51st state.\"",
      "Here are five big takeaways from the two Liberal leadership debates.",
      "The Trump Factor",
      "How Canada should respond to what many have dubbed an \"existential threat\" from US President Donald Trump has unsurprisingly dominated the agenda at both debates.",
      "Trump has said he plans to impose a 25% tariff on all Canadian exports, with the exception of energy that would be tariffed at a lower 10% - a move that economists say would be devastating for Canada while increasing prices for Americans.",
      "He has also repeatedly proposed that the US should annex Canada, which has been met with alarm and anger from large swathes of the Canadian population.",
      "Freeland, a former top minister who served during Trump's first term, positioned herself as an experienced negotiator who has fought - and won - against the US president and his previous tariffs.",
      "But Carney warned that the Trump of today was not the Trump of the past. \"He is more isolationist. He is more aggressive,\" Carney said. \"In the past he wanted our markets. Now he wants our country.\"",
      "Gould, the youngest candidate, suggested that Canada should \"put everything on the table\" to protect its sovereignty, and that the federal government should help businesses diversify their portfolios to depend less on the US.",
      "Baylis, meanwhile, said Canada needed to forge closer economic ties with the UK, New Zealand and Australia, saying all four were like-minded countries with shared values, culture, and government systems.",
      "How Canada can fix its economy",
      "Trump's threats are made more alarming by Canada's current economic situation.",
      "Canadians have voiced frustrations over the stubborn high cost of living.",
      "Carney - an economist by trade - promised a plan that would balance Canada's operational budget in three years and proposed that Canada rethink the way it spends its money.",
      "But he has also noted his support for key Liberal programmes, like affordable childcare and dental care.",
      "As the former finance minister, Freeland defended her track record, saying the country's finances were still \"very strong\". She added that Canada should capitalise on the surge of patriotism in the face of Trump's threats, using that momentum to support Canadian industries and promote job growth.",
      "Baylis drew on his expertise as a businessman to say that Canada should work on building its productivity.",
      "Gould, on the other hand, said the Liberal Party should be \"realistic with Canadians\" and that balancing the budget in three years was not possible without significant cuts, which she did not support. She said Canada should instead focus on \"modernising its social safety net\" to help those who are struggling.",
      "\"We are facing extreme threats from the US, so we have to be able to invest in our people and in our businesses to protect them,\" Gould said.",
      "Defeating Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre",
      "The four candidates were debating with each other but they often presented a united front against their shared opponent, Conservative party leader Pierre Poilievre, whose party is favoured in the polls as the most likely to form Canada's next government.",
      "Liberal leadership hopefuls threw several jabs at Poilievre throughout the debate. Gould called him \"our little version of Trump here at home\" while Freeland said Poilievre was looking to \"imitate\" Trump.",
      "Carney criticised Poilievre as \"irresponsible\" and added that Canada could \"not afford\" to have him as prime minister.",
      "Poilievre, who has enjoyed a sizable lead in the polls ahead of an unpopular Trudeau, has had to pivot his pitch to Canadians since Trudeau's resignation.",
      "His message changed from criticising the sitting prime minister for leading a \"broken\" Canada to putting \"Canada First\" in the face of threats from the US. He has also shifted his focus to attacking Carney, who is favoured to win the Liberal leadership race.",
      "Poilievre is still polling ahead nationally, but some polls suggest that the lead between him and the Liberals has shrunk since Trudeau's exit.",
      "Supporting Ukraine and Nato",
      "Responding to shifting US policy on the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, all four candidates affirmed their commitment to continuing Canada's support for Ukraine.",
      "All of them also backed the need for Canada to hit its 2% military spending target as set out in its commitments to the Nato alliance, though they disagreed on the timeline and how to get there.",
      "Freeland said Canada should hit the target by 2027, and should do so by investing in the \"next generation of warfare\". Baylis and Carney have said their plan would be for Canada to reach that target by 2030.",
      "Both Freeland and Carney said Canada needed to invest that money into Canadian military ventures instead of into the US.",
      "Freeland noted that Canada should reduce its reliance on the US, and should look to work with the EU and other Nato partners on security assurances.",
      "A rethink of the consumer tax on carbon",
      "A tax on carbon for consumers and businesses has been the cornerstone of the Trudeau government's policy on climate change.",
      "But that tax has proven to be unpopular with Canadians, forcing Carney and Freeland to promise that they would ditch the policy.",
      "Carney, a former UN special envoy on climate action and finance, has long been a proponent of the carbon tax. In the debates, however, he acknowledged the tax on consumers had become divisive, and said he would instead focus on taxing big polluters and growing clean energy projects in Canada.",
      "Freeland, who resigned from Trudeau's government because of disagreements with the prime minister on spending, said that history would judge his climate action favourably despite his policies' unpopularity. But she, too, vowed to scrap the carbon tax.",
      "\"Democracy is about listening to people, and Canadians were very clear with us that they did not think that policy worked for them,\" she said.",
      "Gould and Baylis, on the other hand, said they would keep some version of the consumer tax on carbon in place, saying that fighting climate change comes with a price.",

      "A month on, Pascaline has come back to the charred shell of the prison complex, where an empty watch tower still stands.",
      "She wants to tell her story and is willing to be identified. She is also a voice for the dead.",
      "She walks through the main yard of the women's section, glancing at the scorched walls, scattered cooking pots and piles of clothing. Her hand comes to her mouth in wordless horror, and she shakes her head.",
      "\"At one point I didn't know what was happening any more,\" she says. \"It was after seeing the others die that I began to pull myself together, I would say that it was God who wanted me to be saved.\"",
      "Pascaline, an onion seller, wound up behind bars here when her employer accused her of theft.",
      "Nadine, 22, has also come back to the prison for the first time. In her mind, she cannot escape it.",
      "\"When I sleep at night, everything I've seen here comes back to me. I see the dead again - as many dead bodies as I saw here until I got out. Instead of opening the door, they let us die like animals here.\"",
      "Nadine says she was also raped by two men.",
      "\"They came with alcohol,\" she tells the BBC. \"They wanted to drug people. They took me by force. They took all the women here.\"",
      "The BBC cannot verify how many women were raped that night, out of a total of 167 who, sources say, were being held.",
      "Nadine is furious at the authorities - for locking her up in the first place over an unpaid debt, she says, and then failing to let her out.",
      "\"I don't think that justice can exist in Congo,\" she says. \"I condemn the way the government is running things.\"",
      "The DR Congo government - more than 1,500km (1,000 miles) away in the capital Kinshasa - is no longer running anything in Goma. The rebels are in full control and are continuing to advance in the east.",
      "Among the piles of ash that carpet the prison floor after the fire, there is a tiny pink sandal, which is burnt on one side. Some shiny buttons glitter in the dirt beside it, perhaps from children's clothing.",
      "Women prisoners were allowed to keep one of their children in the jail with them.  Only two children out of 28 survived the blaze in the prison, according to a source. Child prisoners - held in a separate block - were released earlier in the day.",
      "It was not just the smoke and the flames that killed the most vulnerable, according to a detailed account from another survivor aged 38, who does not want to be identified. We are calling her Florence.",
      "She says \"children started to die\" when tear gas was fired into the women's section.",
      "\"The prison was surrounded by soldiers and police who, instead of coming to put out the fire, were firing bullets and throwing tear gas at us,\" Florence says.",
      "\"When the tear gas was dropped on us, the fire became intense. Our eyes tingled as if chilli had been poured into them. There was almost no way to breathe,\" she adds.",
      "The fire and the rapes are shrouded in confusion, with all sides eager to blame someone else.",
      "Human rights groups say rape is widely used as a weapon of war in DR Congo by both the M23 rebels and government forces.",
      "What's the fighting in DR Congo all about?Your phone, a rare metal and the war in DR Congo",
      "What's the fighting in DR Congo all about?",
      "Your phone, a rare metal and the war in DR Congo",
      "However, in this case, Florence says it was fellow inmates.",
      "\"You could see they were prisoners. Some came without shoes. When they climbed onto the roof of the women's prison, they were calling the names of those they knew. And none of the attackers were armed or in uniform.\"",
      "Florence says she heard \"bullets crackling\" outside the prison from 23:00 onwards, and escaping prisoners were being killed by police outside.",
      "\"If a prisoner got out, they shot him. When the bullets were flying, I was on my knees begging God to deliver us from this bad situation.\"",
      "Some of the prisoners who broke into the women's section were looking for a safer escape route, she says.",
      "They breached one of the walls facing the outside - a place where police were not normally stationed.  But soon that gap was filled - by the fire.",
      "Florence first saw the flames at about 04:00. Then hour after hour, she rushed from body to body.",
      "\"People were dying in front of our eyes. I couldn't count them. We tried to revive them by giving them water. Some women were suffocated by the fire, as well as the gas. Some died of heart attacks,\" Florence tells the BBC.",
      "She too blames the Congolese authorities for the loss of so many lives.",
      "\"The state should have opened the doors when it saw the fire or come and put it out.\"",
      "The BBC has contacted the government in Kinshasa asking for a response to what the survivors have told us but we have not yet received one.",
      "Florence says the women's prison was finally opened at 11:00 - she does not know by who - and she emerged with 18 other survivors.  They were offered no help.",
      "\"Even the policemen we found on the road, did not ask for news of the prisoners, or ask if anyone had been hurt, or how we were,\" she says.",
      "By then rebel fighters were in parts of the city, having entered at around 08:00. Goma was falling.",
      "The women did not seem to matter - in or out of prison.",
      "In a tent in the grounds of Goma's hospital, we meet another survivor, Sifa, 25, who was pulled from the flames by a friend.",
      "She lies on her left side - any other position is too painful. Her right arm is heavily bandaged, and there are burn marks on her arm and her face. She also has burns on her back. When her dressings are changed the nurses have to give her morphine.",
      "But her agony is more than physical.",
      "Her two-year-old daughter Esther died in the prison.",
      "\"I had Esther on my back. When we wanted to escape, something fell on her. A bomb? I don't know what. She died on the spot,\" Sifa tells the BBC.",
      "She adds that Esther was just starting to walk and was \"without sin\". Sometimes she would play with the other children in the prison, but mostly she was by her mother's side.",
      "How did Sifa, a peanut seller, wind up behind bars in a teeming prison with her daughter?",
      "She was accused of involvement in a robbery, which she denies. She says she was jailed without being convicted. Local sources say that is a common occurrence.",
      "The full story of what happened in Munzenze Prison may never be known. It seems those in power are in no rush to find out.",
      "Sifa and the other survivors we spoke to told us that no-one had contacted them to take their testimony about the horrors of 27 January - not the rebels in control of Goma now, nor the government in Kinshasa who used to run the prison.",
      "\"No-one will follow [this case],\" Sifa says. \"No-one will be pursued. It's already over.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Feb 2025 01:47:56 GMT",
    "summary": "As the first European leader to visit Trump since his inauguration, Macron navigated potentially testing talks.",
    "story": [
      "Relations between Europe and the US are unquestionably in crisis, so merely keeping things together as French President Emmanuel Macron did at the White House on Monday stands as an achievement.",
      "He did that by praising, flattering and gently cajoling the US president as they took questions in the Oval Office and held a joint news conference. This is a playbook that many leaders around the world now see as more productive than outright plain speaking or criticism of Trump.",
      "Macron managed to navigate what could have been a tricky day in Washington without conceding or revealing too much.",
      "He spoke of both countries wanting peace, and while he gently corrected one of Trump's claims on Europe's support for Ukraine, he also agreed that Europe needed to take more responsibility for its own security.",
      "But Macron did make one important concession \u2013 that Trump was right to re-establish some kind of relationship with Russia's Vladimir Putin.",
      "That is in sharp contrast to the view up until now in London, Paris and Berlin, which have all pursued a policy of isolating Putin and slapping sanctions on Russian industries and individuals.",
      "\"There is good reason for President Trump to re-engage with President Putin,\" Macron said, adding that the new administration represented \"a big change\".",
      "Peace must not mean surrendering Ukraine, Macron saysZelensky says he hopes to end Ukraine war 'this year'Three years on, Ukraine's extinction nightmare has returned",
      "Peace must not mean surrendering Ukraine, Macron says",
      "Zelensky says he hopes to end Ukraine war 'this year'",
      "Three years on, Ukraine's extinction nightmare has returned",
      "Macron held out the prospect of European countries such as France and the UK being willing to play a leading role in ensuring the security of a post-truce Ukraine, possibly in the form of air power and troops stationed away from the frontline.",
      "But at the same time, he stressed the importance of having an American backstop.",
      "Macron, however, did not get a commitment of US back-up from his meeting in the Oval Office. And if he was looking for a scintilla of criticism of the Russian president from Trump, then he did not get that either.",
      "What he did get was, at least to some extent, Europe's voice back at the table and he, along with other European leaders, will take some heart from that.",
      "It is clear however, that the ambitions for re-establishing the kind of close relationship that Europe and the US have had since the end of World War Two are not on anyone's roadmap.",
      "That is why Macron himself has been working on the idea of a more strategically autonomous Europe for some time, toying with ideas of combined European defence forces.",
      "His sense that Europe needs to adapt given the dramatic shift in the US position is shared by Friedrich Merz, who will be Germany's next chancellor.",
      "Merz has already said that he believes the US under Donald Trump is indifferent to Europe's fate, and that the continent needs to be independent of the US in terms of security.",
      "\"My absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA,\" Merz said.",
      "But France, the UK and Germany have also got to be cognisant of the fact that not all European powers are so hostile to the US view on Ukraine.",
      "The rise of far-right nationalist parties in Europe, most notably in places like Germany where the AfD came second in Sunday's elections, suggests some European citizens are also sceptical about the continent's continued support for Kyiv.",
      "Later this week, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who has been closely co-ordinating with his French counterpart, will come to Washington to reinforce their case on Ukraine.",
      "He, like Macron, believes his country has a special relationship with the US which can open doors and get a fair hearing.",
      "The problem is that Washington in the shape of Donald Trump is on transmit mode at the moment \u2013 pushing an agenda that leaves little room for the opinion of others.",
      "And while America has always had the ability to flex its muscles and get its way, Europe for the most part has not been on the receiving end. The fact that has changed is a sign of just how serious this rupture in established alliances has become.",

    "summary": "Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida, known as IBB, has got Nigeria talking about the past and what might have been.",
    "story": [
      "Nigeria's former military ruler Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida, known as IBB, has released a new autobiography including several revelations about the turbulent times while he was in charge of the country from 1985 to 1993.",
      "A Journey In Service has got Nigerians talking and reflecting on what might have been if things had turned out differently - especially the controversial decision to annul the 1993 elections, and the execution of a childhood friend.",
      "Babangida has a mixed record. While some praise him for the infrastructural development Nigeria he oversaw, others say there was massive corruption during his time.",
      "Here are four takeaways from the book:",
      "The 1993 elections annulment",
      "This is the biggest talking-point as it touches on a topic which many believed altered Nigeria's history. Some say the country still has not really recovered from the annulment of the 1993 presidential elections.",
      "In the book, Babangida, now 83, for the first time expressed deep regret for cancelling that election.",
      "The poll was supposed to bring an end to military rule after 10 years and the cancellation of the outcome threw the country into turmoil.",
      "The date of the vote - 12 June - is now remembered in Nigeria as Democracy Day.",
      "Moshood Abiola, widely believed to have won the election, was later imprisoned and his wife assassinated.",
      "Gen Babangida acknowledged that Abiola, who died in 1998, had won the vote.",
      "However, in 1993 as results were being collated, the military government abruptly stopped the process - an action that triggered widespread protests and a political crisis.",
      "\"That accident of history is most regrettable. The nation is entitled to expect my expression of regret,\" Babangida writes.",
      "At the time, he cited the issue of vote-buying, as well as the need to protect the country\u2019s judiciary as reasons for the annulment.",
      "Gen Babangida was forced to resign several months later.",
      "Nigeria's current President, Bola Tinubu, said at the book launch that Gen Babangida had shown courage by admitting what took place.",
      "Abiola\u2019s son Jamiu said the acknowledgment by Gen Babangida that his father had won the election came as a welcome surprise to him and some of his family members.",
      "\"Perhaps General Babangida was looking for peace,\u201d he told the BBC Focus on Africa podcast.",
      "Civilian rule was eventually restored in 1999, 11 months after the death of another military ruler Gen Sani Abacha. He had seized power towards the end of 1993 in the wake of the annulled elections.",
      "Execution of a childhood friend",
      "General Mamman Vatsa and Babangida grew up together, were in the same class in school and rose alongside each other in the military. His execution in 1986 after he was convicted of a coup plot is another major talking-point of Babangida's presidency.",
      "\"We were very close friends,\" Babangida recalls.",
      "\"We had grown up together in Minna and had been classmates in Bida. We did several things together as peers. My wife recalled that we used to share a room as bachelors. We would reach out for whatever shirt was available, irrespective of whose it was, and just wear it and head out! We were that close.\"",
      "However, he says now realises that Vatsa had been jealous since when they were teenagers.",
      "\"With the benefit of hindsight now, I recall that a constant part of our relationship as teenagers and young men was a continuous and recurrent peer jealousy on his part towards me. He was always envious of my achievements, especially when he thought I was progressing better than him, either in school or our military career path.\"",
      "Vatsa and nine others were executed in March 1986. They were said to have planned a coup, which according to Babangida would have plunged the country into darkness.",
      "\"I had to choose between saving a friend's life and the nation's future,\" he writes.",
      "Nigeria's first coup",
      "Another contentious issue has been the 1966 coup which overthrew Nigeria's first government following independence from the UK. Prime Minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa was killed, along with other high-ranking national and regional leaders.",
      "The fact most of the coup plotters were from south-eastern Nigeria meant the coup became known as an \"Igbo coup\" - a label Babangida rejects.",
      "He highlighted the role of Major John Obienu, an ethnic Igbo officer, who played a key role in quelling the coup, revealing that many senior Igbo officers were also killed in the mutiny.",
      "The book also sheds light on the involvement of members of other ethnic groups, notably Yorubas, many of whom he said had participated in the military takeover.",
      "The former leader confirmed that the original intention of the coup plotters was to release politician Obafemi Awolowo from detention and install him as president.",
      "Babangida writes: \"It was a terrible time for the Nigerian military. As I have said elsewhere, as a young officer who saw all of this from a distance, probably, ethnic sentiments did not drive the original objective of the coup plotters.",
      "\"For instance, the head of the plotters, Major Kaduna Nzeogwu, was only 'Igbo' in name. Born and raised in Kaduna, his immigrant parents were from Okpanam in today's Delta State, which, in 1966, was in the old mid-western region. Nzeogwu spoke fluent Hausa and was as 'Hausa' as any! He and his original team probably thought, even if naively, that they could turn things around for the better in the country.\"",
      "The association of Igbos with the coup led to attacks on members of that community around the country and ultimately to the civil war in which some Igbo leaders tried to secede from Nigeria in 1967. At least a million people were killed in what became known as the Biafran war.",
      "Remembering the Biafra war that many prefer to forget",
      "Remembering the Biafra war that many prefer to forget",
      "The love story with Maryam Babangida",
      "Many Nigerians see Babangida's wife Maryam as the country's most iconic and influential first lady. From 1985 to when they left office in 1993, their love story captivated a lot of people. She died in 2009 and the ex-head of state has never remarried.",
      "\"She was stunning. Her ebony beauty set off enchanting eyes, and her dazzling smile showed off a lovely set of teeth; when she smiled - and she often smiled - her face lit up, and her eyes danced,\" he writes.",
      "\"We both saw our marriage as our freedom and agreed to sort things out ourselves if we quarrelled. We were very compatible; indeed, I can only recall two occasions on which we quarrelled, and neither of us was afraid to apologise to the other. In all our years of marriage, it was never necessary for anyone to mediate between us over a misunderstanding because of that original meeting of minds.",
      "\"I never imagined that Maryam would pass away before I did, but the gift of life is in Allah's hands, not in humanity's. I am grateful for the life Maryam and I shared and for the fruit of our union. Coping without her has not been easy, but it has been made much less demanding by the memories of our life together and the length of her shadow,\" Babangida says.",
      "He describes Maryam as a devoted wife, mother, homemaker, and passionate advocate for rural women. Above all, he saw her as a true partner.",

    "story": [
      "One in five German voters put an X in the box for Alternative for Germany (AfD) on Sunday: a record result that has made them the second biggest force in German politics.",
      "Riding on the back of that success, the party is now calling for an end to the consensus in German politics not to work with the far right.",
      "That \"firewall\" - Brandmauer in German - has worked since the end of World War Two, but AfD joint leader Tino Chrupalla says: \"Anyone who erects firewalls will get grilled behind them.\"",
      "There is a determination among all of Germany's main parties to keep that block in place - and the German public backs them up: 69% see the AfD as a threat to democracy, according to voters surveyed on Sunday.",
      "Friedrich Merz, who won the election for the conservatives, believes the only reason the AfD exists is because of problems such as migration and security that need to be addressed: \"We need to resolve these problems... then that party, the AfD, will disappear.\"",
      "The AfD won 20.8% of the vote nationally, and as the light blue areas of the map show, it was dominant in the five states in the east, securing 34%.",
      "\"East Germans have made it very clear they no longer want a firewall,\" said Tino Chrupalla.",
      "Friedrich Merz will now go into talks on forming a government with the Social Democrats, who came third.",
      "Even though his party won 28.6% of the vote, it was still their second-worst result since World War Two.",
      "Support for the AfD doubled, and a million of their voters deserted Merz's conservatives for them, according to a survey by research institute Infratest dimap.",
      "Voters have not been put off by the fact that Germany's domestic intelligence classifies parts of the AfD as right-wing extremist - or that the party has now embraced a policy called \"remigration\".",
      "The AfD argues that remigration means deporting immigrants convicted of crime, but the term has been used by the extreme right to mean mass deportations.",
      "One of the big issues for the Christian Democrats is how to get their voters back and stop losing more.",
      "Merz has already flirted with the AfD in parliament, relying on their votes to push through a motion on migration.",
      "But he was clearly stung by a public outcry and the mass protests that followed in many German cities.",
      "Germany's chancellor-in-waiting is unlikely to try that again, especially if he forms a government with the centre-left.",
      "But now the AfD has more than 150 seats in parliament, its supporters in particular believe it is time for the firewall to go.",
      "\"I just hope that the firewall will fall. But we all know that it won't be like that,\" says pro-AfD TikTok influencer Celina Brychcy, 26.",
      "\"I think it will fall at the latest when new elections are held. Then they'll have to realise at some point they can't get through with what they're doing right now.\"",
      "\"I think the Brandmauer will stay,\" says Dominic, 30, who voted for the AfD in Saxony. \"I want the government to really think about their own people and their own country.\"",

      "Pressure to take down the long-standing firewall is not just coming from the AfD, but from leading figures in the Trump administration too, including US Vice-President JD Vance and Elon Musk, who has repeatedly backed the party.",
      "Most of the voices you hear challenging the firewall come from the east, which may not be surprising considering the deep reach of the AfD, especially in the five eastern states out of a total of 16 across Germany.",
      "They won 38.6% of the vote in Thuringia and 37.% in both Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt, far ahead of the CDU. It makes them increasingly difficult to keep at arm's length.",
      "On one of the big talkshows on German TV on Monday night, Harsh but Fair, one local mayor from Saxony, Mirko Geissler, believed the AfD should be put on the \"playing field\", so they could show what they could do. If not, they would end up surging to 40-50% in the polls, he warned.",
      "Liane Bach, an independent mayor from a village in Thuringia said that in her region, \"AfD voters aren't right-wing extremists\".",
      "A CDU politician on the programme, Phillip Amthor, conceded there should be \"no firewalls between the democratic parties and people who vote AfD\".",
      "That is the main issue the big national parties will have to address. How to avoid ostracising AfD voters who clearly have no problem with the firewall being breached.",
      "One mayor pointed out that one of her fellow residents who was also an AfD councillor was fixing the local fountain. It made no sense not to work with him.",
      "Prof Conrad Ziller from the University of Duisburg-Essen believes the greatest threat to the firewall could come at state level, rather than nationally.",
      "\"If you have trouble building a coalition in a state, then at some point, there could be a minority government that relies on the AfD, or gets votes from the AfD from time to time.\"",
      "On a national level, the worst-case scenario would be for a breakdown in a Merz-led coalition: \"Merz could make mistakes. If he gets really tough on immigration, it might become problematic with the SPD.\"",
      "Germany has already seen one early election because of a coalition collapse, and the AfD's Alice Weidel has made clear she is looking for early elections.",
      "Her repeated appearances on TV election debates have made her a prominent figure in Germany and helped raise her party's profile.",
      "But it was the constant focus on migration and security that became the number one issue for AfD voters, partly fuelled by three deadly attacks, all allegedly carried out by immigrants.",
      "Tackling insecurity, and the perception of it, will be an immediate task for the next government, when it eventually takes shape.",
      "Underlying the urgency, Bavaria's centre-right leader Markus S\u00f6der said the need to tackle immigration, along with Germany's faltering economy, was \"in fact, the last bullet of democracy\".",
      "There is no question of breaching the long-standing firewall for the moment.",
      "And the general secretary of Merz's party, Tom Unger, was adamant that there should be no collaboration with a party that opposed Germany's ties with the West, its membership of Nato and \"the European idea\".",

      "The deaths were found to be \"suspicious enough in nature\" to require a thorough investigation, a search warrant filed in New Mexico says.",
      "In an email to CBS News early Thursday, the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office said, \"Foul play is not suspected as a factor in those deaths at this time. However, (the) exact cause of death has not been determined.\"",
      "\"This is an active and ongoing investigation by the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office,\" the statement added.",
      "Hackman and Arakawa had been dead for some time and their bodies were found by deputies in different rooms, according to a search warrant obtained by CBS News. Hackman was found in a mudroom and Arakawa was found in a bathroom next to a space heater, and there was an open prescription bottle and pills on the counter near Arakawa, the warrant said.",
      "Hackman's daughters and granddaughter released a statement Thursday confirming the deaths.",
      "\"He was loved and admired by millions around the world for his brilliant acting career, but to us he was always just Dad and Grandpa,\" Elizabeth, Annie and Leslie Hackman said in the statement. \"We will miss him sorely and are devastated by the loss.\"",
      "Hackman was a consummate actor renowned for playing complicated figures in such classics as \"The French Connection,\" \"The Conversation\" and \"Unforgiven,\" and who also delighted superhero fans as the comical villain Lex Luthor in three \"Superman\" films.",
      "Hailed as one of the best actors of the era before retiring from the screen in 2004, Hackman moved easily among genres, from heart-wrenching family stories (\"I Never Sang for My Father\"), crime dramas (\"Bonnie and Clyde,\" \"Mississippi Burning\"), thrillers (\"The Conversation,\" \"No Way Out\"), and triumphant tales of sports (\"Hoosiers\") to comedies (\"Get Shorty,\" \"The Royal Tenenbaums\").",
      "Rough-hewn and flinty, a movie star without stereotypical movie-star looks, Hackman gave even his humorous roles a slightly sinister, unpredictable edge.",
      "The quality of Hackman's performances and the charisma that the shy ex-Marine would bring to the screen were praised by famed stage director Ulu Grosbard, who'd once hired him for a small role in Arthur Miller's \"A View from the Bridge.\" In a 2004 Vanity Fair profile, Grosbard described the actor as \"a complex guy. Very intelligent. A generosity of spirit. Socially charming. A lot going on in him. A certain sense of being tormented with past ghosts and things. That's part of what he brings to his work.\"",
      "\"Ghosts and things\" were likely evoked in three of Hackman's most heralded performances, in movies that redefined their genres. In William Friedkin's \"The French Connection\" (1971), Hackman played \"Popeye\" Doyle, a New York City detective unbound by rules, who constantly crossed the line between law officer and law breaker while tracking down the head of a drug ring. Dangerous and unpredictable, his Doyle was brash, vindictive and colorful, whether it was chasing down a suspect while wearing a Santa Claus costume or recklessly driving a car in pursuit of an assassin through the streets of Brooklyn.",
      "In Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Conversation\" (1974), he starred as Harry Caul, a surveillance expert whose wiretapping of his subjects leads to increased paranoia about his own safety when he believes he's uncovered evidence of a murder plot; and in Clint Eastwood's revisionist Western \"Unforgiven\" (1992), Hackman played \"Little\" Bill Daggett, the brutal sheriff of a Wyoming town who confronts Eastwood's bounty-hunting gunslinger.",
      "\"There was no finer actor than Gene,\" Eastwood said in a statement following Hackman's death. \"Intense and instinctive. Never a false note. He was also a dear friend whom I will miss very much.\"",
      "In a 2001 New York Times interview, Hackman noted that his scene in which he brutally beats up a bounty hunter played by Richard Harris was fueled by the disappointment that Harris hadn't remembered working with Hackman on the 1966 film \"Hawaii.\"",
      "\"I just took that disappointment and did this kind of transference,\" Hackman said.",
      "Hackman was less \"method-y\" than some of his peers, though he admitted that the ways in which he would behave on-screen and off as he inhabited a character \u2014 fueled by memories of his dysfunctional family growing up and the slights he faced during his struggling early years \u2014 took their toll. Temper tantrums earned him a nickname: \"Vesuvius.\"",
      "''I don't mean to live my roles,'' he told The Times. ''But sometimes I suppose it's not comfortable to be around me.''",
      "His success as an actor was merely one facet of Hackman's biography. He also raced sports cars, flew planes, deep-sea dived, painted, designed houses, and wrote or co-authored adventure and historical novels \u2014 living a life as varied and challenging as the roles for which he became famous. \"I need the diversity,\" he explained to CBS's \"Sunday Morning\" in 2000.",
      "\"One could say, you know, that I've achieved some manner of success,\" Hackman said. \"But it's like the difference between being a doctor and a lawyer, and being, maybe, a laborer. I feel that, in some ways, my efforts of being an actor are so all-instinctive, and that I haven't really paid my dues in terms of my contribution to the firmament.\"",
      "From character actor to star",
      "A shy and itinerant acting student, Hackman washed out of classes at the Pasadena Playhouse with the worst grades ever. He had several TV credits (including \"Naked City,\" \"The Defenders\" and \"Route 66\") and was featured in several light comedies on Broadway before appearing in the 1964 Warren Beatty film \"Lilith.\" After Hackman co-starred in \"Hawaii,\" \"A Covenant of Death\" and the war film \"First to Fight,\" Beatty hired him to play Buck Barrow, the older brother of bank robber Clyde Barrow, in the 1967 classic \"Bonnie and Clyde.\"",
      "The film, directed by Arthur Penn and produced by Beatty, was a shot across the bow of the studio system in its glamorous and violent dramatization of a pair of Depression Era lovers who robbed banks and killed people. After initially receiving lukewarm reviews over its blend of blood and sardonic humor, \"Bonnie and Clyde\" quickly garnered a reappraisal, spearheading Hollywood's own \"New Wave\" of filmmaking that revolutionized the industry in the late 1960s and '70s.",
      "It earned 10 Oscar nominations, including one for Hackman for best supporting actor.",
      "His film resume grew as a result, to include \"Riot,\" \"The Gypsy Moths,\" \"Downhill Racer,\" \"Marooned,\" and \"I Never Sang for My Father,\" earning Hackman his second Oscar nod for supporting actor, playing the son of a dominating parent (Melvyn Douglas).",
      "\"The French Connection\" would cement Hackman's position as a movie star. The film's brash, documentary-style production perfectly captured Hackman's character, a seething, sadistic NYC cop seeking to bust a ring of heroin smugglers \u2014 like Ahab on the hunt for the white whale.",
      "Although much of the film's heralded chase scene \u2014 in which Doyle, in a car, pursues an assassin who has hijacked an above-ground subway train \u2014\u00a0 featured stunt driver Bill Hickman, Hackman as Doyle did drive for some of it, crashing his car into a wall.",
      "At times during production, Hackman was unsure about his performance and asked to be fired. And then, after the film proved to be a hit, winning five Oscars \u2014 including for best picture, best director and best actor \u2014 he feared that he would be typecast as a determined cop thereafter. Hackman would return to the role in the 1975 sequel, \"French Connection II,\" in which he gave a grueling portrayal of Doyle suffering withdrawal from heroin addiction.",
      "His star power led him to both big-budget studio fare, headlining an all-star cast in the 1972 disaster film \"The Poseidon Adventure,\" and small character dramas such as \"Scarecrow,\" opposite Al Pacino, and \"Zandy's Bride,\" co-starring Liv Ullman. Other 1970s appearances included playing a private eye in the film noir \"Night Moves\"; a horseman competing in a cross-country race in the Western \"Bite the Bullet\"; a rum-runner in the Prohibition Era comedy \"Lucky Lady\" (opposite Burt Reynolds and Liza Minnelli); a contract killer in the conspiracy thriller \"The Domino Principle\"; and a World War II general in \"A Bridge Too Far.\"",
      "One of his most memorable turns was an unbilled cameo in Mel Brooks' \"Young Frankenstein,\" playing a blind hermit who spills hot soup into the lap of Peter Boyle's monster.",
      "Then came \"Superman\" (1978), in which Hackman, as Lex Luthor, faced off against Christopher Reeve's Man of Steel in a scheme that involved nuking the San Andreas Fault, which would make much of California slide into the ocean and turn Luthor's worthless desert land into prime seaside real estate.",
      "Hackman's criminal mastermind was wily, vain, cantankerous, and a bit too sure of himself. He told the BBC in 1986 that playing Luthor was great fun: \"He's kind of a flamboyant character and deranged, and all the things that actors love to play.\"",
      "Still, director Richard Donner had to go to lengths to coax Hackman into taking the job (a $2 million paycheck helped), and when the actor refused to shave off his mustache (let alone shave his head), Donner agreed to shave off his own mustache if Hackman got rid of his. Once the actor put a razor to his upper lip, Donner ripped off his own mustache \u2014\u00a0 a fake.",
      "He continued playing Luthor for the sequel (shot concurrently with the first film), but when Donner was fired by the producers and replaced for the remainder of what would be released as \"Superman II,\" Hackman walked. A body double and dubbed voice filled in for him. He later returned to the role in 1987's \"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace.\"",
      "\"Getting to be somebody\"",
      "Eugene Alden Hackman was born January 30, 1930 in San Bernadino, California. His father, a pressman for newspapers, moved the family several times during Hackman's youth before they settled in Danville, Illinois. It was there, when Gene was 13, that his father left the family with just a wave goodbye.",
      "Seeking escape from an uneasy family life, Gene was entranced by the movies. He idolized James Cagney and Errol Flynn, and vowed to become an actor himself. \"I loved the idea that somebody could convince me that they were a sea captain without being phony,\" he told Vanity Fair in 2004. \"I think because I was shy I felt insecure, and acting seemed like a way of maybe getting around that. Getting to be somebody.\"",
      "He dropped out of school and lied about his age to get into the Marine Corps, where he spent four and a half years. He got a taste of performing as an announcer on Armed Forces Radio, but injuries from a motorcycle accident led to his departure from the Marines, just in time to avoid fighting in the Korean War.",
      "He tried his hand at acting with classes at the Pasadena Playhouse, where his fellow students voted him (along with classmate Dustin Hoffman) \"Least Likely to Succeed.\" He picked up and moved to New York City, where he existed in a stream of menial jobs as he tried to create a path toward an acting career, aided and abetted by a circle that included Hoffman and Robert Duvall. Married, Hackman even shared his apartment with Hoffman for a time, as they experienced disappointments that would have crushed others.",
      "\"It was more psychological warfare, because I wasn't going to let those f*****s get me down,\" Hackman told Vanity Fair. \"I insisted with myself that I would continue to do whatever it took to get a job. It was like me against them, and in some way, unfortunately, I still feel that way. But I think if you're really interested in acting there is a part of you that relishes the struggle. It's a narcotic in the way that you are trained to do this work and nobody will let you do it, so you're a little bit nuts. You lie to people, you cheat, you do whatever it takes to get an audition, get a job.\"",
      "The rejections, he said, \"create a resolve in you that, no matter what kind of part you're given, you can do anything. Give me the challenge, I can do it. The scarier the better.\"",
      "\"He is incapable of bad work\"",
      "In the 1980s, his marriage with Faye Maltese, with whom he'd had three children, ended in divorce. Uncomfortable with life in Los Angeles, he contemplated retirement, though his desire for acting continued.",
      "His credits included \"All Night Long,\" \"Reds,\" \"Under Fire,\" \"Uncommon Valor,\" \"Twice in a Lifetime\" (a rare romantic role), \"Power,\" \"Hoosiers,\" \"No Way Out,\" \"Split Decisions,\" \"Bat*21,\" \"Another Woman,\" \"Postcards From the Edge,\" \"Narrow Margin\" and \"Class Action.\"",
      "In 1988's \"Mississippi Burning,\" Hackman's FBI agent scrapes against the by-the-book attitude of his colleague (played by Willem Dafoe) as they investigate the kidnapping and death of civil rights activists in 1964 Mississippi. Hackman earned his fourth Oscar nomination for his performance.",
      "Alan Parker, the film's director, said of Hackman, \"He is incapable of bad work. Every director has a short list of actors he'd die to work with, and I'll bet Gene's on every one.\"",
      "The '90s gave him further latitude to explore his considerable range, from John Grisham legal thrillers (\"The Firm,\" \"The Chamber,\" \"Runaway Jury\") to westerns (\"Unforgiven,\" \"Geronimo: An American Legend,\" \"The Quick and the Dead,\" \"Wyatt Earp\"). He brought heft and authority to the thrillers \"Crimson Tide,\" \"Extreme Measures,\" \"Absolute Power,\" \"Enemy of the State,\" \"Under Suspicion,\" \"Heist,\" and \"Behind Enemy Lines,\" and winking humanity to the comedies \"The Birdcage,\" \"Heartbreakers,\" \"The Royal Tenenbaums,\" and \"Welcome to Mooseport,\" his last film appearance.",
      "In 1992, he starred on Broadway in \"Death and the Maiden\" with Glenn Close and Richard Dreyfuss, under the direction of Mike Nichols.",
      "Hackman the writer",
      "He retired from the screen in 2004 and would only return as narrator on a pair of documentaries about the Marines. He lived in Santa Fe, New Mexico, with his second wife, Betsy Arakawa, and pursued his interests in art and writing.",
      "When he met up with Daniel Lenihan for some scuba lessons, the two got to talking about adventure books they grew up with and decided to try writing one \u2014 a pirate story. Hackman wrote his chapters longhand in spiral notebooks; the two would then meet up at a caf\u00e9 to go over their work. \"I would have some pages, he would have some pages,\" Hackman told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"We would trade. And we'd read them over while we were ordering and eating, and by the end of that couple of hours, we would have critiqued each other's work and decided where we were going to go from there.\"",
      "\"The Wake of the Perdido Star,\" a tale of shipwrecks and piracy set in 1805, was published in 1999. It sold well but received mixed reviews. The acclaimed actor now faced a new audience. He told \"Sunday Morning,\" \"The fact that you're being judged on your intelligence and your skill as a writer, and your skill as a storyteller, that was very tense for me \u2014 and being criticized, and finding that you're vulnerable to the critics, in a way that I hadn't experienced before.\"",
      "Hackman and Lenihan later collaborated on the crime drama \"Justice for None\" (2004) and the historical novel \"Escape From Andersonville\" (2008). Hackman then authored two books solo: a Western, \"Payback at Morning Peak,\" and a police thriller, \"Pursuit.\"",
      "His interest in writing may have been inherited from his grandfather, a reporter, and he'd explored that avenue of expression as far back at the 1980s when he'd optioned a crime novel by Thomas Harris that he'd hoped to adapt, direct and star in. But his screenplay grew distressingly overlong and he let the option slide. The book: \"The Silence of the Lambs.\"",
      "Hackman regularly refused interviews in his later years but in 2021, to mark the 50th anniversary of \"The French Connection,\" he shared with the New York Post the revelation that he'd only watched the film once. \"Filmmaking has always been risky \u2014 both physically and emotionally \u2014 but I do choose to consider that film a moment in a checkered career of hits and misses,\" he wrote in an email.",
      "As for the car chase, he added, \"There was a better one filmed a few years earlier with Steve McQueen,\" tipping his hat to the 1968 film \"Bullitt.\"",
      "Maybe. But at the conclusion of \"The French Connection\" chase, Hackman's \"Popeye\" Doyle, like so many of his other characters, refused to let his prey get the better of him.",

      "Erivo, who won a Tony Award, a Grammy and an Emmy for her role as Celie in the 2015 Broadway revival of \"The Color Purple,\" was previously nominated for two Academy Awards, for best actress and best original song, for the 2019 drama \"Harriet,\" about abolitionist Harriet Tubman.",
      "Erivo's performance as Elphaba is notable not just for her singing, which is astounding, but for singing live on set, rather than acting to pre-recorded vocal tracks. She said it allowed her to play, and change her performance, moment to moment: \"It means that you can act on impulse. \u2026 You have more breath, more space.\"",
      "She told \"CBS Mornings\" that she did change the character slightly from the original Broadway show (which was originated by Tony-winner Idina Menzel), in order to inform Elphaba with her own experience. \"I definitely felt like I had a responsibility to the character and to the piece because I didn't want to remove it so far away that you just didn't recognize her anymore,\" she said, \"but I also wanted to find out what the truth was for me playing this character. So, I knew it would feel different, but I wasn't trying to make it different. I just knew that if I told my truth, it would end up being different anyway. There's no need to force the difference in. Just happened.\"",

      "The operatic crime film \"Emilia Perez\" leads this year's Oscar nominations, with 13, including best picture, director and screenplay. Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, who plays the title character, became the first transgender woman to be nominated for an Academy Award for best actress.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n is introduced in the film as Juan \"Manitas\" Del Monte, a Mexican drug lord who kidnaps Rita, an attorney (best supporting actress Oscar nominee Zoe Salda\u00f1a), to hire her for an unusual task: Manitas wants to become a woman. A fake death is staged, Manitas' wife and children are relocated to Europe, and Manitas becomes Emilia P\u00e9rez.",
      "Flash forward to London, where, in this scene, Rita and Emilia are reunited:",
      "Emilia's desire to reconnect with her wife and children leads to an arrangement whereby Emilia pretends to be a distant relative. Tragedy follows. Written and directed by Jacques Audiard, the film is a highly theatrical musical that earned its four leads (Gasc\u00f3n, Salda\u00f1a, Selena Gomez and Adriana Paz) a shared best actress award at the Cannes Film Festival.",
      "In May, Gasc\u00f3n told the Associated Press, \"I want to get to the point where trans actresses are not limited to only playing trans characters. Just because you're trans doesn't mean you can't also play a lady going to the bakery. Just because you're trans doesn't mean you can't play a philosopher. Trans people are normal and ordinary just like anyone else. Not every trans person is engaged in prostitution on the street and if they do pursue it's because society rejects them, not necessarily because they wanted to do it. So, the opportunity for me to play these two roles is a gift from the universe. \u2026 It's marvelous to be able to find myself with roles like these.\"",
      "After Gasc\u00f3n's Oscar nomination was announced (she was also nominated for a BAFTA, Golden Globe, C\u00e9sar, and two Screen Actors Guild Awards), she received backlash over a series of offensive and racist social media posts she'd made several years earlier. In one, from 2021, she slammed the Academy Awards ceremony as something akin to \"an Afro-Korean festival, a Black Lives Matter demonstration or [International Women's Day].\" Other posts attacked Islam, Christianity, Catholicism, and George Floyd.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n apologized, and deleted the posts. But she was dropped from Netflix's promotional tour for \"Emilia P\u00e9rez,\" was absent from Spain's Goya Awards\u00a0and Britain's BAFTAs, and had a book cancelled. The film's director disavowed her, telling Deadline, \"I haven't spoken to her, and I don't want to.\"",
      "On February 9, at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival, Selena Gomez commented on the controversy swirling around \"Emilia P\u00e9rez\" and Gasc\u00f3n's posts: \"Some of the magic has disappeared, but I choose to continue to be proud of what I've done, and I'm just grateful. I live with no regrets,\" she said, adding, \"I would do this movie over and over again if I could.\"",

      "Mikey Madison, \"Anora\"",
      "Sean Baker's \"Anora,\" which won the top prize at last year's Cannes Film Festival, is a sly and at times uproarious comic-drama of a Brooklyn sex worker who enters into a Cinderella romance and marriage with the flighty son of Russian oligarchs. Mikey Madison portrays Anora (preferred name: Ani) as a woman older than her 25 years, but still young enough to believe in the sanctity of elopement, when she and her immature lover, Ivan (Mark Eydelshteyn), decide to tie the knot in Las Vegas.",
      "In this scene, Ani takes a stand about the working conditions at her club \u2013 she will not countenance rudeness from the DJ! (Note: Graphic language):",
      "In this scene, Ivan makes his proposal, to a young woman not quite sure whether to believe the guy (Note: Graphic language):",
      "Madison told Variety that it was a long, engaged process for her to get into the world Ani inhabited: \"It was a character that felt so far away from home in every single way. It was very intimidating at first; how do I empathize with her? I was like, I just need to start small. I did quite a bit of pole training. I did this stripper boot camp where I was taught how to give lap dances, how to twerk. And I would know everything about her \u2014 what cigarettes she smokes, what her school life was like.\"",
      "Madison, whose credits include Quentin Tarantino's \"Once Upon a Time \u2026 in Hollywood,\" \"Scream,\" and the TV series \"Better Things,\" told \"CBS Mornings\" that she \"absolutely fell in love\" with Ani when she read the character. \"She's such a complicated woman. There's so much nuance to who she is. She's so vulnerable on the inside, but she presents herself as this very fierce, tough person. And she has such a fighting spirit, and I was excited to explore all the different parts of what that would be.\"",
      "Baker, whose past films include \"The Florida Project,\" \"Tangerine\" and \"Prince of Broadway,\" told Madison he would write the character of Ani expressly for her if she agreed to be in his movie. \"It's very surreal, and I am very lucky, because I dreamed of working with someone like Sean my entire career as an actress,\" she said.",
      "Madison's accent in particular was key to her getting the character. She moved into the Brighton Beach neighborhood of Brooklyn a month before shooting, in order to absorb the sound of the locals. Luna Sof\u00eda Miranda, who plays Ani's best friend, Lulu, and who is herself a stripper, also instructed Madison on the vernacular of the world of \"gentlemen's clubs.\" \"She is amazing and was so sweet, and made me [two] PowerPoint presentations,\" Madison said. \"One of them was just stripper memes, and then another one was lingo and slang.\"",
      "What was some of the slang? \"Brick.\u00a0Oh, it's brick outside, which means it's cold. And then another one, I think, was a whale, which means a very wealthy, powerful person who comes into the club, someone who has a lot of money.\"",
      "Madison told the Hollywood Reporter that one of the lessons she learned from Baker was, \"He really made it clear that he cared about my ideas and what I was bringing to the film. The most important thing I learned from him is that my opinion and my voice matter.\"",
      "She returned to Brighton Beach since the film was released and found everything to be exactly the same. \"That's one of the things I love about Brighton Beach, is that it's such a time capsule. It's basically been the same for 30 years,\" she told \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "This is Madison's first Academy Award nomination. She won the BAFTA, was nominated for Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild Awards, and received best actress honors from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association (tying with Marianne Jean-Baptiste for \"Hard Truths\").",

      "Demi Moore, \"The Substance\"",
      "In the darkly comic body horror film \"The Substance,\" Demi Moore plays an aging TV star who discovers a sinister-looking potion that can give her a younger, more perfect version of herself, but at a terrible price.",
      "Moore, who has been a Hollywood fixture \u2013 and a target of the tabloid press \u2013 since the 1980s, told \"Sunday Morning\" that she recognized the story's message about the pains those in the public eye would go through to meet supposed social standards. \"I put so much pressure on myself,\" she said, when discussing the value she had placed on her attractiveness in the past. \"And I did have experiences of being told to lose weight. And all of those, while they may have been embarrassing and humiliating, it's what I did to myself because of that.\"",
      "In this scene, Moore's character, preparing for a date, looks in the mirror, applies makeup, then purposely smears it. She said the process of shooting that scene was difficult. \"Emotionally, that idea that I think many of us have been where we're trying to make something better, and then we just keep making it worse,\" she said. \"For me, it's one of the most heart-wrenching moments in the whole film. And it was at least 15 takes each time. And so, by the end, my face was raw.\"",
      "Asked what she thinks when she looks in a mirror, Moore replied, \"Uhm, it fluctuates. Some days I look and I'm like, Wow. That's pretty good. \u00a0And some days, I catch myself dissecting, hyper-focusing on, you know, things that I don't like.",
      "\"The difference is, now I can catch myself. I can go, Yeah, I don't like that loose skin. But, you know, it is what it is. So, I'm gonna make the best of what is, as opposed to chasing what isn't.\"",
      "Moore endured hours of body prosthetics, and spent much time naked on-screen. She told \"CBS Mornings,\" \"The interesting thing for me was the exploration of that violence we have against ourselves, the harshness of how we can sit in judgment \u2013 that heavily comparing and dissecting. That for me was something that really resonated, because I felt that was so human.\"",
      "She broke out in such films as \"St. Elmo's Fire\" and \"No Small Affair,\" and starred in \"The Seventh Sign,\" \"Ghost,\" \"A Few Good Men,\" \"Indecent Proposal,\" \"Striptease,\" \"G.I. Jane,\" and \"Margin Call.\"\u00a0 \"The Substance,\" which marks her first Oscar nomination, won Moore a Golden Globe for best motion picture actress (musical or comedy) and the Screen Actors Guild Award.",
      "\"Thirty years ago, I had a producer tell me that I was a popcorn actress,\" she said, accepting her Golden Globe. \"And at that time, I made that mean that this wasn't something that I was allowed to have. And so today, I celebrate this as a marker of my wholeness and of the love that is driving me. And for the gift of doing something I love and being reminded that I do belong.\"",
      "\"The Substance\" is in theaters and available on Mubi and via VOD.",
      "Fernanda Torres, \"I'm Still Here\"",
      "Brazilian actress Fernanda Torres won the Golden Globe for best motion picture actress (drama) for her performance as Eunice Paiva, the wife of politician Rubens Paiva, who opposed Brazil's military dictatorship in the 1960s and '70s. In 1971 Rubens was kidnapped by the military, tortured and killed.",
      "The film, directed by Walter Salles (\"Central Station,\" \"The Motorcycle Diaries\"), is based on the 2015 book \"I'm Still Here,\" written by Marcelo Rubens Palva, about his parents. \"[The book is] when we really discovered Eunice,\" Torres told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. \"The book is about the son in his adulthood discovering that the real hero of the family was not the father, not him, but it was this amazing woman called Eunice Paiva.\"",
      "It was a story almost lost to history. Following her husband's murder, Eunice \u2013 a housewife and mother of five \u2013 not only fights to protect her children, but also fights to confront a repressive system. She returned to university and became a lawyer, and eventually led efforts to protect the rights of Indigenous people in Brazil and for protection of the Amazon rain forest. But her contributions were never fully acknowledged by the public.",
      "\"It's like a woman who always fights the right fight, and she never had the will to be recognized by this, which is kind of strange nowadays,\" Torres said. \"She was a woman who never felt like it was important for [herself] to be recognized.\"",
      "In this scene, Eunice \u2013 alerted to the death of the family dog in front of their home \u2013 confronts two mysterious men parked across the street, who have been spying on her:",
      "Torres has appeared in more than 60 films and TV productions, including \"Love Me Forever or Never,\" \"The Invisible Woman,\" \"Foreign Land.\" She is the second Brazilian actress to be nominated for an Academy Award. The first? Her mother, Fernanda Montenegro, nominated for \"Central Station.\"",
      "Torres told W Magazine, \"I was raised in the wings of theaters. My father, Fernando, is also an actor and producer. And they named me Fernanda. So, I couldn't escape, you see? I paid a lot of hours in shrinks, and I really don't know how I did it, but I did it. I started working as an actress from the time I was 13 years old. \u2026 I find it a miracle. Isn't it a miracle? Even now, to be here with this film. The other day, I saw Judi Dench saying that there is a lot of luck involved in this business, and I think she's right.\"",
      "\"My mother reminded me a lot of Eunice \u2013 the intelligence, a kind of woman that is down-to-earth and courageous,\"\u00a0she told Interview Magazine. \"It's a form of femininity. It has so much to do with my childhood that I think it became universal because of that.",
      "\"It's a tragic story,\" she said. \"In tragedy, you face the unfaceable. You restrain, and you endure. That was very clear, and I never worked in anything like that, where I have restraint and change through the restraint. She was just like a sketch of what she could be, and after the disappearance of the man, she becomes herself, which is a beautiful tale.\"",
      "\"I'm Still Here\" has become a sensation in Brazil, where the nation's collective memory about the hundreds who disappeared under the dictatorship, and the 20,000 estimated to have been tortured under military rule across two decades, is being revived through the story of Eunice and her family. But the film also met with universal acclaim outside of Brazil, and earned Torres the Golden Globe for best motion picture actress (drama).",
      "Commenting on the packed category of actresses, Torres talked with \"Entertainment Tonight\" about her \"Cinderella night,\" at the Golden Globes, saying, \"Everybody deserves it. Everybody. So I don't know why they choose this street dog that speaks Portuguese, but I'm so glad!\"",
      "Like Gascon, Torres has been made to address her past, in her case a performance from 2008 in the Brazilian sketch comedy series \"Fantastico,\" in which she appeared in blackface. She told Deadline, \"At that time, despite the efforts of Black movements and organizations, the awareness of the racist history and symbolism of blackface hadn't yet entered the mainstream public consciousness in Brazil. Thanks to better cultural understanding and important but incomplete achievements in this century, it's very clear now in our country and everywhere that blackface is never acceptable.\"",
      "\"I'm Still Here,\" released by Sony Pictures Classics, is also nominated for best picture and best international feature film.  It is screening exclusively in theaters.",

      "Trachtenberg, a child actor who grew up in Brooklyn, appeared in her first commercials at age 3, according to the\u00a0movie database\u00a0IMDb. At 8 years old, she landed a role as Nona Mecklenberg on Nickelodeon's \"The Adventures of Pete & Pete,\" which ran from 1994 to 1996.",

      "Adrien Brody, \"The Brutalist\"",
      "In 2003 Adrien Brody became the youngest best actor Oscar-winner in history for his performance in Roman Polanski's \"The Pianist,\" as Wladyslaw Szpilman, a musician struggling to survive in the Jewish ghetto during the Nazi occupation of Poland. It was a role for which he virtually starved himself, losing 30 pounds, all while learning the piano so that he could play Chopin.",
      "Twenty-two years later, Brody is back with his second Oscar nomination for \"The Brutalist,\" Brady Corbet's lacerating tale of L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u00f3th, a Hungarian Jewish architect who emigrates to the United States, and his efforts both to resume his career and to assimilate in a society where antisemitism and classism are rife.",
      "T\u00f3th  is hired by a wealthy Pennsylvania industrialist to build a massive community center in his \"brutalist\" style \u2013 a form of architecture that's light on decoration and heavy on concrete. In this scene, T\u00f3th  \u2013 who is working a construction site in Pennsylvania \u2013 is discovered by Harrison Lee Van Buren (best supporting actor nominee Guy Pearce), who sees in T\u00f3th a talent for which he wants to be the patron.",
      "T\u00f3th  accepts a commission. But once his wife Erzs\u00e9bet (best supporting actress nominee Felicity Jones) arrives from Europe, T\u00f3th\u00a0 feels caught between his artistic impulses and the realities of working in an America that, in many cases, is closed to the foreign born:",
      "Brody, whose mother and grandparents fled Hungary during the 1956 revolution, said their sacrifices informed his performance. \"There was so much unknown, and a lot of loss,\" he told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"And all of those sacrifices have kind of laid the foundation for my own existence and what has been accessible to me.\"",
      "He also heard the voice of his Hungarian grandfather in T\u00f3th. \"I remember my grandfather's accent was very, very heavy,\" he said. \"I conjure it up. I also knew every bad word in Hungarian as a kid. So, I infused some of that in it that's not in the script!\"",
      "In this extended interview with \"Sunday Morning,\" Brody believes that empathy helped shape his own choices as an actor, \"trying to find films that have social relevance, or to represent people who don't have a voice and to give them that through me in some respect.\"",
      "Brody won the New York Film Critics Circle Award, the Golden Globe for best motion picture actor (drama), and the BAFTA for \"The Brutalist.\" The film received 10 Oscar nominations, including best picture and best director (Brady Corbet).",

      "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, \"A Complete Unknown\"",
      "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet earned his first best actor Oscar nomination at age 22 for \"Call Me By Your Name,\" as a teenage boy who becomes the target of an older man. In \"A Complete Unknown,\" Chalamet plays the iconic singer-songwriter Bob Dylan during the years when he made a name for himself as a folk artist and as a rock star who, to a segment of his fans, left the roots of folk music behind.",
      "In this scene Dylan is introduced by Pete Seeger (best supporting actor nominee Edward Norton) for his first appearance at New York's Folk City, where he performs \"I Was Young When I Left Home\":",
      "Prior to shooting, Chalamet travelled to Minnesota to research Dylan's roots and his formative days. He returned to the state for a screening of the finished film in Minneapolis. In December\u00a0Chalamet told CBS Minnesota station WCCO, \"I think he's very proud of his Minnesota heritage, and I think, in some ways, the way I relate to him is, I think the iron ore in his songs and the iron ore in his voice \u2014 as a New Yorker, as a 28-year-old New Yorker, I don't think my path would have really brought me out here, ever.",
      "\"So, the first time I got here I thought, 'Wow, what a gift, Bob Dylan, being in this guy's worldview.'\"",
      "The actor was first attached to the project in 2019, but shooting was repeatedly delayed due to COVID and then the actors' strike. In the intervening years, Chalamet learned how to play the guitar. \"I don't know if I'll ever get this much time to work on something in advance,\"\u00a0he told The Hollywood Reporter. He also gained 20 pounds prior to shooting, to better match the folk singer's physique.",
      "He said the role marked the furthest that he'd stretched himself. \"And it became so biblical to me in terms of this man's life and his work that I felt if I let my focus err for a second, that I'd be self-loathing about it for years to come. I had three months to play Bob Dylan, and the rest of my life I don't get to be about that, so why not give it my all?\"",
      "To connect with what the reclusive Dylan represented, the actor told \"60 Minutes\" he disconnected from his own life for the two-and-a-half months of filming. He did not use his cellphone, or have visitors on set. \"I've never approached a character so intensely as Bob, 'cause I have such respect for the material,\" Chalamet said. \"And I knew I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I remembered that I was lazy on a day when something went wrong.\"",
      "In addition to learning how to play the guitar and the harmonica, the actor told \"60 Minutes\" he learned to perform about 40 Bob Dylan songs \u2014 far more than were originally called for in the script. But while Chalamet pre-recorded all the Dylan songs he'd sing in the movie (to be played back on set during filming), he said they sounded \"too clean,\" and so he tried performing live on set, doing so the first time in a scene in which Dylan visits his terminally ill hero, folk artist Woody Guthrie, in a New Jersey hospital.",
      "Director James Mangold said he knew Chalamet nailed \"Song to Woody\" on his first take: \"There's a moment in that scene right at the last stanza where he holds a note \u2013 that would never have happened if we'd used the playback track,\" Mangold said.",
      "Chalamet also examined video of the singer, including footage taken of a Dylan performing a duet of \"It Ain't Me Babe\" with Joan Baez, which he played at a reduced speed. \"That was when I really slowed down, 'cause it's fascinating the way Bob observes her,\" he said. \"And how he refuses eye contact in that video.\"",
      "In \"A Complete Unknown,\" Chalamet and Barbaro perform \"It Ain't Me Babe\":",
      "Speaking of the finished film, Chalamet said, \"I was honored and counting my lucky stars that we got to bring this to life. Because nothing's a given. No opportunity is a given. No career is a given. I talked a lot about this with Edward Norton: the gift to work on something where every day \u2014 whether listening to the musicians we were playing, or the musicians that inspired them, or reading the authors that inspired them \u2014 you learn more about yourself.\"",
      "Chalamet told \"60 Minutes\" he's not sure what he'd say to Dylan if he ever did meet him \u2013 but maybe not even mention the movie, and only talk about the weather: \"What his favorite sandwich is, or something like that ... I would play it super cool, you know? 'Cause I feel like he's probably used to so much hyperbole and praise.\"",

      "At New York's Sing Sing prison, the organization Rehabilitation Through the Arts, or RTA, was formed to produce plays featuring incarcerated men performing classics by Shakespeare, as well as original plays that spoke to the lived experiences of men. \u00a0The value of theater as a tool of reform was made palpable by RTA's success; compared to the prison's typical recidivism rate of 60%, only 3% of former inmates who had taken part in RTA were back in prison three years or less after their release.",
      "Directed by Greg Kwedar, the film \"Sing Sing\" was built on the experiences of real-life former inmates (two of whom, Clarence Maclin and John Divine G Whitfield, share an Oscar nomination for best adapted screenplay). Colman Domingo was nominated for playing Divine G, a founding member of Sing Sing's theater program and an award-winning author.",
      "In this scene, Divine G attends a clemency hearing and describes to the commissioners how the prison program grew into something he calls \"wonderful\":",
      "Domingo was a journeyman actor whose work in recent years has exploded, from \"Fear the Walking Dead\" and \"Euphoria,\" to \"The Color Purple\" and \"The Madness.\" He received two Tony Award nominations (for acting in the musical \"The Scottsboro Boys\" and producing the play \"Fat Ham\"). He earned his first Oscar nomination last year for playing civil rights activist Bayard Rustin in \"Rustin.\"",
      "He talked about his recent success on \"CBS Mornings\"\u00a0last November: \"I feel that it's been a long time in my journey, where suddenly the roles are sort of meeting my skill set and what I'm curious about and what I can do. So, it just feels like I'm a journeyman actor. I've been working for 34 years, and it just feels like, I never knew what this time would be like.\"",
      "Last March, on the day of the Oscars, Domingo posted a picture of himself on Instagram as a child, writing, \"His dream came true. Not easily. With dedication, hard work, hardships, triumphs, pitfalls, detours, reroutes and love and faith. Today is a good day for this kid. He already won. And as you can tell he always loved a pop of color. Got it from his parents.\"",
      "That \"pop of color\" led to Domingo being asked by Anna Wintour to co-chair the 2025 Met Gala. \"She actually said, 'I'm not sure if you'd be interested in something like this or if you have time,'\" Domingo laughed. \"I said, 'I think I have time!'\"",

    "summary": "Lisa Jeanine Findley pleaded guilty to a charge of mail fraud in a plot to defraud Elvis Presley's family by trying to auction off his Graceland mansion and property.",
    "story": [
      "A Missouri woman pleaded guilty Tuesday to a federal charge accusing her of concocting a brazen plot to defraud Elvis Presley's family by trying to auction off his Graceland mansion and property before a judge halted the mysterious foreclosure sale.",
      "During a hearing in front of a Memphis federal judge, Lisa Jeanine Findley pleaded guilty to a charge of mail fraud related to the scheme. She previously pleaded not guilty to the two-count indictment, which also includes a count of aggravated identity theft that will now be dropped.",
      "When asked by the judge if Findley was admitting guilt and accepting responsibility, she said \"Yes.\" Findley will be sentenced on June 19. She would have faced up to 20 years if convicted, but she is expected to receive less than that under the plea deal.",
      "\"We are grateful for the hard work of the federal investigators and prosecutors who secured this conviction,\" Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said in a statement. \"Graceland matters so much to so many people around the world \u2013 just go to Memphis during Elvis Week and listen to all the different accents and languages of fans who make the pilgrimage. All of Tennessee is glad that Graceland remains safely in the possession of Elvis's heir and that it will remain a celebrated Memphis landmark for generations to come.\"",
      "Findley, of Kimberling City, falsely claimed Presley's daughter Lisa Marie Presley borrowed $3.8 million from a bogus private lender and had pledged Graceland as collateral for the loan\u00a0before her death in January 2023, prosecutors alleged when she was\u00a0charged in August 2024. She then threatened to sell Graceland to the highest bidder if Presley's family didn't pay a $2.85 million settlement, according to authorities.",
      "Findley posed as three different people allegedly involved with the fake lender, fabricated loan documents, and published a fraudulent foreclosure notice in a Memphis newspaper announcing the auction of Graceland in May 2024, prosecutors said. A judge stopped the sale after Presley's granddaughter Riley Keough sued.",
      "Experts were baffled by the attempt to sell off one of the most storied pieces of real estate in the country using names, emails and documents that were quickly suspected to be phony.",
      "In May, a public notice for a foreclosure sale of the 13-acre estate said Promenade Trust, which controls the Graceland museum, owes $3.8 million after failing to repay a 2018 loan. Keough inherited the trust and ownership of the home after the death of her mother, Lisa Marie Presley.",
      "Keough filed a lawsuit claiming fraud, and a judge halted the proposed auction with an injunction. Naussany Investments and Private Lending \u2014 the bogus lender authorities say Findley created \u2014 said Lisa Marie Presley had used Graceland as collateral for the loan, according to the foreclosure sale notice. Keough's lawsuit alleged that Naussany presented fraudulent documents regarding the loan in September 2023 and that Lisa Marie Presley never borrowed money from Naussany.",
      "Kimberly Philbrick, the notary whose name is listed on Naussany's documents, indicated she never met Lisa Marie Presley nor notarized any documents for her, according to the estate's lawsuit. The judge said the notary's affidavit brings into question \"the authenticity of the signature.\"",
      "The judge halted the foreclosure sale of the beloved Memphis tourist attraction, saying Elvis Presley's estate could be successful in arguing that a company's attempt to auction Graceland was fraudulent.",
      "Elvis bought Graceland in 1957 and died there in 1977, and about five years later, the mansion was opened to the public as a museum and tourist attraction. Hundreds of thousands of tourists visit the 17,552-square-foot mansion each year, which was named to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. Visitors can then stop at the large Presley-themed entertainment complex across the street.",
      "Elvis and other members of the Presley family, including Lisa Marie Presley and her son, Benjamin Keough, who died by suicide in 2020, are buried on the mansion's grounds.",
      "Keough, who starred in the television series hit \"Daisy Jones and The Six,\" said in a 2024 interview\u00a0with CBS News that she plans to continue running the beloved property and keep the mansion in the family. Keough and her husband Ben Smith-Peterson have a\u00a0daughter, Tupelo,\u00a0who is Elvis' first great-grandchild.",
      "\"I think, like, my instinct with everything is always to do what my mother would have wanted. Which is to keep it a home,\" Keough told CBS News last year. \"It was our family's home.\"",

She was 88.",
      "She died at home surrounded by her family, publicist Elaine Schock said in a statement. Flack announced in 2022 she had ALS, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, and could no longer sing.",
      "Little known before her early 30s, Flack became an overnight star after Clint Eastwood used \"The First Time I Ever Saw Your Face\" as the soundtrack for one of cinema's more memorable and explicit love scenes, between the actor and Donna Mills in his 1971 film \"Play Misty for Me.\" The hushed, hymn-like ballad, with Flack's graceful soprano afloat on a bed of soft strings and piano, topped the Billboard pop chart in 1972 and received a Grammy for record of the year.",
      "\"The record label wanted to have it re-recorded with a faster tempo, but he said he wanted it exactly as it was,\" Flack told The Associated Press in 2018. \"With the song as a theme song for his movie, it gained a lot of popularity and then took off.\"",
      "In 1973, she matched both achievements with \"Killing Me Softly With His Song,\" becoming the first artist to win consecutive Grammys for best record.",
      "She was a classically trained pianist discovered in the late 1960s by jazz musician Les McCann, who later wrote that \"her voice touched, tapped, trapped, and kicked every emotion I've ever known.\" Versatile enough to summon the up-tempo gospel passion of Aretha Franklin, Flack often favored a more reflective and measured approach.",
      "For Flack's many admirers, she was a sophisticated and bold new presence in the music world and in the social and civil rights movements of the time, her friends including the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Angela Davis, whom Flack visited in prison while Davis faced charges \u2014 for which she was acquitted \u2014 for murder and kidnapping. Flack sang at the funeral of Jackie Robinson, Major League Baseball's first Black player, and was among the many guest performers on the feminist children's entertainment project created by Marlo Thomas, \"Free to Be ... You and Me.\"",
      "Roberta Cleopatra Flack, the daughter of musicians, was born in Black Mountain, North Carolina, and raised in Arlington, Virginia. A gospel fan as a child, she was so talented a piano player that at age 15 she received a full scholarship to Howard, the historically Black university.",
      "Flack's other hits from the 1970s included the cozy \"Feel Like Makin' Love\" and two duets with her close friend and former Howard University classmate Donny Hathaway, \"Where Is the Love\" and \"The Closer I Get to You\" \u2014 a partnership that ended in tragedy. In 1979, she and Hathaway were working on an album of duets when he suffered a breakdown during recording and later that night fell to his death from his hotel room in Manhattan.",
      "\"We were deeply connected creatively,\" Flack told Vibe in 2022, upon the 50th anniversary of the million-selling \"Roberta Flack and Donny Hathaway\" album. \"He could play anything, sing anything. Our musical synergy was unlike (anything) I'd had before or since.\"",
      "She never matched her first run of success, although she did have a hit in the 1980s with the Peabo Bryson duet \"Tonight, I Celebrate My Love\" and in the 1990s with the Maxi Priest duet \"Set the Night to Music.\" In the mid-90s, Flack received new attention after the Fugees recorded a Grammy-winning cover of \"Killing Me Softly,\" which she eventually performed on stage with the hip-hop group.",
      "Overall, she won five Grammys (three for \"Killing Me Softly\"), was nominated eight other times and was given a lifetime achievement Grammy in 2020, with John Legend and Ariana Grande among those praising her.",
      "\"I love that connection to other artists because we understand music, we live music, it's our language,\" Flack told songwriteruniverse.com in 2020. \"Through music we understand what we are thinking and feeling. No matter what challenge life presents, I am at home with my piano, on a stage, with my band, in the studio, listening to music. I can find my way when I hear music.\"",
      "In 2022, Beyonc\u00e9 placed Flack, Franklin and Diana Ross among others in a special pantheon of heroines name-checked in the Grammy-nominated \"Queens Remix\" of \"Break My Soul.\"",
      "Flack was briefly married to Stephen Novosel, an interracial relationship that led to tension with each of their families, and earlier had a son, the singer and keyboardist Bernard Wright. For years, she lived in Manhattan's Dakota apartment building, on the same floor as John Lennon and Yoko Ono, who became a close friend and provided liner notes for a Flack album of Beatles covers, \"Let It Be Roberta.\" She also devoted extensive time to the Roberta Flack School of Music, based in New York and attended mostly by students between ages 6 to 14.",
      "Flack had taught music in D.C.-area junior high schools for several years in her 20s, while performing after hours in clubs. She sometimes backed other singers, but her own shows at Washington's renowned Mr. Henry's attracted such celebrity patrons as Burt Bacharach, Ramsey Lewis and Johnny Mathis. The club's owner, Henry Yaffe, converted an apartment directly above into a private studio, the Roberta Flack Room.",
      "\"I wanted to be successful, a serious all-round musician,\" she told The Telegraph in 2015. \"I listened to a lot of Aretha, the Drifters, trying to do some of that myself, playing, teaching.\"",
      "Flack was signed to Atlantic Records and her debut album, \"First Take,\" a blend of gospel, soul, flamenco and jazz, came out in 1969. One track was a love song by the English folk artist Ewan MacColl: \"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,\" written in 1957 for his future wife, singer Peggy Seeger. Flack not only knew of the ballad, but used it while working with a glee club during her years as an educator.",
      "\"I was teaching at Banneker Junior High in Washington, D.C. It was part of the city where kids weren't that privileged, but they were privileged enough to have music education. I really wanted them to read music. First, I'd get their attention. (Flack starts singing a Supremes hit) 'Stop, in the name of love.' Then I could teach them!\" she told the Tampa Bay Times in 2012.",
      "\"You have to do all sorts of things when you're dealing with kids in the inner-city,\" she said. \"I knew they'd like the part where ('The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face') goes 'The first time ever I kissed your mouth.'

    "story": [
      "Not long ago, soap operas ruled daytime TV. The casts of shows like \"General Hospital,\" \"All My Children\" and \"Days of Our Lives\" became part of daily life in the United States.",
      "For the first time in more than 25 years, a new daytime soap opera will debut and it is already making\u00a0history.",
      "\"Beyond the Gates\" focuses on the Dupree family, a prominent Black family living in a gated community outside Washington, D.C. Leading the cast are actors Clifton Davis and Tamara Tunie with Daphn\u00e9e Duplaix and Karla Mosley portraying their daughters.",
      "\"It's fresh, it's innovative, it's exciting,\" Duplaix said during production in December.",
      "\"This is 2025,\" added Tunie. \"The writers came out swinging. The first episode is just like 'Pfooom!'\"",
      "Those writers are making their own history with the show.",
      "\"It appears to be that we're the first Black female executive producers in all of daytime drama,\" said Sheila Ducksworth, an executive producer and president of this CBS/NAACP production.",
      "Ducksworth partnered with Michele Val Jean, who serves as executive producer, head writer and showrunner.",
      "\"I'd say it's been a couple of decades in the making that I've wanted to actually produce and make a soap opera,\" Ducksworth said. \"But what I felt was missing was one that centered on the Black experience.\"",
      "Val Jean shared a similar vision: \"I just wanted to see people that looked like me. I didn't want downtrodden Black people. I wanted rich, messy Black people that carry the stories.\"",
      "That inclusive approach extends behind the camera.",
      "\"I look around, and I see African American cameramen. I see the costumers, and lighting, and crew,\" Davis said.",
      "\"The writers, the makeup, the hair,\" Duplaix added.",
      "During a December filming, a crew of more than 200 people worked around the clock to bring the show to life. Hair designer Wankaya Hinkson emphasized the importance of representation in the production.",
      "\"Bringing the culture to daytime television was very important to me,\" Hinkson said. \"I want everyone to be able to identify themselves on daytime television.\"",
      "Historically, hair and makeup departments often lacked people who knew how to work with actors of color, but \"Beyond the Gates\" has prioritized expertise in this area.",
      "\"We wear our hair many, many different ways,\" Hinkson explained. \"It's a part of our Black girl magic. I wanted to make sure that I had different textures.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 23 Feb 2025 10:09:04 -0500",
    "summary": "The game is simple: can one player outwit, outplay and outlast 17 others isolated on a South Pacific island to win the $1 million prize? \"Sunday Morning\" travels to Fiji to go behind-the-scenes of a pioneer of reality TV with host Jeff Probst.",
    "story": [
      "Divide 18 strangers into three \"tribes\"; drop them on remote islands with little food and no shelter, and have them outwit and outplay one another until the last competitor standing is crowned the winner of a $1 million prize. When the adventure reality game show \"Survivor\" debuted on CBS in May 2000, nothing like it had been seen on American television before.",
      "Asked to describe the series, \"Survivor\" host and showrunner Jeff Probst said, \"It is a social experiment, in that it takes a group of people who don't know each other, and forces them to rely on each other, while playing this game where you vote each other out.\"",
      "Probst invited \"Sunday Morning\" to watch this experiment for ourselves, in Fiji, as he began taping Season 48, which premieres on CBS and Paramount+ this Wednesday.",
      "Asked if he still gets nervous hosting the series for the 48th time, Probst replied, \"I don't get nervous on 'Survivor.' It's weird. I've never gotten nervous. I lean into it. I love the uncertainty.\"",
      "And it's this uncertainty that's made \"Survivor\" one of the most popular shows on television for a quarter of a century. The show averages around 6 million viewers an episode. In the past 24 years, fans have collectively watched ten-and-a-half billion hours.",
      "\"When I knew 'Survivor' was going to be interesting was the first day of the first season,\" said Probst, \"when we abandoned everybody on the beach, and Richard Hatch \u2013 who ended up winning the first season \u2013 got up in a power position in a tree. And he was looking down on everyone, and he said, 'I think we should all talk!'\u00a0 And Sue Hawk, a truck driver from Wisconsin, looked up and said, 'Where I'm from, we work while we talk.'\"",
      "While Probst had no doubt, \"Survivor\" almost didn't happen. Mark Burnett, the British TV producer behind hits like \"The Apprentice\" and \"Shark Tank\" (and now President Trump's newly-appointed special envoy to the United Kingdom), re-imagined a Swedish reality series (\"Expedition: Robinson\") and took his idea to just about every U.S. TV network.",
      "\"And every network said, 'No. That's a crazy idea. We don't wanna do it,'\" said Probst. \"But Mark is not easily deterred. So, he went out and got sponsors for the entire show.\"",
      "At the time, Probst hosted music shows on cable TV (including VH1's \"Rock & Roll Jeopardy!\"). \"I was literally the last person hired,\" he said. \"I heard Mark talking about 'Survivor' on a radio interview. And he described the show. I knew when I heard it; I told all my friends, 'This is my show, this is what I've been waiting for.'\"",
      "Today, Probst (now also the showrunner) has his hands in every aspect of production, including combing through more than 15,000 audition tapes that arrive each year. \"I know within 30 seconds, honestly, within 30 seconds, I'm pretty sure you're gonna be on the show or not,\" he said. \"Some people are compelling immediately.\"",
      "People like Stephanie Berger, a technical product manager from New York City, and one of this season's chosen ones. Asked in Fiji what her strategy for the game will be, Berger replied, \"In my, like, day-to-day life, everyone will tell you that I get to be the alpha, like, I like to be in charge. I like control. And I know that I cannot come out here and do that.\"",
      "Kyle Fraser is a contestant from Roanoke, Virginia. \"When I first started watching 'Survivor,' I knew that this game was for me,\" he said.",
      "I asked, \"Are you willing to lie? Like, where do you draw the line in your game?\"",
      "\"Listen, I am gonna have to lie,\" Fraser said. \"You know, I'm not gonna tell people I'm a lawyer.\"",
      "Contestants not only need to build trust through any means possible; they have to win mental and physical challenges from the moment they arrive, or risk getting voted off.",
      "Probst says what we see is never staged or scripted, including tribal councils, where he grills contestants off-the-cuff, a skill he's developed over time.",
      "I said, \"You're a student of psychology and anthropology.\"",
      "\"Without the degrees!\" Probst laughed. \"I've always loved all of that. I just never formally applied it. I didn't want to be a psychologist; I wanted to be a storyteller.\"",
      "What does make it on television is carefully selected from thousands of hours worth of video shot around the clock for 26 days, in what is one of the largest television productions on Earth. \"It's a great trick, because when you're watching 'Survivor' it does feel intimate, and it is,\" Probst said. \"When the tribes are on the beaches, there's just a small handful of crew there and producers. But when you get to a challenge or tribal council, you know, there's cameras everywhere. We have roughly 400 people that are our international crew. Then we have another 400 Fijians who work with us as well. So, we're close to 1,000 people.\"",
      "Each season films in the summer, with crews arriving months in advance, turning a resort into a production village.",
      "Roberta Limjap, who works in the art department, said, \"It's not only work, it's family.\"",
      "All of the materials, equipment and props are produced here. \"Everything is made from scratch,\" she said. \"You can't buy this.\"",
      "Dozens of young production assistants test every detail of the challenges while crews plot camera angles.",
      "I had my chance. And yes, it's much harder than it looks. And tribal members often compete exhausted and hungry. They are not fed when the cameras are off.",
      "I tried my hand at survival. Opening up a coconut is not easy. \"You know what I'm afraid of? Taking off my thumb,\" I laughed.",
      "Co-executive producer Jimmy Quigley coached me through starting a fire, while on my first try with a spear gun, I caught a fish. Beginner's luck!",
      "What isn't luck is \"Survivor\"'s staying power. \"That freedom to play is what keeps us out here in the middle of Fiji,\" said Probst, who \u2013 after 47 seasons \u2013 is the ultimate survivor.",
      "\"It sounds like you're in this until the end?\" I asked.",
      "\"I'm in it now,\" Probst replied. \"I don't have any thoughts of not being in it. But I mean, yeah, if you're saying at 86, I mean, maybe I'm too old then! But I never really look at it that way. I feel like I'm a part of a team. And I've said to the people I work with, 'As long as you all keep showing up, I'll keep showin' up.'\"",

    "summary": "With 18 galleries around the globe, he's been called \"the biggest art dealer in the history of the world.\" Larry Gagosian talks about his estimated billion-dollar-a-year business and why, at age 79, he's still energized by the hustle.",
    "story": [
      "On any night, he can have art openings in Paris, in London, or at his flagship gallery in New York. With 18 galleries around the globe, Larry Gagosian has more exhibition space than most museums. His annual revenues are estimated at over a billion dollars, which (as The New Yorker put it) may make Gagosian \"the biggest art dealer in the history of the world.\"",
      "In 2022, when Andy Warhol's \"Shot Sage Blue Marilyn\" set an auction record for a 20th century artist at Christie's, the winning bidder was Larry Gagosian. The final price, with fees: $195 million.",
      "I asked, \"That must have been a crazy moment?\"",
      "\"When you're bidding at that level,\" Gagosian said, \"your adrenaline is \u2026 it's very exciting.\"",
      "\"It's a brutal business.\"",
      "\"It's a blood sport.\"",
      "\"What do you love about this most?\" I asked.",
      "\"I love the challenge,\" Gagosian smiled. \"I love winning.\"",
      "Gagosian represents more than 100 artists, and shows the works of Picasso, Warhol, and de Kooning. His clients include billionaire mega-collectors like New York Mets owner Steve Cohen, music mogul David Geffen, and cosmetics heir Leonard Lauder. Gagosian said, \"That's why New York is such a great city for an art dealer, because you have all these super-competitive rich guys trying to (you know, in a certain way) outdo each other \u2013 'I got one.' 'Oh, I got one better.'\"",
      "Gagosian, who grew up in an Armenian family in Los Angeles, never had any formal art training. In the 1970s, he was working as a parking attendant. Then he saw somebody selling posters on the street. \"I saw that and I said, 'Jeez, I could do that.' And so, I bought basically the same posters, I literally paid a dollar apiece, and then put a little aluminum frame on them and put 'em on a peg board and tried to get as close to twenty bucks as I could, which is a pretty good profit margin.\"",
      "He built it into a business, and started having shows. In 1981, a young New York artist caught his eye: Jean-Michel Basquiat. Gagosian bought three of his paintings on the spot. \"And sadly, I sold them all. Wish I still owned them!\"",
      "He'd give Basquiat his first West Coast exhibition, which put Gagosian's gallery on the map. \"It was a big deal in L.A.,\" he said. \"We did the show and it was, like, mobbed. The buzz was \u2013 I'd never experienced anything like that in my gallery.\"",
      "But Gagosian knew that New York was the center of the art world, and in 1985, he relocated.",
      "How was he received in the New York art world? \"They didn't like me,\" he said. \"I guess they thought I was gonna, you know, cause some trouble.\"",
      "\"Well, you kinda did!\" I said.",
      "\"I'd rather not go into that litany, but I was roughed up quite a bit by competitors, I think very unfairly.\"",
      "He earned a nickname, \"Gogo,\" which he says actually started when he was young. \"When I was kid, my friends had a hard time pronouncing my name, Gagosian. And that's really where it started. But then it became, people associate it with something else.\"",
      "But Gagosian made an important ally, the esteemed dealer Leo Castelli. On a walk together one day, Castelli stopped a non-descript man in the street: \"And so I said, 'Well, who was that?' 'Oh, that's Si Newhouse.' And I'll never forget his very words: 'He can buy anything.'\"",
      "Newhouse, who owned the Cond\u00e9 Nast magazine empire, would become Gagosian's first big client. At Sotheby's 1988 auction of Jasper Johns' painting \"False Start,\" they sat side-by-side: \"He didn't want to be seen bidding,\" said Gagosian. \"So, he would literally nudge me when he wanted to bid. And I bid, I think it was $17 million. And he got the painting.\"",
      "It was a record for a living artist at the time. \"It was, you know, like, jaw-dropping,\" Gagosian said.",
      "But that price seems almost quaint today.",
      "I asked, \"Do you think there's a billion-dollar painting out there?\"",
      "\"Maybe; I don't see why not,\" Gagosian replied. \"A young artist, if he's really talented, can sell for a million dollars.\"",
      "I asked Gagosian about the comments of one of his former rivals, Arne Glimcher of Pace Gallery, who said five years ago, \"This market has nothing to do with art. It's all about how fast one can make money.\"",
      "\"You know, there's a certain truth to what he's saying,\" Gagosian said, \"but I don't think it's just about money at all. I don't think, if people didn't love art, you know, I think they wouldn't buy it at that level. I don't think it's just an asset class. And it's not just about money. It's just gotten more expensive to buy really great art.\"",
      "\"Do you think in any way it distances ordinary people from loving art?\"",
      "\"No. I think it actually makes art seem more interesting. Wow! Somebody spent X amount of money for a painting? Wow, that's fascinating!\"",
      "Gagosian \u2013 who's had some high-profile romances, is single, and has no children \u2013 is still energized by the hustle. \"I guess to a degree I thrive on it,\" he said. \"It gives you something to go for.\"",
      "\"Why do you thrive on it?\"",
      "\"Cause I'm tenacious. And because I like to win.\"",
      "\"What's the win for you?\"",
      "\"The win is to keep it going. The win is to survive at the top. There's no real finish line.\"",
      "But there is, of course. Gagosian turns 80 in April. And the man who GQ magazine called \"The closest thing the art world has to a Caesar,\" still has no plans of succession for his empire.",
      "So, can there be a Gagosian without Gagosian? \"I don't know; that's the question,\" he said. \"I don't want to think it's an impossibility. I think it's a serious challenge. But I'm not ready to pass the reins. I enjoy it too much.\"",
      "I asked, \"Are you ever gonna be, do you think?\"",
      "\"No.\"",
      "\"Well, it kind of means you're, like, never at rest.\"",
      "\"Well, there's no time to rest, really. It's overrated!\" he laughed.",

      "This season's influenza vaccines may have been less effective against emergency room visits for some kids compared to last year, a new study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests, though effectiveness was still high against hospitalization.",
      "So far this season, the vaccine's protection against flu hospitalization was at least 63% for children and at least 41% for adults. These estimates of effectiveness against hospitalization, released Thursday in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, are considered high for flu vaccines.",

Effectiveness was 32% for children and adolescents, from the CDC's U.S. Flu VE network of health care systems. That's down from 67% in last year's estimates.",
      "Those figures are lower than from another network of outpatient providers in the report. The study's authors suspect the decline is because of a difference in how many kids were infected in each by a strain of the flu virus called H3N2.",

      "The predominant symptoms reported are diarrhea and vomiting, the Vessel Sanitation Program said. The ship's crew increased cleaning and disinfection procedures, isolated ill passengers and crew members, and collected stool specimens for testing, the program said. The crew will stay in contact with the Vessel Sanitation Program to consult on sanitation procedures and report any additional illnesses.",
      "\"During its current voyage, a number of guests onboard Eurodam reported symptoms of gastrointestinal illness.

What's the plan for flu vaccines this year,\" Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the FDA advisory committee and director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told CBS News.",
      "Offit said he received the notification that the meeting was canceled shortly after 4 p.m. The FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee was supposed to meet on March 13 to discuss how to update the shots for the next flu season, Offit said.",
      "Some of the other committee members said they had not received any notification about the upcoming meeting being canceled. Offit said the email he received was addressed to all of the committee's members.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services confirmed Thursday that the meeting had been canceled.",
      "\"The FDA will make public its recommendations to manufacturers in time for updated vaccines to be available for the 2025-2026 influenza season,\" the spokesperson, Andrew Nixon, said in a statement.",
      "It is possible for the FDA to make the pick for flu shots without consulting the panel, a former federal health official said, though it would be unprecedented in recent history.",
      "The panel often largely adopts the WHO's recommendations without changes. However, the committee's input has also spurred major changes in recent years, like a push to abandon use of a now-extinct flu strain in the shots.",
      "The companies that manufacture influenza vaccines rely on the FDA each year to pick out the strains to use in shots made for the American market. The specific strains are chosen each year based on predictions of what flu variants will be circulating in the coming winter.",
      "That selection is usually done by the committee in early March, drawing in large part on recommendations from a meeting of the World Health Organization's advisers reviewing data on influenza from across the Northern Hemisphere.",
      "\"Because the vaccine is grown in eggs, for the most part, it requires six months to produce. So March is six months before September, which is when these vaccines roll out,\" said Offit.",
      "Last year, the FDA asked the committee to meet on March 5 to decide on how to update the influenza shots for the 2024 to 2025 season.",
      "The agency usually announces these meeting dates around a month in advance. Next month's meeting had not yet been publicly disclosed.",
      "Which strains are picked to be targeted by the vaccines can have a significant impact on how effective the shots are.",
      "Early data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's testing suggests that this past season's vaccine may have been a poor match for one of the common strains of the virus. More data on the effectiveness of the vaccine is expected to be released Thursday.",
      "The cancellation is just the latest federal vaccine meeting to be disrupted.",

    "published": "Sun, 23 Feb 2025 11:33:27 -0500",
    "summary": "Arline Geronimus' research shows how societal pressures like institutional racism, classism, financial stressors or the environmental can impact not just the length of life, but also the quality of life for marginalized communities suffering chronic diseases.",
    "story": [
      "Forty years ago, the public was outraged.\u00a0 It seemed there was a wave of teenage girls, particularly Black teenage girls, getting pregnant. \"This was a new idea, this new deviant class of people, and it was portrayed in these terms that were really not accurate: babies having babies,\" said Arline Geronimus.",
      "Geronimus was at the time a graduate student.\u00a0 The prevailing wisdom was that high rates of infant mortality in the Black community were because women were having children when they were too young. \"I had worked in a school for pregnant teens. And none of what I was hearing, and had taken as common sense myself, was what I was seeing,\" she said.",
      "Geronimus looked at the numbers and found that, actually, younger mothers were having more successful pregnancies. She said, \"For the Black women, the lowest risk ages were in the teens and the late teens. And then they went straight up, so that by the 20s, and certainly by the mid-to-late 20s, there was substantially more risk of infant mortality if you had a baby, compared to if you were 18 or 19. And by 35, things were off the charts.\"",
      "How did people react to what she found? \"Not very well!\" Geronimus said. \"People thought I was promoting teen childbearing. The papers wrote columns where they called it things like, 'Research Queen Says Let Them Have Babies.'\u00a0 I got death threats.\"",
      "Geronimus became a professor at the School of Public Health at the University of Michigan, where she teaches to this day. She lowered her profile, but also widened her perspective, examining indicators like the lower life expectancy of Black Americans (72.8 years) compared to white Americans (77.5).",
      "She developed a theory: that stress caused by racism and other societal pressures contributes to poor health. She named it \"Weathering.\"",
      "\"The idea of weathering was connoting sort of how a rock, for example, would be weathered by hundreds of years of rain and wind,\" she said. \"It's gonna affect it [and] absolutely wear it down. I like the word weathering in particular, because it also has another meaning, which is that you weather the storm.\"",
      "The weathering theory deals with not just length of life, but quality of life. For example, while on average Black women outlive white men (76.5 years versus 75.1), Geronimus found that Black women faced shorter active life expectancies (59 years) than white men (64) \u2013 that is, Black women become disabled at earlier ages.",
      "After decades of working on the theory, she pulled it all together in a book called, \"Weathering: The Extraordinary Stress of Ordinary Life in an Unjust Society\" (Little, Brown Spark).\u00a0 She defines weathering as the way that structural racism makes life very hard. But there are a lot of different factors. \"This is not something that just affects people of color; it can be a class issue as well?\" I asked.",
      "Geronimus said, \"It can be a class issue, it can be a stigmatized group issue; anybody who's human is capable of becoming weathered, and will become weathered to some degree, if they're also oppressed or marginalized or suffering endless stressors, whether it's environmental or material hardships or hunger, or whether it's the fact that you're not affirmed or valued, and you have to question where you belong, and what it's safe to do or say in different situations.\"",
      "Dr. Kimberlydawn Wisdom has spent much of her career putting Geronimus' theories into practice, trying to overcome the impacts of weathering: \"She endured a lot for this work. And we just have to applaud her. Her courage is remarkable.\"",
      "Wisdom is the senior vice president of community health and equity at Henry Ford Health in Detroit. She also served as Michigan's first surgeon general.",
      "She notes how day-to-day stress actually changes the body down to the cellular level, leading to premature aging. \"The body keeps score,\" she said. \"So, take diabetes, take hypertension, take cardiovascular disease, infant mortality, maternal mortality \u2013 just multiply the poor outcome by two or by three, and that's what you see in the populations of color. So, it's like the Caucasian population can catch a cold, but populations of color actually develop pneumonia.\"",
      "For example, the latest studies show infant mortality rates for Black Americans that are more than double those of white Americans (10.9 versus 4.52).",
      "To take on the challenge, Dr. Wisdom founded the WIN Network, which stands for the Women-Inspired Neighborhood Network. Expectant mothers are given health care, guidance and support through pregnancy and beyond, which has led to maternal and infant deaths falling, and birthweights rising.",
      "Courtney Anderson said the experience of having her third child, Kalani, through WIN was great. \"She's a happy baby. Most happiest baby I got,\" Anderson said.",
      "Anderson had her first child, Kamrine, before she was in the WIN Network. He was followed a year later by his brother, Kristian. \"With my first child \u2026 I had my hands full, kind of stressed. Kind of bummed out. Post-partum depression.\" But she says the support she received through WIN was a major improvement, increasing her happiness, which in turn has impacted her children positively. \"It's going to affect them really well to know that their mom's happy,\" Anderson said. \"When mom is happy, they get it, and they have a lot more.\"",
      "I asked Wisdom, \"What would you say to people who would kind of maybe blow this off and say, 'Everybody has stress, everybody has things to deal with, what's the big deal? Take care of it yourself. Be responsible for your own health'?\"",
      "\"Yes, people should eat healthy, have healthy behaviors, but yet we see the weathering, when we look through the lens of what's really happening in a society,\" Wisdom replied. \"You can do all those things and have a poor outcome. See, the typical narrative is you eat healthy, you go to school, you get a college degree, you have a good life and you live to 80 or 90.\u00a0 That happens with one population. When you find another population that eats healthy, goes to college, gets an education, gets her Ph.D., and dies of maternal mortality, something is wrong.\"",
      "When asked if the concept of \"weathering\" could be seen as another way of making Black people into victims, or building in another stereotype, Geronimus said, \"That couldn't be farther from the truth. Even if you go back to slavery, no one was working harder, or doing more. But the people who pronounce on 'Black people's poverty is self-inflicted 'cause they're too lazy or too irresponsible,' they're just wrong.\"",
      "At the end of the day, it got me thinking about my own family.\u00a0 My parents died in their 70s. Two siblings died in their early 60s \u2026 all of them much too soon.\u00a0 There were certain ailments \u2013 diabetes, cancer, high blood pressure \u2013 that were expected almost, or that just kind of comes with the territory. And Wisdom says it shouldn't come with the territory \u2013 or that the reason it came with the territory was due to weathering.",
      "Wisdom said, \"Many people of color, families say that, 'Oh, we all get diabetes. We all get cancer. I mean, that's part of the natural course of life. That's the life course.' That is not the life course.\"",

      "More than 10% of the staff working for the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration were fired this month as part of the government-wide cuts to recently hired federal workers ordered by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, task force.",
      "The cuts amounted to around 100 probationary workers, multiple current and former federal health officials told CBS News, and affected multiple teams around the department, ranging from recently hired directors of SAMHSA's regional offices to staff working on projects related to the 988 hotline for people facing mental health crises, which the agency oversees.",

      "Palosky declined a request for an interview, referring comment to SAMHSA and the Department of Health and Human Services. A spokesperson for the department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Officials predicted the impact of the cuts, like at many other health agencies that administer large swaths of grants and external contracts, would likely not be immediately felt. Instead, they said the cuts would translate to a long-term erosion of SAMHSA's ability to conduct oversight, a slowdown in grant approvals and bogging down updates to guidance.",
      "Much of the work in some parts of the agency is made up of awarding and tracking taxpayer dollars awarded to drug addiction and mental health treatment programs.",

      "Federal health officials said they also feared the cuts at the agency would herald a return of the plummeting morale under the first Trump administration, which followed a steep reduction in the agency's size.",
      "The workforce at SAMHSA dropped to a low of 376 employees in 2020, according to records tallied by the Partnership for Public Service, down from a high of 553 in 2014.",

      "Employee satisfaction scores began to recover in 2020, reaching a record high of 81.5 by 2023, above the average. The size of the SAMHSA workforce also grew to 633 by 2023.",
      "Most federal health agencies have also faced firings in recent weeks, largely handed down by either termination letters this past weekend from HHSor as a result of severed contracts.",
      "Agencies losing contractors and recently-hired workers include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, and the Administration for Children and Families.",
      "Some agencies initially slated for steep cuts later secured exemptions for many health agency workers, including the Indian Health Service.",

      "Scott Amey, general counsel for the Project on Government Oversight, a nonpartisan watchdog focused on reducing government corruption, told CBS MoneyWatch that Musk's close relationship with President Trump could amount to a conflict of interest.",

      "Millions of retired teachers, firefighters, police officers and others with public pensions will be reaping the benefits of the recently passed Social Security Fairness Act sooner than first projected, federal officials announced on Tuesday.",
      "The Social Security Administration (SSA) said it was immediately beginning to pay retroactive benefits and will increase monthly payments starting in April to the more than 3.2 million people affected by a law signed in January by\u00a0former President Biden, who said it would mean an average monthly increase of $360 for more than 2.5 million Social Security recipients.",
      "Decades in the making, the Social Security Fairness Act expanded benefits for millions by eliminating two federal\u00a0policies\u00a0that barred employees with a public pension from collecting their full benefits under the federal retirement program. Those same policies also\u00a0reduced\u00a0benefits for such workers' surviving spouses and family members.",
      "How much will Social Security payments increase?",
      "Depending on the type of benefit and pension, the change in payment amount will vary from person to person. \"Some people's benefits will increase very little, while others may be eligible for over $1,000 more each month,\" the Social Security Administration stated.",
      "As Social Security benefits are paid a month behind, most of the affected beneficiaries will start receiving their updated payments in April for their March benefit, the agency noted.",
      "The benefits hike under the law would be retroactive to December 2023. As a result, eligible recipients who previously only received partial benefits will get a full payment retroactive to a year ago.",
      "\"Social Security's aggressive schedule to start issuing retroactive payments in February and increase monthly benefit payments beginning in April supports President Trump's priority to implement the Social Security Fairness Act as quickly as possible,\" Lee Dudek, acting commissioner of Social Security, said in a statement.",
      "SSA in late January cautioned that those impacted might have to wait up to a year or longer to reap the benefits of the Social Security Fairness Act of 2023, which\u00a0became law on January 5, 2025. At the time, the agency noted that the legislation had not provided additional financing or staff to help implement the law or deal with the increased workload.",
      "\"The agency's original estimate of taking a year or more now will only apply to complex cases that cannot be processed by automation,\" Dudek added.",
      "Most eligible Social Security recipients will get their one-time retroactive payment by the end of March, which will be deposited into their bank account on record with the Social Security Administration.",
      "The agency is asking beneficiaries to wait until April to ask about the status of their retroactive payment.",
      "To learn more about the expanded Social Security benefits, including who is eligible and when recipients will see an increase in their payments, visit the Social Security Fairness Act website.",
      "The push to enhance Social Security payments for public pension recipients has been in the works for decades, with the Senate holding its first hearings into the policies in 2003.",
      "The Senior Citizens League said it was pleased that the timeline for implementing the new law had been moved up, given the high cost of living that affects so many of its members, according to Shannon Benton, executive director of the group.",

    "summary": "President Trump is floating the idea of a new \"gold card\" visa that would be sold to wealthy foreigners for $5 million.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Tuesday unveiled a new pathway to residency: a \"gold card\" aimed at wealthy foreigners willing to pay millions for the right to live in the U.S.",
      "That term is a play on the green card, more officially known as a permanent residency card, which allows non-citizens to live and work permanently in the U.S. Green cards are most frequently awarded to foreigners who marry U.S. citizens or to those who receive one through their employer, with the latter process taking an average of three years to complete, according to the Cato Institute.",
      "The new program comes as the Trump administration moves to change the country's rules for who can legally live, work and gain citizenship in the U.S. That includes tightening restrictions on many types of immigration in the U.S. and pushing to\u00a0end birthright citizenship, the constitutionally protected right to citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil.",
      "The U.S. already opens the door to wealthy non-U.S. citizens who want residency through what is known as an EB-5 visa. But that program, launched in 1990, has long been cited for potential\u00a0abuses, including one prominent case from almost a decade ago that involved owners of a Vermont ski resort embezzling millions from foreign investors who hoped to score visas through the program.",
      "Yet both the new gold card and the EB-5 program have a common goal: Attracting foreign capital by allowing rich non-citizens to ante up in exchange for a U.S. residency visa.",
      "\"It's going to be a route to citizenship, and wealthy people will be coming into our country by buying this card, they'll be wealthy, and they'll be successful and they'll be spending a lot of money and paying a lot of taxes and employing a lot of people,\" Mr. Trump said on Tuesday.",
      "Here's what to know about the gold card plan.",
      "What is Trump's gold card?",
      "The gold card will offer a new route for rich non-U.S. citizens to gain a valid visa to live and work in the U.S., according to Mr. Trump, who spoke Tuesday about the new visa with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick from the Oval Office.",
      "The cost of each new visa will be $5 million, Mr. Trump said.",
      "\"We're going to be putting a price on that card of about $5 million, and that's going to give you green card privileges, plus,\" the president added.",
      "Green cards allow recipients to live permanently in the U.S. and work for whomever they choose. By comparison, some immigrants, such as those on H-1B visas, are locked into working for the employer that sponsored their visa.",
      "Green card holders can also travel in and out of the U.S. without restriction, and are able to start the process to become a U.S. citizen.",
      "When will the gold card be available?",
      "Lutnick said the gold cards would be available starting in about two weeks.",
      "Will the gold card replace the EB-5 visa?",
      "Yes, with Lutnick on Tuesday describing the EB-5 program as \"full of nonsense, make believe and fraud.\"",
      "\"So the President said, rather than having this sort of ridiculous EB-5 program, we're going to end the EB-5 program,\" Lutnick said in joining Mr. Trump to outline the gold card program from the Oval Office. \"We're going to replace it with the Trump Gold Card, which is really a Green Card Gold.\"",
      "One major difference between the gold card and the EB-5 visa \u2014 the cost, with the latter requiring applicants to invest about $1 million in the U.S., typically by putting the money into a business. But the EB-5 visa also comes with a host of other requirements, such as documenting that the investment will create or preserve 10 permanent full-time jobs for U.S. workers.",
      "How much money could the gold card raise for the U.S.?",
      "Mr. Trump suggested that the the U.S. could \"sell maybe a million of these cards, maybe more than that.\"",
      "At $5 million each, selling 1 million gold cards could raise $5 trillion, he said.",
      "\"And if you sell 10 million of the cards, that's a total of $50 trillion,\" Mr. Trump added. \"We have $35 trillion in debt. That'll be nice, so we'll see.\"",
      "Typically, the number of annual applicants for EB-5 visas is far lower than what Mr. Trump projects for the gold card. About 8,000 people obtained investor visas in the 12-month period ending Sept. 30, 2022, according to the Homeland Security Department's most recent Yearbook of Immigration Statistics.",
      "If roughly 8,000 people received gold cards each year, the U.S. would raise about $40 billion annually through the program.",
      "The U.S. is a top immigration destination for rich investors, according to Henley & Partners, a company that provides immigration advisory services. The group estimated\u00a0that the U.S. had the second-biggest net influx of millionaires in 2024, following the United Arab Emirates, at about 3,800 foreign millionaires moving stateside last year.",
      "Who could qualify for a gold card?",
      "Aside from having $5 million to pay the U.S. government, gold card applicants would also have to meet other criteria, Lutnick said.",
      "\"They'll have to go through vetting, of course, we're going to make sure they're wonderful world class global citizens,\" he said, without providing details.",
      "Asked by reporters if Russian oligarchs could qualify for the visa, Mr. Trump responded, \"Possibly.\"",
      "He added, \"Hey, I know some Russian oligarchs that are very nice people. It's possible. They're not as wealthy as they used to be. I think they could afford \u2014 I think they could afford $5 million.\"",
      "Do other nations offer gold cards?",
      "Yes, investor visas are common around the world. More than 100 countries offer \"golden visas\" to wealthy individuals, including the U.S., United Kingdom, Spain, Greece, Malta, Australia, Canada and Italy, according to Henley & Partners.",
      "Does the gold card need congressional approval?",
      "Congress determines qualifications for citizenship, but Mr. Trump said gold cards would not require congressional approval.",
      "\"We have it all worked out from the legal standpoint. It's totally legal to do,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's somewhat like a green card, but at a higher level of sophistication \u2014 it's a road to citizenship for people, and essentially people of wealth or people of great talent, where people of wealth pay for those people of talent to get in, meaning companies will pay for people to get in and to have long, long term status in the country.\"",

      "As far as the menu changes go, while a small share of customers might miss the beverages that are being eliminated, Starbucks probably \"did the math and figured the cost of keeping them on the menu was greater than the benefits,\" Cohan said.",

      "London \u2014\u00a0Sales data show many Europeans, seemingly angry with Elon Musk as he navigates his close relationship with President Trump to influence U.S. policy, may be choosing to steer clear of Tesla vehicles. A sharp decline in sales comes as anti-Musk ads appear in the U.K. and other countries alluding a comparison to Adolf Hitler.",
      "Tesla new vehicle sales fell across the continent by nearly half in January, plunging by 45% year-on-year, according to data compiled by the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA). In hard numbers, Tesla sold just under 9,950 vehicles in Europe in January. For the same month in 2024, the company sold just over 18,100 new vehicles.",
      "The drop in sales has hurt Tesla's share price, which had nearly doubled in the first month after Mr. Trump's election victory to a record high. Most of those gains have since been lost, and Tesla's market cap has plunged below the $1 trillion mark. The stock, which as of early Wednesday traded for roughly $305 in the U.S., remains up 54% over the last 12 months, buoyed by the company's ambitious plans for self-driving cars and humanoid robots.",
      "In Germany, Tesla sales fell nearly 60% in January year-on-year as would-be buyers voted with their wallets \u2014 possibly angered by Musk's purported meddling in the country's federal elections last weekend, which saw the far-right AfD party he backed become the country's second most popular.",
      "In France, Tesla's sales in January fell 63%. The plunge came after Musk backed far-right parties in that country and attacked left-leaning ones, although the impact of his political activities on Tesla's financial performance is hard to gauge and could reflect other factors, such as mounting competition from other EV makers.",
      "Tesla sales in the U.S. have also been declining, falling 1% in 2024 compared to the prior year \u2014 the automaker's first annual sales decline in 12 years despite global EV sales rising 7.3%. As CBS News' MoneyWatch reported this week, Wall Street analysts have said Musk's political activities could alienate consumers previously loyal to the brand, and protests have erupted at a number of Tesla dealerships in the U.S.",
      "\"Musk's DOGE related actions and more powerful alliance with Trump clearly could alienate some consumers to move away from the Tesla brand,\" analysts for the U.S. financial services firm Wedbush wrote in a Tuesday company report on the automaker. \"There is some momentum around this effort in Europe and pockets of the U.S. as well since November. That said, we view this as containable brand issues for Tesla for now that are not a major cause for concern.\"",
      "A similar trend has been seen in Europe. While Tesla's European sales numbers plunged in January, ACEA data show sales of electric vehicles overall surged by 34%, with buyers increasingly eyeing options from China and the continent's own automakers.",
      "In the U.K., after Musk attacked Prime Minister Keir Starmer and called for the release of a jailed far-right activist, January sales fell a comparatively gentler 12% year-on-year, but anger at Musk has been visible on British roadsides after an activist group called \"Everybody Hates Elon\" pasted over bus stop ads with posters showing Musk making a hand gesture that strongly resembled a Nazi salute at one of Mr. Trump's inauguration events.",
      "Musk has neither admitted nor denied his intent with the gesture, but he mocked the criticism of it, saying in a message on his social media platform X that, \"the 'everyone is Hitler' attack is sooo tired.\"",

    "summary": "Apple credits its DEI program as helping make the iPhone maker the most valuable company in the world.",
    "story": [
      "Apple shareholders on Tuesday rejected a proposal to end the iPhone maker's diversity, equity and inclusion program.",
      "The National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank, had called on Apple to follow other major companies in backing off from DEI, which has come under fire from Republicans and from President Donald Trump.",
      "\"DEI poses litigation, reputational and financial risks to companies, and therefore financial risks to their shareholders, and therefore further risks to companies for not abiding by their fiduciary duties,\" according to the\u00a0proposal offered by the group. It offered a similar proposal at Costco's annual meeting in January that shareholders also\u00a0rejected.",
      "\"The risks to Apple stemming from continuing to push these divisive and value-destroying agendas is only increasing in light of President Trump's recent executive order focusing the Department of Justice on rooting out illegal discrimination being carried out in the name of DEI,\" Stephen Padfield, executive director of the National Center for Public Policy Research's Free Enterprise Project, said in a prerecorded statement played to Apple shareholders on Tuesday.",
      "\"The vibe shift is clear, DEI is out and annual merit is in,\" Padfield said.",
      "In responding to the anti-DEI proposal, Apple defended its diversity program as an integral part of its corporate culture, crediting the policies in part for making the technology giant the most valuable company in the world.",
      "\"We've never had quotas or targets for Apple. Our strength has always come from hiring the very best people and then providing a culture of collaboration,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said during a question-and-answer period at the meeting, while conceding the company may need to revise aspects of its diversity policies \"as the legal landscape\" around DEI evolves.",
      "\"But our North Star of dignity and respect for everyone, and our work to that end, will never waver,\" he said.",
      "Apple disclosed in 2022 that nearly three-fourths of its global workforce consisted of white and Asian employees; early two-thirds of its employees were men.",
      "Mr. Trump slammed the decision by Apple shareholders to reject the proposal to end the company's DEI initiatives.",
      "\"Apple should get rid of DEI rules, not just make adjustments to them. DEI was a hoax that has been very bad for our country. DEI is gone!!!\" he wrote in a social media post on Wednesday.",
      "DEI, aimed at promoting fairness in the workplace and opening career paths for people of color, women and other protected classes,\u00a0gained momentum\u00a0after the 2020 murder of George Floyd.",
      "But that trend has reversed of late, with Ford,\u00a0Google, McDonald's, Meta,\u00a0Target, Walmart and other large corporations scaling back their diversity initiatives under pressure from conservative activists emboldened by court rulings and by President Trump, who has banned DEI programs across the federal government.",
      "Shifting DEI landscape",
      "Certain forms of DEI have become more legally risky than just a few years ago, yet practices such as employers posing standardized questions in recruitment to mitigate implicit bias are legally sound, according to David Glasgow, an adjunct professor at the New York University School of Law and executive director of its Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging.",
      "\"DEI is a really broad umbrella term covering things like disabilities, parental leave and flexible work. The anti-DEI folks have done a good job of driving the narrative that it's all about racial quotas and preferences,\" which in reality is just a narrow slice of such initiatives, Glasgow told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Some companies' response to the current legal and political climate is a matter of rebranding, Glasgow said. Businesses may ditch the terms diversity, equity and inclusion, while substituting references to \"welcoming\" and \"belonging.\"",
      "\"[I]t's more about getting anti-DEI activists off their back,\" Glasgow said.",
      "Critics of DEI say employer hiring and promotion decisions should be based on merit alone without regard to race, color, gender and other categories. By contrast, advocates of these policies say that supporting inclusivity doesn't inhibit companies from rewarding top-performing employees, while also helping organizations create a respectful workplace culture.",
      "Despite the pushback on diversity, roughly half of corporate leaders who were surveyed after Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration said they weren't considering rolling back their DEI programs, according to a new\u00a0survey\u00a0of 350 C-suite executives from Littler, a law firm focused on labor and employment issues. Roughly 22% of executives are considering reducing or phasing out jobs focused on DEI, the survey found.",

    "summary": "Elon Musk's close ties to President Trump is alienating some motorists. Wall Street analysts say that could hurt Tesla.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk has long been Tesla's public face, convincing consumers to pay premium prices for electric vehicles that promised to help combat climate change. But as Musk has navigated toward conservative politics and emerged as a close adviser to President Trump, some Tesla owners say they are reconsidering their loyalty to the brand.",
      "Wall Street analysts worry the Tesla brand is showing some cracks, with sales falling 1% in 2024 from the prior year \u2014 the automaker's first annual sales decline in 12 years, even as global EV sales rose 7.3%. They also say Musk's political activities risk alienating consumers, while protests have erupted at a number of\u00a0Tesla dealerships across the U.S. over his proximity to the Trump administration.",
      "\"It would seem that potential consumers for Tesla EVs might be turning away from the company because they don't appreciate Elon Musk's close relationship to President Trump and the administration's tariff policies,\" Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Since Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration, the carmaker's stock has dropped 17% due to the \"visible perceived downside impact\" of Musk's involvement with the White House, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote in a Feb. 19 research note.",
      "The inextricable link between Musk, the world's richest person, and Tesla's brand illustrates both the opportunities and risks of tying a company's fortunes to the personality of a single executive. Musk has led Tesla from its days as a scrappy startup to the world's biggest producer of EVs, growing its valuation to more than $1.2 trillion, making it one of the world's most valuable businesses.",
      "But Musk's recent\u00a0inflammatory public statements\u00a0and his role leading Mr. Trump's cost-cutting task force, the Department of Government Efficiency,\u00a0or DOGE, appear to be turning off some Americans. Consumers' political leanings can play into their decision to buy an electric vehicle, with Democrats three times more likely to buy an EV than Republicans, according to a 2024 Pew Research Center poll.",
      "Tesla did not respond to a request for comment about the impact of Musk's political activities on the automaker.",
      "Customer dissatisfaction",
      "Among the one-time Tesla fans who have had second thoughts is Minah Oh, 40, of Massachusetts, who told CBS MoneyWatch that Musk's political activities led her to sell her Tesla Model X, which she had owned since 2015, in October.",
      "\"I got it because it was great for the environment, and at the time he was more on the liberal side of politics,\" Oh told CBS MoneyWatch about Musk. But, she added, she felt that Musk by last fall had become \"volatile and turned radically right.\"",
      "Oh also said she was concerned that driving a Tesla could signal to others that she's aligned with Musk's political opinions.",
      "\"I wouldn't want people to think I was a Trumper or that I am associated with Elon, because he is so tied to the brand,\" Oh said. \"I am so happy I sold it, because if I was driving it today, in the current climate I would be so embarrassed.\"",
      "Jake Nickell is another former Tesla owner who has distanced himself from the car company because of Musk's evolving reputation. An early EV fan, the Chicago-based entrepreneur bought the first of three Tesla vehicles he eventually purchased, a Roadster sportscar, in 2006.",
      "\"It was super fun to see an electric car company come up and be viable,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. He sold the car for a profit when it was no longer practical for his growing family, replacing it with a Tesla Model S and later a Model X.",
      "But Nickell said he sold the Model X in 2021 because he was unhappy with the vehicle and because of Musk's changing public persona. He replaced it with a car from rival EV maker Rivian.",
      "\"We were not happy with how [Musk] was acting on many levels. It was a slow slide. He started getting into the 'bro' startup culture of cryptocurrency at time, and there were signs that he was sliding into right-wing politics. We didn't want anything to do with that anymore,\" Nickell said of why he sold his family's Model X.",
      "Asked if he'd ever buy a Tesla again, Nickell responded, \"Absolutely not.\" He's now helping his son buy a car and is considering a Toyota Prius or an EV from Volkswagen.",
      "Musician Sheryl Crow is another former Tesla owner who recently distanced herself from the brand, writing in an Instagram\u00a0post\u00a0that she sold her vehicle because of Musk's recent political activities.",
      "\"There comes a time when you have to decide who you are willing to align with. So long Tesla,\" she wrote, adding that she was donating the proceeds of the sale to NPR because the Trump administration wants to cut its federal funding.",
      "Wall Street analysts have voiced concern about the impact of Musk's reputation on the company's sales. That includes in Europe, where Tesla sales in Germany, a key market, fell roughly 60% last month, according to Reuters.",
      "\"Musk's DOGE related actions and more powerful alliance with Trump clearly could alienate some consumers to move away from the Tesla brand,\" Ives, who remains bullish on the company's prospects, said in his Feb. 19 report. \"There is some momentum around this effort in Europe and pockets of the U.S. as well since November.\"",
      "Tesla's \"net favorability rating,\" which measures consumers' perception of the brand based on survey responses, is at all-time lows, according to Stephen Gengaro, an analyst for investment advisory firm Stifel, who believes that Musk could be hurting the brand's score. Researchers asked consumers if they had a \"favorable\" or \"unfavorable\" impression of Tesla, ranging from \"very favorable\" to \"very unfavorable,\" to determine the rating. Respondents could also reply that they'd never heard of the brand, or that they had no opinion.",
      "Tesla's favorability rating sank to 3%, a six percentage point decline, for the week ended Jan. 28, compared with 9% in January 2024, according to data from Stifel Think Tank Group, the firm's research and analysis arm. In January 2018, the company's favorability rating stood at 33%.",
      "\"[M]any on the Street view Musk spending '100% of his time' with DOGE as creating a negative perception around his Tesla focus,\" Gengaro wrote in a research note.",
      "Partisan divide",
      "More than half of Americans held a negative view of Musk, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted between Jan. 27 and Feb. 2. Views were starkly divided based on political party, with about 7 in 10 Republicans saying they had a favorable view of him, while more than 8 in 10 Democrats said they viewed him unfavorably.",
      "Those changing perceptions may be rubbing off on car buyers, with a February Morning Consult poll finding that about 32% of U.S. buyers \"would not consider\" buying a Tesla, a five percentage point increase compared with a year earlier, according to a recent CNN report.",
      "In states that voted Democratic in the last four presidential elections, the share of repeat Tesla buyers dropped seven percentage points over the past year, falling from 72% at the end of 2023 to 65% by the fourth quarter of 2024, according to additional data provided to CNN by S&P Global Mobility. Repeat buyers in states that voted Republican barely inched higher, rising from 47.6% to 48.2% over the same period.",
      "In California, the country's largest market for electric vehicles, total driver registrations for Tesla's cars fell 11.6% percent in 2024, according to data from Experian automotive. Registrations for all other brands increased 1.4%, California New Car Dealers Association NCDA wrote in a January\u00a0report.",
      "Could Musk's ties to Trump actually help Tesla?",
      "At the same time, some on Wall Street say there are potential upsides to Musk's alliance with Mr. Trump. Perhaps most important, the Trump administration may seek to weaken or eliminate federal rules governing Tesla's self-driving vehicle technology, a major initiative for Tesla.",
      "Musk has long had ambitions to launch full self-driving vehicles powered by AI. The company plans to launch autonomous ride hailing in Austin in June, Musk\u00a0confirmed. Yet such efforts have been slowed by federal investigations into vehicle crashes involving Tesla's\u00a0\"Full Self-Driving\" system and by existing safety regulations.",
      "\"Trump's election, and the bromance between Trump and Musk, will essentially lead to the defanging of a regulatory environment that's been stifling Tesla,\" Ives told the Associated Press.",
      "If the Trump administration eases regulations for self-driving cars, it would be \"a significant tailwind for Tesla's autonomous and AI vision heading into 2025,\" he added.",
      "Meanwhile, the dip in consumer perceptions of Tesla's brand could simply be a short-term headwind, Gengaro said. And long-term, the company's development of robotaxis and self-driving vehicles could provide much more of Tesla's growth than vehicle sales to consumers, he added.",
      "Tesla's sales struggles also could be based on other issues besides Musk, including mounting competition for EVs from other automakers. And Tesla's sales decline in Germany could be due to a preference among consumers there for electric cars made by homegrown automakers such as BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen.",

      "U.S. consumer confidence plummeted in February, the biggest monthly decline in more than four years, a business research group said Tuesday, with inflation seemingly stuck and a trade war under President Donald Trump seen by a growing number of Americans as inevitable.",
      "The Conference Board reported that its consumer confidence index sank this month to 98.3 from 105.3 in January. That's far below the expectations of economists, who projected a reading of 103, according to a survey by FactSet.",
      "\"The Conference Board survey is the 3rd data point in less than a week (after Fri's flash PMIs and Michigan sentiment report) making it abundantly clear that Trump-linked policy uncertainty is eroding confidence and tipping the economy (at least) into a slowdown (if not something worse),\" Adam Crisafulli, president of investment advisory firm Vital Knowledge, said in a note.",
      "The seven-point drop was the biggest month-to-month decline since August of 2021.",

      "Tariff concerns",
      "Respondents to the board's survey expressed concern over inflation with a significant increase in mentions of trade and tariffs, the board said.",
      "Since taking office in January, President Trump has threatened sweeping tariffs which he says will bolster the U.S. economy over the long term. While it's not clear that Mr. Trump will enact all the tariffs he's outlined \u2014 he recently gave a 30-day reprieve to Mexico and Canada in his plan to enact 25% import duties on those countries \u2014 the president is also signaling plans to move forward with additional tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump's plans to lean on new tariffs to enact his trade and other policy objectives has prompted some economists to forecast higher inflation in 2025.",
      "\"The Conference Board's survey mirrors the Michigan survey in showing that consumers' confidence has deteriorated sharply in the face of threats to impose large tariffs and to slash federal spending and employment,\" Samuel Tombs, chief U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a research note.",
      "\"The weakness of confidence strongly suggests that recent rapid growth in spending on durable goods mostly reflects households pre-empting tariffs,\" he added.",
      "The Conference Board's report Tuesday said that the measure of Americans' short-term expectations for income, business and the job market fell 9.3 points to 72.9. The Conference Board says a reading under 80 can signal a potential recession in the near future.",
      "The proportion of consumers expecting a recession over the next year jumped to a nine-month high, the board said.",
      "\"This index says that consumers are rattled. Their current situation is not so bad, but a growing do not feel so good about the future,\" analysts with High-Frequency Economics said in report. \"The decline in consumer sentiment since the November election might not be a coincidence,\" they added.",
      "Growing pessimism",
      "Consumers' view of current conditions tumbled 3.4 points to a reading of 136.5 this month and views on current labor market conditions fell again.",
      "\"Views of current labor market conditions weakened,\" the group said Tuesday. \"Consumers became pessimistic about future business conditions and less optimistic about future income. Pessimism about future employment prospects worsened and reached a ten-month high.\"",
      "Consumers appeared increasingly confident heading into the end of 2024 and spent generously during the holiday season. However, U.S. retail sales dropped sharply in January, with cold weather taking some of the blame for a dent in vehicle sales and at retail stores.",
      "Retail sales fell 0.9% last month from December, the Commerce Department reported last week. The decline, the biggest in a year, came after two months of healthy gains.",
      "Inflation has also remained sticky. So much so that the Federal Reserve has taken a more cautious approach to interest rates, leaving its benchmark borrowing rate alone at its last meeting after cutting it at the previous three. Fed officials have also expressed uncertainty over the new administration's policies.",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Feb 2025 10:22:10 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration is apparently nearing a deal with Ukraine that could grant the U.S. access to mineral resources in exchange for security guarantees.",
    "story": [
      "Exactly three years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion and under pressure from President Trump, a senior Ukrainian official said negotiations over a deal that would give Washington access to Ukraine's vast mineral reserves were \"in the final stages.\"",
      "Ukraine's leaders have voiced hope that such an agreement might serve as the foundation of a long-term security guarantee for the country against any future Russian aggression, but the Trump administration has thus far remained non-committal, framing access to the resources as a way for Ukraine to pay the U.S. back for its support over the last three years.",
      "\"The negotiations have been very constructive, with nearly all key details finalized,\" Olga Stefanishka, Ukraine's Vice President for European and Euro-Atlantic integration, said in a Monday\u00a0social media post, written in English. \"We are committed to completing this swiftly to proceed with its signature. We hope both US and UA leaders might sign and endorse it in Washington the soonest to showcase our commitment for decades to come.\"",
      "Often called Europe's \"breadbasket\" thanks to its massive agriculture sector, Ukraine is also one of the continent's most resource-rich nations. Much of Ukraine's mineral reserves remain untapped, however, due to difficult access, old and undeveloped infrastructure and a lack of investment \u2014 all exacerbated by Russia's ongoing offensive military campaign, which initially started in 2014 with its invasion and annexation of the Crimean Peninsula.",
      "Zelenskyy says he'd give up presidency in exchange for peace, NATO membership",
      "Zelenskyy says he'd give up presidency in exchange for peace, NATO membership",
      "Roughly 20% of Ukrainian land \u2014 a vast swath of the eastern Donbas region plus Crimea \u2014 is now under Russian control. The occupied territory includes a significant portion of Ukraine's mineral reserves, including highly sought-after rare earth elements used in defense, aerospace, technology and energy production.",
      "The ground beneath Ukraine is believed to hold about 5% of the world's total reserves of rare earth elements. The U.S., which covers about 12 times as much ground, is estimated to have only 1-2% of the world's rare earths, by comparison.",
      "According to the Institute for the Study of War, about half of Ukraine's rare earth element reserves lie in territory currently occupied by Russia.",
      "Ukraine also has one of Europe's biggest reserves of titanium. The strong, lightweight metal is a vital component in modern aircraft, missiles and countless other civilian and military hardware, from satellites to bicycles. Ukraine's reserves are largely found in the northwest and central regions of the country, which have remained firmly under Kyiv's control.",
      "Lithium deposits, meanwhile, are scattered across Ukraine's central, east and southeast regions \u2014 the latter of which are currently held largely by Russia. Lithium is a key component in the rechargeable batteries found in everything from electric vehicles to laptops and smartphones.",
      "Ukraine also holds about 20% of the world's global reserves of graphite. Commonly used in pencils, the soft substance is also used in industrial lubricants for motors and other machinery.",
      "\"We must have an agreement with Ukraine on critical minerals and rare earths and various other things as security. And I think that that's happening. I think we've made a lot of progress,\" Mr. Trump said during a joint news conference at the White House on Monday with visiting French President Emmanuel Macron.",
      "\"I think this discussion (a potential mineral deal) is a very important one,\" said Macron. \"First, because it's important for the U.S. and it will be a good occasion for a first very important meeting between President Trump and President Zelenskyy. Second, I think it's \u2014 there is a lot of economic upside on both sides.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has characterized U.S. access to Ukraine's minerals as a way for the country to pay back Washington for the military assistance provided over the past three years.",
      "U.S. industry currently relies largely on China, which is the world's biggest source of rare earths and other minerals, for its raw materials. An increase in the supply of those materials from Ukraine could eventually mean a decrease in minerals purchased from China \u2014 and less concern from a national security standpoint.",
      "While the details of the deal said to be taking shape have not been shared, Zelenskyy earlier refused to sign an agreement that reportedly would have given the U.S. access to about $500 billion worth of his nation's mineral wealth \u2014 about half of its estimated future value.",
      "\"I won't sign a document that 10 generations of Ukrainians will pay for,\" Zelenskyy said over the weekend. He has stressed that any agreement to grant U.S. access to Ukraine's minerals must come with security guarantees\u2014\u00a0 including, he suggested Tuesday, the possibility of American forces deploying to protect American investments.",
      "Zelenkyy's chief of staff, Andrii Yermak, said Monday that Kyiv was considering investment opportunities with both the U.S and European countries, \"which includes minerals, their development and extraction,\" calling his country's natural resources \"a very important element that can work in the general structure of security guarantees \u2014 military guarantees and others.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has claimed the U.S. has given Ukraine $350 billion in assistance since the war started three years ago, and made it clear he wants to get that back.",
      "Ukraine Oversight, a U.S. interagency watchdog group, says the U.S. has provided no more than $183 billion, however, and roughly a third of that was spent domestically in the U.S. to manufacture ammunition and other weapons and equipment to be used by Ukraine.",

A backyard hen in her prime can lay up to five eggs per week, but consumers need to consider the initial cost of the coop, chicks and feed, which could cost thousands of dollars.

      "Mormino said bird flu is a big concern for flocks at home.",
      "\"Bird flu is distributed primarily by migratory waterfowl so they're droppings and other secretions are infected by the virus,\" Mormino explained. \"All you have to do is walk through duck poop at a pond in the local park and now you're carrying bird flu on your shoes, wherever you're going.\"",
      "She added the concern is true for wildlife as well.",
      "\"So all it takes is a mouse to walk through infected droppings from waterfowl that is a carrier and bring it into your backyard. ... But there are certain biosecurity measures that you can take and should be taking as a backyard 'chickeneer' with the prevalence of bird flu.\"",

    "summary": "Tax accountants urge Americans to file early this year to avoid delays in getting your 2025 tax refund.",
    "story": [
      "Tax filing season is upon us, and some people are worried it may take longer to get their refunds as President Trump says he intends to make\u00a0significant cuts\u00a0to the IRS during its busy period.",
      "Tax experts say these concerns are valid and that it's more important than ever to file early this year, as Americans could encounter tax refund delays, particularly as they get closer to the filing deadline. The Internal Revenue Service began accepting tax returns on Jan. 27 and will continue to do so until April 15, unless a taxpayer asks for an extension.",
      "Mr. Trump is\u00a0expected to fire more than 6,000\u00a0IRS employees by the end of this week, as he doubles down on efforts to cut the size of the federal workforce.",
      "Tax accountant Terrance Hutchins, of Logos Financial Group, said taxpayers should expect longer hold times over the phone and slower customer service in general. He still expends refunds on relatively straightforward returns that are filed early and electronically, though, to appear in a timely manner.",
      "But many taxpayers could experience processing delays as a result of the anticipated cuts.",
      "\"Your refund can be very fast indeed if you receive it by direct deposit, but those promises were made a few weeks ago before the agency knew of the cuts, so it's very hard to say what the impact will be,\" Vanessa Williams, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Will the IRS cuts affect how long it takes to get my refund?",
      "Tax accountants say the advice they always give taxpayers \u2014 which is to file their returns early \u2014 is even more important this year, in light of the anticipated workforce reduction. If the IRS' headcount is reduced, any errors on one's tax return will take longer to remedy.",
      "If taxpayers file close to the deadline or make mistakes in their returns, Hutchins expects a reduced workforce at the agency would lead to one's refund being delayed.",
      "Williams of the Tax Policy Center, said filers in need of assistance should expect slower refunds as a result of long wait times and worse customer service.\u00a0 \"You spend a lot of time on hold, and there are real consequences,\" she said, recalling the 2010s when the IRS was understaffed.",
      "Democratic Senators warned in a letter to the Trump administration Tuesday that potential staff cuts could lead to delayed tax refunds for Americans in 2025.",
      "\"Staffing reductions at the IRS resulting from Trump's hiring freeze and potential layoffs would likely delay tax refunds, harm taxpayer service and undermine law enforcement effort,\" the senators wrote. It's essential that the agency responsible for processing refunds be fully staffed to support Americans through tax season and \"answer their questions, process their returns, send them refunds and keep IRS systems online and functional.\"",
      "\"I always advise people to do their taxes as early as they can, partly because hackers can get their social security numbers and file false tax returns,\" Katie Brewer, a Texas-based financial adviser told CBS MoneyWatch. Brewer also expects cuts to lead to longer wait times to have tax-related questions answered by phone, a particularly burdensome for older filers, who aren't as tech savvy and might not be inclined to turn to the IRS' website for advice, she added.",
      "When will I get my tax refund?",
      "The IRS says that most refunds are issued in fewer than 21 calendar days, if you file your taxes electronically. It can take longer to get a refund on paper returns.",
      "Taxpayers filing electronically can view the status of their 2025 refund using the IRS'\u00a0Where's My Refund? tool.",
      "Returns that require corrections or extra review could result in a delayed refund, the IRS notes. That's why Brewer says it's extra important to ensure that there are no errors on your return.",
      "\"Sometimes people don't double check things until after they hit send. But I really encourage to make sure not to mix up any numbers or accidentally add a zero because those are the kinds of things that hinder refunds or make it hard to deal with the IRS to correct them,\" Brewer said.",
      "Who counts on timely refunds?",
      "Millions of Americans count on receiving their refunds in a timely manner, so that they can repay debt, put money into savings, or make a big purchase.",
      "\"Particularly for working families who receive a child tax credit, or the earned income tax credit, these are often essential supports for Americans,\" Williams said. \"Low-income people use their tax refunds to pay off their winter heating bills, or to put money aside to cover spring clothes for their kids.\"",
      "She added that working-class Americans rely on their tax credits for financial stability. \"That's the purpose. To give people stability when they are working and have kids,\" she said. \"It's not a spare $20 someone might be excited to receive as gift or surprise. It's real money that underwrites the economic security of a very large number of Americans.\"",
      "The IRS last year piloted a new, free electronic service called Direct File, that provides public tax preparation services. It's currently available to 30 million Americans in 25 states, and pulls one's personal tax filing information directly from the IRS. Using such a service is one way to increase one's chances of receiving a refund in a timely manner, according to Williams.",
      "Why haven't I received my tax refund yet?",
      "The IRS'\u00a0Where's My Refund?\u00a0tool will tell electronic filers what the status of their 2025 tax refund is 24 hours after they file a return, according to the agency's website. Those filing by mail can view the status of their refund four weeks after they mail in their return.",
      "To use the tool, taxpayers need to enter their Social Security number, or ITIN, their filing status and exact dollar amount of their refund rounded to the nearest whole number.",

      "Both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 1.7% on Friday, marking their worst one-day declines since December 18, according to financial data firm FactSet. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index dropped 2.2%.",
      "A preliminary report from S&P Global found U.S. business activity is nearing stall-speed, with growth decelerating to a 17-month low. Activity for U.S. services businesses unexpectedly shrank, and many businesses in the survey reported slumping optimism because of worries about policies from the Trump administration, including the potential for new tariffs and domestic spending cuts.",
      "\"Companies report widespread concerns about the impact of federal government policies, ranging from spending cuts to tariffs and geopolitical developments,\" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence. \"Sales are reportedly being hit by the uncertainty caused by the changing political landscape, and prices are rising amid tariff-related price hikes from suppliers.\"",
      "Inflation worries also weighed on the stock market, with a University of Michigan survey finding that consumers are preparing for higher inflation due to potential tariffs. Because tariffs are taxes paid by importers, such as retailers such as Walmart, the costs are often passed onto consumers, raising prices.",
      "Consumers say they are broadly expecting prices to be 4.3% higher 12 months from now, which is a big jump from last month's forecast of 3.3% inflation, the University of Michigan survey found. That fits with preliminary data the survey suggested earlier, though a divide is evident underneath the surface.",
      "Expectations for inflation are rising for political independents and Democrats, while falling slightly for Republicans.",
      "A third economic report, meanwhile, said sales of previously occupied homes were weaker last month than economists expected. Relatively high mortgage rates have been hurting the housing market.",
      "Walmart, Akamai",
      "Other corporate reports have added to the sense of unease on Wall Street, including Walmart's most recent earnings report. The retailing giant on Thursday provided a 2025 sales and profit forecast that was lower than analysts had expected, with executives warning about new challenges in an uncertain economic landscape.",
      "Walmart shares slipped 2.5% on Friday, following a 6.5% decline on the prior day.",
      "\"With policy uncertainty and weaker retail sales guidance yesterday from consumer spending bellwether Walmart, we may have the catalyst we need for a healthy correction,\" noted Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group, in an email.",
      "Akamai Technologies had the sharpest drop in the S&P 500, even though the cybersecurity and cloud computing company reported stronger profit than analysts expected. It lost a fifth of its value and fell 20.6% as investors focused instead on its forecasts for revenue and other financial measures this upcoming year, which fell short of analysts' expectations.",
      "Even within the big companies of the S&P 500 index, roughly 4 out of every 5 stocks fell. Everything from Big Tech stocks that have been bid up amid the artificial-intelligence frenzy to airlines to metals companies fell. Nvidia sank 2.5%. United Airlines lost 5.5%, and Newmont Mining fell 4.4%.",
      "To be sure, the U.S. stock market is still up for the young year so far and is not far from its all-time high set earlier this week. Virtually no one on Wall Street is forecasting a recession anytime soon. But Friday's reports together raise concerns about what's been a remarkably resilient economy, and the ensuing losses on Wall Street were widespread.",
      "Before Friday's sharp drop, the S&P 500 had been heading for a week of almost zero movement. Helping to lift stocks had been a steady parade of better-than-expected profit reports. That worked against worries about stubbornly high inflation, which could prevent the Federal Reserve from delivering more relief for the economy and financial markets through lower interest rates.",

And I'll be going, I'll be going there and we expect to see each other in the near future. We'll be announcing it.\" Both leaders emphasized the \"special relationship\" between the two countries, forged during World War II.",
      "Mr. Trump said he and Starmer would discuss Russia and Ukraine, as the president seeks an end to the war started when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. In a break with many European allies \u2014 including Britain \u2014 Mr. Trump has called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a \"dictator\" but has declined to give the same label to Russian President Vladimir Putin.",

      "Starmer thanked Mr. Trump for changing the conversation on Ukraine, according to reporters in the room, and said he believes an \"historic deal\" can be achieved.",

      "Mr. Trump said the two will also be discussing trade, as he imposes new tariffs on allies and adversaries alike.",
      "Starmer said ahead of the meeting that the U.S. and Britain \"want to strike a new partnership. We share the view that our best days lie ahead.\"",
      "\"Taking out a chainsaw isn't quite my style, but we are stripping away red tape and bureaucracy,\" he said, at once taking a gentle jab at Musk while also attempting to appeal to Mr. Trump's passion for a slimmed down government. \"We are reforming, permitting, getting things built, reducing barriers to investment and growth, and we're open for business, open for investment, and we're determined to help U.S. innovators thrive in the United Kingdom.\"",

He flew in on the wings of an announcement just days earlier that his government was planning to bump U.K. defense spending from the current 2.3% of GDP to 2.5% by 2027, which his office has billed as Britain's biggest sustained defense spending increase since the Cold War. Starmer has left open the possibility of that defense spending rising further, to 3%, after the next U.K. general election.",
      "The timing of the prime minister's announcement was notable, coming just two days before his meeting with Mr. Trump. A White House official said ahead of the meeting that the Trump administration was \"very pleased\" with Starmer's announcement, but that it still wants to see America's NATO allies increase defense spending further, towards 5% of their respective national GDPs. That would be more, proportionally, than even the U.S. spends on defense, which in 2023 amounted to roughly 3.4% of the United States' GDP.",
      "Mr. Trump has implied that the U.S. could break from the historic collective defense agreement of NATO, known as Article 5, which essentially says that if any member is attacked it will be treated as an attack on all, if other member countries do not boost their defense spending.",
      "\"I think that that means there's got to be security guarantees,\" said Starmer, acknowledging the pressure for higher spending, but also indicating that he will ask the White House to provide clear commitments to help defend Ukraine against any future Russian attack if a ceasefire is reached to halt the ongoing war. \"I've indicated that we will play our full part. There has to be U.S. backing, because otherwise I don't think it will deter Putin. We are working on that. I'm having extensive discussions about it.\"",
      "A White House official said the U.S. appreciated Starmer's willingness to consider sending British troops to help with peacekeeping efforts to enforce a potential peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, but Mr. Trump has made it clear that any and all security guarantees for Ukraine may have to come from Europe.",
      "\"I'm not going to make security guarantees beyond, very much,\" Mr. Trump said this week. \"We're going to have Europe do that, because we're talking about, Europe is their nextdoor neighbor, but we're going to make sure everything goes well.\"",
      "U.K.-British trade",
      "Mr. Trump's tariff threats will also be on the agenda during Thursday's White House meeting. A 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imported into the U.S. is set to kick in on March 12, ordered by Mr. Trump, he said, to protect American companies. Starmer may seek an exemption.",
      "Mr. Trump implied weeks ago that a unilateral trade agreement could be worked with the U.K. If that does not happen, there's concern that some of the estimated 40,000 British jobs directly linked to steel and aluminum production could be lost and entire plants could close.",
      "After Starmer's meeting with Mr. Trump, he's scheduled to meet back in London with several European leaders on Sunday, including the heads of state from Germany, Italy and Poland. Starmer will no doubt brief them on his talks with the U.S. president.",
      "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy may join them, after he meets with Mr. Trump in Washington on Friday, where he's expected to sign a financial deal to share his country's mineral wealth with Washington, which Mr. Trump has called \"payback\" for U.S. aid to Ukraine over the past three years.",

    "summary": "Some of the athletes have publicly clashed with the White House's preferred messaging by openly criticizing the NCAA in social media posts and other public statements.",
    "story": [
      "Several female athletes who stood next to President Trump three weeks ago to celebrate an executive order banning transgender participation in women's sports were not invited to a White House event Thursday for a briefing on women's sports after they criticized the National Collegiate Athletic Association's new policy, sources told CBS News.",
      "Among those who didn't get asked back for the briefing on Title IX issues were Riley Gaines, a former NCAA swimmer; Sia Liilii, captain of the University of Nevada's women's volleyball team; and Kaitynn Wheeler, a former NCAA swimmer at the University of Kentucky.",
      "Some of the athletes have publicly clashed with the White House's preferred messaging by openly criticizing the NCAA in social media posts and other public statements.",
      "\"It's absolutely not a win at all and we need to demand for better,\" Wheeler told CBS News.",
      "White House officials told CBS that Thursday's Title IX event is for state attorneys general and is an effort to encourage them to use sex discrimination authorities already in place in their states to protect women and girls in athletics.",
      "Sports figures whose stories haven't yet been highlighted by the Trump administration were invited, they said. Some athletes from Maine, whose Democratic governor has said she will fight Mr. Trump's order in court, will be there, one of the officials said.",
      "After Mr. Trump earlier this month signed the executive order titled \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports,\" the NCAA \u2014 the nonprofit that governs college sports \u2014 issued a new policy stating a \"student-athlete assigned male at birth may not compete for an NCAA women's team.\"",
      "White House officials said they think the NCAA policy is a victory for Mr. Trump because the organization is not accepting amended birth certificates and is being more aggressive than other sporting organizations such as the Ladies Professional Golf Association, National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics, and the International Rugby League.",
      "However, some of the women athletes and advocates at the photo opportunity with Mr. Trump have since argued the NCAA policy has major loopholes and continues to allow male athletes to compete in women's sports.",
      "Payton McNabb, a 17-year-old who was injured during a collision with a transgender female athlete during a volleyball game, was initially invited to Thursday's event, but it was unclear if she would attend, people familiar with the matter said. Liilii was invited and later asked not to come, they said.",
      "Jennifer Sey, a former gymnast and business executive who has been an advocate for keeping transgender women out of women's sports, said the sports governance landscape is complicated - multiple bodies govern various corners of sports. Olympics and independent events such as the Boston Marathon can claim they're outside the executive order because they don't receive federal funding, she said.",
      "\"It's very fractured \u2014 there was no way an EO was going to be able to solve the entire problem. It was a great first step,\" Sey said. \"But in the meantime, I think the NCAA policy is wildly insufficient.\"",
      "Sey, who was invited to the White House for the executive order event but not Thursday's briefing, said she and others hope Mr. Trump will pressure the NCAA to redo it. \"It should be thrown in the garbage,\" she said.",
      "May Mailman, Mr. Trump's senior policy strategist who has been coordinating the policy and the events, told CBS the White House is closely watching the NCAA and if men are allowed in women's sports, that won't be acceptable.",
      "\"We are using every tool that we have. We care about this issue,\" Mailman said. \"We are trying to get the state AGs to go along with us and I think they want to.\"",

      "The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions voted 14 to 9 on Thursday to advance Chavez-DeRemer's nomination for a vote in the full Senate. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky was the sole Republican to vote against her nomination, while three Democrats \u2014 Sens. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, John Hickenlooper of Colorado and Tim Kaine of Virginia \u2014 voted in favor. GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska did not originally cast a vote, but the committee later allowed her to record herself as a \"yes.\"",
      "Paul said he would oppose her because of her previous support for pro-labor policies. Chavez-DeRemer was one of only three Republicans who supported the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, or PRO Act, in the last Congress, which did not advance past introduction. The bill would have made it easier for workers to unionize. During her confirmation hearing last week, the former lawmaker addressed her prior support for the bill, saying it was \"imperfect\" and she backs right-to-work laws, which allow workers to choose whether or not to join a union.",
      "Without Paul, Chavez-DeRemer needed at least one Democrat on the Senate HELP Committee to vote to advance her nomination. Republicans have a 12-11 vote majority on the panel.",
      "Hassan of New Hampshire said in a statement this week that she would support Mr. Trump's nominee, all but ensuring that Chavez-DeRemer had the votes needed to advance, barring any surprise opposition from other Republican committee members.",

      "Hickenlooper told CBS News on Tuesday that he was also considering supporting Chavez-DeRemer's nomination. The Colorado Democrat cited Chavez-DeRemer's support for youth apprenticeships, an issue he has worked on for nearly a decade, as a positive.

      "The U.S. will begin removing transgender troops from the military within 30 days unless they obtain a waiver on a case-by-case basis, the Pentagon said in a Wednesday memo.",
      "The memo became public as part of a court filing in a case challenging President Trump's late January executive order that was aimed at barring military service by transgender personnel.",
      "\"Service members who have a current diagnosis or history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with, gender dysphoria will be processed for separation from military service,\" the memo read.",
      "These troops may be \"considered for a waiver on a case-by-case basis, provided there is a compelling government interest in retaining the service member that directly supports warfighting capabilities,\" it said.",
      "To obtain such a waiver, troops must show that they have never attempted to transition, as well as demonstrate \"36 consecutive months of stability in the service member's sex without clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.\"",
      "SPARTA Pride, a nonprofit group comprised of thousands of transgender service members, veterans and their supporters, released a statement saying: \"Transgender Americans have served openly and honorably in the U.S. Armed Forces for nearly a decade. Thousands of transgender troops are currently serving, and are fully qualified for the positions in which they serve. No policy will ever erase transgender Americans' contribution to history, warfighting, or military excellence.

    "summary": "The government runs out of funding on March 14, and averting a shutdown will likely require bipartisan support in both the House and Senate.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Congress is barreling toward a deadline to avert a government shutdown in just over two weeks, with Democrats and Republicans at odds over whether there should be guardrails on President Trump's ability to withhold funding approved by Congress.",
      "Democrats want to insert language in the funding bill to ensure that the administration implements the spending directed by Congress, a reaction to Mr. Trump and top adviser Elon Musk's work to downsize large swaths of the executive branch. But Republicans have made it clear that they won't accept those terms.",
      "Government funding expires on March 14, and keeping the government open past the deadline will likely require bipartisan support in both the House and Senate. Republicans control 53 seats in the Senate, but a funding measure requires 60 votes for passage. In the House, Republicans are operating with a razor-thin majority and a divided conference in which conservatives regularly vote against government spending bills.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said Wednesday that a continuing resolution that funds the government at the current levels is the \"most reasonable thing to do to ensure that the government is not shut down.\"",
      "It has yet to be determined whether disaster relief for the California wildfires would be included in the funding measure, but Johnson told reporters it likely would not include language to codify cuts spearheaded by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, the Musk-led task force that is slashing programs across the executive branch.",
      "\"It probably is as close to a clean CR as possible,\" he said of the potential path forward.",
      "Johnson's comments came after a meeting with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, and Mr. Trump at the White House on Wednesday afternoon.",
      "But in an interview with CNN later in the evening, Johnson noted that the CR might include some \"anomalies,\" opening the door to spending cuts that would alienate most Democrats.",
      "\"You can increase some spending, you can decrease some spending. You can add language that says, for example, the dramatic changes that have been made to USAID would be reflected in the ongoing spending,\" Johnson said. \"It would be a clean CR, mostly, I think, but with some of those changes to adapt to the new realities here.\"",
      "Democratic leaders have said the blame for any shutdown would lie squarely with Republicans, who control the House, Senate and the White House. Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democratic appropriator in the Senate, said Tuesday that Democrats don't want a shutdown and are at the table negotiating in good faith to fund the government.",
      "\"But Republicans are the majority in the House and in the Senate. If they want our votes, they need to work with us,\" Murray said, noting that appropriators are \"close\" on topline spending.",
      "\"We need to know Republicans are willing to work with us to protect Congress' power of the purse,\" Murray said. \"That is the absolute bare minimum, and it's frankly not asking a whole lot.\"",
      "Republicans \"should not follow Elon toward a shutdown,\" Murray said.",
      "Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, the Senate's top Republican appropriator, and Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, her counterpart in the House, met with Johnson and Thune on Wednesday morning to discuss government funding.",
      "Cole said he and Collins are on the same page, but do have differences with Democrats on \"some of the restrictions that they're demanding on what we consider legitimate presidential authority.\" He added that Republicans are \"not moving on that.\"",
      "\"That's a no-go, that's a red line that we're not changing our position on and they know that \u2014 that's been communicated consistently,\" Cole said.",
      "Johnson said Democrats have \"had completely unreasonable conditions assigned to this.\"",
      "\"They want us to limit the power of the executive branch, they want us to stipulate in the appropriations bills for the first time in history that certain agencies in the executive branch would have to have a specific number of employees, all sorts of just unreasonable \u2014 what I think are unconstitutional \u2014 demands,\" Johnson said. \"It would be a violation of separation of powers. So we're pretty far apart right now, but it is not because of Republicans, it's because of the Democrats.\"",
      "The funding fight comes as Republicans in Congress have also been moving ahead on a separate budget resolution, which serves as a blueprint for approving Mr. Trump's agenda on issues ranging from border security to energy and taxes. Though the two issues are distinctly separate, the focus on the budget has taken center stage in recent weeks, appearing to sideline progress toward government funding.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Chief Justice John Roberts late Wednesday granted the Trump administration's request to put on hold a lower court order that required it to pay an estimated $2 billion in foreign assistance funds for State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development projects by the end of Wednesday.",
      "Roberts, who oversees requests for emergency relief arising from cases in the District of Columbia, acted alone in halting the decision from a federal district judge issued Tuesday. The judge, U.S. District Judge Amir Ali, gave the State Department and USAID until 11:59 p.m. Wednesday to pay its bills to contractors for work that had been completed before Feb. 13. The Trump administration had earlier in the night asked the Supreme Court to intervene in the dispute involving frozen foreign assistance funds.",
      "Roberts gave the State Department and USAID contractors until noon Friday to respond to the Trump administration's request.",
      "Separately, the State Department cut more than 9,100 foreign assistance grants and contracts, totaling roughly $58.4 billion, a State Department spokesperson confirmed to CBS News. The cuts at USAID amount to a 92% decrease in grants and awards.",
      "In the bid for emergency relief from the Supreme Court, acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris said Ali's order covers an estimated $2 billion and said his Wednesday night deadline \"moved the goalposts.\"",
      "\"It is not tailored to any actual payment deadlines associated with respondents' invoices or drawn-down requests, or anyone else's. And it has thrown what should be an orderly review by the government into chaos,\" she wrote.",
      "Harris said that officials at the \"highest levels of government\" are involved in the matter and told the Supreme Court that the Trump administration is \"undertaking substantial efforts to review payment requests and release payments.\"",
      "\"The Executive Branch takes seriously its constitutional duty to comply with the orders of Article III courts,\" she wrote.",
      "But she warned that the district court's deadline \"makes full compliance impossible,\" in part because restarting funding related to canceled or suspended agreements requires multiple steps, multiple agencies and documentary evidence.",
      "The acting solicitor general requested an administrative stay, which would maintain the status quo, \"to ensure that the agencies are not placed in the position of violating a federal court order requiring payments on thousands of requests within a 30-some-hour deadline, despite their efforts, while this court reviews the merits of their challenge.\"",
      "The Trump administration had already appealed the district judge's order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and asked it to pause the lower court's decision. But the D.C. Circuit had yet to act by Wednesday evening. Harris said the administration was seeking the Supreme Court's intervention \"in light of that extraordinary circumstance.\"",
      "But shortly after the Trump administration formally asked the high court for emergency relief, the appeals court declined the Trump administration's request to pause the district court's decision. The three-judge panel on the D.C. Circuit said Ali's orders could not be appealed.",
      "Ali, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden in 2024, is overseeing the case brought by a group of companies, nonprofits and other organizations that receive money from the State Department and the USAID. He\u00a0issued a temporary restraining order earlier this month that prevented the Trump administration from freezing foreign aid funds for contracts and other awards while proceedings continued.",
      "But the contractors told Ali earlier this week that foreign aid funding was still not flowing despite his order, and sought prompt payment for work they completed weeks ago. The international development groups said they were owed millions of dollars for invoices and reimbursements, and warned the Trump administration's failure to reinstate the funding forced them to furlough workers and end critical programs overseas.",
      "Ali granted their motion to enforce his earlier order and gave the State Department and USAID 36 hours to pay the bills related to foreign aid contracts and grants.",
      "Justice Department lawyers said in a separate filing that they estimated the payments covered by Ali's order approached $2 billion, and for the challengers alone, the amount at issue was at least $250 million.",
      "\"This new order requiring payment of enormous sums in less than 36 hours intrudes deeply into the prerogatives of the Executive Branch and the president's obligation under Article II to take care that the laws are faithfully executed,\" they wrote in a filing to the D.C. Circuit.",
      "Peter Marocco, director of foreign assistance at the State Department, said in a declaration that the administration is undertaking an \"individualized review\" of contracts and grants, and warned determining the course of those awards is a \"cumbersome, multi-step process.\"",
      "He said that it would take the federal government \"multiple weeks\" to make the payments required by the district court judge.",
      "\"Restarting funding related to terminated or suspended agreements is not as simple as turning on a switch or faucet,\" Morocco wrote in his declaration, adding that USAID and State Department payment systems are \"complicated\" and involve disbursements by numerous other agencies.",

      "The Food and Drug Administration unexpectedly canceled an annual meeting of its advisers to update next season's influenza vaccines, an adviser on the panel and multiple officials tell CBS News, upending the usual process to start manufacturing next winter's flu shots.",
      "\"We're all left trying to understand what is going on. Why was this meeting canceled? It's an important meeting. What's the plan for flu vaccines this year,\" Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the FDA advisory committee and director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told CBS News.",
      "Offit said he received the notification that the meeting was canceled shortly after 4 p.m. The FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee was supposed to meet on March 13 to discuss how to update the shots for the next flu season, Offit said.",
      "Some of the other committee members said they had not received any notification about the upcoming meeting being canceled. Offit said the email he received was addressed to all of the committee's members.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services confirmed Thursday that the meeting had been canceled.",
      "\"The FDA will make public its recommendations to manufacturers in time for updated vaccines to be available for the 2025-2026 influenza season,\" the spokesperson, Andrew Nixon, said in a statement.",
      "It is possible for the FDA to make the pick for flu shots without consulting the panel, a former federal health official said, though it would be unprecedented in recent history.",
      "The panel often largely adopts the WHO's recommendations without changes. However, the committee's input has also spurred major changes in recent years, like a push to abandon use of a now-extinct flu strain in the shots.",
      "The companies that manufacture influenza vaccines rely on the FDA each year to pick out the strains to use in shots made for the American market. The specific strains are chosen each year based on predictions of what flu variants will be circulating in the coming winter.",
      "That selection is usually done by the committee in early March, drawing in large part on recommendations from a meeting of the World Health Organization's advisers reviewing data on influenza from across the Northern Hemisphere.",
      "\"Because the vaccine is grown in eggs, for the most part, it requires six months to produce. So March is six months before September, which is when these vaccines roll out,\" said Offit.",
      "Last year, the FDA asked the committee to meet on March 5 to decide on how to update the influenza shots for the 2024 to 2025 season.",
      "The agency usually announces these meeting dates around a month in advance. Next month's meeting had not yet been publicly disclosed.",
      "Which strains are picked to be targeted by the vaccines can have a significant impact on how effective the shots are.",

      "Washington \u2014 A Tajik man living in New York was arrested and charged with conspiring to provide material support to the ISIS and ISIS-K terrorist groups, according to court documents unsealed Wednesday.",
      "Federal prosecutors alleged that Mansuri Manuchekhri, a Tajik national who was illegally living in Brooklyn, facilitated the transfer of over $70,000 to ISIS-affiliated individuals in Turkey and Syria between December 2021 and June 2023, including to one person who was arrested in Turkey for attacking a church in Istanbul in 2024. ISIS-K, or ISIS-Khorasan, is one of the terrorist group's most dangerous branches and publicly claimed responsibility for the attack.",
      "Manuchekhri was taken into custody after a close family member reported him to a New York terrorism tip line, warning of potential violence and saying that he had threatened to kill the family member, according to an affidavit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that Manuchekhri discussed the payments at length with someone affiliated with ISIS in Turkey, who told him that the money would go to current ISIS soldiers and family members of dead ISIS fighters. They also alleged that Manuchekhri publicly expressed his support of past ISIS attacks on the U.S. and had multiple ISIS propaganda videos on his iCloud account.",
      "Manuchekhri would often train using firearms, prosecutors said, and in two instances sent videos of himself shooting guns to an ISIS contact in Turkey. He allegedly said that he trains with guns \"at least once or twice a week,\" and wrote in another message, \"Thank God, I am ready, brother.\"",
      "He was also charged with illegal possession of firearms, including an AK-47 and a tactical rifle, and immigration fraud. An attorney for Manuchekhri did not immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "The affidavit included photos allegedly taken from Manuchekhri's iCloud account showing him posed with various firearms at shooting ranges:",
      "Prosecutors said that Manuchekhri entered the U.S. on a tourist visa in 2016 and stayed in the country illegally after it expired. In March 2017, he paid an American citizen to enter into a sham marriage with him so he could obtain legal status in the United States, according to the affidavit.",
      "When immigration authorities asked for more documentation about the marriage, Manuchekhri filed for divorce and claimed he was a victim of domestic violence, hoping that would help him become a lawful permanent resident through other legal means, the government said.",
      "Both of Manuchekhri's immigration petitions were fraudulent, prosecutors alleged, adding that they have evidence he never lived with his wife and that utility bills submitted as evidence that the pair lived together were fake.",
      "Manuchekhri appeared before a federal judge on Wednesday and was ordered to be detained as proceedings play out, a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York told CBS News.",
      "The arrest follows a spate of terrorism warnings from the U.S. government, with national security officials pointing to a system that's blinking red in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas on Israel and the emergence of terrorism hot spots in Central Asia.",
      "An ongoing FBI investigation into the New Year's Day truck attack on New Orleans' Bourbon Street found the attacker posted videos declaring his support for ISIS shortly before the deadly rampage. The attacker killed 14 people and injured dozens more when he rammed a pickup truck down the popular tourist spot.",
      "Following the attack, the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and National Counterterrorism Center circulated a law enforcement bulletin warning of the threat of violence from lone offenders: \"Official ISIS messaging in the group's flagship products from 2014 and 2016 called for attackers so use vehicles as weapons in addition to edged weapons and firearms, and pro-ISIS media outlets and the group's online supporters regularly recirculate or re-purpose those produces in a variety of forums.\"",
      "Last October, the FBI arrested Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi for allegedly planning an Election Day terrorist attack in Oklahoma City.

      "Last June, federal agents apprehended eight men from Tajikistan on immigration charges amid concern the men \u2014 who entered via the Southwest border and lived in Los Angeles, New York, and Philadelphia \u2014 were in the early stages of plotting a possible terrorist attack on U.S. soil, according to multiple U.S. officials.",

    "published": "Wed, 26 Feb 2025 19:48:39 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump said the head of the EPA is prepared to implement deep staffing and spending cuts as part of the administration's efforts to downsize the executive branch.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said the head of the Environmental Protection Agency is prepared to implement deep staffing and spending cuts as part of the administration's efforts to downsize the executive branch, raising fears among employees and environmental groups about the impacts of the reductions.",
      "\"He thinks he's going to be cutting 65 or so percent of people from Environmental,\" Mr. Trump said at his first Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, referring to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin. \"You had a lot of people who weren't doing their job. They were just obstructionists.\"",
      "A White House official later clarified that the president was referring to cutting 65% of spending at EPA, not necessarily a 65% cut in staff. Nonetheless, the remarks stoked concern among the EPA's workforce.",
      "The EPA currently employs more than 15,000 people across the country who are dedicated to its core mission of protecting clean air, land and water. A main part of that mission is to enforce federal laws, like the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts, that protect the environment and human health. The agency is also instrumental in cleaning up contaminated lands and toxic sites. It recently wrapped up phase one of the hazardous debris clean-up in California following January's devastating wildfires.",
      "\"Trump said out loud what we have suspected all along: His agenda is to demolish the EPA,\" said Jeremy Symons, a senior adviser with the Environmental Protection Network, a group of more than 650 former EPA employees that was formed in 2017 to protect the integrity of the agency. \"This is a wrecking ball approach that will throw the doors open to corporate polluters.\"",
      "The Office of Personnel Management and Office of Management and Budget issued guidance to the heads of all agencies across the federal government on Wednesday instructing them to submit plans to reduce the size of their workforces and streamline their operations. The memo directed agencies to submit their plans to the offices for approval by March 13. Mr. Trump's comments about the EPA sparked confusion, given the agency has yet to submit a proposal for downsizing.",
      "\"Since this plan hasn't even been submitted to the OPM or OMB for review [and] approval, it is unclear how President Trump could state that there would be a 65% reduction at the EPA,\" said Marie Owens Powell, an EPA union president of Council 238, which represents thousands of employees across the country.",
      "\"President Trump, DOGE, and Administrator Zeldin are committed to cutting waste, fraud, and abuse across all agencies,\" said White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers, referring to the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency. \"After recently identifying $20 billion in fraudulent spending, Administrator Zeldin is committed to eliminating 65% of the EPA's wasteful spending.\"",
      "Rogers did not detail the $20 billion in allegedly fraudulent spending.",
      "Whether it's a 65% cut in staffing or a 65% budget cut, the impacts to the agency would be immense and hurt its ability to do its job, according to environmental organizations.",
      "\"Slashing the staff of the EPA will open the floodgates to more air pollution, contaminated water and toxic chemicals,\" said Alexandra Adams, chief policy advocacy officer at the Natural Resources Defense Council, in a statement. \"Pulling the nation's environmental stewards off the beat is great for polluters, but it's dangerous for the health of our families. Hobbling the EPA is not about saving money, it's about protecting President Trump's friends in the oil industry. Congress needs to step in to help put a stop to this.\""

    "published": "Wed, 26 Feb 2025 17:50:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The SAVE Act could change voter registration requirements for millions of people. Here's how.",
    "story": [
      "A claim circulating on social media suggests that married people who changed their last name will face difficulties when trying to vote under the proposed Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act.",
      "Experts say the bill, which was recently\u00a0reintroduced in the U.S. House of Representatives, would not explicitly prevent these voters from casting a ballot, but it could create barriers to registration by requiring them to show additional documentation.",
      "If passed, the act would amend the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, which requires states\u00a0to offer voter registration when obtaining a driver's license, to mandate documentary proof of citizenship for voter registration.",
      "This means that common forms of ID used for voter registration, including driver's licenses, would no longer be accepted as they are not generally considered proof of citizenship. Instead, voters would have to present documents such as a U.S. passport, a birth certificate, or naturalization paperwork to register.",
      "The Center for American Progress analysis estimated as many as 69 million have taken their spouse's name but do not have a matching birth certificate. \"The fate of those 69 million women are basically up in the air, the way the bill is written,\" said Greta Bedekovics, associate director of democracy policy at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy and advocacy group.",
      "Opponents argue that the law could also make voting more difficult for military and rural voters by upending both mail-in and online voter registration. Bedekovic said it would make an in-person trip to the election office the only \"viable way for Americans across the country to register to vote,\" adding that rural voters are less likely to have a passport and may have to travel hours to obtain and submit documents.",
      "According to Congress.gov, the bill also \"establishes criminal penalties\" for registering someone who does not have the right documents to vote.",
      "Eliza Sweren-Becker, senior counsel in the Brennan Center's Voting Rights and Elections Program, noted that the bill \"does not specify what extra documents\" married individuals would need to produce, adding that \"election officials, who would face legal risks under the bill, would be hesitant to register women whose documentation name does not match their current name.\"",
      "\"This in-person 'show your papers' requirement would keep many eligible voters out of the voting booth \u2014 beyond the millions who already lack ready access to their citizenship documents \u2014 and cause chaos for election administration,\" said Sweren-Becker.",
      "As of January 2025, eight states require proof of citizenship to register to vote, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "Americans widely support both voter ID requirements and proof of citizenship. A\u00a02024 Gallup survey found more than 4 in 5 respondents supported proof of citizenship requirements for first-time voters.",
      "Supporters of the bill, including U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly, a Republican from Pennsylvania, argue that it is necessary to prevent noncitizens from voting.",
      "However,\u00a0noncitizen voting is already illegal and rare. In a study following the 2016 election, the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice found just 30 suspected cases of noncitizen voting out of 23.5 million votes cast in the 42 jurisdictions reviewed.",
      "The SAVE Act has not yet passed and remains under debate in Congress.",
      "A 2023 Pew Research survey found\u00a0that about 80% of women married to men in the U.S. take their husband's last name. Under the SAVE Act, if their voter registration name differs from the name on their birth certificate or passport, they may need to show additional documents.",
      "If the SAVE Act were to become law, Bedekovics said married women who have changed their names should obtain certified copies of all marriage certificates, locate their birth certificates, and keep any change-of-name documentation on hand for any updates to their voter registration.",

      "In the memo, the heads of the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management asked agencies to submit these plans by March 13 and to prepare for \"reductions in force.\"",

      "Those who didn't respond \"are on the bubble,\" he said, adding, \"maybe they're gonna be gone.\"",
      "Musk's role at the helm of the agency has been in question, with the administration denying he was is the DOGE administrator \u2014 a role specified in Mr. Trump's executive order creating the agency.

    "summary": "USDA officials said there are \"no anticipated changes\" to the policy for killing flocks with sick birds.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. Department of Agriculture officials said Wednesday that there are \"no anticipated changes\" to the current federal policy requiring poultry to be culled in response to bird flu outbreaks, which have driven up egg prices to record highs in recent months.",
      "The decision marks a rebuke of an idea floated by Trump administration officials in recent weeks to change the policy. More than 35 million birds have been killed in response to bird flu outbreaks in commercial flocks so far this year, according to the USDA's figures.",
      "\"The Biden plan was to just kill chickens, and they spent billions of dollars just randomly killing chickens within a perimeter where they found a sick chicken,\" Kevin Hasset, director of the White House's economic council, told CBS News' \"Face the Nation\"\u00a0on Feb. 16.",
      "The U.S. and most other countries have a \"stamping-out policy\" for bird flu, in order to comply with standards that underpin international poultry exports from the World Organization for Animal Health, or WOAH.",
      "\"No anticipated changes to our current stamping-out policy at this time. And we will continue to follow WOAH guidelines,\" Rosemary Sifford, chief veterinary officer for the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said Wednesday on a call with stakeholders.",
      "Biden administration officials had defended the culling approach as the best way to contain outbreaks and cut down on unnecessary suffering of poultry birds who are likely to otherwise die prolonged deaths from the disease anyway.",
      "\"The avian flu is an extremely fast spreading virus. And within a couple of days, it spreads so quickly that most of the chickens have died anyway,\" Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said Wednesday in a Fox News interview.",
      "But Rollins also reiterated openness to changing the policy, saying that they hoped to fund research into \"some pilot programs around the country\" that might help avoid culling infected birds.",
      "\"There are some farmers that are out there that are willing to really try this on a pilot as we build the safe perimeter around them to see if there is a way forward with immunity,\" she added.",
      "Changes to how authorities respond to bird flu outbreaks could also have major implications for America's poultry industry, which exported more than $5 billion of poultry products last year.",
      "Rising egg prices",
      "Sifford's remarks come as the Trump administration is rolling out a new plan to combat the surge in egg prices driven by this past winter's uptick in bird flu outbreaks.",
      "Some of the new plan amounts to continuations of programs already being developed at the department, former USDA officials under the Biden administration said, or federal funding that officials had already secured towards combating the virus.",
      "One near-term change officials highlighted is that the USDA says it will soon pay \"up to 75% of the cost of addressing some of the highest risk biosecurity challenges that the producer faces,\" when issues are identified through the free audits that are offered to farmers.",
      "Rollins also said the administration is looking to import eggs in the short term, telling reporters at the White House that the talks could amount to up to 100 million more eggs imported over the next two months.",
      "In a call with reporters, officials mentioned Turkey as an example of a country that could export millions more eggs to the U.S. this year.",
      "The officials also said that they wanted \"to be realistic\" about the temporary imports, citing the need for food safety precautions on imported eggs. Private purchases of the imported eggs will also not be subsidized by the administration.",
      "Considering a plan to vaccinate poultry for bird flu",
      "One longer-term change could be the possibility of deploying a vaccine for poultry, which the Trump administration says it is now seriously considering.",
      "While previous administrations have poured money into research and development of new poultry vaccinations for bird flu, the idea has been plagued by concerns that vaccinating chickens would lead to undetected bird flu infections spreading in flocks that aren't displaying symptoms.",
      "Current outbreaks in the U.S. have already led to some spread of the virus from poultry to raw pet food, leading to the deaths of cats in several states.",
      "Any move to start vaccinating poultry could trigger import bans under agreements governing poultry exports, over concerns that food could be contaminated with the virus. Drawing up a plan to surveil and test poultry for missed infections would be needed to assuage those fears.",
      "One former USDA official under the Biden administration said it took more than a year of daily meetings to negotiate safely resuming imports of some poultry from France after that country's authorities decided to begin vaccinating ducks for bird flu.",
      "\"We expect to start the working group within the next two weeks and we will move very swiftly to put together a full plan, so that we can put that in front of trading partners as quickly as possible,\" said Sifford on the stakeholder call.",
      "USDA officials cautioned that they had not yet actually decided to begin vaccinations of poultry, citing the potential impact on exports.",
      "Instead, the department plans to continue supporting research and development into vaccines. Studies are aimed at overcoming the two longstanding hurdles towards using the shots: attempting to achieve \"sterilizing immunity\" to stop spread of the virus and making it easier to administer to the hundreds of birds in commercial flocks.",
      "\"We're going to make sure that we work to limit any impact on export trade markets, if there ever was vaccination rolled out,\" the department's chief of staff Kailee Buller told reporters.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-gold-card-eb5-visa-5-million-immigration-oligarch-cbs-news-explains/",
    "published": "Wed, 26 Feb 2025 14:47:31 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump is floating the idea of a new \"gold card\" visa that would be sold to wealthy foreigners for $5 million.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Tuesday unveiled a new pathway to residency: a \"gold card\" aimed at wealthy foreigners willing to pay millions for the right to live in the U.S.",
      "That term is a play on the green card, more officially known as a permanent residency card, which allows non-citizens to live and work permanently in the U.S. Green cards are most frequently awarded to foreigners who marry U.S. citizens or to those who receive one through their employer, with the latter process taking an average of three years to complete, according to the Cato Institute.",
      "The new program comes as the Trump administration moves to change the country's rules for who can legally live, work and gain citizenship in the U.S. That includes tightening restrictions on many types of immigration in the U.S. and pushing to\u00a0end birthright citizenship, the constitutionally protected right to citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil.",
      "The U.S. already opens the door to wealthy non-U.S. citizens who want residency through what is known as an EB-5 visa. But that program, launched in 1990, has long been cited for potential\u00a0abuses, including one prominent case from almost a decade ago that involved owners of a Vermont ski resort embezzling millions from foreign investors who hoped to score visas through the program.",
      "Yet both the new gold card and the EB-5 program have a common goal: Attracting foreign capital by allowing rich non-citizens to ante up in exchange for a U.S. residency visa.",
      "\"It's going to be a route to citizenship, and wealthy people will be coming into our country by buying this card, they'll be wealthy, and they'll be successful and they'll be spending a lot of money and paying a lot of taxes and employing a lot of people,\" Mr. Trump said on Tuesday.",
      "Here's what to know about the gold card plan.",
      "What is Trump's gold card?",
      "The gold card will offer a new route for rich non-U.S. citizens to gain a valid visa to live and work in the U.S., according to Mr. Trump, who spoke Tuesday about the new visa with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick from the Oval Office.",
      "The cost of each new visa will be $5 million, Mr. Trump said.",
      "\"We're going to be putting a price on that card of about $5 million, and that's going to give you green card privileges, plus,\" the president added.",
      "Green cards allow recipients to live permanently in the U.S. and work for whomever they choose. By comparison, some immigrants, such as those on H-1B visas, are locked into working for the employer that sponsored their visa.",
      "Green card holders can also travel in and out of the U.S. without restriction, and are able to start the process to become a U.S. citizen.",
      "When will the gold card be available?",
      "Lutnick said the gold cards would be available starting in about two weeks.",
      "Will the gold card replace the EB-5 visa?",
      "Yes, with Lutnick on Tuesday describing the EB-5 program as \"full of nonsense, make believe and fraud.\"",
      "\"So the President said, rather than having this sort of ridiculous EB-5 program, we're going to end the EB-5 program,\" Lutnick said in joining Mr. Trump to outline the gold card program from the Oval Office. \"We're going to replace it with the Trump Gold Card, which is really a Green Card Gold.\"",
      "One major difference between the gold card and the EB-5 visa \u2014 the cost, with the latter requiring applicants to invest about $1 million in the U.S., typically by putting the money into a business. But the EB-5 visa also comes with a host of other requirements, such as documenting that the investment will create or preserve 10 permanent full-time jobs for U.S. workers.",
      "How much money could the gold card raise for the U.S.?",
      "Mr. Trump suggested that the the U.S. could \"sell maybe a million of these cards, maybe more than that.\"",
      "At $5 million each, selling 1 million gold cards could raise $5 trillion, he said.",
      "\"And if you sell 10 million of the cards, that's a total of $50 trillion,\" Mr. Trump added. \"We have $35 trillion in debt. That'll be nice, so we'll see.\"",
      "Typically, the number of annual applicants for EB-5 visas is far lower than what Mr. Trump projects for the gold card. About 8,000 people obtained investor visas in the 12-month period ending Sept. 30, 2022, according to the Homeland Security Department's most recent Yearbook of Immigration Statistics.",
      "If roughly 8,000 people received gold cards each year, the U.S. would raise about $40 billion annually through the program.",
      "The U.S. is a top immigration destination for rich investors, according to Henley & Partners, a company that provides immigration advisory services. The group estimated\u00a0that the U.S. had the second-biggest net influx of millionaires in 2024, following the United Arab Emirates, at about 3,800 foreign millionaires moving stateside last year.",
      "Who could qualify for a gold card?",
      "Aside from having $5 million to pay the U.S. government, gold card applicants would also have to meet other criteria, Lutnick said.",
      "\"They'll have to go through vetting, of course, we're going to make sure they're wonderful world class global citizens,\" he said, without providing details.",

    "published": "Wed, 26 Feb 2025 14:00:49 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump held his first Cabinet meeting at the White House on Wednesday and weighed in on a wide range of topics.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump publicly backed efforts by Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to slash government spending and cut the federal workforce on Wednesday, with the president downplaying potential conflicts between Musk and members of his Cabinet.",
      "Mr. Trump opened his first Cabinet meeting shortly before noon at the White House, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth seated beside him. For more than an hour, Mr. Trump weighed in a wide range of topics, fielding questions from reporters on Ukraine, Russia, Taiwan, the House Republicans' budget plan and more.",
      "But first, the president allowed Musk, who is not a member of the Cabinet, to address the group and discuss his work to cancel contracts and fire workers across the executive branch. Musk is not formally leading the DOGE task force, but has been tasked with overseeing its work by the president.",
      "\"They have a lot of respect for Elon and that he's doing this, and some disagree a little bit, but I will tell you for the most part I think everyone's not only happy, they're thrilled,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Over the weekend, Musk\u00a0sent an email to the entire federal workforce asking them to document five things they accomplished over the past week. On X, he said those who failed to respond would risk losing their jobs. The message sparked confusion from workers and multiple Senate-confirmed Cabinet members told their employees that they could ignore the demand, the first public sign of a split between Musk and other top officials.",
      "Musk said Wednesday that the email was meant to identify employees who may be getting paid without showing up to work, and that Mr. Trump signed off on sending the message. As of Tuesday, the White House said more than 1 million federal employees had responded. The president claimed that the assembled Cabinet members were \"very much behind\" the effort.",
      "\"And if they aren't, I want them to speak up,\" Mr. Trump said during the Cabinet meeting, adding that, \"in many cases, we haven't gotten responses.\"",
      "When a reporter asked Musk if he's heard of any Cabinet members who are unhappy with him, the president asked if those in the room had anything to say. None spoke up.",
      "Wearing a shirt that said \"tech support,\" Musk said DOGE's main goal is to help federal agencies address wasteful spending.",
      "\"DOGE is a support function for the president and for the agencies and departments, to help achieve those savings and to effectively find 15% in reduction in fraud and waste,\" Musk said. While he said that DOGE has tried to be transparent by posting all of its savings online, a CBS News analysis found many discrepancies in its so-called \"wall of receipts.\"",
      "Musk also admitted DOGE will make mistakes, revealing that it briefly canceled funding for Ebola prevention efforts distributed by the U.S. Agency for International Development before reinstating them. On Feb. 11, Musk made a similar claim that the administration had \"turned on funding for Ebola prevention and for HIV prevention,\" an apparent reference to waivers that the government approved, but the New York Times reported the next day that the aid remained frozen. On Feb. 13, a federal judge ordered the administration to reinstate foreign aid contracts and other assistance that had been paused.",
      "During the Cabinet meeting, a journalist asked Mr. Trump if it's his view of his executive authority that he has the power to call up any Cabinet official at the table and issues orders that the official is required to follow.",
      "\"Oh, yeah, they'll follow the orders, yes,\" the president said, adding, \"of course, no exceptions.\"",
      "Later in the meeting, Mr. Trump revealed that the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Lee Zeldin, told him that he believes he can cut 65% of the EPA's workforce.",
      "Mr. Trump also reiterated his plans to begin selling citizenship \"gold cards,\" which would allow foreigners to immigrate to the U.S. in exchange for $5 million, in about two weeks. Mr. Trump said prospective immigrants will be vetted, but he doesn't expect to restrict immigration from specific countries. The president suggested the $5 million payments would go toward paying down the national debt.",
      "On the foreign policy front, Mr. Trump said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is coming to the White House\u00a0on Friday to sign a critical minerals deal framework reached between the U.S. and Ukraine. The two countries reached an agreement on a framework for a broad economic deal that entails access to Ukraine's\u00a0mineral resources.",
      "Most, but not all, of Mr. Trump's top nominees have now been confirmed by the Senate. A full Senate vote has yet to be scheduled for Rep. Elise Stefanik, his pick to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, as House Republicans cannot afford to lose a vote given their razor-thin majority. Linda McMahon, Mr. Trump's pick to run the Department of Education, also has yet to be confirmed by the Senate. Mr. Trump has pledged to overhaul that department.",
      "The president's nomination of Lori Chavez-DeRemer for secretary of labor is still in limbo, with no vote scheduled yet. And the Senate has yet to confirm Jamieson Greer as U.S. trade representative, although the Senate advanced his nomination this week, as the president imposes hefty new tariffs\u00a0on allies and adversaries alike.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 House Republicans narrowly adopted a budget proposal late Tuesday that serves as a blueprint for implementing President Trump's agenda, a dramatic turn of events after a group of holdouts threatened the razor-thin Republican majority's plan.",
      "In a 217-215 vote, the House adopted the resolution, with just one Republican joining all Democrats to oppose it. The resolution now goes to the Senate, which has been pursuing its own budget proposal.",
      "But the two chambers must adopt the same budget plan to move forward with the budget reconciliation process \u2014 a complicated maneuver that allows Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold typically required in the Senate.",
      "Here's what to know about the budget resolution:",
      "What's in the House GOP budget plan?",
      "The budget resolution directs congressional committees to craft their own proposals to hit spending targets, increasing or decreasing funding by adjusting programs and policies that fall under their purview. Republicans want to cut trillions of dollars in spending to pay for trillions in tax cuts, while increasing funding in some areas.",
      "Though Senate Republicans have pushed for two bills to address Mr. Trump's priorities, House Republicans are pursuing one major bill to address border security, defense and energy priorities, along with $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.",
      "Their plan calls for at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts over a 10-year period and instructs a number of committees to find ways to reduce their budget impact, while increasing spending for several other issue areas. The House Ways and Means Committee is tasked with implementing the $4.5 trillion in tax cuts over a decade. The resolution would also raise the debt ceiling by $4 trillion.",
      "Here are the areas where spending would increase:",
      "Up to $110 billion in additional spending for the Judiciary CommitteeUp to $100 billion for the Armed Services CommitteeUp to $90 billion for the Homeland Security Committee",
      "Up to $110 billion in additional spending for the Judiciary Committee",

      "At least $880 billion by the Energy and Commerce Committee\u00a0At least $330 billion by the Education and Workforce Committee\u00a0At least $230 billion by the Agriculture CommitteeAt least $50 billion by the Oversight and Government Reform CommitteeAt least $10 billion by the Transportation and Infrastructure CommitteeAt least $1 billion by the Financial Services CommitteeAt least $1 billion by the Natural Resources Committee",

      "At least $10 billion by the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee",
      "At least $1 billion by the Financial Services Committee",
      "At least $1 billion by the Natural Resources Committee",
      "The final product must be deficit-neutral to comply with reconciliation rules, and Republicans are relying on economic projections that show the tax cuts would spur economic growth that would increase tax revenues. Those projections have been questioned by outside experts and Democrats who describe them as overly optimistic. One analysis found that the budget proposal would allow for a deficit increase of $2.8 trillion through 2034.",
      "Opposition to the proposed cuts",
      "Opponents of the resolution have pointed to the proposed cuts, arguing that they implicate key programs that Americans rely on. Medicaid in particular has come under the microscope \u2014 the Energy and Commerce Committee oversees Medicaid, and the $880 billion it is tasked with saving would almost certainly require cuts to the entitlement program.",
      "House Republican leadership has stressed that Medicaid isn't specifically mentioned in the budget resolution, noting that Tuesday's vote was one simply to begin the reconciliation process. But House Speaker Mike wouldn't commit to preserving Medicaid in its entirety as the reconciliation process continues. Johnson said cuts to the program would target \"fraud, waste and abuse\" within the program. Other Republicans have said that benefits would not be cut.",
      "Under an amendment to the House budget resolution aimed at placating conservatives, House committees must achieve at least $2 trillion in spending cuts in order to secure the proposed $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. But if they slash more than $2 trillion, tax cuts would be increased.",
      "The budget reconciliation process",
      "The budget reconciliation process is a tool used sparingly to work around the 60-vote threshold needed to pass most legislation in the Senate, allowing the party in the majority to approve legislation without support from the minority. But the maneuver is a complicated one, requiring lawmakers to first approve a budget resolution before directing committees to craft bills reconciling spending with the new budget goals.",
      "The final product of the reconciliation process can only include provisions dealing with taxes, spending or the debt limit, and any new spending must be paid for. The Senate parliamentarian must also sign off on the package, confirming that the provisions have direct budgetary consequences, if an item is challenged.",
      "Democrats in the majority approved two major packages under budget reconciliation during the Biden administration \u2014 a pandemic aid package and the Inflation Reduction Act. In 2017, Republicans in the majority approved tax cuts under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the first Trump administration. Also during Mr. Trump's first term, Republicans tried and failed to use the reconciliation process to repeal portions of the Affordable Care Act.",

    "story": [
      "For the second time in two weeks, DOGE's \"receipts\" don't match its claims.",
      "On Monday, the Department of Government Efficiency released another round of so-called \"receipts\" \u2014 or canceled contracts to show its cost cutting \u2014 and posted them on its \"wall of receipts.\" As was the case with the first round, this set, too, contained inaccuracies.",
      "Despite doubling the number of listed contracts, the updated itemized savings now total $9.6 billion, a sharp drop from the original $16.6 billion in savings DOGE itemized last week. At the same time, DOGE is now claiming total savings of $65 billion \u2014 far higher than the amount itemized, and an increase from its earlier claim of $55 billion, much of which has previously been called into question.",
      "$65 billion is approximately 0.9% of the entire 2024 federal budget of $6.75 trillion.",
      "DOGE's website claims this higher figure includes savings from contract and lease terminations, renegotiations, grant cancellations, layoffs and other miscellaneous reductions, but DOGE has not supplied documentation for the vast majority of the savings it claims.",
      "In addition, $144.6 million is attributed to real estate savings, but DOGE has provided no supporting details beyond the dollar figure, agency and city, making independent verification difficult.",
      "DOGE has not explained why it reduced the itemized total, but this is likely due to errors in the original reporting \u2014 many of which were first identified by news organizations including CBS News.",
      "Initially, DOGE listed 1,127 receipts. That number has now grown to 2,299, though 34% of them report zero savings. The newly added receipts also contain apparent errors and instances of double, triple and even quadruple counting.",
      "Many of the contracts included in the \"wall of receipts\" were unlikely to reach the amount of savings that DOGE is claiming. According to Michael LeJeune, a private consultant with an expertise in government contracts, many of these are specific types of agreements with \"unfunded requirements and they rarely get used\" to the full amount. He also says it appears that some of these unfunded or partly-funded contracts are being counted multiple times.",
      "For example, there is a quadruple listing for a contract for DEI training and assessment services for the Department of Agriculture. The overall contract was $25 million, and four companies that provided these services drew funding from that single contract. DOGE, however, mistakenly listed each company as having a separate $25 million contract \u2014 wrongly claiming a total of $100 million in savings.",
      "Other listings also raise questions, including:",
      "Three separate items list savings of $15 million each, but each item references the same contract, a blanket purchase agreement, under different contractors. A blanket purchase agreement is a standard government agreement that is often used for simple repetitive purchases. In this case, the Environmental Protection Agency contract was for \"human resources consulting services.\" The Trump administration terminated the agreement on Jan. 25, referring to the contract as \"Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) Enterprise Services Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs).\" It is unclear how much of the contract's funding had already been spent.",

In reality, government records indicate that only $400 million had been spent over four years across 44 subcontracts, with minimal remaining expenditures expected.

      "An asteroid gaining notoriety for its potential to collide with Earth in 2032\u00a0was estimated Tuesday to have roughly a 3% chance of striking our planet \u2014 the highest probability ever assigned \u2014 before additional analysis Thursday lowered the chances to about 0.28%, according to NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies.",
      "Risks of the massive space rock \u2014 which falls into the \"city killer\" category \u2014 actually making impact have fluctuated\u00a0since it was first discovered last December. Called 2024 YR4, the near-Earth asteroid initially carried a 1% chance of hitting land when NASA and the European Space Agency first announced its existence last month.",
      "Protocols require the agencies to formally notify the public when the odds of an asteroid strike reach that 1% threshold, which in itself is an extremely rare occurrence.",
      "The highest estimate, by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, suggested\u00a0a 3.1% chance the asteroid will hit Earth on Dec. 22, 2032, during a fleeting window of time in which the rock's orbit around the sun intersects the path of the planet. That would make the odds of a collision still quite small, about 1 in 32.",
      "The European Space Agency's peak probability estimate\u00a0was slightly lower, at 2.8%. Last week, NASA and the ESA agreed the probability of an asteroid strike was closer to 2%.",
      "\"However,\" NASA reported, \"on Wednesday, Feb. 19, new data collected overnight reduced the impact probability to 1.5%.\"",
      "It added, \"NASA expects the impact probability to continue to evolve as new observations of asteroid 2024 YR4 are made over the coming days and weeks.\"",
      "Astronomers and researchers have said the probability could drop to zero as they learn more about the asteroid, which will be closely observed by the James Webb Space Telescope before it disappears from view in April. Much of the risk is based on an area of \"uncertainty\" in outer space, where the asteroid may or may not end up, and rising odds reflect new insights into that area, according to Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's Planetary Defence Office.",
      "\"The size of the Earth \u2014 which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014 is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness,\" Moissl\u00a0told CBS News last week, speaking about how the odds of a collision are determined.",
      "The size of the uncertainty region has shrunk since then, because more is known about it, so Earth, remaining the same size, occupies a greater portion of the region than it did originally. Scientifically, that drives up the probability even though nothing has truly changed, Moissl said. He emphasized that even a 3% chance of hitting Earth corresponds with a 97% chance of missing it, and in all likelihood 2024 YR4 will not pose threats to our world.",
      "\"What will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further,\" he said. \"And the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.\"",
      "Probability of a crash will most likely dip below 1% before April, experts say, as the asteroid's orbit carries it too far from Earth for humans to see it on the ground. After that, 2024 YR4 will not be visible again for four years.",
      "It is possible the probability of a collision continues to rise, moderately, if its route takes it on a \"close flyby\" of Earth. Moissl said \"this is still no cause for alarm,\" although international space organizations are taking the slim risk seriously. The asteroid, at 40 to 90 meters wide, could be capable of destroying a mid-sized city on Earth. If researchers find its actual size to be nearer the top end of that range, it could flatten some of the world's largest metropolitan areas.",

      "An asteroid capable of flattening a mid-sized city could potentially collide with Earth eight years from now, as its orbit around the sun briefly intersects the path of our planet. Named 2024 YR4, the space rock carries with it very slim odds of striking land \u2014 either on Earth or the moon \u2014 and astronomers recently set the odds of a crash at 0.28%.",
      "International space organizations like NASA are taking the possible threat seriously, however small it might be. Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's Planetary Defence Office, said their attentiveness shouldn't unduly raise public concern. He shared key facts about the asteroid with CBS News during the below conversation, which has been edited for clarity.",
      "When would the asteroid hit Earth?",
      "This asteroid passes us by every four years. Every time we go four times around the sun, it has almost precisely completed one turn. It has just recently had a flyby in December 2024, which means the next flyby is in December 2028, and we know already that this one is no problem.",
      "The critical one is in 2032, on the 22nd of December, somewhere around the middle of the day in Universal Time. That is when the asteroid is passing, really, through a part of the orbit of the Earth. So, it's really going through the path of Earth, so to speak.",
      "And the question is, whether Earth will be there at this point in time, or whether it will have already passed or is still approaching that point. It's the question, where will it pass by? There's an uncertainty region that spans, right now, the entire Earth-Moon system \u2014 which is not to say that we don't know a lot about it. In fact, we know a lot about it.",
      "Now, we're looking at a closing moment in time on the 22nd of December, 2032, and the question is about fractions of a meter per second, which will make all the difference.",
      "There's about a 20-something-minute window in which the Earth can be in the way of this before it's no longer in the path of the asteroid, or the asteroid cannot come in contact with the Earth anymore.",
      "How is the asteroid risk being managed?",
      "Until recently, we did daily measurements with different telescopes. Then, we had to pause a little bit for one or two days because of the full moon, and the object being too close to the full moon, and the moon illuminating the sky too much to see it.",
      "From now on, we will not monitor it daily, but it will be constantly monitored in the best way possible, with ever larger telescopes. And the idea is to measure its path around the sun in ever higher positions, so you will see this uncertainty region shrink, and shrink, and shrink. And we are trying to constrain the uncertainty so much that we can say whether it passes by Earth safely, or whether there is still some chance left in the middle of April.",
      "What happens in April?",
      "We will be so far away from the object that we cannot observe it from Earth anymore. And then, the James Webb Telescope will take measurements. It will actually take one in March, primarily infrared observations that give us more insight about the size of the object, and then one more in May to do additional measurements. The most likely scenario is that, by that time, you will be able to say, look, we can prove it's not going to hit Earth, but there is a chance that we cannot eliminate it completely. And that will be the more interesting bit, because then we have to wait until mid-2028, when we can observe it again. We will not let that time pass by without action.",
      "When was the last time an asteroid had similar odds of hitting Earth?",
      "This is only the second time that impact prediction systems have rated any asteroid with an impact probability of more than 1%. The last time was about 20 years ago, with the asteroid Apophis in 2004, which reached a couple of percent for a brief period in time before the uncertainty region could be constrained.",
      "That shows how unusual 1% is, and that means that we, as experts, have to take this seriously. However, with the current probability estimated at around 3%, it's still around 97% likely that nothing bad will happen at all. So, that needs to be kept in mind all the time. This is something that merits attention, but it's not perceived as an imminent threat. It's just, we need to find out more about it.",
      "Have asteroids this size actually crashed into Earth?",
      "We are aware of a recent example in history where this has happened. It was 1908 in Siberia. There was an event where 2,000 square kilometers of forest had been flattened by a big explosion, high up in the atmosphere. And this is very consistent with a body about 50 meters in diameter, plus or minus 10 meters, entering Earth's atmosphere.",
      "The body itself was, then, likely not a solid piece of rock. It was more like, what we call a pile of smaller pieces of rock. And this burst several kilometers above the surface and had this effect, that 2,000 square kilometers of forest was flattened, that seismic waves went out from this and could be detected far away, that people witnessed this event, also from very far away.",
      "We don't know if anyone was hurt in that accident. Nothing is reported. But the size, the footprint of the destruction is comparable to a major urban area, or a big city on Earth. So, this is basically the scenario that we would expect from this.",
      "Another example not recorded in human history was an object believed to have been about 50 meters in diameter, a massive chunk of iron that formed the Barringer meteor crater in Arizona. It's a 1.2-kilometer crater. If you look at this and think about it, if that were to hit in a city, the city would look very, very different afterward.",
      "The estimated size of this asteroid ranges from about 40 to 90 meters. Wouldn't there also be a big difference between the damage caused by something 40 meters wide versus 90 meters?",
      "Absolutely. I mean, the 40 to 90 meters is a standard estimate, because we cannot know at this point in time what the surface brightness is. Current data indicate it's more toward the 40- or 50-meter size. So, luckily, on the smaller size range, which is why I cited these popular examples for this.",
      "But, indeed, size matters for asteroids. Size matters a lot. If we're talking about the doubling of the radius of an asteroid, that means eight times the mass, eight times the energy, and that is a significant difference, of course. While on the lower end of the scale, with about 40 meters, it would be threatening to, let's say, a middle-sized city, on the 90-meter edge, it might be comparable to the biggest urban areas.",
      "Why has the probability of 2024 YR4 hitting Earth increased since it was first discovered?",
      "The good news is, this increase does not mean that the asteroid has become more dangerous. The path of the asteroid is defined by physical laws. It's already clear. It's just our knowledge of where that path would be, in reality, is not perfect yet.",
      "The percentage can be compared to the size of the uncertainty area, compared with the size of the Earth. If you look at the fraction, the size of the Earth \u2014   which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014   is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness.",
      "Since then, the size of the uncertainty region has basically shrunk by half. And the size of Earth, luckily, remains the same. So, that means Earth is now occupying twice the amount of space in the uncertainty region. And it means our estimate for the impact risk has risen from 1% to 3%. It doesn't mean that anything has changed.",
      "Again, 3% is a 97% chance of missing. So what will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further, and the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.",
      "In the case of this being a close flyby to Earth, if it's reasonably close, it's entirely possible that the impact probability will continue to rise a little bit on a modest path. This is still no cause for alarm.",
      "The asteroid has been assigned a Level 3 ranking, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale. How uncommon is that?",
      "It's the first time ever that an object is officially classified as a Level 3 on the Torino scale. The only other object that was ever classified with a level higher than 1 was Apophis. Because of its larger size, Apophis has been classified as a 4 on the Torino scale, which is really just indicating that it's a larger object. [Apophis has an estimated diameter of 350 meters, which is much larger than the asteroid 2024 YR4.]",
      "What else should people know?",
      "Well, the most important thing is, don't panic. Always good advice, but it's definitely applicable advice in this situation. I think this gives us a chance to prove that we, as a planet, can still rise above things on Earth that are between people, between countries, between parts of Earth. That if we are facing a completely outside threat, that we can all come together, join forces and face these kinds of threats together.",
      "This one is a manageable challenge. Even if it were to be headed towards Earth, which is by no means certain, 97% it's clear that it will miss us. So, not much to be afraid of, but a good chance to show that we can stand united on this planet.",

    "summary": "Intuitive Machines launches its second moon lander, which will use NASA and commercially developed tools to search for ice in the moon's crust.",
    "story": [
      "With two commercial moon landers already on their way, Houston-based Intuitive Machines launched its second robotic lander atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket Wednesday, the centerpiece of a multi-element NASA-sponsored mission to help pave the way for human expeditions.",
      "The workhorse rocket's nine first-stage engines roared to life at  7:16 p.m. EST, pushing the booster away from pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center atop 1.9 million pounds of thrust and a brilliant jet of flaming exhaust.",
      "Arcing to the east through a crystal-clear early evening sky, the rocket quickly disappeared from view as it consumed propellant and lost weight. Two-and-a-half minutes after liftoff, the first stage fell away and the Falcon 9 continued toward space on the power of its single second stage engine.",
      "A little less than six minutes after that, the upper stage engine shut down, putting the rocket on the planned trajectory. A second one-minute firing was carried out 36 minutes after launch to put the upper stage and its payloads on course for the moon.",
      "Given the on-time launch and assuming no major problems, the Athena lander is expected to descend to touchdown on a flat mesa-like structure known as Mons Mouton on March 6, setting down just 100 miles from the moon's south pole \u2014 closer than any other spacecraft has attempted.",
      "Another privately-built moon lander, Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost, was launched by a Falcon 9 SpaceX rocket on Jan. 15 and is on course to land on the moon early Sunday. Touching down near the center of Mare Crisium, it is equipped with 10 NASA-sponsored instruments to collect data needed for planned astronaut landings in the agency's Artemis program.",
      "Blue Ghost shared its Falcon 9 with yet another moon lander, this one built by the Japanese company ispace. It is on a longer, low-energy trajectory to the moon and is expected to land in May.",
      "What's different about the Athena lander",
      "The Athena lander represents a more complex mission with broader science goals. Intuitive Machines managers say they incorporated dozens of upgrades and improvements to insure a safe, upright landing after the company's first lander, Odysseus, tipped over during touchdown last February.",
      "\"Every time you go, it's ... a roll-the-dice thing,\" said CEO Steve Altemus. \"I think we have higher confidence, but we're also have a much more complicated mission this time.",
      "\"This time we're flying with a deployable drill. We're flying with a deployable rover, we're flying with a drone, (a) rocket-powered drone that hops, flies off the lander and hops along the surface and down into a permanently shadowed (crater).",
      "\"All those deployments and surface operations are new, and we're going to learn when we do those,\" he said.",
      "The Athena lander's Trident drill and a mass spectrometer will analyze the ultra-cold soil beneath the spacecraft. The lander also will deploy a small commercially-built rover and a rocket-powered hopper that will jump up to 300 feet high before bounding into a nearby, permanently shadowed crater in search of ice deposits.",
      "Ice would be a critical resource for future astronauts, if it can be extracted, because it can be turned into drinking water, air and even rocket fuel, providing in situ resources that otherwise would have to be carried up from Earth.",
      "Data collected by orbiting satellites indicate reservoirs of ice may be present in the cold, dark interiors of polar craters that never see the light of the sun. Athena's mission is the first to actually search for the suspected ice from the surface.",
      "The hopper, named Grace after software pioneer Grace Hopper, and the Mobile Autonomous Prospecting Platform rover built by a company called Lunar Outpost, will communicate with the Athena lander via cellular networking equipment provided by Nokia in a first-of-its-kind demonstration.",
      "Other spacecrafts tagging along",
      "A tiny microrover known as Yaoki, provided by Tokyo-based Dymon Co., will be dropped to the surface from the Athena lander. It will provide close-up images of the lunar soil, or regolith, and beam them back to Earth through Athena.",
      "In case all that is not enough, hitching a ride aboard the Falcon 9 are three more independent spacecraft, one provided by NASA and two from private companies.",
      "AstroForge's commercially developed Odin asteroid prospector was released four minutes after Athena, NASA's Lunar Trailblazer satellite was deployed about 20 seconds after that followed a few seconds later by Epic Aerospace's Chimera GEO-1 space tug.",
      "Odin is headed for deep space on an asteroid prospecting mission. It will be the first commercially-built probe to fly beyond the moon, heading for an asteroid flyby to look for potentially valuable mineral deposits.",
      "During the Lunar Trailblazer's two-year mission, two instruments will study the nature of any ice that might be present in the lunar soil below while measuring surface temperatures on a global scale.",
      "The third satellite, known as Chimera GEO, was provided by Epic Aerospace. It's a compact space tug built to move small satellites to different locations in Earth orbit.",
      "The Grace hopper may end up the star of the show. Five hops are planned with the first carrying it to an altitude of about 65 feet to a landing another 65 feet from Athena.",
      "\"On the second hop, we expect to go around 50 meters (164 feet) altitude. And on the third hop we'll go about 100 meters (328 feet) altitude,\" said Trent Martin, a senior vice president at Intuitive Machines.",
      "The fourth hop will carry Grace into a permanently shadowed crater some 1,500 from the lander. It's fifth and final hop, either commanded through the Nokia network or triggered by a backup timer, will carry Gracie back up and out of the crater.",
      "\"The purpose of the demo is to show that we can reach extreme environments with technologies other than rovers,\" Martin said. \"The idea is that if you have a really deep crater and you want to get down into that crater, why not do it with something like a drone?\"",
      "The costs of the mission",
      "NASA paid Intuitive Machines $62 million to deliver the Trident drill and mass spectrometer, known collectively as Prime-1, to the moon. NASA's \"tipping point\" technology development program paid $15 million to help fund Nokia's cellular communications integration and another $41 million helps finance Intuitive's Grace hopper.",
      "Finally, NASA spent another $89 million on the Lunar Trailblazer satellite and mission operations. Total cost to NASA: $207 million.",
      "The mission was funded in large part by the agency's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative.",
      "The CLPS program is aimed at encouraging private industry to launch agency payloads to the moon to collect needed science and engineering data before Artemis astronauts begin work on the surface near the lunar south pole later this decade.",
      "\"NASA is investing in commercial delivery services to the moon to enable industry growth and to support long-term lunar exploration, helping the United States stay ahead in space innovation,\" said Nicola Fox, head of NASA's space science mission directorate.",
      "Athena is Intuitive Machines' second CLPS-sponsored lunar lander. The company's first lander, Odysseus, touched down on the moon on Feb. 22, 2024. But the spacecraft came down harder than expected and it was moving slightly to one side at the moment of touchdown. It apparently caught a footpad on the surface and tipped over on its side.",
      "The spacecraft still had power, however, and it sent back data for several days. This time around, multiple upgrades were put in place to insure a safe landing for Athena.",
      "\"If you can routinely land on the moon, all the smart people, the scientists, and the engineers that want to fly things to the moon will now be willing to invest money, to build and engineer the systems that will help us live and work on the moon,\" Altemus said.",
      "\"These are the initial highways or trails that open up a whole new region of exploration of the moon. Like the United States when it was very young, go west, right? This is like that. Just like that.\"",

      "For the best chances, spectators should look at the sky as soon as the sun sets. That's when the planets will make a brief appearance.",
      "Which day is best will depend on the location. Tokyo started seeing the parade first, on Feb. 22, according to Star Walk, a sky-gazing app. New York will have the best view of the event on Feb. 25, Star Walk said. In other parts of the world, the phenomenon will be best visible in early March. Worldwide, the best day to see the alignment will be Feb. 28.",
      "How to watch the planetary parade",
      "Five planets are visible to the naked eye, according to NASA: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.",
      "Mars will appear reddish and high in the sky, near the Gemini constellation, Star Walk said. Jupiter will be a bit lower in the sky, near Taurus. Venus will appear as the brightest planet in the sky, near the Pisces constellation.",
      "Mercury will be in the constellation Aquarius, near the sun and just above the western horizon. Saturn will also be near the sun and low in the horizon, making it harder to spot, Star Walk said.",
      "To see Uranus and Neptune, you'll need a telescope, NASA said. Uranus will appear in the Aries constellation, and Neptune will be in Pisces, Star Walk said.",
      "The display will only be visible for a few minutes after sunset, because the planets near the horizon \u2014 Saturn and Mercury \u2014 will be setting. Once they drop below the horizon, they will no longer be visible, but the other planets will linger in the night sky.",
      "For the best view, head to a location with minimal light pollution and a clear view of the horizon. Clear skies will also be necessary to see all the planets.",
      "How do planetary alignments work?",
      "The planets in the solar system orbit the sun, just as Earth does. Every planet orbits at a different speed and distance.",
      "During these alignments, the planets appear to be lined up from Earth's perspective, creating the visual display, NASA said. In reality, the planets are extremely far from each other.",
      "The planets also move very slowly, causing the multi-day timeline of the planetary parades.",
      "When will the next planetary alignment be?",
      "Lineups of four or five planets occur every few years, according to NASA. In late August 2025, four planets will be visible before sunrise, and in late October 2028, five planets will be visible at once before sunrise. Another five-planet alignment will occur in late February 2034, with the planets visible after sunset.",
      "\"In summary, while they aren't once-in-a-lifetime events, planetary parades afford an uncommon opportunity to look up and appreciate our place in our solar system, with diverse worlds arrayed across the sky before our very eyes,\" NASA says on its website.",
      "Outside of the planetary alignments, it's possible to spot other planets individually. Mars, Jupiter and Saturn are frequently seen in the night sky, according to NASA.",

    "summary": "The asteroid 2024 YR4 has a very small chance of striking Earth when its orbit briefly intersects our planet's in December 2032.",
    "story": [
      "An asteroid gaining notoriety for its potential to collide with Earth in 2032\u00a0was estimated Tuesday to have roughly a 3% chance of striking our planet \u2014 the highest probability ever assigned \u2014 before additional analysis Thursday lowered the chances to about 0.28%, according to NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies.",
      "Risks of the massive space rock \u2014 which falls into the \"city killer\" category \u2014 actually making impact have fluctuated\u00a0since it was first discovered last December. Called 2024 YR4, the near-Earth asteroid initially carried a 1% chance of hitting land when NASA and the European Space Agency first announced its existence last month.",
      "Protocols require the agencies to formally notify the public when the odds of an asteroid strike reach that 1% threshold, which in itself is an extremely rare occurrence.",
      "The highest estimate, by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, suggested\u00a0a 3.1% chance the asteroid will hit Earth on Dec. 22, 2032, during a fleeting window of time in which the rock's orbit around the sun intersects the path of the planet. That would make the odds of a collision still quite small, about 1 in 32.",
      "The European Space Agency's peak probability estimate\u00a0was slightly lower, at 2.8%. Last week, NASA and the ESA agreed the probability of an asteroid strike was closer to 2%.",
      "\"However,\" NASA reported, \"on Wednesday, Feb. 19, new data collected overnight reduced the impact probability to 1.5%.\"",
      "It added, \"NASA expects the impact probability to continue to evolve as new observations of asteroid 2024 YR4 are made over the coming days and weeks.\"",
      "Astronomers and researchers have said the probability could drop to zero as they learn more about the asteroid, which will be closely observed by the James Webb Space Telescope before it disappears from view in April. Much of the risk is based on an area of \"uncertainty\" in outer space, where the asteroid may or may not end up, and rising odds reflect new insights into that area, according to Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's Planetary Defence Office.",
      "\"The size of the Earth \u2014 which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014 is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness,\" Moissl\u00a0told CBS News last week, speaking about how the odds of a collision are determined.",
      "The size of the uncertainty region has shrunk since then, because more is known about it, so Earth, remaining the same size, occupies a greater portion of the region than it did originally. Scientifically, that drives up the probability even though nothing has truly changed, Moissl said. He emphasized that even a 3% chance of hitting Earth corresponds with a 97% chance of missing it, and in all likelihood 2024 YR4 will not pose threats to our world.",
      "\"What will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further,\" he said. \"And the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.\"",
      "Probability of a crash will most likely dip below 1% before April, experts say, as the asteroid's orbit carries it too far from Earth for humans to see it on the ground. After that, 2024 YR4 will not be visible again for four years.",
      "It is possible the probability of a collision continues to rise, moderately, if its route takes it on a \"close flyby\" of Earth. Moissl said \"this is still no cause for alarm,\" although international space organizations are taking the slim risk seriously. The asteroid, at 40 to 90 meters wide, could be capable of destroying a mid-sized city on Earth. If researchers find its actual size to be nearer the top end of that range, it could flatten some of the world's largest metropolitan areas.",

      "An asteroid has a small chance of hitting Earth less than eight years from now, and astronomers are enlisting the help of NASA's James Webb Space Telescope to study it. Characterized as a potential \"city-killer,\" the asteroid was first detected in December and its odds of impacting our planet have fluctuated since then, according to NASA and the European Space Agency.",
      "The space rock is formally named 2024 YR4. Scientists say the risk of it making contact with Earth is remote \u2014 with NASA giving it as high as a 3.1% chance before reducing its estimate to 0.28%, and the European agency putting it at 0.16%, down from around 2.8% \u2014 when it eventually reaches this part of the solar system on Dec. 22, 2032. Although the asteroid will most likely pass by without issue, those tasked with monitoring its physical attributes and potential have shifted upward the probability of a crash since 2024 YR4 was initially discovered.",
      "The European Space Agency in January placed the asteroid's odds of hitting Earth at roughly 1%, before NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory estimated the risk was more like 1.6% at the tail end of the month. Officials at both agencies acknowledge the unlikelihood of 2024 YR4 causing problems, with the ESA saying that current risk estimates are probably unnecessarily high because the people studying it are still uncertain about some of the asteroid's key features.",
      "Right now, astronomers estimate the asteroid is between 40 meters and 90 meters wide, which is roughly 130 to 295 feet wide. For reference, an American football field measures 100 yards \u2014 or 300 feet \u2014 long.",
      "\"It is very important that we improve our size estimate for 2024 YR4,\" the ESA said in a statement Monday, which noted \"the hazard represented by a 40 m asteroid is very different from that of a 90 m asteroid.\"",
      "On the slim chance the asteroid does strike Earth in 2032, its impacts would be localized. But 2024 YR4 has nonetheless received a Level 3 rating, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale, which is a fairly rare distinction meant to represent \"a close encounter\" that warrants public and scientific attention.",
      "\"An asteroid this size impacts Earth on average every few thousand years and could cause severe damage to a local region,\" the ESA said\u00a0a previous statement\u00a0about 2024 YR4.",
      "If the asteroid does hit the planet, NASA said its potential impact sites could include areas over the eastern Pacific Ocean, northern South America, the Atlantic Ocean, Africa, the Arabian Sea and South Asia.",
      "CBS News space consultant Bill Harwood said if it landed in a populated area, it would \"be truly catastrophic,\" but the effects would be localized.",
      "\"It wouldn't be something like the rock that killed the dinosaurs,\" Harwood said. \"It wouldn't affect the global climate, but it would certainly be a disaster of every proportion. So we're all hoping that doesn't happen.\"",
      "In order to gain a greater understanding of the asteroid and better prepare for whatever is to come, astronomers will use the Webb Telescope to collect data on its size that could not be observed as accurately without the telescope's technology, the ESA said.",
      "Where scientists are generally limited to observing the asteroid based on the amount of visible light it reflects from the sun, with brighter light typically signaling a larger asteroid, the Webb telescope can calculate its infrared emissions, allowing for more accurate estimates.",
      "Webb will begin studying the asteroid in March, when it appears brightest, and again in May, according to the ESA. 2024 YR4 will disappear from view for a while after that, and astronomers will take time to interpret the telescope's data and determine what it could mean for the asteroid's route before it shows itself again in 2028.",

    "summary": "The head of planetary defense at the European Space Agency discusses 2024 YR4, an asteroid with a small chance of striking Earth eight years from now.",
    "story": [
      "An asteroid capable of flattening a mid-sized city could potentially collide with Earth eight years from now, as its orbit around the sun briefly intersects the path of our planet. Named 2024 YR4, the space rock carries with it very slim odds of striking land \u2014 either on Earth or the moon \u2014 and astronomers recently set the odds of a crash at 0.28%.",
      "International space organizations like NASA are taking the possible threat seriously, however small it might be. Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's Planetary Defence Office, said their attentiveness shouldn't unduly raise public concern. He shared key facts about the asteroid with CBS News during the below conversation, which has been edited for clarity.",
      "When would the asteroid hit Earth?",
      "This asteroid passes us by every four years. Every time we go four times around the sun, it has almost precisely completed one turn. It has just recently had a flyby in December 2024, which means the next flyby is in December 2028, and we know already that this one is no problem.",
      "The critical one is in 2032, on the 22nd of December, somewhere around the middle of the day in Universal Time. That is when the asteroid is passing, really, through a part of the orbit of the Earth. So, it's really going through the path of Earth, so to speak.",
      "And the question is, whether Earth will be there at this point in time, or whether it will have already passed or is still approaching that point. It's the question, where will it pass by? There's an uncertainty region that spans, right now, the entire Earth-Moon system \u2014 which is not to say that we don't know a lot about it. In fact, we know a lot about it.",
      "Now, we're looking at a closing moment in time on the 22nd of December, 2032, and the question is about fractions of a meter per second, which will make all the difference.",
      "There's about a 20-something-minute window in which the Earth can be in the way of this before it's no longer in the path of the asteroid, or the asteroid cannot come in contact with the Earth anymore.",
      "How is the asteroid risk being managed?",
      "Until recently, we did daily measurements with different telescopes. Then, we had to pause a little bit for one or two days because of the full moon, and the object being too close to the full moon, and the moon illuminating the sky too much to see it.",
      "From now on, we will not monitor it daily, but it will be constantly monitored in the best way possible, with ever larger telescopes. And the idea is to measure its path around the sun in ever higher positions, so you will see this uncertainty region shrink, and shrink, and shrink. And we are trying to constrain the uncertainty so much that we can say whether it passes by Earth safely, or whether there is still some chance left in the middle of April.",
      "What happens in April?",
      "We will be so far away from the object that we cannot observe it from Earth anymore. And then, the James Webb Telescope will take measurements. It will actually take one in March, primarily infrared observations that give us more insight about the size of the object, and then one more in May to do additional measurements. The most likely scenario is that, by that time, you will be able to say, look, we can prove it's not going to hit Earth, but there is a chance that we cannot eliminate it completely. And that will be the more interesting bit, because then we have to wait until mid-2028, when we can observe it again. We will not let that time pass by without action.",
      "When was the last time an asteroid had similar odds of hitting Earth?",
      "This is only the second time that impact prediction systems have rated any asteroid with an impact probability of more than 1%. The last time was about 20 years ago, with the asteroid Apophis in 2004, which reached a couple of percent for a brief period in time before the uncertainty region could be constrained.",
      "That shows how unusual 1% is, and that means that we, as experts, have to take this seriously. However, with the current probability estimated at around 3%, it's still around 97% likely that nothing bad will happen at all. So, that needs to be kept in mind all the time. This is something that merits attention, but it's not perceived as an imminent threat. It's just, we need to find out more about it.",
      "Have asteroids this size actually crashed into Earth?",
      "We are aware of a recent example in history where this has happened. It was 1908 in Siberia. There was an event where 2,000 square kilometers of forest had been flattened by a big explosion, high up in the atmosphere. And this is very consistent with a body about 50 meters in diameter, plus or minus 10 meters, entering Earth's atmosphere.",
      "The body itself was, then, likely not a solid piece of rock. It was more like, what we call a pile of smaller pieces of rock. And this burst several kilometers above the surface and had this effect, that 2,000 square kilometers of forest was flattened, that seismic waves went out from this and could be detected far away, that people witnessed this event, also from very far away.",
      "We don't know if anyone was hurt in that accident. Nothing is reported. But the size, the footprint of the destruction is comparable to a major urban area, or a big city on Earth. So, this is basically the scenario that we would expect from this.",
      "Another example not recorded in human history was an object believed to have been about 50 meters in diameter, a massive chunk of iron that formed the Barringer meteor crater in Arizona. It's a 1.2-kilometer crater. If you look at this and think about it, if that were to hit in a city, the city would look very, very different afterward.",
      "The estimated size of this asteroid ranges from about 40 to 90 meters. Wouldn't there also be a big difference between the damage caused by something 40 meters wide versus 90 meters?",
      "Absolutely. I mean, the 40 to 90 meters is a standard estimate, because we cannot know at this point in time what the surface brightness is. Current data indicate it's more toward the 40- or 50-meter size. So, luckily, on the smaller size range, which is why I cited these popular examples for this.",
      "But, indeed, size matters for asteroids. Size matters a lot. If we're talking about the doubling of the radius of an asteroid, that means eight times the mass, eight times the energy, and that is a significant difference, of course. While on the lower end of the scale, with about 40 meters, it would be threatening to, let's say, a middle-sized city, on the 90-meter edge, it might be comparable to the biggest urban areas.",
      "Why has the probability of 2024 YR4 hitting Earth increased since it was first discovered?",
      "The good news is, this increase does not mean that the asteroid has become more dangerous. The path of the asteroid is defined by physical laws. It's already clear. It's just our knowledge of where that path would be, in reality, is not perfect yet.",
      "The percentage can be compared to the size of the uncertainty area, compared with the size of the Earth. If you look at the fraction, the size of the Earth \u2014   which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014   is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness.",
      "Since then, the size of the uncertainty region has basically shrunk by half. And the size of Earth, luckily, remains the same. So, that means Earth is now occupying twice the amount of space in the uncertainty region. And it means our estimate for the impact risk has risen from 1% to 3%. It doesn't mean that anything has changed.",
      "Again, 3% is a 97% chance of missing. So what will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further, and the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.",
      "In the case of this being a close flyby to Earth, if it's reasonably close, it's entirely possible that the impact probability will continue to rise a little bit on a modest path. This is still no cause for alarm.",
      "The asteroid has been assigned a Level 3 ranking, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale. How uncommon is that?",
      "It's the first time ever that an object is officially classified as a Level 3 on the Torino scale. The only other object that was ever classified with a level higher than 1 was Apophis. Because of its larger size, Apophis has been classified as a 4 on the Torino scale, which is really just indicating that it's a larger object. [Apophis has an estimated diameter of 350 meters, which is much larger than the asteroid 2024 YR4.]",
      "What else should people know?",
      "Well, the most important thing is, don't panic. Always good advice, but it's definitely applicable advice in this situation. I think this gives us a chance to prove that we, as a planet, can still rise above things on Earth that are between people, between countries, between parts of Earth. That if we are facing a completely outside threat, that we can all come together, join forces and face these kinds of threats together.",
      "This one is a manageable challenge. Even if it were to be headed towards Earth, which is by no means certain, 97% it's clear that it will miss us. So, not much to be afraid of, but a good chance to show that we can stand united on this planet.",

      "\"DEI poses litigation, reputational and financial risks to companies, and therefore financial risks to their shareholders, and therefore further risks to companies for not abiding by their fiduciary duties,\" according to the\u00a0proposal offered by the group. It offered a similar proposal at Costco's annual meeting in January that shareholders also\u00a0rejected.",
      "\"The risks to Apple stemming from continuing to push these divisive and value-destroying agendas is only increasing in light of President Trump's recent executive order focusing the Department of Justice on rooting out illegal discrimination being carried out in the name of DEI,\" Stephen Padfield, executive director of the National Center for Public Policy Research's Free Enterprise Project, said in a prerecorded statement played to Apple shareholders on Tuesday.",
      "\"The vibe shift is clear, DEI is out and annual merit is in,\" Padfield said.",
      "In responding to the anti-DEI proposal, Apple defended its diversity program as an integral part of its corporate culture, crediting the policies in part for making the technology giant the most valuable company in the world.",

      "Shifting DEI landscape",
      "Certain forms of DEI have become more legally risky than just a few years ago, yet practices such as employers posing standardized questions in recruitment to mitigate implicit bias are legally sound, according to David Glasgow, an adjunct professor at the New York University School of Law and executive director of its Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging.",
      "\"DEI is a really broad umbrella term covering things like disabilities, parental leave and flexible work.

      "Over the last month, the U.S. government has worked quickly to pause, disband and dismantle the U.S. effort to fight foreign meddling in elections, raising concern among federal lawmakers and election officials across the country who rely on the federal cybersecurity agency and its counterparts to warn them about attacks on election systems.",
      "First came a flurry of notices forcing out Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency personnel who are tasked with stopping foreign interference in U.S. elections \u2014 at least a dozen have been put on leave or fired over the past month. Then, on Attorney General Pam Bondi's first day in office on Feb. 5, she disbanded the FBI task force targeting foreign influence operations originating from places like Russia, China and Iran.",
      "The focus on election security has been turned toward the past, rather than the future. In an internal memo earlier this month, CISA's acting director announced an internal investigation to assess every position and program that touches election security \u2014 including election misinformation and disinformation \u2014 dating back to President Trump's first term in office, with findings to be delivered in a final report on March 6.",

      "The memo landed in the mailboxes of CISA's roughly 3,400 personnel on Valentine's Day, hours before more than 130 probationary workers \u2013 roughly 4% of the nation's cyberdefense agency \u2014 were summarily fired with form-letter terminations.",

      "In a letter to President Trump, Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes likened the cuts to shutting down the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ahead of hurricane season. \"This decision undermines Arizona's election security at a time when our enemies around the world are using online tools to push their agendas and ideologies into our very homes,\" he wrote.",
      "The moves come months after CISA and the FBI aided states responding to a slew of Election Day bomb threats and white powder mailings. Officials debunked phony Russian-linked videos\u00a0purporting to depict election workers destroying ballots during nationwide voting, and an FBI investigation outed a hack-and-leak operation that stole documents from Mr. Trump's campaign, leading to the indictment of three Iranian cyber operatives.",
      "CISA and the FBI possess a broader view of the threat landscape that election officials find to be helpful in sizing up the threats facing them. \"You know it would be difficult to comprehend 50 states doing this on their own,\" Pennsylvania Secretary of State Al Schmidt told CBS News. \"Each state runs elections in accordance with federal and state law\u2026 but no state has a national or global perspective on the nature of threats and the capabilities of bad faith actors seeking to disrupt our electoral process.\"",
      "While state and local governments run elections nationwide, federal agencies like CISA and the FBI coordinate with election offices to help safeguard against rising cyber and physical threats, while uncovering foreign influence campaigns designed to sow division among Americans and uproot voter confidence.",
      "\"States can often see only the effects of the attacks \u2014 disinformation directed at them and their voters and threats, but they have no insight into where those attacks are coming from, and therefore, have a limited ability to respond,\" said David Becker, CBS News election law expert and political contributor. \"CISA, the FBI Foreign Influence Task Force, and others, have that 'birds-eye view' insight, both detecting the source of the attacks \u2014 domestic or foreign, nations or criminal actors \u2014 as well as how they all fit into the big picture.\"",
      "In a letter to the DHS secretary on Friday, nearly 40 chief election officials wrote to try to persuade Noem to maintain cybersecurity and physical security services provided to states. \"Information technology systems related to election administration have long been targeted by sophisticated cyber threat actors including nation-state and cybercriminal groups,\" leaders of the National Association of Secretaries of State wrote. \"CISA's prioritized services help election entities defend against these national security threats.\"",
      "DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that \"CISA needs to refocus on its mission\" and is \"undertaking an evaluation of how it has executed its election security mission with a particular focus on any work related to mis-, dis-, and malinformation.\"",
      "But the cuts across CISA and the FBI targeted teams may not only affect their ability to identify false content online but could also affect safeguards protecting election infrastructure from being undermined, according to multiple current and former U.S. officials. The teams have rooted out covert operations from Russia, China and Iran in the last year alone. Among the cyber agency employees targeted are members of CISA's Election Security Resilience Team, the Cybersecurity Advisory Committee and Regional Election Security Advisors, multiple current and former federal and state officials told CBS News.",
      "The new administration has not yet nominated a new CISA director, with the agency's highest-ranking political appointee, Karen Evans, now serving as a senior adviser.",
      "Earlier this month, Mr. Trump\u00a0attempted to fire the chair of the Federal Election Commission, a move that coincides with the adjudication of campaign finance complaints from the 2024 election, including those against tech billionaire and presidential ally Elon Musk.",
      "Mr. Trump and some conservatives on Capitol Hill have accused CISA of policing speech by coordinating with social media companies to identify online misinformation and disinformation ahead of the 2020 election. They accused the agency of \"censorship,\" which CISA officials have repeatedly denied. Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court threw out a lawsuit over the government's work, but the blowback prompted CISA to curb those conversations with tech platforms in 2021, according to three former U.S. officials.",
      "\"That is not our role, that's not what we do,\" former CISA Director Jen Easterly told reporters last year, ahead of the 2024 election. \"We're looking to work with our partners on overall threats to election infrastructure.\"",
      "CISA's ongoing internal probe appears to follow a Jan. 20-related directive instructing the attorney general and agency leaders to investigate Biden administration activities that are \"inconsistent\" with Trump's vow to end \"online censorship.\"",
      "DHS and CISA did not immediately respond to CBS News' questions about who directed the audit and would not say whether the report would be publicly released. The Justice Department did not respond to questions about whether the attorney general would be consulted on the investigation.",
      "\"I'm concerned and alarmed at what looks like a retreat from the anti-disinformation mission,\" Simon said. \"If a foreign adversary is spinning up a false narrative about our election system that could impact physical security, all it takes is one person who believes this disinformation to act out in a violent or threatening, harassing or intimidating way. All it takes is one.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Feb 2025 16:19:00 -0500",
    "summary": "A 9-year-old's mission to get a bionic arm led to a story about the power of kindness \u2014 and an inspiring new friendship.",
    "story": [
      "Remi Bateman was born without her left forearm and hand but she doesn't let it slow her down.",
      "Now 9 years old, Bateman is busy riding her bike and scooter around her neighborhood in Utah \u2014 and she's got her sights set on doing even more daily tasks, like cutting her own food and doing her own hair.",
      "Remi has been using a silicone prosthesis, covered by her health insurance, since she was 6 months old. While the prosthetic is helpful, it's heavy and doesn't give her the ability to move fingers.",
      "\"Her current prosthetic is pretty stationary and doesn't do a lot,\" her mother, Jami, told \"CBS Mornings.\" The hand on Remi's prosthesis was molded into a plastic fist.",
      "A \"life changing\" mission",
      "Last year, Jami came across a social media post for\u00a0Open Bionics\u00a0and its 3D-printed multi-grip \"Hero Arm.\" Each finger has its own motor, making it possible to grip everyday items with precision. Within 48 hours, Jami and her husband, Josh, scheduled a video consultation with Open Bionics and drove to their clinic in Denver, Colorado for an initial fitting.",
      "\"It was life changing,\" Jami said. \"This bionic arm is like 95% of having a real hand.\"",
      "The Batemans hoped insurance would help pay for the Hero Arm but their provider denied coverage, saying it wasn't \"medically necessary,\" according to Jami. Without insurance, the bionic arm cost $24,000.",
      "\"I do understand that you can live just fine without [a hand], but imagine what you could do with two hands. I feel like the whole world is built around having two hands,\" Jami said.",
      "Like many Americans with medical needs not covered by insurance, the Batemans turned to crowdsourcing.",
      "On Dec. 10, 2024, Remi's fight for her Hero Arm made the local news. Within four days, the Batemans raised over $24,000. Andy Schoonover, CEO of\u00a0CrowdHealth, a subscriber-based crowdfunding platform for medical bills, also contacted the Batemans after seeing their plea for help online.",
      "\"He told me he would pay for Remi's hand in cash,\" said Jami.",
      "And that's where the story takes a turn.",
      "Paying it forward",
      "With Schoonover's gift, Jami realized they still had $24,000 in donations. She asked her daughter what she wanted to do with it.",
      "\"Help more kids,\" Remi enthusiastically replied. \"So people can actually have a life-changing arm like me.\"",
      "Across the country in Maryland, 9-year-old Tyraun \"Taj\" Johnson was also trying to raise money for a Hero Arm. He was born with a partial left hand. His family worked hand specialists at Johns Hopkins Medicine to look at surgery and different prosthesis options to give him some usage of his left hand. They were hopeful the Hero Arm could be the solution they were searching for.",
      "But like Remi, Taj's health insurance company denied the coverage of the Hero Arm. His family was devastated.",
      "\"You're telling me that a kid able to function with daily tasks \u2013 something as small as feeding themselves, getting dressed...You're telling me that that's not medically necessary?\" his mother, Kaitlin Skinner, asked.",
      "\"I would give Taj my left hand if I could,\" Kaitlin added.",
      "The family started lemonade stands to raise the money for the bionic arm. In four months, they had only made $1,500.",
      "Then they got a life-changing call from Remi's mom. The Bateman's offered to use the donations they received for Remi's arm for Taj's Hero Arm.",
      "Open Bionics helped connect the families. Samantha Payne, co-founder of Open Bionics, told CBS News clinicians spend a lot of time assisting families in appealing insurance denials.\u00a0 \"The technology is 20 years old and has been tested,\" added Payne.",
      "A dream come true",
      "Kaitlin was brought to tears by the Batemans' generous offer and thanked them for making Taj's dream come true.",
      "\"Taj got teary eyed when he saw a video of Remi holding a fork with the Hero Arm,\" Kaitlin said. One of the things Taj is most looking forward to is playing sports.",
      "Kaitlin recently drove to New York City with Taj to meet Daniel Green, upper limb prosthetist at Open Bionics, who will make the mold that will become Taj's Hero Arm. While in New York, Taj had a surprise visitor: Remi and her mom. They arrived at our invitation.",
      "A new friendship forged through the kindness of strangers. Remi and Taj plan to meet again during the summer.",
      "\"If we have a playdate with our [Hero] robot arms, we could be like Ironman,\" Remi said.",
      "Donations for Remi continued to pour in. So she's continued to pay it forward, using the fund to help two more 11 year olds fund their Hero Arms after insurance denied their claims.",

Hackman was found in a mudroom and Arakawa was found in a bathroom next to a space heater, and there was an open prescription bottle and pills on the counter near Arakawa, the warrant said.",
      "Hackman's daughters and granddaughter released a statement Thursday confirming the deaths.",
      "\"He was loved and admired by millions around the world for his brilliant acting career, but to us he was always just Dad and Grandpa,\" Elizabeth, Annie and Leslie Hackman said in the statement. \"We will miss him sorely and are devastated by the loss.\"",
      "Hackman was a consummate actor renowned for playing complicated figures in such classics as \"The French Connection,\" \"The Conversation\" and \"Unforgiven,\" and who also delighted superhero fans as the comical villain Lex Luthor in three \"Superman\" films.",
      "Hailed as one of the best actors of the era before retiring from the screen in 2004, Hackman moved easily among genres, from heart-wrenching family stories (\"I Never Sang for My Father\"), crime dramas (\"Bonnie and Clyde,\" \"Mississippi Burning\"), thrillers (\"The Conversation,\" \"No Way Out\"), and triumphant tales of sports (\"Hoosiers\") to comedies (\"Get Shorty,\" \"The Royal Tenenbaums\").",
      "Rough-hewn and flinty, a movie star without stereotypical movie-star looks, Hackman gave even his humorous roles a slightly sinister, unpredictable edge.",
      "The quality of Hackman's performances and the charisma that the shy ex-Marine would bring to the screen were praised by famed stage director Ulu Grosbard, who'd once hired him for a small role in Arthur Miller's \"A View from the Bridge.\" In a 2004 Vanity Fair profile, Grosbard described the actor as \"a complex guy. Very intelligent. A generosity of spirit. Socially charming. A lot going on in him. A certain sense of being tormented with past ghosts and things. That's part of what he brings to his work.\"",
      "\"Ghosts and things\" were likely evoked in three of Hackman's most heralded performances, in movies that redefined their genres. In William Friedkin's \"The French Connection\" (1971), Hackman played \"Popeye\" Doyle, a New York City detective unbound by rules, who constantly crossed the line between law officer and law breaker while tracking down the head of a drug ring. Dangerous and unpredictable, his Doyle was brash, vindictive and colorful, whether it was chasing down a suspect while wearing a Santa Claus costume or recklessly driving a car in pursuit of an assassin through the streets of Brooklyn.",
      "In Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Conversation\" (1974), he starred as Harry Caul, a surveillance expert whose wiretapping of his subjects leads to increased paranoia about his own safety when he believes he's uncovered evidence of a murder plot; and in Clint Eastwood's revisionist Western \"Unforgiven\" (1992), Hackman played \"Little\" Bill Daggett, the brutal sheriff of a Wyoming town who confronts Eastwood's bounty-hunting gunslinger.",
      "\"There was no finer actor than Gene,\" Eastwood said in a statement following Hackman's death. \"Intense and instinctive. Never a false note. He was also a dear friend whom I will miss very much.\"",
      "In a 2001 New York Times interview, Hackman noted that his scene in which he brutally beats up a bounty hunter played by Richard Harris was fueled by the disappointment that Harris hadn't remembered working with Hackman on the 1966 film \"Hawaii.\"",
      "\"I just took that disappointment and did this kind of transference,\" Hackman said.",
      "Hackman was less \"method-y\" than some of his peers, though he admitted that the ways in which he would behave on-screen and off as he inhabited a character \u2014 fueled by memories of his dysfunctional family growing up and the slights he faced during his struggling early years \u2014 took their toll. Temper tantrums earned him a nickname: \"Vesuvius.\"",
      "''I don't mean to live my roles,'' he told The Times. ''But sometimes I suppose it's not comfortable to be around me.''",
      "His success as an actor was merely one facet of Hackman's biography. He also raced sports cars, flew planes, deep-sea dived, painted, designed houses, and wrote or co-authored adventure and historical novels \u2014 living a life as varied and challenging as the roles for which he became famous. \"I need the diversity,\" he explained to CBS's \"Sunday Morning\" in 2000.",
      "\"One could say, you know, that I've achieved some manner of success,\" Hackman said. \"But it's like the difference between being a doctor and a lawyer, and being, maybe, a laborer. I feel that, in some ways, my efforts of being an actor are so all-instinctive, and that I haven't really paid my dues in terms of my contribution to the firmament.\"",
      "From character actor to star",
      "A shy and itinerant acting student, Hackman washed out of classes at the Pasadena Playhouse with the worst grades ever. He had several TV credits (including \"Naked City,\" \"The Defenders\" and \"Route 66\") and was featured in several light comedies on Broadway before appearing in the 1964 Warren Beatty film \"Lilith.\" After Hackman co-starred in \"Hawaii,\" \"A Covenant of Death\" and the war film \"First to Fight,\" Beatty hired him to play Buck Barrow, the older brother of bank robber Clyde Barrow, in the 1967 classic \"Bonnie and Clyde.\"",
      "The film, directed by Arthur Penn and produced by Beatty, was a shot across the bow of the studio system in its glamorous and violent dramatization of a pair of Depression Era lovers who robbed banks and killed people. After initially receiving lukewarm reviews over its blend of blood and sardonic humor, \"Bonnie and Clyde\" quickly garnered a reappraisal, spearheading Hollywood's own \"New Wave\" of filmmaking that revolutionized the industry in the late 1960s and '70s.",
      "It earned 10 Oscar nominations, including one for Hackman for best supporting actor.",
      "His film resume grew as a result, to include \"Riot,\" \"The Gypsy Moths,\" \"Downhill Racer,\" \"Marooned,\" and \"I Never Sang for My Father,\" earning Hackman his second Oscar nod for supporting actor, playing the son of a dominating parent (Melvyn Douglas).",
      "\"The French Connection\" would cement Hackman's position as a movie star. The film's brash, documentary-style production perfectly captured Hackman's character, a seething, sadistic NYC cop seeking to bust a ring of heroin smugglers \u2014 like Ahab on the hunt for the white whale.",
      "Although much of the film's heralded chase scene \u2014 in which Doyle, in a car, pursues an assassin who has hijacked an above-ground subway train \u2014\u00a0 featured stunt driver Bill Hickman, Hackman as Doyle did drive for some of it, crashing his car into a wall.",
      "At times during production, Hackman was unsure about his performance and asked to be fired. And then, after the film proved to be a hit, winning five Oscars \u2014 including for best picture, best director and best actor \u2014 he feared that he would be typecast as a determined cop thereafter. Hackman would return to the role in the 1975 sequel, \"French Connection II,\" in which he gave a grueling portrayal of Doyle suffering withdrawal from heroin addiction.",
      "His star power led him to both big-budget studio fare, headlining an all-star cast in the 1972 disaster film \"The Poseidon Adventure,\" and small character dramas such as \"Scarecrow,\" opposite Al Pacino, and \"Zandy's Bride,\" co-starring Liv Ullman. Other 1970s appearances included playing a private eye in the film noir \"Night Moves\"; a horseman competing in a cross-country race in the Western \"Bite the Bullet\"; a rum-runner in the Prohibition Era comedy \"Lucky Lady\" (opposite Burt Reynolds and Liza Minnelli); a contract killer in the conspiracy thriller \"The Domino Principle\"; and a World War II general in \"A Bridge Too Far.\"",
      "One of his most memorable turns was an unbilled cameo in Mel Brooks' \"Young Frankenstein,\" playing a blind hermit who spills hot soup into the lap of Peter Boyle's monster.",
      "Then came \"Superman\" (1978), in which Hackman, as Lex Luthor, faced off against Christopher Reeve's Man of Steel in a scheme that involved nuking the San Andreas Fault, which would make much of California slide into the ocean and turn Luthor's worthless desert land into prime seaside real estate.",
      "Hackman's criminal mastermind was wily, vain, cantankerous, and a bit too sure of himself. He told the BBC in 1986 that playing Luthor was great fun: \"He's kind of a flamboyant character and deranged, and all the things that actors love to play.\"",
      "Still, director Richard Donner had to go to lengths to coax Hackman into taking the job (a $2 million paycheck helped), and when the actor refused to shave off his mustache (let alone shave his head), Donner agreed to shave off his own mustache if Hackman got rid of his. Once the actor put a razor to his upper lip, Donner ripped off his own mustache \u2014\u00a0 a fake.",
      "He continued playing Luthor for the sequel (shot concurrently with the first film), but when Donner was fired by the producers and replaced for the remainder of what would be released as \"Superman II,\" Hackman walked. A body double and dubbed voice filled in for him. He later returned to the role in 1987's \"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace.\"",
      "\"Getting to be somebody\"",
      "Eugene Alden Hackman was born January 30, 1930 in San Bernadino, California. His father, a pressman for newspapers, moved the family several times during Hackman's youth before they settled in Danville, Illinois. It was there, when Gene was 13, that his father left the family with just a wave goodbye.",
      "Seeking escape from an uneasy family life, Gene was entranced by the movies. He idolized James Cagney and Errol Flynn, and vowed to become an actor himself. \"I loved the idea that somebody could convince me that they were a sea captain without being phony,\" he told Vanity Fair in 2004. \"I think because I was shy I felt insecure, and acting seemed like a way of maybe getting around that. Getting to be somebody.\"",
      "He dropped out of school and lied about his age to get into the Marine Corps, where he spent four and a half years. He got a taste of performing as an announcer on Armed Forces Radio, but injuries from a motorcycle accident led to his departure from the Marines, just in time to avoid fighting in the Korean War.",
      "He tried his hand at acting with classes at the Pasadena Playhouse, where his fellow students voted him (along with classmate Dustin Hoffman) \"Least Likely to Succeed.\" He picked up and moved to New York City, where he existed in a stream of menial jobs as he tried to create a path toward an acting career, aided and abetted by a circle that included Hoffman and Robert Duvall. Married, Hackman even shared his apartment with Hoffman for a time, as they experienced disappointments that would have crushed others.",
      "\"It was more psychological warfare, because I wasn't going to let those f*****s get me down,\" Hackman told Vanity Fair. \"I insisted with myself that I would continue to do whatever it took to get a job. It was like me against them, and in some way, unfortunately, I still feel that way. But I think if you're really interested in acting there is a part of you that relishes the struggle. It's a narcotic in the way that you are trained to do this work and nobody will let you do it, so you're a little bit nuts. You lie to people, you cheat, you do whatever it takes to get an audition, get a job.\"",
      "The rejections, he said, \"create a resolve in you that, no matter what kind of part you're given, you can do anything. Give me the challenge, I can do it. The scarier the better.\"",
      "\"He is incapable of bad work\"",
      "In the 1980s, his marriage with Faye Maltese, with whom he'd had three children, ended in divorce. Uncomfortable with life in Los Angeles, he contemplated retirement, though his desire for acting continued.",
      "His credits included \"All Night Long,\" \"Reds,\" \"Under Fire,\" \"Uncommon Valor,\" \"Twice in a Lifetime\" (a rare romantic role), \"Power,\" \"Hoosiers,\" \"No Way Out,\" \"Split Decisions,\" \"Bat*21,\" \"Another Woman,\" \"Postcards From the Edge,\" \"Narrow Margin\" and \"Class Action.\"",
      "In 1988's \"Mississippi Burning,\" Hackman's FBI agent scrapes against the by-the-book attitude of his colleague (played by Willem Dafoe) as they investigate the kidnapping and death of civil rights activists in 1964 Mississippi. Hackman earned his fourth Oscar nomination for his performance.",
      "Alan Parker, the film's director, said of Hackman, \"He is incapable of bad work. Every director has a short list of actors he'd die to work with, and I'll bet Gene's on every one.\"",
      "The '90s gave him further latitude to explore his considerable range, from John Grisham legal thrillers (\"The Firm,\" \"The Chamber,\" \"Runaway Jury\") to westerns (\"Unforgiven,\" \"Geronimo: An American Legend,\" \"The Quick and the Dead,\" \"Wyatt Earp\"). He brought heft and authority to the thrillers \"Crimson Tide,\" \"Extreme Measures,\" \"Absolute Power,\" \"Enemy of the State,\" \"Under Suspicion,\" \"Heist,\" and \"Behind Enemy Lines,\" and winking humanity to the comedies \"The Birdcage,\" \"Heartbreakers,\" \"The Royal Tenenbaums,\" and \"Welcome to Mooseport,\" his last film appearance.",
      "In 1992, he starred on Broadway in \"Death and the Maiden\" with Glenn Close and Richard Dreyfuss, under the direction of Mike Nichols.",
      "Hackman the writer",
      "He retired from the screen in 2004 and would only return as narrator on a pair of documentaries about the Marines. He lived in Santa Fe, New Mexico, with his second wife, Betsy Arakawa, and pursued his interests in art and writing.",
      "When he met up with Daniel Lenihan for some scuba lessons, the two got to talking about adventure books they grew up with and decided to try writing one \u2014 a pirate story. Hackman wrote his chapters longhand in spiral notebooks; the two would then meet up at a caf\u00e9 to go over their work. \"I would have some pages, he would have some pages,\" Hackman told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"We would trade. And we'd read them over while we were ordering and eating, and by the end of that couple of hours, we would have critiqued each other's work and decided where we were going to go from there.\"",
      "\"The Wake of the Perdido Star,\" a tale of shipwrecks and piracy set in 1805, was published in 1999. It sold well but received mixed reviews. The acclaimed actor now faced a new audience. He told \"Sunday Morning,\" \"The fact that you're being judged on your intelligence and your skill as a writer, and your skill as a storyteller, that was very tense for me \u2014 and being criticized, and finding that you're vulnerable to the critics, in a way that I hadn't experienced before.\"",
      "Hackman and Lenihan later collaborated on the crime drama \"Justice for None\" (2004) and the historical novel \"Escape From Andersonville\" (2008). Hackman then authored two books solo: a Western, \"Payback at Morning Peak,\" and a police thriller, \"Pursuit.\"",
      "His interest in writing may have been inherited from his grandfather, a reporter, and he'd explored that avenue of expression as far back at the 1980s when he'd optioned a crime novel by Thomas Harris that he'd hoped to adapt, direct and star in. But his screenplay grew distressingly overlong and he let the option slide. The book: \"The Silence of the Lambs.\"",
      "Hackman regularly refused interviews in his later years but in 2021, to mark the 50th anniversary of \"The French Connection,\" he shared with the New York Post the revelation that he'd only watched the film once. \"Filmmaking has always been risky \u2014 both physically and emotionally \u2014 but I do choose to consider that film a moment in a checkered career of hits and misses,\" he wrote in an email.",
      "As for the car chase, he added, \"There was a better one filmed a few years earlier with Steve McQueen,\" tipping his hat to the 1968 film \"Bullitt.\"",
      "Maybe. But at the conclusion of \"The French Connection\" chase, Hackman's \"Popeye\" Doyle, like so many of his other characters, refused to let his prey get the better of him.",

      "The FAA has faced a longstanding shortage of air traffic controllers, while the agency's oversight of the skies has\u00a0recently faced heightened scrutiny following a\u00a0string of recent aviation incidents. Currently, more than 90% of U.S. airport towers are understaffed, and do not meet standards set by a working group that includes the FAA and the controllers' union, according to a CBS News analysis of FAA data.",
      "There are approximately 10,800 air traffic controllers working across U.S. airports, which the NATCA says is about 3,600 fewer than \"what is needed to fully staff the National Airspace System.\"",
      "While several hundred probationary workers at the FAA were\u00a0recently fired by the Trump administration through late night emails sent on Feb. 14, \"Zero air traffic controllers and critical safety personnel\" were among those let go according to Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy in a Feb. 17\u00a0post on X.",
      "Duffy has said he wants to extend a waiver to the current controllers who are near retirement age to help expand the workfroce.",
      "Earlier this month, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), the union representing air traffic controllers, told CBS the proposal is not \"an effective solution to addressing the chronic air traffic controller staffing crisis. \"In the next 12 months, we anticipate 49 ATCs across 35 facilities will reach age 56.\u00a0This is not enough to address the nationwide staffing shortage,\" the union added.",
      "\"The solution to the ATC staffing crisis is a long-term commitment to hiring and training and the retention of the experience of all the highly skilled, highly trained air traffic controllers,\" it added.",
      "Shortage goes back to pandemic",

      "This season's influenza vaccines may have been less effective against emergency room visits for some kids compared to last year, a new study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests, though effectiveness was still high against hospitalization.",
      "So far this season, the vaccine's protection against flu hospitalization was at least 63% for children and at least 41% for adults. These estimates of effectiveness against hospitalization, released Thursday in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, are considered high for flu vaccines.",
      "But another metric of the shot's effectiveness, looking at protection against infections that result in outpatient visits to places like urgent care clinics or emergency rooms, was worse. Effectiveness was 32% for children and adolescents, from the CDC's U.S. Flu VE network of health care systems. That's down from 67% in last year's estimates.",
      "Those figures are lower than from another network of outpatient providers in the report. The study's authors suspect the decline is because of a difference in how many kids were infected in each by a strain of the flu virus called H3N2.",
      "\"The U.S. Flu VE network did not find statistically significant VE against influenza A(H3N2) in the outpatient setting among child and adolescent patients or among adult patients,\" the study's authors wrote.",
      "Earlier data reported by the CDC suggested that this season's flu vaccines might be poorly matched against many H3N2 strains this season. Around half of infections this past fall and winter were H3N2.",

      "Carbon monoxide is produced any time a fossil fuel is burned, meaning accidental poisoning can occur when home appliances and systems like furnaces, kerosene heaters, stoves, lanterns and generators produce fumes that people breathe in.",
      "Most CO exposures happen in the winter in cold climates because of unvented space heaters in the home, a common source of CO poisoning. Cases sometimes occur after hurricanes or other storms when people are relying on generators for emergency power that may not be vented properly.",

      "Gas stoves and ovens: Never use these for heating a room.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Congress is barreling toward a deadline to avert a government shutdown in just over two weeks, with Democrats and Republicans at odds over whether there should be guardrails on President Trump's ability to withhold funding approved by Congress.",
      "Democrats want to insert language in the funding bill to ensure that the administration implements the spending directed by Congress, a reaction to Mr. Trump and top adviser Elon Musk's work to downsize large swaths of the executive branch. But Republicans have made it clear that they won't accept those terms.",
      "Government funding expires on March 14, and keeping the government open past the deadline will likely require bipartisan support in both the House and Senate. Republicans control 53 seats in the Senate, but a funding measure requires 60 votes for passage. In the House, Republicans are operating with a razor-thin majority and a divided conference in which conservatives regularly vote against government spending bills.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said Wednesday that a continuing resolution that funds the government at the current levels is the \"most reasonable thing to do to ensure that the government is not shut down.\"",
      "It has yet to be determined whether disaster relief for the California wildfires would be included in the funding measure, but Johnson told reporters it likely would not include language to codify cuts spearheaded by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, the Musk-led task force that is slashing programs across the executive branch.",
      "\"It probably is as close to a clean CR as possible,\" he said of the potential path forward.",
      "Johnson's comments came after a meeting with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, and Mr. Trump at the White House on Wednesday afternoon.",
      "But in an interview with CNN later in the evening, Johnson noted that the CR might include some \"anomalies,\" opening the door to spending cuts that would alienate most Democrats.",
      "\"You can increase some spending, you can decrease some spending. You can add language that says, for example, the dramatic changes that have been made to USAID would be reflected in the ongoing spending,\" Johnson said. \"It would be a clean CR, mostly, I think, but with some of those changes to adapt to the new realities here.\"",
      "Democratic leaders have said the blame for any shutdown would lie squarely with Republicans, who control the House, Senate and the White House. Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democratic appropriator in the Senate, said Tuesday that Democrats don't want a shutdown and are at the table negotiating in good faith to fund the government.",
      "\"But Republicans are the majority in the House and in the Senate. If they want our votes, they need to work with us,\" Murray said, noting that appropriators are \"close\" on topline spending.",
      "\"We need to know Republicans are willing to work with us to protect Congress' power of the purse,\" Murray said. \"That is the absolute bare minimum, and it's frankly not asking a whole lot.\"",
      "Republicans \"should not follow Elon toward a shutdown,\" Murray said.",
      "Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, the Senate's top Republican appropriator, and Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, her counterpart in the House, met with Johnson and Thune on Wednesday morning to discuss government funding.",
      "Cole said he and Collins are on the same page, but do have differences with Democrats on \"some of the restrictions that they're demanding on what we consider legitimate presidential authority.\" He added that Republicans are \"not moving on that.\"",
      "\"That's a no-go, that's a red line that we're not changing our position on and they know that \u2014 that's been communicated consistently,\" Cole said.",
      "Johnson said Democrats have \"had completely unreasonable conditions assigned to this.\"",
      "\"They want us to limit the power of the executive branch, they want us to stipulate in the appropriations bills for the first time in history that certain agencies in the executive branch would have to have a specific number of employees, all sorts of just unreasonable \u2014 what I think are unconstitutional \u2014 demands,\" Johnson said. \"It would be a violation of separation of powers. So we're pretty far apart right now, but it is not because of Republicans, it's because of the Democrats.\"",
      "The funding fight comes as Republicans in Congress have also been moving ahead on a separate budget resolution, which serves as a blueprint for approving Mr. Trump's agenda on issues ranging from border security to energy and taxes. Though the two issues are distinctly separate, the focus on the budget has taken center stage in recent weeks, appearing to sideline progress toward government funding.",

      "Harris said that officials at the \"highest levels of government\" are involved in the matter and told the Supreme Court that the Trump administration is \"undertaking substantial efforts to review payment requests and release payments.\"",
      "\"The Executive Branch takes seriously its constitutional duty to comply with the orders of Article III courts,\" she wrote.",
      "But she warned that the district court's deadline \"makes full compliance impossible,\" in part because restarting funding related to canceled or suspended agreements requires multiple steps, multiple agencies and documentary evidence.",
      "The acting solicitor general requested an administrative stay, which would maintain the status quo, \"to ensure that the agencies are not placed in the position of violating a federal court order requiring payments on thousands of requests within a 30-some-hour deadline, despite their efforts, while this court reviews the merits of their challenge.\"",
      "The Trump administration had already appealed the district judge's order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and asked it to pause the lower court's decision. But the D.C. Circuit had yet to act by Wednesday evening. Harris said the administration was seeking the Supreme Court's intervention \"in light of that extraordinary circumstance.\"",
      "But shortly after the Trump administration formally asked the high court for emergency relief, the appeals court declined the Trump administration's request to pause the district court's decision. The three-judge panel on the D.C. Circuit said Ali's orders could not be appealed.",
      "Ali, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden in 2024, is overseeing the case brought by a group of companies, nonprofits and other organizations that receive money from the State Department and the USAID. He\u00a0issued a temporary restraining order earlier this month that prevented the Trump administration from freezing foreign aid funds for contracts and other awards while proceedings continued.",
      "But the contractors told Ali earlier this week that foreign aid funding was still not flowing despite his order, and sought prompt payment for work they completed weeks ago. The international development groups said they were owed millions of dollars for invoices and reimbursements, and warned the Trump administration's failure to reinstate the funding forced them to furlough workers and end critical programs overseas.",
      "Ali granted their motion to enforce his earlier order and gave the State Department and USAID 36 hours to pay the bills related to foreign aid contracts and grants.",
      "Justice Department lawyers said in a separate filing that they estimated the payments covered by Ali's order approached $2 billion, and for the challengers alone, the amount at issue was at least $250 million.",
      "\"This new order requiring payment of enormous sums in less than 36 hours intrudes deeply into the prerogatives of the Executive Branch and the president's obligation under Article II to take care that the laws are faithfully executed,\" they wrote in a filing to the D.C. Circuit.",
      "Peter Marocco, director of foreign assistance at the State Department, said in a declaration that the administration is undertaking an \"individualized review\" of contracts and grants, and warned determining the course of those awards is a \"cumbersome, multi-step process.\"",
      "He said that it would take the federal government \"multiple weeks\" to make the payments required by the district court judge.",
      "\"Restarting funding related to terminated or suspended agreements is not as simple as turning on a switch or faucet,\" Morocco wrote in his declaration, adding that USAID and State Department payment systems are \"complicated\" and involve disbursements by numerous other agencies.",

      "Danette Colbert, 48, is accused of stealing Manzano's cellphone and bank cards after she was seen on security video footage entering his hotel room with him, authorities said.",
      "Colbert faces multiple felony charges related to theft and fraud as police await a final autopsy and toxicology report, Kenner Police Department Deputy Chief Mark McCormick told The Associated Press. He added that Colbert may face upgraded charges once these tests are finalized in the coming weeks.",
      "A preliminary toxicology exam found Manzano's system contained the depressant benzodiazepine, which includes the drug commonly sold under the brand name Xanax, Kenner Police Detective Jeffrey Fitzmorris testified in Jefferson Parish magistrate court on Tuesday, according to media outlet Nola.com. Manzano did not have a prescription for Xanax or other depressants based on his medical records and the drug is often used to facilitate theft by inducing amnesia, the detective said.",
      "Police say they also recovered Xanax from Colbert's residence.",
      "Overdoses of the drug can lead to \"extreme drowsiness\" and \"possible death,\" according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.",
      "Surveillance footage showed Colbert arriving with Manzano at his hotel room around 5 a.m. the day of his death and then leaving without him about an hour later, police have said. Authorities have said Colbert later used Manzano's credit card to make a purchase at a New Orleans gas station and several stores in the area.",
      "Last year, a Louisiana jury found Colbert guilty of theft and fraud charges in an unrelated case.",
      "In 2022, Colbert was twice arrested in Las Vegas on felony charges of grand larceny and administering a drug to aid in a felony crime, court records show. In both cases she was accused of drugging men in their hotel rooms and stealing from them, but the charges were dismissed because the victims did not want to testify in court, Colbert's attorney for those cases, Daniel Lippmann, told The Associated Press.",
      "Colbert is being held without bond at the Orleans Parish Justice Center after a court appearance Tuesday, having been deemed a flight risk based on her criminal history, \u00a0McCormick said.",
      "\"We believe that that will help prevent any further victimization for the public,\" he said Wednesday.\u00a0CBS affiliate WWLTV reported that the judge also highlighted Colbert's history of not showing up for court. WWLTV reported that there were two court dates where Colbert did not appear as prosecutors requested her date be reset. A hearing set for Feb. 14 was rescheduled at the last minute when Colbert was taken back to the Orleans Parish Justice Center.",
      "Colbert's attorney Stavros Panagoulopoulos said authorities are making assumptions about Colbert's connection to Manzano's death.",
      "\"We're looking forward to our day in court to present all the evidence as necessary,\" Panagoulopoulos said. \"Assumptions and guesses are not enough to maintain criminal prosecution and we look forward to providing further information as this case moves forward.\"",

And I'll be going, I'll be going there and we expect to see each other in the near future. We'll be announcing it.\" Both leaders emphasized the \"special relationship\" between the two countries, forged during World War II.",
      "Mr. Trump said he and Starmer would discuss Russia and Ukraine, as the president seeks an end to the war started when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. In a break with many European allies \u2014 including Britain \u2014 Mr. Trump has called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a \"dictator\" but has declined to give the same label to Russian President Vladimir Putin.",

      "Starmer thanked Mr. Trump for changing the conversation on Ukraine, according to reporters in the room, and said he believes an \"historic deal\" can be achieved.",
      "Mr. Trump, however, disagreed with a previous assessment by Starmer that there is a risk Putin could invade Ukraine again after a deal is reached, saying he trusts Putin to keep his word.",

      "Mr. Trump said the two will also be discussing trade, as he imposes new tariffs on allies and adversaries alike.",
      "Starmer said ahead of the meeting that the U.S. and Britain \"want to strike a new partnership. We share the view that our best days lie ahead.\"",
      "\"Taking out a chainsaw isn't quite my style, but we are stripping away red tape and bureaucracy,\" he said, at once taking a gentle jab at Musk while also attempting to appeal to Mr. Trump's passion for a slimmed down government. \"We are reforming, permitting, getting things built, reducing barriers to investment and growth, and we're open for business, open for investment, and we're determined to help U.S. innovators thrive in the United Kingdom.\"",
      "Starmer presented the president with a letter from King Charles, and Mr. Trump read it in real time. Mr. Trump called the British king a \"beautiful man and a wonderful man.\"",
      "Britain, the U.S., and collective security via NATO",
      "Starmer didn't arrive in Washington empty-handed. He flew in on the wings of an announcement just days earlier that his government was planning to bump U.K. defense spending from the current 2.3% of GDP to 2.5% by 2027, which his office has billed as Britain's biggest sustained defense spending increase since the Cold War. Starmer has left open the possibility of that defense spending rising further, to 3%, after the next U.K. general election.",
      "The timing of the prime minister's announcement was notable, coming just two days before his meeting with Mr. Trump. A White House official said ahead of the meeting that the Trump administration was \"very pleased\" with Starmer's announcement, but that it still wants to see America's NATO allies increase defense spending further, towards 5% of their respective national GDPs. That would be more, proportionally, than even the U.S. spends on defense, which in 2023 amounted to roughly 3.4% of the United States' GDP.",
      "Mr. Trump has implied that the U.S. could break from the historic collective defense agreement of NATO, known as Article 5, which essentially says that if any member is attacked it will be treated as an attack on all, if other member countries do not boost their defense spending.",
      "\"I think that that means there's got to be security guarantees,\" said Starmer, acknowledging the pressure for higher spending, but also indicating that he will ask the White House to provide clear commitments to help defend Ukraine against any future Russian attack if a ceasefire is reached to halt the ongoing war. \"I've indicated that we will play our full part. There has to be U.S. backing, because otherwise I don't think it will deter Putin. We are working on that. I'm having extensive discussions about it.\"",
      "A White House official said the U.S. appreciated Starmer's willingness to consider sending British troops to help with peacekeeping efforts to enforce a potential peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, but Mr. Trump has made it clear that any and all security guarantees for Ukraine may have to come from Europe.",
      "\"I'm not going to make security guarantees beyond, very much,\" Mr. Trump said this week. \"We're going to have Europe do that, because we're talking about, Europe is their nextdoor neighbor, but we're going to make sure everything goes well.\"",
      "U.K.-British trade",
      "Mr. Trump's tariff threats will also be on the agenda during Thursday's White House meeting. A 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imported into the U.S. is set to kick in on March 12, ordered by Mr. Trump, he said, to protect American companies. Starmer may seek an exemption.",
      "Mr. Trump implied weeks ago that a unilateral trade agreement could be worked with the U.K. If that does not happen, there's concern that some of the estimated 40,000 British jobs directly linked to steel and aluminum production could be lost and entire plants could close.",
      "After Starmer's meeting with Mr. Trump, he's scheduled to meet back in London with several European leaders on Sunday, including the heads of state from Germany, Italy and Poland. Starmer will no doubt brief them on his talks with the U.S. president.",
      "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy may join them, after he meets with Mr. Trump in Washington on Friday, where he's expected to sign a financial deal to share his country's mineral wealth with Washington, which Mr. Trump has called \"payback\" for U.S. aid to Ukraine over the past three years.",

      "The WHO's Africa office said earlier this week that the first outbreak was among several children who ate a bat and then died within 48 hours after experiencing hemorrhagic fever symptoms, similar to those caused by the Ebola or Marburg viruses.",
      "The deaths occurred in one village, Boloko, and affected people of all ages, however, teenagers and young adults seemed the most susceptible.",
      "Concern over front-line impact of Trump's aid cuts",
      "When a number of unexplained cases of illness crop up, a team of health officials and international \"virus hunters\" immediately go in to investigate the outbreak, determine who was the first case \u2014 \"patient zero\" \u2014 and work to identify, contain and treat the illness.",
      "But those teams have been gutted by the Trump administration's recent U.S. foreign aid cuts, a health official who works in the region told CBS News on Thursday.",
      "During the first Cabinet meeting of Mr. Trump's second administration on Wednesday, non-Cabinet member Elon Musk said officials with his efficiency-oriented DOGE department had mistakenly cancelled Ebola programs as they targeted USAID.",
      "\"We all make mistakes, but when we make mistakes, we fix it quickly, and in the case of the USAID, we accidentally canceled, very briefly, Ebola, Ebola prevention. I think we all want Ebola prevention, so we restored it and there was no interruption,\" Musk said.",
      "One U.S. health official who spoke with CBS News disputed that aid had been restored, however. They said locally trained health workers in some of the infectious disease hot zones in Africa have not been paid, and some have been dismissed entirely due to the USAID cuts.",
      "The U.S. has long been the largest international donor to Congo's health sector, and the funding has helped train epidemiologists to do the fieldwork that identifies and controls disease outbreaks. It's unclear how President Trump's funding cuts will affect the teams on the ground, but there's widespread concern among health officials, with one virus hunter telling CBS News the region is facing \"a perfect storm\" for the potential spread of infectious diseases, including possible new ones.",
      "Race to identify the mystery disease",
      "In northern Congo, health officials have been searching for anyone with general sickness or an illness that fits a \"broad case definition\" that includes fever, chills, headache, nose bleeding, coughing, vomiting, diarrhea, stiff neck and muscle or joint pain",
      "By February 19, the WHO said 943 people with such symptoms had been identified, including 52 who had died.",
      "Test results released on February 13 showed the first cases were not Ebola or Marburg, but half of the samples did test positive for malaria. Earlier samples of suspected cases, health officials say, were \"not viable,\" so retesting delayed the diagnostic process. WHO officials are conducting further tests, also looking at the possibility of meningitis and testing food, water and other environmental samples from the affected region.",
      "Officials say they're searching for unusual patterns in cases of the mystery illness by increasing both disease surveillance and treatment for other diseases such as malaria, meningitis and typhoid fever.",
      "A regional health team arrived in the Basankkusu health zone, which is about 110 miles from the Bolamba zone, on February 16, and it was joined six days later by a national rapid response team from the Ministry of Health and two WHO epidemiologists. They have been collecting samples of blood and urine and taking oral and nasal swabs for testing in an effort to identify the illness.",
      "\"These illnesses know no boundaries.\"",
      "The remoteness of the affected areas and Congo's limited national health system and poor roads and phone infrastructure have all contributed to the challenges of diagnosing and containing the illness.",
      "About 1,000 miles away, in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the M23 rebel group \u2014   which is backed by Rwanda, according to the United Nations \u2014   has captured large swaths of territory in the mineral rich region, pushing refugees into camps and adding to the burden of an already struggling health sector.",
      "Sarah Olsen, the director of Health Research at the Wildlife Conservation Society, told CBS News on Thursday that outbreaks of Ebola, Marburg and other diseases, like the still-unidentified one killing people in northern Congo, had become the new normal, adding a call for the global community to be ready to respond.",
      "\"The reality is there have been multiple Ebola outbreaks across Africa in recent months, and now this mystery illness in Congo is super dangerous. We just don't know enough,\" she said, adding a warning: \"These illnesses know no boundaries. Now is the time to increase funding and vigilance before one of these illnesses ends up in a major city center and begins a new pandemic.\"",

    "summary": "The women took the stand in the trial of Joel Le Scouarnec, a former surgeon accused of raping or sexually assaulting hundreds of children who were his patients.",
    "story": [
      "Weeks after a mass rape trial involving a man who drugged his wife and brought strangers home to assault her, France is again reeling as a new alleged predator appears in court.",
      "A trial is underway in Vannes, France, of 74-year-old Joel Le Scouarnec, a former surgeon accused of raping or sexually assaulting 299 people, almost all of them children who were his patients. It is the biggest trial related to alleged child sex abuse in France \u2013 and one of the biggest in the world.",
      "His ex-wife, Marie-France Le Scouarnec, took the stand on Wednesday \u2013 and denied she had any knowledge of her husband's activities. \"There was nothing that could have made me think that. Nothing,\" she told the court.",
      "\"I never had an inkling. It's so huge, so unthinkable, inconceivable that my husband could have done all that,\" she said.",
      "The alleged assaults took place over 25 years, between 1989 and 2014, according to the prosecution. The average age of the children \u2014 both girls and boys \u2014 was 11.",
      "The prosecution claims many of the victims were still under anesthesia or just coming out of it when they were assaulted. Others were barely awake in their hospital beds as the surgeon allegedly assaulted them as he made his early morning rounds.",
      "On the first day of the trial, which started on Monday, Le Scouarnec told the court he had \"committed heinous acts.\" His lawyer said he admitted to carrying out \"the vast majority\" of the assaults of which he is accused.",
      "\"I owe it to all these people and their loved ones to take responsibility for my actions and the consequences they may have had,\" Le Scouarnec told the court.",
      "The alleged abuse of Le Scouarnec's former patients only came to light in 2017, after his neighbors' 6-year-old daughter told her parents he had exposed himself and touched her through the fence that divided their gardens.",
      "During a search of his home, police said they discovered hard drives containing more than 300,000 photos and videos depicting child sex abuse. They also found notebooks with meticulous records of the alleged abuse of child patients.",
      "That investigation led to his conviction in December 2020 for the sexual abuse of four little girls: the young neighbor, a 4-year-old patient and two of his nieces. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison.",
      "On Thursday, the former surgeon's sister, the mother of the two nieces, took the stand \u2014 and accused his ex-wife of \"cruelty\" and \"lies.\" The woman, Annie, whose last name was not made public at the trial, said Marie-France Le Scouarnec knew that her husband abused his nieces, which Marie-France Le Scouarnec had denied in court.",
      "Annie said the youngest of her two daughters confided in her in October 2000 that Le Scouarnec had sexually abused her. She told the court that her brother admitted the assault to her, and said that his wife was aware of what had happened.",
      "In 2005, Le Scouarnec was convicted of possession of child sexual abuse images, after an FBI investigation into an international network. He was given a four-year suspended sentence. The court did not order any psychological followup or restriction on his work.",
      "Le Scouarnec told investigators that even though he told his employers at a hospital in Quimperl\u00e9 about the conviction, no particular measures were taken.",
      "During his career, Le Scouarnec worked in a number of hospitals across Brittany, a region in western France where his trial is being held. That has led many to question how he could have carried out so many alleged rapes and assaults without an alarm being raised.",
      "Investigators said that few of the victims had any memory of the alleged assaults. For many of them, it came as a complete shock when police contacted them with evidence of what had happened, as recounted in the surgeon's journals.",
      "Outside the courthouse Monday, a small group of protesters brandished placards denouncing \"more than 20 years of silence\" about the surgeon's past.",
      "The trial is set to last four months. During that time, the 299 alleged victims \u2014 who are now men and women \u2014 will be called on to recount what they can remember of their interactions with Le Scouarnec, who faces 20 years in prison if convicted.",

The Tates, who are dual U.S.-British nationals, landed in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.",
      "Prosecutors in Romania have alleged for years that Andrew, 38, and his brother Tristan, 36, set up a criminal enterprise in the country and in Britain in 2021, along with two women, and used it to sexually exploit multiple people. Andrew Tate was charged with rape and trafficking offenses in Romania, while his brother and two female associates faced trafficking and other related charges.",
      "The brothers have always maintained their innocence, denying all charges against them in Romania, as well as separate rape and assault allegations made by women in Britain, which are still being investigated by police in England.",

      "In a separate probe, Bedfordshire Police obtained a European arrest warrant in 2024 for Tate and his brother Tristan \"as part of an ongoing investigation into allegations of rape and human trafficking\" in 2024. It would be on these grounds that the pair would be extradited to Britain if and when that happens.",
      "A Romanian judge decided last year that this would only happen after the Romanian case concludes.

      "The world-famous site said it had excavated in recent weeks a nearly life-size frieze depicting the procession of Dionysus, the god of wine, painted on three sides of a large banquet room.",
      "Known as a \"megalography\" from the Greek for \"large painting,\" the frieze depicts a procession, with Dionysus joined by the bacchantes, his female followers. They are portrayed both as dancers or as hunters, with slaughtered animals on their shoulders.",
      "\"Young satyrs with pointed ears play the double flute, while another performs a sacrifice of wine in acrobatic style, squirting wine behind him from a drinking horn into a patera (shallow bowl),\"\u00a0Pompeii said in a statement, while releasing several images of the discoveries.",

    "story": [
      "Jerusalem \u2014 Hamas handed over four dead hostages to the Red Cross early Thursday in exchange for Israel's release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, days before the first phase of the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip will end.",
      "The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed that Hamas had given the bodies to the Red Cross, and Israeli President Isaac Herzog later said on X that all four had been identified.",
      "At around the same time the bodies were received on Wednesday, a Red Cross convoy carrying dozens of released Palestinian prisoners left Israel's Ofer prison. Crowds of cheering families, friends and supporters of Palestinian prisoners were gathered in Beitunia jostling for a glimpse of the bus that was on its way.",
      "Hamas said Thursday it was ready to negotiate the the next phase of the ceasefire, adding in a statement that the \"only way\" for Israel to secure the release of the remaining hostages was through negotiations and adhering to the agreement. It warned that any attempt to pull back from the truce \"will only lead to more suffering\" for the captives and their families.",
      "Israel had delayed the release of over 600 Palestinian prisoners since Saturday to protest what it called the cruel treatment of hostages during their handover by Hamas. The terrorist group has called the delay a \"serious violation\" of the ceasefire and said talks on a second phase aren't possible until the Palestinians are freed. The deadlock had threatened to collapse the ceasefire when the current six-week first phase of the deal expires on Saturday. But late Tuesday, Hamas said an agreement had been reached to resolve the dispute during meetings in Cairo.",
      "Netanyahu's office had said Wednesday that the release of the bodies would be carried out without a ceremony, as opposed to past Hamas releases with stage-managed events in front of crowds. Israel, along with the Red Cross and U.N. officials, have called the ceremonies humiliating for the hostages.",
      "Among those leaving Israel early Thursday were hundreds of detainees arrested from Gaza, held on suspicion of militancy after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack, without charge for months. They include 445 men, 21 teenagers and one woman who were all arrested after the Hamas attack, according to lists shared by Palestinian officials that did not specify their ages.",
      "Among those released was Nael Barghouti, 67, who spent 45 years in Israeli jails, more than any other Palestinian. He was first arrested in 1978 for killing an Israeli bus driver, but was released in a prisoner exchange in October 2011. He was then rearrested in 2014 and accused of violating his release terms. Under the exchange agreement, freed prisoners who were convicted of killing Israelis must be deported, leaving Barghouti unable to return to his home in the West Bank. It was not immediately clear on Thursday where Barghouti had been sent.",
      "Only around 50 Palestinians were being released into the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem in this round. Dozens sentenced to life over deadly attacks against Israelis will be exiled out of the Palestinian territories, taken to Egypt at least temporarily until other countries accept them.",
      "The handover will complete both sides' obligations under the ceasefire's first phase, during which Hamas returned 33 hostages, including eight bodies, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.",
      "In a brief statement earlier Wednesday, Netanyahu's office confirmed that an agreement had been reached by the mediators, adding that \"our four fallen hostages will be returned tonight as part of Phase A, under an agreed procedure and without Hamas ceremonies.\"",
      "Prior to Thursday, Hamas had released living Israeli hostages and the bodies of dead captives in large public ceremonies during which the Israelis were paraded and forced to wave to large crowds. Israel, along with the Red Cross and U.N. officials, have said the ceremonies were humiliating to the hostages, and Israel last weekend delayed the scheduled prisoner release in protest.",
      "The latest agreement would complete both sides' obligations of the first phase of the ceasefire \u2014 during which Hamas is meant to return 33 hostages \u2014 including eight bodies \u2014 in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.",
      "It also could clear the way for a likely return visit to the region by the White House's Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff.",
      "He said at a Tuesday event in Washington for the American Jewish Committee that Israeli representatives were already on their way to engage in talks on the next phase of the ceasefire deal, and he repeated that he was also ready to head back to the region, according to the French news agency AFP.",

    "story": [
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Thursday that he had instructed his country's negotiators to travel to Cairo \"for the continuation of the talks\" aimed at keeping the\u00a0tenuous ceasefire agreement with Hamas alive. The announcement came hours after four Israeli hostages'\u00a0remains were returned by Hamas\u00a0as part of the final hostage-prisoner exchange of phase one of the deal.",
      "The fact that the Israeli leader was sending his team to Cairo would bring hope, but there was still deep uncertainty over the future of the ceasefire deal two days before its first six-week phase ends.",
      "The bodies handed over by Hamas on Thursday were the last of the 33 hostages to be returned to Israel during phase one of the ceasefire. Israel released about 600 more Palestinian prisoners Thursday in exchange. The freed detainees, some of whom had been serving long sentences and others who were detained during the Gaza war and never formally charged, poured out of buses in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and in Gaza to emotional reunions with loved ones.",
      "There were still 59 Israeli hostages being held in Gaza as of Thursday, only 24 of whom are believed to be alive, according to the Israeli government. Their fate hinges on the future of the ceasefire agreement that was negotiated by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar.",
      "The plan was for the second phase of the deal to see all remaining hostages returned in exchange for a permanent ceasefire and Israel pulling its forces out of Gaza. But Netanyahu has been under intense pressure from hardline members of his cabinet to walk away from the truce and resume Israel's war in Gaza against Hamas, which has long been designated a terrorist group by the U.S., Israel and the European Union.",
      "Israeli West Bank assault displaces more than 40,000 Palestinians as Gaza truce hangs in balance",
      "Israeli West Bank assault displaces more than 40,000 Palestinians as Gaza truce hangs in balance",
      "Netanyahu has said for more than a year that the objective of the war in Gaza \u2014 which the Palestinian territory's Hamas-run Health Ministry says has killed well over 48,000 people, most of them civilians \u2014 is to destroy or at least disarm Hamas. That's a goal Israel's devastating military assault has not yet achieved.",
      "The Israeli prime minister is also under intense pressure, however, from the families of the hostages to keep the ceasefire alive so their loved ones can be brought back home. President Trump has made it clear that he will back Israel, whatever Netanyahu decides to do, but his special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff is expected back in the region soon to push for a second phase.",
      "\"We will get to stage two, or phase two, and I'm very focused on that, and I think it's going to happen,\" Witkoff said Sunday on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Witkoff said securing the release of the last U.S. national believed to be among the surviving hostages, Edan Alexander, who was serving with the Israel Defense Forces when he was abducted during the October 7 terrorist attack, was \"front and center for us.\"",
      "\"I know his parents. We talk all the time. He's critical. It's one of President Trump's most important objectives is to get all Americans home, and we're going to be successful in getting Edan home, I believe,\" Witkoff told Brennan.",
      "Getting to the second phase of the ceasefire agreement, and the terms negotiated for it, is also critical for Gaza's roughly 2 million Palestinian residents, the vast majority of whom were forced to flee from their homes by the 15-month war, many of them multiple times. Many have returned to find their cities and towns in ruins, and Mr. Trump's suggestion that they all be forced out of the enclave \u2014 possibly without any right to return \u2014 so it can be turned into a new luxury real estate development, has fueled anxiety across the region.",
      "Critics have condemned the idea as would-be ethnic cleansing, and America's regional allies Egypt and Jordan, which Mr. Trump has suggested should take in the displaced Palestinians, have adamantly rejected the idea and, along with other Arab nations, are expected to present an alternative proposal to redevelop Gaza.",
      "Witkoff told Brennan that while the level of devastation in Gaza and the risks posed by unexploded ordinance \"suggest that nobody can really live there in a safe environment for probably at least 15 years\u2026 I'm not sure that anyone has a problem with people, with people returning. We've had these discussions around that. I just think the fundamental issue today is how we get phase two done, and then develop a reconstruction plan for Gaza.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's envoy was clear, however, that Hamas \"cannot be allowed to come back into the government\" in Gaza, saying the group that has run Gaza for almost 20 years, \"has to go. They've got to leave.\"",
      "He could not say where the group's remaining members should be sent, however, or who or what should be brought in to replace them as a governing body in the territory.",
      "\"I think the devil is in the details, and we've had a lot of discussions around it. I'm not at liberty to have that, that specific discussion today, but we've got some ideas, and that will be part of the negotiation,\" he said.",
      "Hamas said after the final exchange of phase one on Thursday that it was \"ready\" to engage in negotiations on the terms of a second phase.",
      "The news that Israeli negotiators were headed for Cairo, with the end of phase one looming on Saturday, will offer some hope to the families of the 59 remaining Israeli hostages \u2014 along with some 2 million Palestinians in Gaza and millions of people across the Middle East \u2014 for a continuation of diplomacy rather than a resumption of war.",

      "With two commercial moon landers already on their way, Houston-based Intuitive Machines launched its second robotic lander atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket Wednesday, the centerpiece of a multi-element NASA-sponsored mission to help pave the way for human expeditions.",
      "The workhorse rocket's nine first-stage engines roared to life at  7:16 p.m. EST, pushing the booster away from pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center atop 1.9 million pounds of thrust and a brilliant jet of flaming exhaust.",
      "Arcing to the east through a crystal-clear early evening sky, the rocket quickly disappeared from view as it consumed propellant and lost weight. Two-and-a-half minutes after liftoff, the first stage fell away and the Falcon 9 continued toward space on the power of its single second stage engine.",
      "A little less than six minutes after that, the upper stage engine shut down, putting the rocket on the planned trajectory. A second one-minute firing was carried out 36 minutes after launch to put the upper stage and its payloads on course for the moon.",
      "Given the on-time launch and assuming no major problems, the Athena lander is expected to descend to touchdown on a flat mesa-like structure known as Mons Mouton on March 6, setting down just 100 miles from the moon's south pole \u2014 closer than any other spacecraft has attempted.",
      "Another privately-built moon lander, Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost, was launched by a Falcon 9 SpaceX rocket on Jan. 15 and is on course to land on the moon early Sunday. Touching down near the center of Mare Crisium, it is equipped with 10 NASA-sponsored instruments to collect data needed for planned astronaut landings in the agency's Artemis program.",
      "Blue Ghost shared its Falcon 9 with yet another moon lander, this one built by the Japanese company ispace. It is on a longer, low-energy trajectory to the moon and is expected to land in May.",
      "What's different about the Athena lander",
      "The Athena lander represents a more complex mission with broader science goals. Intuitive Machines managers say they incorporated dozens of upgrades and improvements to insure a safe, upright landing after the company's first lander, Odysseus, tipped over during touchdown last February.",
      "\"Every time you go, it's ... a roll-the-dice thing,\" said CEO Steve Altemus. \"I think we have higher confidence, but we're also have a much more complicated mission this time.",
      "\"This time we're flying with a deployable drill. We're flying with a deployable rover, we're flying with a drone, (a) rocket-powered drone that hops, flies off the lander and hops along the surface and down into a permanently shadowed (crater).",
      "\"All those deployments and surface operations are new, and we're going to learn when we do those,\" he said.",
      "The Athena lander's Trident drill and a mass spectrometer will analyze the ultra-cold soil beneath the spacecraft. The lander also will deploy a small commercially-built rover and a rocket-powered hopper that will jump up to 300 feet high before bounding into a nearby, permanently shadowed crater in search of ice deposits.",
      "Ice would be a critical resource for future astronauts, if it can be extracted, because it can be turned into drinking water, air and even rocket fuel, providing in situ resources that otherwise would have to be carried up from Earth.",
      "Data collected by orbiting satellites indicate reservoirs of ice may be present in the cold, dark interiors of polar craters that never see the light of the sun. Athena's mission is the first to actually search for the suspected ice from the surface.",
      "The hopper, named Grace after software pioneer Grace Hopper, and the Mobile Autonomous Prospecting Platform rover built by a company called Lunar Outpost, will communicate with the Athena lander via cellular networking equipment provided by Nokia in a first-of-its-kind demonstration.",
      "Other spacecrafts tagging along",
      "A tiny microrover known as Yaoki, provided by Tokyo-based Dymon Co., will be dropped to the surface from the Athena lander. It will provide close-up images of the lunar soil, or regolith, and beam them back to Earth through Athena.",
      "In case all that is not enough, hitching a ride aboard the Falcon 9 are three more independent spacecraft, one provided by NASA and two from private companies.",
      "AstroForge's commercially developed Odin asteroid prospector was released four minutes after Athena, NASA's Lunar Trailblazer satellite was deployed about 20 seconds after that followed a few seconds later by Epic Aerospace's Chimera GEO-1 space tug.",
      "Odin is headed for deep space on an asteroid prospecting mission. It will be the first commercially-built probe to fly beyond the moon, heading for an asteroid flyby to look for potentially valuable mineral deposits.",
      "During the Lunar Trailblazer's two-year mission, two instruments will study the nature of any ice that might be present in the lunar soil below while measuring surface temperatures on a global scale.",
      "The third satellite, known as Chimera GEO, was provided by Epic Aerospace. It's a compact space tug built to move small satellites to different locations in Earth orbit.",
      "The Grace hopper may end up the star of the show. Five hops are planned with the first carrying it to an altitude of about 65 feet to a landing another 65 feet from Athena.",
      "\"On the second hop, we expect to go around 50 meters (164 feet) altitude. And on the third hop we'll go about 100 meters (328 feet) altitude,\" said Trent Martin, a senior vice president at Intuitive Machines.",
      "The fourth hop will carry Grace into a permanently shadowed crater some 1,500 from the lander. It's fifth and final hop, either commanded through the Nokia network or triggered by a backup timer, will carry Gracie back up and out of the crater.",
      "\"The purpose of the demo is to show that we can reach extreme environments with technologies other than rovers,\" Martin said. \"The idea is that if you have a really deep crater and you want to get down into that crater, why not do it with something like a drone?\"",
      "The costs of the mission",
      "NASA paid Intuitive Machines $62 million to deliver the Trident drill and mass spectrometer, known collectively as Prime-1, to the moon. NASA's \"tipping point\" technology development program paid $15 million to help fund Nokia's cellular communications integration and another $41 million helps finance Intuitive's Grace hopper.",
      "Finally, NASA spent another $89 million on the Lunar Trailblazer satellite and mission operations. Total cost to NASA: $207 million.",
      "The mission was funded in large part by the agency's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative.",
      "The CLPS program is aimed at encouraging private industry to launch agency payloads to the moon to collect needed science and engineering data before Artemis astronauts begin work on the surface near the lunar south pole later this decade.",
      "\"NASA is investing in commercial delivery services to the moon to enable industry growth and to support long-term lunar exploration, helping the United States stay ahead in space innovation,\" said Nicola Fox, head of NASA's space science mission directorate.",
      "Athena is Intuitive Machines' second CLPS-sponsored lunar lander. The company's first lander, Odysseus, touched down on the moon on Feb. 22, 2024. But the spacecraft came down harder than expected and it was moving slightly to one side at the moment of touchdown. It apparently caught a footpad on the surface and tipped over on its side.",
      "The spacecraft still had power, however, and it sent back data for several days. This time around, multiple upgrades were put in place to insure a safe landing for Athena.",
      "\"If you can routinely land on the moon, all the smart people, the scientists, and the engineers that want to fly things to the moon will now be willing to invest money, to build and engineer the systems that will help us live and work on the moon,\" Altemus said.",
      "\"These are the initial highways or trails that open up a whole new region of exploration of the moon. Like the United States when it was very young, go west, right? This is like that. Just like that.\"",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0Sales data show many Europeans, seemingly angry with Elon Musk as he navigates his close relationship with President Trump to influence U.S. policy, may be choosing to steer clear of Tesla vehicles. A sharp decline in sales comes as anti-Musk ads appear in the U.K. and other countries alluding a comparison to Adolf Hitler.",
      "Tesla new vehicle sales fell across the continent by nearly half in January, plunging by 45% year-on-year, according to data compiled by the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA). In hard numbers, Tesla sold just under 9,950 vehicles in Europe in January. For the same month in 2024, the company sold just over 18,100 new vehicles.",
      "The drop in sales has hurt Tesla's share price, which had nearly doubled in the first month after Mr. Trump's election victory to a record high. Most of those gains have since been lost, and Tesla's market cap has plunged below the $1 trillion mark. The stock, which as of early Wednesday traded for roughly $305 in the U.S., remains up 54% over the last 12 months, buoyed by the company's ambitious plans for self-driving cars and humanoid robots.",
      "In Germany, Tesla sales fell nearly 60% in January year-on-year as would-be buyers voted with their wallets \u2014 possibly angered by Musk's purported meddling in the country's federal elections last weekend, which saw the far-right AfD party he backed become the country's second most popular.",
      "In France, Tesla's sales in January fell 63%. The plunge came after Musk backed far-right parties in that country and attacked left-leaning ones, although the impact of his political activities on Tesla's financial performance is hard to gauge and could reflect other factors, such as mounting competition from other EV makers.",
      "Tesla sales in the U.S. have also been declining, falling 1% in 2024 compared to the prior year \u2014 the automaker's first annual sales decline in 12 years despite global EV sales rising 7.3%. As CBS News' MoneyWatch reported this week, Wall Street analysts have said Musk's political activities could alienate consumers previously loyal to the brand, and protests have erupted at a number of Tesla dealerships in the U.S.",
      "\"Musk's DOGE related actions and more powerful alliance with Trump clearly could alienate some consumers to move away from the Tesla brand,\" analysts for the U.S. financial services firm Wedbush wrote in a Tuesday company report on the automaker. \"There is some momentum around this effort in Europe and pockets of the U.S. as well since November. That said, we view this as containable brand issues for Tesla for now that are not a major cause for concern.\"",
      "A similar trend has been seen in Europe. While Tesla's European sales numbers plunged in January, ACEA data show sales of electric vehicles overall surged by 34%, with buyers increasingly eyeing options from China and the continent's own automakers.",
      "In the U.K., after Musk attacked Prime Minister Keir Starmer and called for the release of a jailed far-right activist, January sales fell a comparatively gentler 12% year-on-year, but anger at Musk has been visible on British roadsides after an activist group called \"Everybody Hates Elon\" pasted over bus stop ads with posters showing Musk making a hand gesture that strongly resembled a Nazi salute at one of Mr. Trump's inauguration events.",
      "Musk has neither admitted nor denied his intent with the gesture, but he mocked the criticism of it, saying in a message on his social media platform X that, \"the 'everyone is Hitler' attack is sooo tired.\"",
      "On the protest group's posters, the words \"0 to 1939 in three seconds\" appear above the image of Musk, alluding to the start of World War II.",

      "A portion of the Srisailam Left Bank Canal tunnel collapsed Saturday morning, causing water and mud to rush into the huge tunnel, which has a diameter of about 33 feet. Officials have said that about 50 workers were inside the tunnel when part of its ceiling caved in. Forty-three of them managed to escape, but eight were left trapped.",
      "There has been no confirmation on the condition of the trapped men as no contact has been made with them by rescuers. Personnel with several agencies, including the Indian Army and the National Disaster Response Force, have been involved in the rescue efforts.",
      "They have faced repeated setbacks due to loose soil and mud inside the tunnel.",
      "Work on the 27-mile-long tunnel, which would be one of the world's longest irrigation tunnels if it is completed, has been delayed several times since construction began in 2005.",
      "On Tuesday, the rescuers worked to clear a train track inside the tunnel so it can be used to transport equipment to pump water out from around the site of the collapse. A path was also being cleared to take earthmoving machines into the tunnel.",
      "\"As of now we are dewatering and going forward. But for the last 40 or 50 meters (yards) we are not able to go,\" B Santhosh, administrative head of the Nagarkurnool district, where the tunnel is being constructed, told India's PTI news agency.",

      "At issue in her case is a higher burden of proof some lower courts have required for those considered to be in \"majority groups\" \u2013 in this case heterosexuals \u2013 to prove discrimination occurred under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.",
      "During Wednesday's oral arguments, the justices \u2013 and the lawyers on both sides of the dispute \u2013 all agreed that the appeals court erred in Ames' case, which required her to provide additional \"background circumstances\" to \"support the suspicion that the defendant is that unusual employer who discriminates against the majority.\"",
      "Trump-appointed Justice Brett Kavanaugh said Wednesday all the court really needs to do is issue \"a really short opinion that says discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, whether it\u2019s because you\u2019re gay or because you\u2019re straight, is prohibited, and the rules are the same.\"",
      "SCOTUS TO HEAR STRAIGHT WOMAN'S DISCRIMINATION CASE THAT COULD RESHAPE EMPLOYMENT LAW",
      "SCOTUS justices appear to favor straight woman in discrimination case. (iStock)",
      "At one point during the arguments, Ohio Solicitor General Elliot Gaiser \u2013 arguing on behalf of the Ohio Department of Youth Services \u2013 perplexed liberal Justice Elena Kagan when he agreed that \"the idea that you hold people to different standards because of their protected characteristics is wrong.\"",
      "\"I mean, it's a little bit of a peculiar situation, isn't it, because this is what the court said,\" Kagan said. \"And you're up here, and I don't know exactly what to make of this.\"",
      "Gaiser said he agreed with Ames \"on that major premise point,\" but \"we don't think Ms. Ames proved enough evidence to showcase a discrimination claim.\"",
      "\"I think we had six depositions under oath, if you can't show any evidence that the employer was motivated by a protected characteristic when they took the adverse action, and certainly, if you can't show an adverse action at all, that's not enough to create any burden of production for the employer,\" Gaiser said. \"And that sample pattern approved the four elements that McDonnell Douglas lays out, courts have adapted that under this court's guidance.\"",
      "The governing precedent in question is McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, a 1973 case where the high court established a four-step process for handling discrimination cases based on indirect evidence. Gaiser told the justices that Ames has not met the criteria set by those tests, even as the appeals court's application of the precedent was wrong.",

      "The \"higher burden of proof\" at the center of the case, which several circuit courts choose to apply, \"is not supported by the text of Title VII,\" GianCarlo Canaparo, senior legal expert at Heritage Foundation, told Fox News Digital in an interview.",
      "\"There was, and to some extent still is, an ideological movement which says the text of the Civil Rights Act, not just Title VII, all of it applies to everybody equally, but really it's only meant to give special protection to certain groups, and its protection doesn't apply to other groups,\" Canaparo said. \"And that sort of logic is what underpinned the rule in the Sixth Circuit and others, that says if you're a majority group, you're presumptively entitled to less protection, and so you have this disparate standard.\"",
      "Canaparo said that during oral arguments \"pretty much everybody, except maybe Justice Jackson, said, 'Look, the text is what it is. It's really clear.'\"",
      "He also said Ohio's goal in the case is to raise the standard for everyone, making it more difficult to file discrimination claims. Under the current McDonnell Douglas framework, plaintiffs only need to present minimal preliminary evidence to suggest discrimination, after which the employer must prove a legitimate reason for firing the employee, Canaparo said.",

      "\"Now that sounds good in theory, but how it actually works out is that the evidentiary burden that a lot of plaintiffs have to put up in the first instance is so low that what functionally happens in a lot of cases is that the defendant, the employer, has to prove its own innocence,\" he said.",

While this malware is currently being seen in only a few attacks, it has been upgraded with new tricks to make it harder to detect and remove.",
      "One of the biggest changes is how the malware hides itself. It now scrambles its code in a more unpredictable way, making it difficult for security software to recognize. It also renames parts of its code to disguise its true purpose, allowing it to stay hidden for longer.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Once it infects a Mac, the malware ensures it keeps running even after the computer is restarted. It does this in two ways. First, it inserts itself into system files that launch when the computer starts. Second, it replaces the shortcut to Launchpad, which is the tool used to open apps, with a fake version that runs both the real Launchpad and the malware at the same time.",

      "It can also collect data from the Notes app, where many users store personal information, passwords and other sensitive details. If important data is saved in Notes, it could be accessed and sent to hackers.",
      "Beyond this, the malware can exfiltrate system information and files, meaning it can gather details about the Mac itself, installed applications and even specific files stored on the device. This could include work documents, saved login credentials or any other valuable information. Because XCSSET is a modular malware, meaning it can be updated with new capabilities, it may gain even more data-stealing abilities over time.",

Be wary of unsolicited emails or messages prompting you to download or install updates, especially if they contain links.\u00a0Phishing attempts often disguise themselves as legitimate update notifications or urgent messages.",
      "3. Keep your software updated: Ensure that both macOS and all installed applications are up to date. Apple frequently releases security patches and updates that address vulnerabilities. Enable automatic updates for macOS to stay protected without having to manually check for updates. If you need more help, see my\u00a0guide on keeping all your devices updated.",
      "4. Use strong and unique passwords:\u00a0To protect your Mac from malware, it\u2019s also crucial to use strong, unique passwords for all your accounts and devices. Avoid reusing passwords across different sites or services. A\u00a0password manager can be incredibly helpful here; it generates and stores complex passwords for you, making them difficult for hackers to crack.",
      "It also keeps track of all your passwords in one place and automatically fills them in when you log into accounts, so you don\u2019t have to remember them yourself. By reducing the number of passwords you need to recall, you\u2019re less likely to reuse them, which lowers the risk of security breaches. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5. Use two-factor authentication (2FA): Enable\u00a02FA for your important accounts, including your Apple ID, Google account, email and any financial services. This adds an extra step to the login process, making it harder for attackers to gain access even if they have your password.",

      "Infostealer-related attacks on the rise in 2024",
      "A\u00a0cybersecurity report by threat intelligence platform KELA has uncovered a sharp rise in infostealer malware in 2024. Researchers also observed an alarming trend in how stolen data was circulated. Large compilations of credentials, often referred to as \"credential lists,\" were being shared across cybercrime forums. These lists, primarily sourced from infostealer logs, contained billions of login details harvested from infected devices.",
      "One of the most notable incidents linked to infostealer malware was the breach of Snowflake, a cloud data storage provider. In April 2024, threat actors gained access to customer accounts using stolen login credentials, many of which were obtained through infostealers. Exploiting weak security practices, such as the absence of multifactor authentication, attackers extracted valuable data and later attempted to sell it on underground markets. The breach affected at least 165 companies.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The KELA report highlights that hackers deploying Lumma, StealC, Redline and other infostealers infected 4.3 million machines, leading to the compromise of 330 million credentials. Nearly 40% of these infected machines contained credentials for corporate systems, including content management platforms, email accounts, Active Directory Federation Services and remote desktop environments. In total, this accounted for 1.7 million compromised bots and 7.5 million stolen credentials.",
      "The report also found that 3.9 billion credentials were shared in credential lists that appear to be sourced from infostealer logs.

      "Law enforcement has been cracking down, though. In 2024, authorities managed to take down key parts of the infostealer ecosystem, including disrupting Redline, one of the most widely used infostealers. This showed that international agencies can go after not just the malware developers but also the networks and underground markets that keep these operations running.",
      "But takedowns like these rarely put an end to the problem. When one major infostealer operation is shut down, others quickly step in to take its place. The constant demand for stolen credentials and the ability of cybercriminals to adapt means infostealer attacks will likely remain a major threat in 2025.",

      "Ways to stay safe from infostealer malware",
      "With infostealer malware becoming a growing threat, protecting your data requires a mix of smart security habits and reliable tools. Here are some effective ways to keep your information safe.",
      "1. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Even if your credentials are stolen,\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code from an authentication app or biometric confirmation. Cybercriminals rely on stolen usernames and passwords to break into accounts, but with 2FA enabled, they cannot gain access without the additional security step. Make sure to enable 2FA on important accounts like email, banking and work-related logins.",
      "2. Use strong antivirus software and be cautious with downloads and links: Infostealer malware often spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails and fake websites. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources and always double-check links before clicking them. Attackers disguise malware as legitimate software, game cheats or cracked applications, so it is best to stick to official websites and app stores for downloads.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Use a password manager: Many infostealers target saved passwords in web browsers. Instead of relying on your browser to store credentials, use a dedicated password manager. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "4. Keep software updated:\u00a0Cybercriminals exploit outdated software to deliver malware.\u00a0Keeping your operating system, browsers and security software up to date ensures that known vulnerabilities are patched. Enable automatic updates whenever possible and install reputable antivirus or endpoint protection software that can detect and block infostealer threats before they compromise your system.",
      "HOW TO FIGHT BACK AGAINST DEBIT CARD HACKERS WHO ARE AFTER YOUR MONEY",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Given the surge in infostealer malware warnings, it is clear that cybercriminals are actively targeting passwords. Both organizations and individuals are urged to strengthen their security measures by enabling 2FA, monitoring credential exposure and using endpoint protection tools. While no security measure is completely foolproof, combining these practices can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to infostealer malware.",

    "story": [
      "Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo., reacts to DOGE's revelation that millions of Americans aged 110-360 are still in the Social Security database and the department's imminent access to the IRS data retrieval system.",
      "I was one of the first to spit into a test tube, giving up my DNA forever to learn more about my health and heredity.\u00a0You know, the ones that promise to connect you with distant relatives you didn\u2019t even know existed or reveal genetic risks for conditions like Alzheimer\u2019s or heart disease. These DNA tests aren\u2019t just about satisfying curiosity; people buy them to uncover important health information, connect with loved ones or give thoughtful gifts.",
      "But here\u2019s the thing \u2013 and I\u2019m speaking from a data privacy perspective here \u2013 genetic information is highly valuable and a risk to unlocking deeply intimate information unique to only you. And while these commercial DNA tests seem harmless, they come with risks that most people don\u2019t immediately think about. Once you hand over your DNA, you\u2019re giving these companies access to your most personal data. And believe me, what happens to that data after the test can be anything but straightforward.",

      "Illustration of human DNA (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What\u2019s the big deal?",
      "Your DNA is more than just a string of letters; it's a unique and permanent blueprint of your identity. Using a commercial DNA testing service can mean handing over not only physical samples but also information about potential medical conditions and predispositions, ethnicity and familial connections and even behavioral or lifestyle markers. This can put you at risk of things like genetic testing without your consent, increased insurance premiums, health-related scams and family secrets coming to light, sometimes with painful consequences.\u00a0One woman even felt that she \"lost her entire family\" after taking one of these tests.",
      "And here\u2019s the kicker: Even if you choose to stay out of the genetic testing game, if anyone who shares some of your DNA, like your brother or your niece, chooses to take one, it can still expose you to many of these risks without you even knowing.",
      "What does happen to your genetic data?",
      "Aside from doing what the services advertise, it turns out that many DNA testing services may be sharing your genetic data with researchers, marketers, insurance companies and even law enforcement agencies.",
      "In fact, according to recent research, half of commercial DNA testing services use your genetic data for research (both internal and external). Nearly half (4 in 10) use it for marketing. And nearly half (also 4 in 10) also share your data with law enforcement agencies, potentially without any kind of subpoena or court order.",
      "While DNA testing companies often claim to use anonymized data for many of these purposes, the reality is that \"anonymized\" genetic information can\u00a0often be re-identified when combined with other data sources, sources like data brokers and people search sites that hold and sell troves of information (like lists of vulnerable individuals, such as those experiencing dementia) that could be used toward this purpose.",

      "If you do buy one of these DNA testing kits, you might expect that the results are pretty reliable. However, I was surprised to learn that this may not always be the case. According to Dr. Divya Vats, a clinical biochemical geneticist at Kaiser Permanente,\u00a0at-home genetic tests aren\u2019t as accurate as medical DNA tests ordered by your doctor. This can lead to unnecessary anxiety or false reassurance regarding your health. Even when it comes to ethnicity and ancestry, results usually rely on statistical comparisons to reference populations, which\u00a0don\u2019t necessarily yield accurate results, especially if you\u2019re from a less-studied ethnic group.",

      "Destroying your genetic samples can be a nightmare",

According to an investigative journalist who tried to have her genetic footprint wiped, it was \"brutally difficult.\" Recent events, like 23andMe going bankrupt, highlight just how precarious the situation can be.",
      "Consumers are left worried about what will happen to their genetic data if a testing company is sold or acquired, especially when they have no easy way to retrieve or destroy that data. These companies often don\u2019t disclose where and how your samples are stored, either.",
      "According to Incogni, a data broker removal service, almost none of the DNA testing services it investigated provided any information more substantial than that of a \"secure facility.\" This lack of transparency about where their data is stored and how it can be destroyed creates a major roadblock for anyone trying to regain control over their genetic information.",

      "If you\u2019re still considering using a DNA service, if your genetic information has already been exposed or if you just want to take preventative steps, here are some things to do.",
      "1) Invest in personal data removal services:\u00a0Proactively remove your personal information from online data brokers and people search sites to minimize the risk of linking anonymized genetic data back to you. Not only will this clean up and prevent your health and genetic data from circulating the web, but it\u2019ll also make it much harder for your anonymized data (genetic or otherwise) to be linked to you. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "2) Choose reputable companies: Select well-known and trusted DNA testing providers, as they are more likely to adhere to privacy and security standards due to public scrutiny.",
      "3) Review privacy options during sign-up: Pay close attention to privacy settings when registering your test kit. Many companies allow you to opt in or out of data sharing for research or marketing purposes.",
      "4) Limit data sharing: Carefully consider whether to permit your data to be shared with third parties. While you can revoke consent later, data already shared may not be fully retrievable or deletable.",
      "5) Delete data post-test: If you\u2019ve already taken a test, review the company\u2019s privacy policy and delete your data if possible. Note that data shared with third parties may remain accessible.",
      "6) Avoid uploading data to third-party databases: Refrain from uploading your genetic information to external services, which may share data with law enforcement or other entities without clear consent.",
      "7) Consider anonymous testing: Use anonymous methods when submitting DNA samples, such as pseudonyms or alternative payment methods, to reduce traceability.",
      "SUBSCRIBE TO KURT\u2019S YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR QUICK VIDEO TIPS ON HOW TO WORK ALL OF YOUR TECH DEVICES",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Your DNA holds some of the most personal and sensitive information about you, and once it\u2019s out there, you lose control over how it\u2019s used. From potential privacy violations to emotional surprises and the challenges of deleting your genetic data, DNA testing kits come with risks that many don\u2019t recognize upfront. If you\u2019re considering diving into your genetic blueprint, ask yourself: Are you comfortable with this data potentially ending up in the hands of marketers, law enforcement or even a company you didn\u2019t agree to share it with?",

The initial residents, expected to move in this fall, will be around 100 strong, primarily Toyota and \"WbyT\" (Woven by Toyota) employees and their families. The community will then expand to around 360 residents during its first phase. Eventually, the city plans to house around 2,000 people, including inventors, weavers and visitors.",
      "\"Inventors\" include Toyota employees, startups and entrepreneurs focused on mobility solutions. \"Weavers\" are residents and visitors who will collaborate with inventors by testing new products and services.

      "The line between spam and scam calls is often thin and blurred. The person on the other end of the call might sound like they're trying to sell you something or conduct a survey, but this could just be a cover for them to try to extract personal information from you.",

      "Security questions: A weak link exploited by hackers",
      "Take security questions, for example. They're pretty repetitive: your mother's maiden name, your first pet's name, your favorite elementary school teacher. A hacker does not need to know how to script a single line of code to break into your accounts; it's often enough that they know these things about you and can convince your mobile carrier to activate a SIM card in your name.",
      "This is all, let's not mince words, scary, especially if you've just sold a vehicle or property and have the proceeds lying around or a nest egg account set aside for your retirement, because scammers and hackers can easily find out about title or deed transfers through data brokers like people finder sites.",
      "Refuse to engage",
      "Scary as it is, it's also simple to protect against. Simple, but not always easy. If you just refuse to engage with these people, never giving up even a scrap of information, your risks of getting scammed or hacked plummet. Keep your personal information out of circulation in the first place (using a data removal service, for example), and they drop to almost zero.",

      "When to hang up",
      "So, once faced with a suspicious call, the solution is simply to hang up as soon as something seems off. And when is that, exactly? The moment someone calls you out of the blue and requires you to give or confirm any personal information. This could be the last four digits of your Social Security number, your address, which credit card company you're with \u2014 anything that concerns you, specifically. If the caller turns up the pressure and starts trying to get you to stay on the line, either by enticing you with \"rewards\" or even threatening you with dire consequences, then you can be absolutely sure the call is not legitimate.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The red herring of legitimacy",
      "But what if the call is legitimate? What if you hang up on someone who was only doing their job? What if they were truly trying to help you? These are the doubts that scammers and hackers play upon to ply their trades. We're all vulnerable to tactics like these, especially if caught off guard. Older adults are particularly vulnerable.\u00a0Studies suggest that older people \u2014 who collectively lose over $28 billion to scams each year \u2014 are more likely to cling to initial impressions of trustworthiness, even when later behavior puts that trustworthiness into question. Scammers typically start their interactions with well-rehearsed, smoothly executed preambles, creating good first impressions. Older people are also more likely to put stock in good manners, finding it more difficult than younger adults to directly or indirectly question a caller's intentions, let alone cut them off mid-sentence and hang up on them.",

      "Why call center staff won't ask for personal information",
      "So, how can you know if the caller is really who they say they are? That's the question many people get stuck on. The twist? It's a red herring. The fact is, it doesn't matter if the call is legit or not. If it's a scammer, they won't be hurt or offended: rejection and hang-ups come with the territory. If it's a real call, the caller also won't be hurt or offended \u2014 here's why. Call center staff and other people who make cold calls as part of their job are aware of the privacy and security concerns that such calls bring up. They know how dangerous it can be to divulge personal information over the phone, which is why they won't ask for it. They should also be familiar with one of the best practices there is for dealing with suspicious cold calls.",
      "10 ways to safeguard against phone scams and unwanted calls",
      "1. Use the \"Hang up, look up, and call back\" method for verification: When in doubt, hang up the phone, look up the organization the caller claimed to be calling from (using its official website, for example), and call it back using the number you find there. If the call you received was above board, they'll be able to redirect you back to the initial caller.",
      "2. Don't answer calls from unknown numbers: Let unknown calls go to voicemail, as legitimate callers will usually leave a message if it's important.",
      "3. Register your phone number on the\u00a0National Do Not Call Registry: This can help reduce telemarketing calls from legitimate businesses, but it won't stop scammers, illegal robocalls or exempt organizations (like charities and political groups) from calling you. Scammers often ignore the registry and use tactics like\u00a0number spoofing to bypass it. Want to know more about why your phone still won\u2019t stop ringing and what you can do about it? Check out our article on the\u00a0\u2018Do Not Call\u2019 list loophole.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Use a spam blocking app for texts and calls:\u00a0These apps can identify and block known spam numbers, significantly reducing the number of unwanted calls you receive.",
      "5. Never give out personal information in response to unexpected calls: Legitimate organizations won't ask for sensitive information over the phone if they've initiated the call.",
      "6. Be cautious of pressure tactics or requests for immediate action: Scammers often create a sense of urgency to prevent you from thinking clearly or verifying their claims.",
      "7. Set a password for your voicemail account: This prevents scammers from accessing your voicemail and potentially gathering personal information.",
      "8. Be wary of caller ID\u00a0spoofing \u2014 local numbers may not be local callers: Scammers can manipulate caller ID to display any number they choose, so don't trust it blindly.",
      "9. Don't respond to questions, especially those that can be answered with \"Yes\": Scammers may record your \"Yes\" response and use it to authorize fraudulent charges or changes to your accounts.",
      "10. Invest in personal data removal services:\u00a0To get fewer of these calls in the first place, you can enlist the help of a professional data removal service. These services can take your personal information out of circulation, including the contact details spammers and scammers use to call you. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Kurt's Key Takeaways",
      "If you receive a call that gives you any doubts at all, even if you can't quite put your finger on why, then you should end the call and either go on with your day or look up the company and call it back on its official number. You can reduce the number of calls like this by signing up for a data removal service. This will leave fewer spam and scam callers with your contact details and other personal information \u2014 something they use to craft convincing backstories and put potential victims at ease.",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2025 06:00:13 -0500",
    "summary": "A new debate has emerged about whether airlines should charge passengers based on their weight to help reduce fuel consumption and lower emissions.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News host Laura Ingraham asks why there are so many plane crashes on 'The Ingraham Angle.'",
      "In 2008, American Airlines became the first major U.S. carrier to charge for checked bags, introducing a $15 fee as part of a cost-cutting measure. Since then, other airlines have adopted similar fees, with prices steadily increasing over the years. Now, a new debate has emerged about whether airlines should charge passengers based on their weight to help reduce fuel consumption and lower emissions.",

      "In 2013, Samoa Air introduced a \"fat tax\" where passengers paid based on their weight. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The changing landscape of airline weight policies",
      "In 2013, Samoa Air introduced a \"fat tax\" where passengers paid based on their weight, but it didn't catch on widely.",
      "In February 2024, Finnair expanded its weight data collection initiative. The airline is now asking passengers to voluntarily weigh themselves along with their carry-on luggage at Helsinki Airport. This data collection will take place over three months, covering both short Schengen-area flights and longer-haul routes.",
      "Finnair's approach is designed to be anonymous, with only age, gender and travel class recorded alongside the weight data. The collected information will be used to update the airline's aircraft balance and loading calculations for the period from 2025 to 2030.",
      "These developments indicate a growing interest in the airline industry in exploring weight-based strategies for both operational efficiency and potential future pricing models.",
      "Researchers believe it\u2019s important to discuss weight-based pricing as a way to reduce the environmental impact of air travel. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "THE BEST TRAVEL GEAR FOR 2025",
      "Weight-based airline pricing divides opinion",
      "A recent\u00a0study asked 1,012 U.S. adults for their opinion on charging based on weight. It looked at three pricing options: a regular fare with a set luggage limit, a \"weight threshold\" where passengers over 160 pounds would pay extra and a \"body weight\" model where ticket prices would depend on each person\u2019s weight.",
      "The results showed that lighter passengers were more in favor of weight-based fees, while heavier passengers preferred the current system. However, almost half of the heavier respondents were still open to the idea.",
      "Younger travelers, frequent flyers and wealthier passengers were more likely to support weight-based charges.",
      "The study also revealed concerns about fairness, with nearly 60% worried about possible discrimination. Despite these worries, researchers believe it\u2019s important to discuss weight-based pricing as a way to reduce the environmental impact of air travel.",
      "The airline industry faces the challenge of balancing environmental responsibility, economic efficiency and inclusive customer experience. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "FOOD TRACKING JUST GOT LAZY WITH THIS WEARABLE",
      "Ethical and environmental implications of weight-based airline pricing",
      "The potential implementation of weight-based airline pricing extends beyond simple economics, touching on complex environmental and social justice considerations. Climate researchers suggest that such a model could significantly reduce carbon emissions by creating a more direct correlation between passenger weight and fuel consumption. Environmental experts calculate that every additional pound on an aircraft increases fuel burn, with some estimates suggesting that a reduction of 1% in total aircraft weight could lead to approximately 0.75% fuel savings.",
      "This data provides a compelling scientific argument for weight-sensitive pricing strategies. However, the approach raises critical ethical questions about body diversity, accessibility and potential discrimination. Disability advocates argue that such pricing could disproportionately impact individuals with medical conditions or physical differences beyond their control.",
      "Emerging technologies like advanced lightweight materials and more fuel-efficient aircraft designs might ultimately provide alternative solutions to reducing aviation's carbon footprint, potentially rendering weight-based pricing unnecessary in the long term. As the debate continues, the airline industry faces the challenge of balancing environmental responsibility, economic efficiency and inclusive customer experience.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Although there's interest in weight-based charges, societal norms and the potential for discrimination make it challenging to address. As airlines continue exploring new ways to reduce fuel costs and environmental impact, it\u2019s clear that any move toward weight-based pricing will need to carefully consider fairness and public perception.",

      "He added, \"The Iranians have to be taken seriously. They constantly said and never backed away from the fact that Israel is the appetizer, but the United States is the entree. They don't want to just annihilate Israel, which they do. Yeah. They want ultimately to annihilate the rest of us as well.\"",

The U.S. State Department under both Republican and Democratic administrations has designated Iran\u2019s regime as a state-sponsor of terrorism.",
      "Huckabee said, \"Let's be real clear. When President Trump was in office in his first term, the maximum pressure that he put on Iran bankrupted them. President Trump didn't have to bomb them, but he bankrupted them. They didn't have any money, and they couldn't fund the hoodies, Hezbollah or Hamas. Joe Biden comes in, takes the pressure off. They get money again. They fund terrorism. They fund the building of their bomb. And now we're having to go back. Thank goodness the president has reestablished the pressure on Iran economically.

Huckabee\u2019s comments underscore the danger Iran\u2019s regime poses to the U.S. and our allies and partners. It\u2019s why presidents for years have stated an Iran with nuclear weapons is unacceptable and that the U.S. will use all instruments of national power to prevent that outcome. One of the pillars of Tehran\u2019s grand strategy is the eradication of Israel and another is anti-Americanism.\"",

This is why weakening the regime and depriving it of resources \u2014 through maximum pressure and peace through strength \u2014 is necessary.\"",

Trade, on the other hand, is a more viable route by which the U.S. can build strong relationships with Africa, and is also in line with President Donald Trump\u2019s style of diplomacy through transactions.\"",

The direct consequence is the growth of the role of the State in the economy of the recipient country, which does not offer incentives to (the) private sector's development.\"",
      "She added, \"Foreign aid has been financing central governments, which (has) ended up promoting statism, and discouraging the creation of an entrepreneurial culture. As a result, government bureaucrats became richer, and regular citizens got poorer.

    "story": [
      "Transgender service members will be removed from the military unless they are granted a waiver, according to a memo the Pentagon filed in court late Wednesday.",
      "The memo was released as part of a lawsuit filed by LGBTQ rights groups last month against President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order barring trans people from enlisting and serving in the military and provides clarity on how the policy will be implemented.",
      "Under the trans military ban Trump issued during his first term, trans service members who had come out prior to the ban taking effect could continue to serve openly and receive transition-related medical care. Those who had come out after it took effect had to serve in a manner consistent with their birth sex and could not receive transition care.",
      "The new policy goes further, according to the memo filed in court Wednesday. Within 30 days, the Pentagon must identify service members who have \u201ca current diagnosis or history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with, gender dysphoria,\u201d which is the medical term for the severe emotional distress caused by the misalignment between one\u2019s gender identity and birth sex.",
      "Those identified by the Pentagon will be disqualified from service and must be removed from their jobs. They will receive an honorable separation unless their record reflects otherwise, according to the memo.",
      "Some trans service members can be considered for a waiver on a case-by-case basis, the memo states, \u201cprovided there is a compelling Government interest in accessing the applicant that directly supports warfighting capabilities.\u201d They also must show 36 consecutive months of stability in their sex assigned at birth without clinical distress or impairment of functioning, that they have never pursued medical transition, and that they are willing to adhere to the standards for their sex.",
      "The memo also states that the Defense Department will only recognize two sexes and that service members must use sex-separated spaces for sleeping, changing and bathrooms in accordance with their sex assigned at birth. The new policy also requires service members to use pronouns and salutations, such as sir and ma\u2019am, that align with their birth sex.",
      "The Defense Department will also be prohibited from using funds for transition-related care, including hormone therapy and surgeries, with all scheduled surgeries being canceled, the memo states. Service members can continue to receive hormone replacement therapy until they are separated from the military if a doctor recommends it.",
      "Last month, the National Center for Lesbian Rights and GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders (GLAD Law) filed a lawsuit on behalf of six active-duty trans service members and two trans people seeking to enlist, arguing that Trump\u2019s executive order barring their service violates the 14th Amendment\u2019s equal protection clause by discriminating against them based on sex and shows animosity toward transgender people because of their transgender status.",
      "Kate Cole, an Army sergeant and trans woman who is a plaintiff in the suit, said in a statement Wednesday night that the new policy will destabilize the military.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve spent more than half my life in the Army, including combat in Afghanistan,\u201d Cole said. \u201cRemoving qualified transgender soldiers like me means an exodus of experienced personnel who fill key positions and can\u2019t be easily replaced, putting the burden on our fellow soldiers left behind.\u201d",
      "Shannon Minter, legal director at NCLR, said the memo filed Wednesday shows that the \u201cscope and severity of the ban are unprecedented.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe administration has doubled down on betraying servicemembers who have faithfully followed the rules, met the same standards as others, and put their lives on the line to serve our country,\u201d Minter said in a statement. \u201cThis is a complete purge of all transgender individuals from military service.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s executive order, unlike the trans military ban he issued in 2017, says being trans fundamentally \u201cconflicts with a soldier\u2019s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one\u2019s personal life.\u201d",
      "\u201cA man\u2019s assertion that he is a woman, and his requirement that others honor this falsehood, is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member,\u201d the order states.",
      "Whether the order expresses animus against trans people sparked a tense back-and-forth between Justice Department attorney Jason C. Lynch and U.S. District Judge Ana C. Reyes during a preliminary hearing in the lawsuit last week.",
      "\u201cWould it be fair to say that excluding a group of people from military service based on unsupported assertions that they are liars, immodest, lack integrity, are undisciplined and are dishonorable, would you agree with me that \u2014 particularly where there\u2019s no support for any of those assertions \u2014 that that is animated by animus?\u201d Reyes asked Lynch, who declined to answer.",
      "The Defense Department doesn\u2019t publicly report how many trans people are serving in the military, and estimates vary widely. One 2014 report by the Williams Institute at UCLA using data from the 2011 National Transgender Discrimination Survey found that about 15,500 transgender people were serving in the military. A 2016 report from the Rand Corp. drawing from Defense Department data and previous research (including the Williams Institute report) found that there were a maximum of 10,790 trans people serving in the military and the reserves, though it found that figure could also be as low as 2,150."

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/states-brace-trump-plan-dismantle-education-department-rcna192953",
    "published": "Thu, 27 Feb 2025 10:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Trump has said he wants school policy to be left to the states, but state officials and lawmakers aren\u2019t clear on what that would look like.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has set his sights on abolishing the U.S. Education Department and has said he\u2019d prefer to put education policy in the hands of the states.",
      "But that may not be so simple, with state officials and lawmakers saying they\u2019re wildly unprepared for such a huge undertaking.",
      "NBC News reported this month that the White House is preparing an executive order to eliminate the agency, though the details of how that would work remain unclear. Trump cannot unilaterally get rid of a federal agency without congressional approval, and his nominee for education secretary, Linda McMahon, agreed at her recent Senate confirmation hearing that they hope to present a plan that Congress will support.",
      "At a Cabinet meeting Wednesday, Trump reiterated his plans for major changes at the agency, saying that \u201cwe want to move education back to the states where it belongs.\u201d",
      "Conservatives have for decades circulated an array of ideas on how to abolish or diminish the Cabinet-level agency \u2014 plans that include transferring key responsibilities within the department to other federal offices, as well as moving funds and oversight to the states.",
      "Yet, in the absence of specifics, the White House\u2019s broader plan has been met with confusion and big questions from state lawmakers and education officials from both parties who would be tasked with filling in the gaps most likely to arise if and when the department is ended or curtailed.",
      "While some state lawmakers are quietly attempting to develop modest contingency plans, most say they have no choice but to wait for the details to emerge and then scramble to make sure their states can absorb whatever additional responsibilities come their way.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no solid [federal] plan, so we don\u2019t even know what to plan for,\u201d said Connecticut state Rep. Maryam Khan, a Democrat and a former teacher and local board of education member. \u201cIf there\u2019s just an implementation of something, all of a sudden, there\u2019s no way any state can plan that quickly. There would be huge burdens on states to try to figure out something within a very small time frame.\u201d",
      "The largest questions revolve around who would pick up many of the agency\u2019s most crucial responsibilities \u2014 among them, the disbursement and oversight of funding for schools with extra needs, including schools with large populations of impoverished students or schools with children with disabilities.",
      "Another major question is how state governments would fill in huge funding gaps for other critical programs the federal agency manages, and whether they\u2019re remotely prepared to jump in if the department is dismantled.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t just move dollars like that without downstream impacts on individual districts,\u201d said Joshua Cowen, an education policy professor at Michigan State University. \u201cLike rural communities that really rely on the ability to easily, quickly interface with their own state agency and with the U.S. Department of Education to just get what they need, get decisions made, get dollars cleared.\u201d",
      "States could see much more responsibility",
      "In addition to managing the federal student loan portfolio for college students and post-secondary students, the Education Department is charged with distributing millions of dollars in funding for K-12 schools through programs that serve more than 50 million students in almost 100,000 public schools and 32,000 private schools.",
      "That includes funding for thousands of so-called Title I schools \u2014 schools that receive federal dollars to help low-income families \u2014 as well as for programs that ensure disabled students have access to a free and appropriate public education. In addition, the agency\u2019s Office for Civil Rights enforces laws that aim to prevent discrimination in schools.",
      "The White House has shared little about its plans. Responding to questions about the timing or possible details of a potential executive order regarding the agency, White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said in a statement, \"As promised, President Trump will explore options to empower the states, promote educational freedom, prioritize parents over politicians, and restore greatness to our education system.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the Education Department didn\u2019t respond to questions about potential changes.",
      "But conservatives have long discussed plans of what they\u2019d like to see happen with the Education Department.",
      "The largest element of some proposals include moving critical functions of the agency to other federal departments. Most prominently, some conservative activists have advocated for transferring federal student loan programs to the Treasury Department (Republican-sponsored U.S. House bills filed last month by Reps. Thomas Massie, of Kentucky, and David Rouzer, of North Carolina, that seek to eliminate the agency propose this) and civil rights enforcement issues in public schools to the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department.",
      "The concept of abolishing the whole agency was pushed by Project 2025, which also advocated for ending Title I funding in phases. Other advocates for conservative education policy have said the federal government should convert most of the funding it gives to states for K-12 programs into block grants, a form of funding that comes with fewer and less onerous rules and federal oversight.",
      "As a result, state lawmakers are largely anticipating having to figure out how to plan for a number of contingencies, including: How to account for or make up for the spending they rely on for Title I schools and schools that must accommodate students with disabilities; how to manage oversight and accountability for schools that would then get that funding; and whether block grants are in their future.",
      "But in interviews, state lawmakers and education officials made clear that few plans are underway for how states would deal with such a broad new framework.",
      "\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d North Carolina Democratic state Rep. Julie von Haefen said when asked if legislators were preparing for how to react to changes in federal funding for public education or how to deal with a shifting civil rights violation enforcement framework. A former PTA president in Wake County and a current substitute teacher, she focuses her attention in the state House on education issues.",
      "\u201cAnd in North Carolina, we\u2019re at a really precarious point in our state funding \u2014 the loss of federal funding would really be devastating. It\u2019s kind of a perfect storm right now, because last year, we greatly expanded our private school voucher program.\u201d she added.",
      "Iowa state Rep. J.D. Scholten, a Democrat who represents a rural and suburban area around Sioux City, offered a similar assessment of his state's readiness.",
      "\u201cNot at all,\" he said. \"We\u2019re not prepared for it, we\u2019re not preparing for it.\"",
      "Republican state policymakers who are advocating for cuts or abolishment of the Education Department also acknowledged that state governments aren\u2019t anywhere near ready to anticipate the drastic changes that could be coming.",
      "\u201cIt is hard to plan, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re really waiting on the details,\u201d said Susie Hedalen, a Republican and Montana's superintendent of public instruction, the top education official in the state.",
      "Hedalen said she didn\u2019t know what cuts to expect, but was open to the feds transferring some of their work to states. She had asked her congressional representatives and checked with the Agriculture Department on funding that feeds school children and agreed it was difficult to plan, and stressed that she had no indication the funding they currently relied on would be cut.",
      "To try to reassure her schools, she wrote a \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter affirming that funds hadn\u2019t yet been cut. Still, Hedalen said, she supported getting rid of the Education Department.",
      "\u201cThe reporting requirements and the burdens that come along with not only having to report to the state office of public instruction on how you\u2019re utilizing those funds but also having to report to the Department of Education just creates burdens on our school districts. My hope is this results in reduced red tape and federal oversight and overreach,\u201d she said.",
      "Public education advocates warned more broadly that a shift in federal education funding to block granting could set the stage for red states pouring dollars into private schools. (Under some GOP proposals, Title I funding for the poorest schools would shift to allow individual poor pupils to take that money to private schools if they chose.)",
      "This month, 12 top education officials from GOP-controlled states wrote to McMahon, who has not yet received a full Senate vote on her nomination, to pitch her on giving out federal school funding as block grants. Those Republicans said they want to be allowed to shift money around for \u201cstate-driven initiatives\u201d and \u201calternative spending approaches,\u201d and asked McMahon to grant them waivers on certain federal requirements that come with their allocations.",
      "But private schools that do not receive federal funding are exempt from civil rights laws, such as those barring discrimination based on a student\u2019s race, gender or disability. Private academies also do not provide Individualized Education Plans to children with learning disabilities. It\u2019s unclear whether any of these civil rights protections would apply, however, if states or school districts used federal dollars to support private K-12 schools under their proposed block granting schemes.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a much bigger transformation \u2014 not only government \u2014 but also of the legal landscape,\u201d said Robert Kim, executive director of the nonprofit Education Law Center and an Education Department official during the Obama administration. \u201cIt could have profound implications for disadvantaged or at-risk populations like students with disabilities.\u201d",
      "Democratic lawmakers in some blue states, including Vermont and Connecticut, said they\u2019d begun trying to at least envision a drastically altered Education Department.",
      "Vermont lawmakers, for example, are \u201clooking under every couch cushion, to know where our [education] dollars come from, that they\u2019re accounted for \u2026 what are the holes that we have now, what holes would grow bigger if there were to be funding cuts from the federal level,\u201d said state Rep. Mary-Katherine Stone, a Democrat.",
      "Other blue state legislators and current Education Department employees warned that any declawing of the agency\u2019s role in Title I and disability funding marked a fundamental threat to the federal right to a free and appropriate public education.",
      "Laws and funding for Title I and disability services exist because of the failures to treat people with respect, noted one department employee, who requested anonymity because of retaliation fears, arguing that states lacked the resources to hold schools accountable.",
      "\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for federal action and federal money they wouldn\u2019t be getting any education at all. If you take away the federal government\u2019s ability to oversee states and schools in that regard,\u201d the employee said, \u201chow do you think states are going to treat students?\u201d"

      "\"DRMM will step in to help if she struggles \u2014 but we expect responsibility and accountability to build toward her independence,\" the organization said.",
      "Amillah Currie, 2, and Darnell Currie, 9, died Feb. 10 after the van the family was living in apparently ran out of gas. Williams found the children unresponsive and not breathing and called either a friend or a relative for help, police said.",
      "The temperature in Detroit that morning was around 12 degrees F, with wind chills of 6 degrees, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "Hours before the deaths, Williams had parked the car on the ninth floor of Hollywood Casino's parking garage. Two adults and five children, ranging in age from 2 to 13, were in the van, Detroit Police Chief Todd Bettison\u00a0had said.",
      "He said he believed the family was seeking shelter in the garage for safety and because they could use the casino's bathroom. The chief also said the family had moved around from various casino parking lots.",
      "The deaths quickly raised questions about flawed systems for helping people experiencing homelessness. Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan called for a review into the family's request for assistance after he said that Williams had reached out to a homeless response team on Nov. 25 and said she needed a place to stay.",
      "The mayor said at a press conference this month that a resolution was not reached during that conversation and an outreach worker did not visit the family.",
      "The family had also reached out in the summer and the previous year, he said.",
      "The City of Detroit said in a Facebook post Wednesday that its heart continues to be with the family \"as we stand by them, offering our love and compassion.\"",
      "\"While nothing can truly ease their loss, the gift of a new home represents a pivotal step forward for both their family and community,\" the city said. \"Detroit, let us unite in support.\""

      "Controversial influencer brothers Andrew and Tristan Tate, who both face charges in Romania, including human trafficking and sexual intercourse with a minor, have arrived in the United States after a travel ban on them was lifted, according to their spokesperson and Romanian prosecutors.",
      "A spokesperson for the brothers, Mateea Petrescu, said the two landed in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, around midday, The Associated Press reported.",
      "After landing, Andrew Tate said in a statement that \"my brother and I are largely misunderstood.\"",
      "\"There\u2019s a lot of opinions about us that go around on the internet. We\u2019ve yet to be convicted of any crime in our lives ever. We have no criminal record anywhere on the planet,\" he said.",
      "Ahead of their arrival, Joseph McBride, the Tate brothers' U.S.-based attorney, told NBC News on Thursday morning, he would not comment on whether the State Department or the White House was involved in lifting the travel ban. A Trump official also declined to comment on the Tate brothers' arrival in the United States. The State Department also declined to comment.",
      "When asked about the Tate brothers' arrival in the U.S., President Donald Trump said he was unaware of the matter but would look into it.",
      "\"Our position is that Andrew and Tristan have long been targets of lawfare,\" McBride said. \"They have maintained their innocence, arguing the accusations against them are defamatory and false.\"",
      "When asked about the Tate brothers entering the state, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said it was under the federal government\u2019s jurisdiction \"whether they want to rebuff his entry into the United States.\"",
      "The Tate brothers, who are dual U.S.-British citizens, were reported by Romanian media to have taken a private plane from the country to the U.S. early Thursday.",
      "The brothers left Romania while under criminal investigation over accusations of having formed an organized criminal group, in addition to human trafficking, the trafficking of minors, sex with a minor and money laundering. They have denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Romania\u2019s Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism, or DIICOT, said in a statement Thursday that prosecutors had approved a \u201crequest to modify the obligation preventing the defendants from leaving Romania,\u201d but it said judicial control measures remained in place, The Associated Press reported. The agency did not expand on who had made the request.",
      "The Tate brothers would still be expected to appear before judicial authorities if summoned and were warned that violating their obligations could \"result in judicial control being replaced with a stricter deprivation of liberty measure,\" DIICOT said.",
      "Andrew Tate, 38, and Tristan Tate, 36, were arrested near Bucharest, Romania's capital, in 2022 along with two Romanian women, with all four indicted by Romanian prosecutors last year.",
      "The Bucharest Tribunal ruled in April that a trial could move forward but did not set a date, with all four denying the allegations against them.",
      "The Tate brothers' departure to the U.S. comes after an American woman who says the siblings attempted to recruit her into a webcam sex trafficking ring filed a countersuit against them this month, claiming they had defamed her after she gave a testimony to Romanian authorities.",
      "Jane Doe\u2019s countersuit came after the Tate brothers sued her for defamation in 2023, accusing her and another woman of giving Romanian authorities fabricated evidence and conspiring to defraud and falsely imprison them.",
      "Her suit was the first U.S.-based lawsuit against the Tate brothers, who are both former kickboxers.",
      "McBride, the brothers' lawyer, said a Zoom hearing was expected to be held on Thursday in a defamation suit the brothers filed in Palm Beach County Circuit Court, but added that that was a coincidence and unrelated to their travel.",
      "When asked about why Romanian authorities gave the brothers permission to leave, McBride added that their defamation case against the government \"put a crack in\" the charges against them, pointing to \"corruption\" in Romania.",
      "Matthew Jury, a lawyer who has represented British women who have filed criminal complaints against Andrew Tate in the U.K., said reports that the Trump administration had played a role in the Tate brothers being allowed to leave Romania for the U.S. were  \u201cequal parts disgusting and dismaying.\"",
      "NBC News was not able to independently verify whether Washington played any role in the development. The Trump administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "McBride declined to comment on whether the White House was involved in the Tate Brothers' departure from Romania.",
      "\u201cThere is clear evidence to support the allegations against Tate that he is one of the world\u2019s worst human traffickers and serial rapists,\u201d Jury said Thursday of Andrew Tate in a post on X. But, he added: \u201cAny suggestion that the Tates will now face justice in Romania is fanciful.\u201d",
      "The lawyer called on the British government to step in and act to see the Tate brothers extradited to the U.K. to face charges of \"human trafficking and rape they are alleged to have committed in this jurisdiction.\u201d",
      "The British government did not immediately comment on the developments."

    "summary": "Hamas is willing to cede political power and administrative governance of the Gaza Strip to a Palestinian unity government, but would not disarm unless an independent Palestinian state is achieved.",
    "story": [
      "TEL AVIV \u2014 Hamas is willing to cede political power and administrative governance of the Gaza Strip to a Palestinian unity government, but would not disarm unless an independent Palestinian state is achieved, Basem Naim, a senior political official for Hamas, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cWe are ready today, if not yesterday, to step back from governance to hand it over to a body, a government, a committee, that is ready to run the Gaza Strip,\u201d Naim said.",
      "Naim made his comments during a critical impasse: The first phase of a tenuous deal between Hamas and Israel is set to end on Saturday, and no arrangements have been made for continuing the ceasefire.",
      "While there have been few publicly acknowledged negotiations to extend the truce into a second phase, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said it will soon send a diplomatic delegation to Cairo to continue talks.",
      "Naim said that beyond that public announcement, Hamas had not been officially notified of Israel's intention to resume negotiations.",
      "It was unclear whether Israeli officials would seek to extend the first phase of the agreement or negotiate terms for a second phase, which could ultimately lead to a more permanent ceasefire and the eventual withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip.",
      "Naim said Israel was deliberately delaying further negotiations to create a pretext for returning to war against Hamas.",
      "\u201cWe believe that this is intentionally done to escalate the situation or to push the second-phase negotiations under the threat to return back to war and not to withdraw from the Gaza Strip,\u201d he said.",
      "Israeli troops are supposed to start withdrawing from the Gaza-Egypt border area on Saturday, marking the end of the ceasefire's first phase. However, Israeli Energy Minister Eli Cohen told public broadcaster Kan on Thursday that Israel has demanded that their military stay in the Philadelphi Corridor, which runs along Gaza\u2019s southern border with Egypt.",
      "The last step of the agreement\u2019s six-week first phase came overnight, when Israel released more than 600 Palestinian prisoners after Hamas handed over the corpses of four Israeli hostages killed during captivity in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Under the ceasefire\u2019s terms \u2014 which were reached with help from intermediaries Qatar and Egypt in late January, after more than a year of fraught negotiations \u2014 talks on the second stage should have begun weeks ago.",
      "But rather than returning to the negotiating table, each side has repeatedly accused the other of violating the agreement\u2019s terms. Several of the weekly exchanges of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners have been dogged by last-minute accusations and near-cancellations.",
      "Hamas has stated before that it is willing to cede governance of the Gaza Strip to a Palestinian body, and Israel has made clear that any plan for Gaza\u2019s \u201cday after\u201d should not include Hamas, which led the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on southern Israel. On that day, about 1,200 people were killed and 250 were kidnapped, according to local officials, sparking Israel's 15-month war on Gaza that has killed at least 48,300 people, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, and destroyed much of the enclave.",
      "The thorniest question standing in the way of negotiating the second phase of an agreement remains whether Hamas will disarm. Netanyahu has declared Hamas\u2019 destruction as the primary goal of Israel\u2019s war in the Gaza Strip \u2014 sometimes, his critics have said, superseding the freedom and welfare of the Israeli hostages still being held there.",
      "Though he reiterated Hamas\u2019 offer to integrate into a Palestinian unity government, Basem Naim said the group would only disarm and transform into a purely political party if Palestinians are granted an independent political state \u2014 a condition that Netanyahu and his right-wing allies in government have repeatedly rejected.",
      "\u201cThese are two different tracks. The arms are related to the existence or the presence of the occupation,\u201d he said, referring to Israel's ongoing presence in Gaza, the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem.",
      "If an independent Palestinian state is created, Naim said, \u201cwe are ready again to become a political party and to integrate our fighters into a Palestinian national army.\u201d",
      "Israeli military leaders have repeatedly made clear that they are prepared to return to war if the agreement collapses, going so far as to call up reservists for renewed fighting.",
      "Though Hamas remains committed to the ceasefire agreement, Naim said, the group is also preparing for renewed fighting.",
      "\u201cIf they decide to escalate and to return back to war, we are preparing ourselves for all options,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have no choice other than to defend ourselves, as we have done already along the 15 months.\u201d"

They both pleaded guilty to four counts of second-degree aggravated child abuse and were sentenced to up to 30 consecutive years in prison.",
      "The saga sparked national shock and outrage as more details continued to surface about the abuse the children endured.

      "\u201cTrusting third parties holding cameras was a huge step for [the Franke family],\u201d the series\u2019 director, Olly Lambert, said in an interview. \u201cBut when we approached them, I think they all individually had it in mind that the story needed to be told with depth and nuance over a long period of time and in detail, because only then can you sort of fully understand how they ended up where they did.\u201d",

Other footage showed similar instances of anger, such as when Ruby Franke expressed frustration at her husband for not being interactive enough on camera.",
      "\u201cShe filmed everything, and I was so uncomfortable with it,\u201d Kevin Franke said in one episode. \u201cWhen I came in the door, wherever Ruby was, the camera was. All of a sudden, it wasn\u2019t enough to just interact with her, I had to interact with the camera.\u201d",

      "It was a moment that set the stage for Hildebrandt\u2019s growing influence on Ruby Franke, as well as her gradual infiltration into the family\u2019s relationships and home. Chad Franke said his weekly calls with her soon grew more frequent, and she began counseling other members of the Franke family,\u00a0including Kevin Franke and Shari Franke.",

      "\u201cI was going to support her over all my children, period,\u201d Kevin Franke said in the docuseries, reflecting on his mindset at the time. He was terrified, he said, of possibly losing his marriage.",
      "Lambert, the series\u2019 director, told NBC News that he asked Kevin Franke \u201cthe very questions that he knew were most painful, but he wanted to be asked them so that he could respond.\u201d",
      "During his exile, several neighbors said in the series that they were growing concerned about the children\u2019s well-being.",
      "Kevin Franke said in the docuseries that even after Ruby Franke\u2019s arrest in 2023, he was initially suspicious of the details the police had told him about the condition of his youngest children.

I don\u2019t want to be hurt and abused by her anymore.

    "summary": "What to know about Alix Earle, Alex Cooper and their reported professional fallout at Unwell Network",
    "story": [
      "When lifestyle influencer Alix Earle signed with Alex Cooper's Unwell Network in August 2023, it was a pairing that brought together two of media's fastest-rising stars.",
      "Each had shown the capability of commanding a loyal audience: Earle on TikTok, where her videos regularly rack up millions of views, and Cooper on \"Call Her Daddy,\" which catapulted her to the top of the podcast rankings and helped her start her own media company. Like Cooper, Earle would also have a podcast, this one called \"Hot Mess.\"",
      "The emergence of personality-driven podcasts as major cultural and media industry forces \u2014 ones not necessarily beholden to traditional media companies \u2014 had opened up opportunities for people like Cooper and Earle not just to entertain their young audiences, but to own them as well.",
      "In an Instagram post announcing their partnership, Unwell Network wrote, \"2 blondes walk into a boardroom \u2026 the world is not ready!!!\"",
      "About a year and a half later, the two are now embroiled in what has  become a fevered internet drama, fueled by speculation around their business relationship and what might come next. Neither has commented on the situation publicly, leaving the kind of vacuum that social media can quickly fill with its own ruminations.",
      "Fans of Earle and Cooper have for months documented what they suspected was a brewing situation. Each of them document their lives on social media, offering no shortage of chances for internet sleuthing. Cooper and Earle, who had been featured so prominently on each others' feeds, were starting to appear more distant.",
      "That speculation went into overdrive this week when Variety, citing unnamed sources, reported that Earle's podcast had been dropped from Cooper's Unwell Network. A source with direct knowledge of the situation confirmed the podcast will no longer be on the Unwell Network.",
      "The Unwell Network, as well as a representative for Earle and Cooper, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Cooper, whose podcast is among the most listened-to shows globally on Spotify, has continued to build her brand with Unwell Network, a subsidiary of the media company Trending, which she founded with her now-husband, Matt Kaplan. Her millions of listeners, nicknamed the \u201cDaddy Gang,\u201d consider her the go-to voice on relationships, dating and life in your 20s and 30s.",
      "Earle exploded in popularity in 2023 while a student at the University of Miami by making viral \u201cget ready with me\u201d videos. She now has 7.3 million followers on TikTok and 4 million on Instagram.",
      "Last year, she became one of the first influencers signed by Cooper for her Unwell Network, which has been marketed as a media and production company catering to Generation Z audiences.",
      "At first, the partnership appeared to be a fruitful one \u2014 Earle was among the many social media stars who celebrated the launch of the Unwell Network with a massive multiday event at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas, in March 2024. Videos of the two partying together were all over social media, with fans lining up for hours to get into the events held at the \u201cUnwell House.\u201d",
      "But by February, many fans online had noticed a shift. Earle was notably absent from an Unwell Super Bowl party in New Orleans, despite being in town at the time. Instead, Earle posted vlogs of herself exploring the city with her friends and her boyfriend the night of the event.",
      "It was enough to further fuel speculation in Reddit threads dedicated to \u201cinfluencer snark,\u201d or drama. Onlookers pointed out that Earle had also not been spotted at other Unwell events in recent months. The network also appeared to be promoting Earle\u2019s podcast less frequently, fans said, despite having once frequently marketed \"Hot Mess\" across all its social media platforms.",
      "This is also not the first time Cooper has been scrutinized over a business relationship.",
      "The 30-year-old created \"Call Her Daddy\" with former co-host Sofia Franklyn. The two shot to viral fame in 2018, when the podcast was still under Barstool Sports. It became known for candid conversations about commonly taboo topics.",
      "But the duo professionally split up in 2020. Cooper went on to host the podcast solo, and Franklyn launched her own podcast titled \u201cSofia with an F.\u201d",
      "Cooper has since interviewed a slew of celebrities and influencers, including Miley Cyrus, Paris Hilton, Zayn, Madison Beer and John Legend. Last year, she signed a new multiyear deal with SiriusXM, dropping Spotify as the show\u2019s exclusive distributor. Terms of SiriusXM\u2019s deal were not disclosed. However, numerous reports have suggested it was valued at more than $100 million.",
      "Unwell Network\u2019s\u00a0talent signings include\u00a0influencer Madeline Argy, reality star Harry Jowsey and actor Owen Thiele.",
      "In the immediate aftermath of their rumored business split Tuesday, Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy posted on social media a screenshot of what appears to be a 22-minute call log with Earle, captioning it: \u201cYou can stop tagging me. I know what needs to be done.\u201d",
      "The cryptic post soon stirred speculation that Barstool would pick up Earle\u2019s \"Hot Mess\" podcast \u2014\u00a0rumors that Portnoy quickly shut down, writing in a comment: \u201cUpdate \u2014 I didn\u2019t call her. I just thought it was funny.\u201d",
      "His post was a near-exact replica of one of Cooper\u2019s posts from December, which she shared just before comedian Grace O\u2019Malley left Barstool Sports for Unwell Network.",
      "Earle has not publicly addressed any news about her podcast\u2019s alleged break with its host network. But in a social media post Wednesday, she announced a new business venture: She\u2019s investing in a new alcohol company in March.",
      "\u201cI guess the other part of this is it could completely fail,\u201d Earle said in an Instagram video. \u201cNo, but what I\u2019m trying to say is, like, it\u2019s scary. I\u2019m scared. I don\u2019t know, you know, it\u2019s a lot that goes into it, and having something start up is scary, but I believe in it and I believe in the team and the product.\u201d"

      "It\u2019s juicy. It\u2019s fresh. And just one will cost you $18.99.",
      "The Elly Amai strawberry, imported from Kyoto, Japan, has become the latest absurdly priced item sold at the Los Angeles luxury grocery store chain Erewhon, and it has captivated the internet.",
      "This week, dozens of people on TikTok and Instagram have posted videos commenting on the strawberry, marveling at the cost while also questioning why anyone would pay so much for a lone fruit. Some who dished out money to get their hands on the berry have described it as delicious \u2014 albeit pricey. Others have called out the cost, suggesting it\u2019s yet another product for wealthy Angelenos who frequent the chain.",
      "In recent years, Erewhon, which has 10 stores in the L.A. area, has become a hotspot for locals and tourists alike thanks to the A-listers who shop there and the influencers who regularly post about it online. Their celebrity-branded smoothies \u2014 including Kendall Jenner\u2019s \u201cPeaches and Cream\u201d smoothie and Hailey Bieber\u2019s \u201cStrawberry Glaze Soft Serve\u201d smoothie \u2014 have helped propel the store's online fame, turning it into a cultural phenomenon.",
      "The market\u2019s social media popularity is something influencer Alyssa Antoci, 22, knows intimately. Her uncle and aunt, Tony and Josephine Antoci, own the popular chain.\u00a0And it was Antoci who began the strawberry trend on TikTok earlier this week, sharing a video of herself unboxing the berry and biting into it while sitting outside an Erewhon store.",
      "\u201cWow, this is the best strawberry,\u201d she says after the taste-test. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy.\u201d",
      "The video has amassed 15.6 million views as of Wednesday and has prompted others on the platform to weigh in. While some have mocked Antoci\u2019s video, others have filmed themselves going to Erewhon to try the strawberry out.",
      "Antoci, who said she used to help run Erewhon\u2019s social media, said she knows that the prices can contribute to the general frenzy over the store\u2019s products. But she believes the overly priced items have also made the chain a destination for many who want a taste of the idyllic L.A. lifestyle.",
      "\u201cPeople kind of want to experience that and say it in posts,\u201d she said of the viral craze around the store itself. The smoothies, for example, are \u201cbeautiful\u201d and serve as the ideal \u201cphoto op\u201d for visitors, she said.",
      "In Erewhon stores, the shelves in which the berries are put on display showcase them in individually packed clear containers. The bright, large berries sit atop white pads.",
      "The description posted next to the product, provided by Elly Amai, says their strawberries \u201credefine sweetness and beauty.\u201d",
      "Once removed from the container, consumers are instructed to rinse the berry, remove the stem and wait 30 minutes \u201cto bring out maximum sweetness and aroma\u201d before eating.",
      "\u201cEach berry is cultivated to achieve perfect symmetry, brilliant color, and exceptional size,\u201d according to the description on display.",
      "With the berry, Antoci didn\u2019t necessarily anticipate such buzz online. But now, it\u2019s become a hot commodity: according to Antoci, the berry has sold out at three L.A. locations as of Wednesday.",
      "\u201cI honestly think this is probably one of the biggest things that have taken off, besides the smoothies,\u201d Antoci said.",
      "A spokesperson for Erewhon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\u00a0A spokesperson for Elly Amai also did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThe strawberries are picked at their prime and hits the shelves at Erewhon within 24-48 hrs,\u201d a representative for Erewhon told TODAY.com\u00a0in an email. \u201cFaster than broccoli growing in CA getting to markets in NY.\u201d",
      "A representative for EllyAmai told the publication that the strawberries are picked in Japan two days before they're sold in L.A. and have to be eaten within three days after that.",
      "\u201cIf you think logistics-wise, getting it here and being able to try it fresh from Japan, it\u2019s very understandable why the price is what it is,\u201d the representative told\u00a0TODAY.com. \u201cDon\u2019t hate on it until you try it.\u201d",
      "Still, some who went to check out the berry in person were not as enthusiastic as Antoci.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of weird things at Erewhon, but this is a new low,\u201d said one creator in a video shared to their Instagram.",
      "Many social media users have also commented how they think a price tag so high for such a small item feels dystopian, given that people are struggling with high grocery costs as it is.",
      "But Antoci isn't deterred by any sort of backlash.",
      "\"That's just how social media works,\" she said. \"It's like, you know, you're gonna get people who hate on you, but it's like, it doesn't really matter at the end of the day, because they don't understand the opportunity it brings.\""

    "summary": "For director Brady Corbet, bringing \"The Brutalist\" to life was a family affair. He and his life partner, Mona Fastvold, who co-wrote the screenplay, are both up for Oscars.",
    "story": [
      "It was a rare wholesome moment at what\u2019s typically known as Hollywood\u2019s biggest and booziest party.",
      "Brady Corbet, accepting a Golden Globe last month for directing \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d made it clear just how important his family was to the making of the epic film. As he spoke, the camera cut to three women who helped Corbet build it: \u201cthe incomparable\u201d Mary Corbet, who raised him as a single mother; Mona Fastvold, his longtime \u201cmuse\u201d and co-writer of the film; and 10-year-old Ada, Corbet and Fastvold\u2019s child.",
      "\u201cI love you so much, Ada James,\u201d Corbet said, looking toward his daughter as she cried tears of joy and relief.",
      "After all, the movie has been part of her life in one way or another since she was 3 years old, Corbet and Fastvold told NBC News in a recent interview at the Breuer Building on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side. The brutalist-style structure, designed by the Hungarian-German modernist architect Marcel Breuer and completed in 1966 to house the Whitney Museum of American Art, will soon become the home of Sotheby\u2019s auction house.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s our partner in crime,\u201d Corbet said of Ada James.\u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s on these film sets, and she\u2019s, you know, with us every step of the way. She\u2019s there with us at the monitor 90% of the time.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Brutalist\u201d is the fifth film collaboration between Corbet and Fastvold. It tells the story of fictional Hungarian architect L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u00f3th (Adrien Brody) and his writer wife Erzs\u00e9bet (Felicity Jones), Holocaust survivors who struggle to adapt to American life and grapple with the demands of wealthy industrialist Harrison Van Buren (Guy Pearce).",
      "It\u2019s a heavyweight contender at this Sunday\u2019s Academy Awards, where it\u2019s nominated for 10 Oscars, including best picture. Corbet is nominated for best director, while he and Fastvold are up for best original screenplay.",
      "The partners take turns in the director\u2019s chair from project to project. Their previous collaborations include 2018\u2019s \u201cVox Lux\u201d starring Natalie Portman and the 2020 release \u201cThe World to Come\u201d featuring Katherine Waterston and Vanessa Kirby. The dynamic will continue this year with their latest film, \u201cAnn Lee,\u201d a historical musical drama starring Amanda Seyfried. Fastvold directed, and Corbet co-wrote it with her.",
      "\u201cBrady likes to write at night, and I write early in the morning,\u201d Fastvold, 38, said. \u201cAnd then we write together in the middle of the day.\u201d",
      "They\u2019ve got it down to a routine, quite literally finishing each other\u2019s sentences.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not very dogmatic about it, and I think that writing in general, even if you\u2019re writing something on your own, which we both occasionally do as well, it\u2019s an improvisational process where, you know, the first rule of improv is, you know, never say no,\u201d Corbet said. \u201cAnd I think that chasing a story, chasing an idea, it\u2019s about riffing and building on each other\u2019s proposals.\u201d",
      "A long road to awards season",
      "The duo\u2019s hard work paved the way for critical acclaim and awards buzz. Corbet has already racked up best director honors at the Golden Globes and the BAFTAs, the U.K.\u2019s equivalent of the Academy Awards. Brody, Jones and Pearce are all nominated for acting Oscars.",
      "But it was a tough road to the Academy Awards for \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d which is three hours and 35 minutes (including an intermission that's reminiscent of Hollywood\u2019s Golden Age epics).",
      "As he promoted the film, Corbet made headlines for underscoring how tough it is to make a living as a filmmaker. In a recent interview on\u00a0the \u201cWTF With Marc Maron\u201d podcast, Corbet said he and Fastvold \u201cmade zero dollars on the last two films we made,\u201d noting that they \u201chad to just live off of a paycheck from three years ago.\u201d",
      "Lining up financing for \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d was tough, too. Corbet and Fastvold said they were turned down by multiple potential investors.",
      "\u201cIf I were in their position, I probably would have passed, too,\u201d Corbet said. \u201cIt was following a global pandemic. People were not going to the movies.\u201d",
      "Eventually, along with some of their own savings, Corbet and Fastvold scraped together enough financing to make the movie for about $10 million. That\u2019s a fraction of what large-scale Hollywood movies typically cost. For comparison, last year\u2019s best picture Oscar winner, the three-hour historical drama \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d reportedly was budgeted at $100 million. (Universal Pictures, which released \u201cOppenheimer\u201d and whose international arm distributed \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d outside North America, shares a parent company with NBC News.)",
      "\u201cThe Brutalist\u201d wrapped filming in May 2023 and then premiered last year at the Venice Film Festival, where it earned rave reviews. It was scooped up by prestigious studio and distributor A24, which positioned the movie in the thick of the Oscar race.",
      "The film generated some controversy, as well, after editor D\u00e1vid Jancs\u00f3 said filmmakers used artificial intelligence to enhance Brody\u2019s and Jones\u2019 Hungarian accents. Corbet and Fastvold told NBC News their use of the technology was minimal, ethical \u2014 and necessary.",
      "\u201cI wanted Hungarians to be able to watch the film and have it ring true for them,\u201d Corbet said.",
      "Home again",
      "Beyond the accolades, \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d is a major personal milestone for Corbet, 36, who was raised by a single mom, dropped out of high school and started acting in films such as 2003\u2019s \u201cThirteen\u201d before settling into the director\u2019s chair.",
      "\u201cI did not go to film school at all. I did grow up on film sets, and so, of course, there\u2019s probably no better education than that,\u201d he said.",
      "The success of \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d is also gratifying for Corbet\u2019s mother, Mary. \u201cShe\u2019s very, very touched by it,\u201d the director said.",
      "As awards season comes to a crescendo, Corbet and Fastvold are looking forward to some family time \u2014 away from the set. The morning after the Oscars, it\u2019s back to their life in Brooklyn, New York.",
      "\u201cYou just gotta go home and, you know, pack lunch and make dinner and then \u2026 we go back into a dark room and keep on trying to make another movie,\u201d Fastvold said.",
      "Corbet, meanwhile, said he\u2019s eager to \u201cbe just dad\u201d again after months of hopping on planes every few days and visiting more than a dozen countries.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been away too much,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that when we finally sort of slow down, we\u2019ll really, really be able to appreciate it.\u201d"

However, Israeli Energy Minister Eli Cohen told public broadcaster Kan on Thursday that Israel has demanded that their military stay in the Philadelphi Corridor, which runs along Gaza\u2019s southern border with Egypt.",
      "The last step of the agreement\u2019s six-week first phase came overnight, when Israel released more than 600 Palestinian prisoners after Hamas handed over the corpses of four Israeli hostages killed during captivity in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Under the ceasefire\u2019s terms \u2014 which were reached with help from intermediaries Qatar and Egypt in late January, after more than a year of fraught negotiations \u2014 talks on the second stage should have begun weeks ago.",
      "But rather than returning to the negotiating table, each side has repeatedly accused the other of violating the agreement\u2019s terms. Several of the weekly exchanges of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners have been dogged by last-minute accusations and near-cancellations.",
      "Hamas has stated before that it is willing to cede governance of the Gaza Strip to a Palestinian body, and Israel has made clear that any plan for Gaza\u2019s \u201cday after\u201d should not include Hamas, which led the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on southern Israel. On that day, about 1,200 people were killed and 250 were kidnapped, according to local officials, sparking Israel's 15-month war on Gaza that has killed at least 48,300 people, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, and destroyed much of the enclave.",
      "The thorniest question standing in the way of negotiating the second phase of an agreement remains whether Hamas will disarm. Netanyahu has declared Hamas\u2019 destruction as the primary goal of Israel\u2019s war in the Gaza Strip \u2014 sometimes, his critics have said, superseding the freedom and welfare of the Israeli hostages still being held there.",
      "Though he reiterated Hamas\u2019 offer to integrate into a Palestinian unity government, Basem Naim said the group would only disarm and transform into a purely political party if Palestinians are granted an independent political state \u2014 a condition that Netanyahu and his right-wing allies in government have repeatedly rejected.",
      "\u201cThese are two different tracks. The arms are related to the existence or the presence of the occupation,\u201d he said, referring to Israel's ongoing presence in Gaza, the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem.",
      "If an independent Palestinian state is created, Naim said, \u201cwe are ready again to become a political party and to integrate our fighters into a Palestinian national army.\u201d",
      "Israeli military leaders have repeatedly made clear that they are prepared to return to war if the agreement collapses, going so far as to call up reservists for renewed fighting.",
      "Though Hamas remains committed to the ceasefire agreement, Naim said, the group is also preparing for renewed fighting.",
      "\u201cIf they decide to escalate and to return back to war, we are preparing ourselves for all options,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have no choice other than to defend ourselves, as we have done already along the 15 months.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Warning: This post contains spoilers for \"The White Lotus\" Season Three.",
      "The opening credits of \"The White Lotus\" Season 3 might give away more information than just the cast and crew's names. Fans think the art has clues into the characters\u2019 fates \u2014 and some of the actors this season do, too.",
      "Jason Isaacs, who plays father of three and businessman Timothy Ratliff in the third season of the hit HBO show, brought up the meaning behind the opening credits this season in an interview with some of his castmates aired on TODAY on Feb. 12.",
      "\"Someone said to Patrick (Schwarzenegger) and I the other day that during the credits when each individual name comes up, did you notice that the drawing behind it means something about their character?\" Isaacs asked.",
      "Sarah Catherine Hook, who plays Tim's middle child Piper in the show, said the illustration accompanying her name directly corresponded with her character.",
      "\"Mine was meditating,\" Hook said. \"I was like, 'That's Piper.'\"",
      "Isaacs started laughing and replied, \"We didn't notice any of this at all.\"",
      "While the cast of the \"White Lotus\" are aware of what the illustrations could mean (or could not mean), fans have began posting their own theories on social media.",
      "One TikTok, which has more than 350,000 views, offered five minutes of analysis of the opening credits, from character illustrations to how Season Three's credits could connect to the credits (and plot lines) from Season One.",
      "Kelly Cahn, an art advisor, curator and appraiser, shared more insights about the opening credits in an interview with TODAY.com.",
      "\"I feel like they're literally showing us the entire thing in advance,\" Cahn said of the opening images, which were hand drawn by Plains of Yonder.",
      "The 'White Lotus' Season 3 credits, analyzed by an art expert",
      "The paintings shown in the opening credits are inspired by Thai mural paintings, which can be found in temples and royal palaces in Thailand, Cahn said.",
      "She noted that several paintings throughout the credits, including the one featured in the first few seconds, appear to be on top of panel that is behind the ones that are visible, meaning we might not be seeing the full, bigger picture.",
      "\"Like, there's some story that's a cover up or something,\" Cahn said.",
      "The first actor's name to appear is Leslie Bibb. The letters are surrounded by an illustration of several elephants \u2014 creatures known for having a remarkable memory.",
      "Cahn said at first she saw three elephants \u2014 which could correspond to the trio Bibb's character is with on the trip \u2014 but then could potentially see four, possibly hinting at more to come for their group.",
      "The illustration for Carrie Coon, who plays another one of the three women on vacation together, also features an elephant, though it's surrounded by a pack of animals as two winged creatures look on from above.",
      "\"There's almost a sense of you're being watched,\" Cahn says of the painting. \"Are these things that can fly away and report back? Again, it feels like an attack. Lying in wait, watching.\"",
      "Walton Goggins is the next name to appear after imagery of a palace or temple. His illustration shows a man sitting in a tower looking down below, which Cahn said could hint at his surveillance of the owners of the hotel.",
      "As Hook said on TODAY, her name is shown with a woman who appears to be meditating on a hill, and her character Piper is a Buddhist.",
      "Before Isaacs' name is alongside a man hiding in a tree (\"perhaps from the incriminating press,\" Cahn said). Above him in the tree are hanging knives or swords \u2014 which could be a sign of incoming danger for the father of three, Cahn said.",
      "And in Episode 2, Tim's business partner Kenny (voiced by Ke Huy Quan) tells him that the feds have raided his office. Kenny then warns Tim that they have everything on their business dealings in Brunei, which Tim implies could be tied to money laundering.",
      "The image for Blackpink singer Lalisa Manobal, who plays Mook, seems to show a woman holding an umbrella and flirting with a man, Cahn said.",
      "\"In the first episode, she is trying to convince her partner to go after more lucrative bodyguard positions that would enable them to travel,\" Cahn noted of Mook.",
      "Michelle Monaghan, who plays the third woman vacationing in Thailand with her two best friends, has a topless woman on a balcony in the image alongside her name.",
      "Sam Nivola, who plays one of Tim\u2019s sons Lochlan, shared on TODAY that the illustration beside his name is just a boy lying down \u2014 but he did give the show\u2019s creator Mike White some room for interpretation with the opening credits.",
      "\u201cWhat if he\u2019s just like, screwing with us all?\u201d Nivola asked.",
      "Cahn analyzed the painting as a boy in his underwear floating in the water, perhaps showing a direct line to who could end up dead in the water at the end of the series.",
      "But as Nivola himself said on TODAY, it all could be a red herring as well.",
      "Lek Patravadi, who plays the owner of the hotel, is shown with a woman seated in a lotus position holding a bird with a human head in her hand, Cahn said.",
      "Parker Posey's image shows two monkeys sitting together, one of which is blowing smoke, which Cahn said could allude to the Southern mom's dependence on prescription drugs.",
      "After Posey's name, the credits cut to an alligator looking in the distance, and then pans over to a heron or crane looking at its reflection in the water.",
      "Natasha Rothwell's name pops up, which Cahn said could relate to the myth of Narcissus, or even her ability to see Gary as Greg.",
      "\"Or perhaps it deals with the self-reflection she will be undertaking during her 3 months in Thailand,\" Cahn said.",
      "Two men appear to be peeping watching a topless woman (a possible reference to the image from Monaghan's name, Cahn noted) from afar in some trees in the next section \u2014 as Patrick Schwarzenegger's name comes up.",
      "\"Patrick Schwarzenegger is clearly, like, the guy that would be leering through the bushes,\" Cahn said, referring to his character Saxon. \"I feel like he instantly tries to hit on (women), and they're like, 'What?' ... it feels like this kind of peeping Tom energy.\"",
      "Tayme Thapthimthong, who plays the hotel's bodyguard Gaitok, has a man fighting a tiger alongside his name, while a cow or ram watches from above, Cahn said.",
      "A large cat has attacked another animal alongside Aimee Lou Wood's name, while two other animals look on and watch. Cahn questioned if Wood's character Chelsea is the attacked animal \u2014 or if she could be the feline itself.",
      "Wood\u2019s name is the last cast member\u2019s name to be shown before members of the crew. A large group of monkeys are seen traveling together, with one monkey pointing the way, as the casting director Meredith Tucker\u2019s name is shown.",
      "Two monkeys appear to be crawling up a tower as the Thailand casting director Non Jungmeier's name is shown, and four people are at the top of the tower as costume designer Alex Boivard's name comes into the frame. One person is holding a snake towards the monkeys, Cahn noted.",
      "The next few scenes show what could be an attack on a place, before a boat appears to capsize, and some of the crew are eaten by large fish, Cahn said.",
      "The last image is of a man paddling on a log while another fish looks on, as White's name is credited as creating the series.",
      "The credits end with an ornate red temple with a Buddha in the middle, which Cahn said could be an allusion to the hotel owner's husband.",
      "Whether Lochlan ends up floating the water, or if the tree of knives falls on Timothy, still remains to be seen. But the theories as to who dies at the end of Season 3 of \"The White Lotus\" are just getting started.",
      "And if \"The White Lotus\" has taught us anything, it\u2019s that we should analyze everything \u2014 from the\u00a0Testa di Moro statues to the art on the walls."

It\u2019s sort of a way they quality test their product. So that\u2019s what having kids does to your to your relationship. It just picks the whole thing up and shakes it, and it\u2019s rattling and sh-- is falling off.

      "\u201cThe Dream Hotel\u201d by Laila Lalami follows Sara, a young mother of twins who has been detained for having dreams that indicate she might be a danger to those around her.",
      "\u201cThey can predict that she will commit a crime,\u201d Jenna says of Sara\u2019s dreams. \u201cBut she\u2019s committed nothing.\u201d",
      "Jenna says that if you\u2019re traveling this month, you\u2019re going to \u201cwant to devour this book.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a book about how technology shackles us even when it connects us, how it can make us not feel present, and it\u2019s a commentary on that,\u201d Jenna says. \u201cIt is a book that is filled with beautiful characters who you will never forget, and it really shows the power we all have to dream.\u201d",
      "\"The Dream Hotel\" by Laila Lalami",
      "Lalami has previously written about immigration and identity in novels like \u201cThe Other Americans\u201d and nonfiction like \u201cConditional Citizens.\u201d",
      "She tells TODAY.com she first got the idea for the novel when she got a Google alert on her phone over 10 years ago.",
      "\u201cI had overslept one morning, and the first thing I did is I picked up my phone, and, still groggy, I look and see that there\u2019s a notification from Google,\u201d she said. \u201cIt said, \u2018If you leave right now, you\u2019ll make it to yoga at 7:28.\u2019 I was stunned and creeped out.\u201d",
      "Though Lalami was a regular yogi, she says she had never added the class to her Google Calendar.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just that every Tuesday and Thursday, I would go to the 7:30 a.m. class, and that day, the company knew that I was not in my car heading there and was alerting me: you better get up and go,\u201d she says.",
      "After receiving the notification, she recalls telling her husband: \u201cPretty soon, the only privacy any of us will have will be in our dreams.\u201d",
      "But then Lalami thought about if one day, even dreams could be monitored and surveilled \u2014 and what could happen. She started the book and made it about 70 pages in before she set it aside to work on another book.",
      "Lalami picked up the project again in 2020, and it would become \u201cThe Dream Hotel,\u201d which publishes on March 4.",
      "Its premise? \u201cImagine if a tech company could know everything about you, including your dreams,\u201d Lalami says.",
      "\u201cThis book follows a person who, like all of us, thinks that this technological surveillance is part of our lives and is generally harmless, and comes to discover that, in fact, it can be harmful,\u201d Lalami adds. \u201cAnd in the book, she is accused of committing a crime because of her dreams. So the question becomes, how does she fight back? How does she regain her freedom?\u201d",
      "In \u201cThe Dream Hotel,\u201d the protagonist Sara is arriving back from a work trip in London when she\u2019s flagged for a further security review at LAX.",
      "When officers determine her score \u2014 a number determined by methods of surveillance like records of her past, her social media and her dreams \u2014 is determined to be too high, she\u2019s moved into a retention center for 21 days for observation.",
      "When three weeks turns into several months in the center, Sara tries everything she can to lower her score and get back to her husband, twin toddlers and her job as a museum archivist.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s obviously a deliberate choice to have her be an archivist, because one of the things that really struck me about all of the data that that our phones collect about us is that we\u2019re essentially creating an archive of us,\u201d Lalami says.",
      "\u201cI wanted to draw the connection between this world that we think of as futuristic and different, and say, actually, maybe it\u2019s not all that different,\u201d she adds. \u201cMaybe it actually does connect to our present and also to our past.\u201d",
      "Lalami says the science of dreams has always fascinated her, and that she wanted to explore how dreams have been interpreted in the past to imagine how they could be used in the future.",
      "\u201cOne of the things that I love about dreams is that they are universal, right? We all dream, all of us, across the entire species. It\u2019s a biological need. You actually need to dream. It\u2019s something that even infants do, apparently, and you continue dreaming your whole life,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cSo we know they\u2019re important in some way to our function, but we also have the sense that they carry symbolism and that they have meaning,\u201d she continues.",
      "Lalami says when she first started writing the book, she had it set in Silicon Valley, but when she returned to it in 2020, she moved the setting to LA, where she\u2019s lived for more than half her life.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a place that I think of as always being on the brink of literal disaster, right?\u201d she says. \u201cI think that that sense of danger is always just so present with the state, and yet the state always manages to survive that.\u201d",
      "She hopes this is one of the themes readers take away from this month\u2019s Read With Jenna pick, Lalami says.",
      "\u201cOne of the things that happened for me during the writing of the book is that it gave me hope. It made me think that we, all of us, actually have the tools to fight back against surveillance. Maybe it can be something small, it can be something large, but we all have the power to to fight back against this technological surveillance,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are not powerless.\u201d"

      "At the time, Daniels, who lived in Auburn, New York, where Tubman lived for the majority of her life, could only unearth research that said Tubman was a \"fugitive\" and there \"was a bounty of her head,\" she tells TODAY.com.",
      "Unsatisfied, she went to her mom with the assignment, curious about why she'd been asked to research a figure who seemingly did what she was \"raised to not do.\"",
      "This moment would change Daniels life forever.",
      "Her mom revealed that they were descendants of Tubman, whom Daniels now affectionately calls \"Aunt Harriet,\" a fact her mom had discovered while comparing family trees in her 20s.",
      "\"She says, 'But your Aunt Harriet was not the kind of villain that they make her out,'\" Daniels recalls of her mother explaining the inaccuracies in the research at that time.",
      "Daniels dived into the book report, using some of her elder aunts and uncles to gather knowledge on Tubman that the school library didn't have.",
      "\"I got an AAA (grade) on (the book report) because I had more information than the school books had,\" she says.",
      "But that assignment was just the beginning of Daniels journey of family discovery and preserving Harriet Tubman's legacy.",

      "She says there's a long list of errors, like that she would \"jump off a cliff,\" as seen in the 2019 film \"Harriet,\" or that she would be \"caught in bushes\" and \"having sex with other people just to get through.\"",
      "Daniels wants her book to spread awareness of Tubman's true legacy and actions, properly documenting Tubman's life that \"went from one extreme to another.\"",
      "She also hopes the book encourages others to dive into their own ancestral past.",
      "\"Other people need to find out what is their journey, who they are they related to, who survived some type of \u2014 I can't (necessarily) say slavery \u2014 but some type of goodness, or whatever it is,\" she adds.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re not going back. Those are my words. We\u2019re not going back,\" she adds.",
      "In 2015, Daniels started the Harriet Tubman Learning Center in Powder Springs, Georgia, alongside her mother, Geraldine Copes-Daniels, with a mission to carry out Tubman's legacy through improving the literacy of underserved children.",
      "Daniels says that \"slaves were not allowed to learn how to read or write,\" so Tubman \"never had that opportunity to learn.\"",
      "\"(Slaves) were not supposed to have any type of skill sets when it came to school or anything like that, and if they if someone even tried to teach them, they would either be hung or lynched,\" she explains.",

Additionally, Copes Johnson has given presentations on Tubman\u2019s life across the U.S. and even in Ghana.",

      "\"She is a true American Patriot and chose to help preserve the Union by risking her life and liberty to do it. She continued to serve and help people who were marginalized, disenfranchised, and in need,\" Wyatt shared with Essence.",
      "\"I would say look at her life and what she accomplished with the span of time from her self-liberation in 1849 until 1913, how she rose up out of it and uplifted others.\"",
      "Like Copes Johnson, she has also spoken about the importance of getting her ancestor on the $20 bill.",
      "\u201cThat $20 bill, for me, represents something greater about who she was and what she gave to the United States,\u201d Wyatt told CNN in January 2024. \u201cShe is a symbol of true democracy in this country, and we have to pay attention to the symbols that we want to represent it.\u201d",

      "\u201cHarriet Tubman is like a stage name for me,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not who she was to herself or to her family here. In Auburn, she was Mrs. Davis. The public has no clue about who she really was as a person, as a member of our family.\u201d",
      "Bryant has spoken at services, events and ceremonies that involve Tubman's legacy, including the opening ceremony for the Thompson Memorial African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, which is part of the Harriet Tubman National Historical Park in Auburn, New York.",
      "Joan Rebecca Stewart Springfield-Butler \u2014 a descendant of Tubman\u2019s brother, James Stewart \u2014 lives in Schenectady, New York.",

      "\u201cI didn\u2019t know about being related to her until I was about 36 or 37,\" she told Ms. Magazine in its January 2022 story. \"I was a little upset because she was in the schoolbooks when I was in school, and there weren\u2019t many Black people in there at that time, and I could have said, \u2018Well, I\u2019m related to her.\u2019\u2019\u2019",
      "Springfield-Butler told Ms. Magazine that her father was 13 when Tubman died.",
      "\u201cHe remembered her sitting at the table and talking and falling asleep. And then she picked up right where she left off when she woke up,\" she said.",
      "\"We had a room in my grandfather\u2019s house that my uncle was living in, and the room was empty except for a Bible and gun. I once asked whose they were, and they said, \u2018Oh, a relative.\u2019 I had no idea that they were Harriet Tubman\u2019s! And then my uncle lost them when he moved from that house to another house.\"",
      "Michele Jones Galvin is a great-great-great grandniece of Tubman.",

      "When Galvin was in fourth grade, she was assigned a school report to pick \"an important individual who was greatly admired\" in the course of history, per Syracuse Woman Magazine. She considered writing about Tubman, but ultimately chose another subject as there was not enough information available regarding her ancestor.",
      "\u201cThen it hit me,\u201d Galvin told the outlet. \u201cAnd, then, I learned that I should never have squandered that opportunity to share with my classmates and my teacher about the relationship with Aunt Harriet.\u201d",
      "Her mother went on to research Tubman's life heavily, producing a documentary called \u201cA Conversation with a Living Relative of Harriet Tubman.\" The mother-daughter duo also published a book on Tubman, which mixes \"family lore, memoir and historical reconstruction,\" according to the official description.",
      "Valerie Ardelia Ross Manokey is Tubman\u2019s great-great-niece. She is a mother of five who lives in Maryland, per the National Parks Conservation Association.",
      "In an interview with NPCA published in 2017, Manokey recalled that when she was growing up, her parents would always tell her, \"Remember Aunt Harriet. If she could endure, so can you.\"",
      "Manokey said in the 1950s, her family advocated for a Harriet Tubman memorial but it never came to fruition.",
      "\u201cPeople told us, \u2018You\u2019ll never get anything,\u2019\u201d Manokey told the association. \u201cBut \u2018never\u2019 means you have just got to fight harder. You might get knocked back to your knees, but you are going to get back up.\u201d",
      "Starting as a teacher's aide, Manokey taught children about Tubman, far beyond what was being shared at the time.",
      "\"I didn\u2019t feel like I was a good teacher. I knew I was,\u201d she said. \u201cI had confidence. I had pride.\u201d",
      "Manokey spoke on Tubman's legacy today, saying, \u201cI honor Harriet. I honor the name. I honor the stories that I have heard. And I thank God that I have lived long enough to see this.\u201d",
      "Charles E.T. Ross is Tubman's great-great-great-nephew and Manokey's nephew. Ross carries out Tubman's mission of helping others through his role as an education specialist, according to the National Parks Conservation Association.",
      "\u201cI need to basically continue what she did,\" he shared with the outlet.",
      "He continues Tubman\u2019s legacy through art, as seen through the mural he painted of her in Dorchester County, which his aunt said shows a young Tubman and marshy terrain, per the association. Ross also volunteers at the Harriet Tubman Museum and Educational Center in Cambridge, Maryland.",
      "\u201cShe was a leader,\u201d he said of Tubman in a November 2022 interview from The Washington Post. \u201cAnd she should empower all of us to be leaders.\u201d"

      "TEL AVIV \u2014 Hamas is willing to cede political power and administrative governance of the Gaza Strip to a Palestinian unity government, but would not disarm unless an independent Palestinian state is achieved, Basem Naim, a senior political official for Hamas, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cWe are ready today, if not yesterday, to step back from governance to hand it over to a body, a government, a committee, that is ready to run the Gaza Strip,\u201d Naim said.",
      "Naim made his comments during a critical impasse: The first phase of a tenuous deal between Hamas and Israel is set to end on Saturday, and no arrangements have been made for continuing the ceasefire.",
      "While there have been few publicly acknowledged negotiations to extend the truce into a second phase, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said it will soon send a diplomatic delegation to Cairo to continue talks.",
      "Naim said that beyond that public announcement, Hamas had not been officially notified of Israel's intention to resume negotiations.",
      "It was unclear whether Israeli officials would seek to extend the first phase of the agreement or negotiate terms for a second phase, which could ultimately lead to a more permanent ceasefire and the eventual withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip.",
      "Naim said Israel was deliberately delaying further negotiations to create a pretext for returning to war against Hamas.",
      "\u201cWe believe that this is intentionally done to escalate the situation or to push the second-phase negotiations under the threat to return back to war and not to withdraw from the Gaza Strip,\u201d he said.",
      "Israeli troops are supposed to start withdrawing from the Gaza-Egypt border area on Saturday, marking the end of the ceasefire's first phase. However, Israeli Energy Minister Eli Cohen told public broadcaster Kan on Thursday that Israel has demanded that their military stay in the Philadelphi Corridor, which runs along Gaza\u2019s southern border with Egypt.",
      "The last step of the agreement\u2019s six-week first phase came overnight, when Israel released more than 600 Palestinian prisoners after Hamas handed over the corpses of four Israeli hostages killed during captivity in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Under the ceasefire\u2019s terms \u2014 which were reached with help from intermediaries Qatar and Egypt in late January, after more than a year of fraught negotiations \u2014 talks on the second stage should have begun weeks ago.",
      "But rather than returning to the negotiating table, each side has repeatedly accused the other of violating the agreement\u2019s terms. Several of the weekly exchanges of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners have been dogged by last-minute accusations and near-cancellations.",
      "Hamas has stated before that it is willing to cede governance of the Gaza Strip to a Palestinian body, and Israel has made clear that any plan for Gaza\u2019s \u201cday after\u201d should not include Hamas, which led the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on southern Israel. On that day, about 1,200 people were killed and 250 were kidnapped, according to local officials, sparking Israel's 15-month war on Gaza that has killed at least 48,300 people, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, and destroyed much of the enclave.",
      "The thorniest question standing in the way of negotiating the second phase of an agreement remains whether Hamas will disarm. Netanyahu has declared Hamas\u2019 destruction as the primary goal of Israel\u2019s war in the Gaza Strip \u2014 sometimes, his critics have said, superseding the freedom and welfare of the Israeli hostages still being held there.",
      "Though he reiterated Hamas\u2019 offer to integrate into a Palestinian unity government, Basem Naim said the group would only disarm and transform into a purely political party if Palestinians are granted an independent political state \u2014 a condition that Netanyahu and his right-wing allies in government have repeatedly rejected.",
      "\u201cThese are two different tracks. The arms are related to the existence or the presence of the occupation,\u201d he said, referring to Israel's ongoing presence in Gaza, the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem.",
      "If an independent Palestinian state is created, Naim said, \u201cwe are ready again to become a political party and to integrate our fighters into a Palestinian national army.\u201d",
      "Israeli military leaders have repeatedly made clear that they are prepared to return to war if the agreement collapses, going so far as to call up reservists for renewed fighting.",
      "Though Hamas remains committed to the ceasefire agreement, Naim said, the group is also preparing for renewed fighting.",
      "\u201cIf they decide to escalate and to return back to war, we are preparing ourselves for all options,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have no choice other than to defend ourselves, as we have done already along the 15 months.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "TEL AVIV, Israel \u2014 An investigation by the Israeli military has determined that Hamas was able to carry out the deadliest attack in Israeli history on Oct. 7, 2023, because the much more powerful Israeli army misjudged the militant group\u2019s intentions and underestimated its capabilities.",
      "The findings, released Thursday, could pressure Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to launch a widely demanded broader inquiry to examine the political decision-making that preceded the attack, which triggered\u00a0the war in Gaza.",
      "Many Israelis believe the mistakes of Oct. 7 extend beyond the military, and they blame Netanyahu for what they view as a failed strategy of deterrence and containment in the years leading up to the attack. That strategy included allowing Qatar to send\u00a0suitcases of cash\u00a0into Gaza and sidelining Hamas\u2019 rival, the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority.",
      "The prime minister has not taken responsibility, saying he will answer tough questions only after the war, which has been paused for nearly six weeks by a tenuous ceasefire.\u00a0Despite public pressure, including from the families of the roughly 1,200 people killed in the Oct. 7 attack and the 251 taken as hostages into Gaza, Netanyahu has resisted calls for a commission of inquiry.",
      "The military\u2019s main findings were that the region\u2019s most powerful and sophisticated military misread Hamas\u2019 intentions, underestimated its capabilities and was wholly unprepared for the surprise attack by thousands of heavily armed militants in the early morning hours of a major Jewish holiday.",
      "The military\u2019s findings are\u00a0in line with past conclusions\u00a0reached by officials and analysts. The military released only a summary of the report and military officials outlined its findings.",
      "\u201cOct. 7 was a complete failure,\u201d said one military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.",
      "A central misconception was that Hamas, which seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority in 2007, was more interested in governing the territory than fighting Israel, the inquiry found.",
      "The military also misjudged the militant group\u2019s capabilities. Military planners had envisioned that, at worst, Hamas could stage a ground invasion from up to eight border points, the official said. In fact, Hamas had more than 60 attack routes.",
      "Intelligence assessed in the aftermath of the attack has shown Hamas came close to staging the offensive on three earlier occasions but delayed it for unknown reasons, the official said.",
      "The official said that in the hours before the attack, there were signs that something was amiss, including when Hamas fighters switched their phones over to the Israeli network.",
      "The perception that Hamas did not want war guided decision makers away from taking action that might have thwarted the attack. The Israeli military official said intelligence shows that\u00a0Yahya Sinwar, a mastermind of the Oct. 7 attack who was killed last October, had begun planning it as early as 2017.",
      "With the military off guard on a holiday weekend, Hamas launched a heavy wave of rockets that allowed thousands of fighters to burst through the security fence or fly over it on hang gliders. They knocked out surveillance cameras and quickly overwhelmed hundreds of soldiers stationed along the border.",
      "From there they advanced to key highway intersections and attacked troops dispatched to the area, including some senior officers, disrupting the military\u2019s command and control, according to a second military official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "For the first three hours after the attack, Hamas fighters marauded through border communities and a\u00a0music festival\u00a0with little resistance. That was when most of the 251 hostages were taken and most people were killed, the official said. The official said the chaos led to friendly fire incidents, although he said there were not many, without disclosing a figure.",
      "It took hours for the military to regain control and days until the area was fully cleared of militants.",
      "According to the first official, the report blamed the military for being overconfident in its knowledge and not showing enough doubt in its core concepts and beliefs. It did not place blame on any individual soldiers or officers, but is likely to pave the way for a reckoning in the military and eventual dismissals.",
      "Some high-ranking officers\u00a0have already resigned, including the former head of military intelligence and Israel\u2019s top general, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, who steps down next week."

      "A woman may have signed her name on the world's oldest dated runestone, researchers in Norway have found, as they piece together the 2,000-year-old puzzle.",
      "The inscription begins with the word \u201cI\u201d in runic script, followed by the name of the writer and a verb that indicates writing, before ending with the word \u201crune,\u201d researchers wrote earlier this month in the journal Antiquity after studying a fragment of the stone found at a grave site in Hole, a small municipality in southern Norway to the east of the capital, Oslo.",
      "\u201cBasically the text would be saying, I, the rune inscriber\u2019s name, wrote the runic inscription,\u201d one of the study\u2019s co-authors, Kristel Zilmer, told NBC News in telephone interview Monday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a type of inscription also that has parallels in some other romantic inscriptions, basically somebody telling us that they made this inscription,\u201d added Zilmer, a professor of runology at the University of Oslo\u2019s Museum of Cultural History.",
      "The researchers said they believed the Germanic alphabetic script was inspired by the Roman alphabet, of which runes formed the foundational blocks in the first A.D. centuries. It was widely used in Scandinavia up until the late Middle Ages.",
      "Runic inscriptions have been found on objects such as a bone knife and iron knife from Denmark and a comb, which archeologists have dated to around 150 A.D. Those found on other runestones date to around 700 A.D.",
      "Often they bore messages, including spells to bring back the dead and charm words.",
      "But very little is known about their development as it varied over time and deciphering them can be challenging without archaeological context.",
      "The latest research suggests the fragments, the first of which was discovered in 2021, were part of a single slab. The discovery also brings scientists one step closer to understanding the language\u2019s evolution and the use of such stones, the researchers said.",
      "Two years later, researchers found more fragments and the script on them appeared to continue across the fragments, indicating they were all part of a single stone.",
      "\u201cThey managed to find two extra pieces, and they fit perfectly within the middle part of one of the inscriptions, and gave us almost a complete inscription,\u201d Zilmer said.",
      "Due to the damage and the weathering of the stone, she added that determining the exact text, including the name of the inscriber, is a \u201cbit tricky,\u201d but what especially caught the attention of the researchers is a feature in the name that indicates it ended with a \u201c-u.\u201d",
      "In ancient runic script, she said that would indicate a possible woman\u2019s name which, if confirmed, \u201cwould be the earliest known record of a female rune-inscriber.\u201d",
      "Because the fragments found in Hole were buried along with cremated human remains, scientists had the crucial archeological context that allowed them to use radiocarbon dating to confirm the fragments dated between 50 B.C. and 275 A.D.",
      "\u201cWe may have here a series of events unfolding involving different people,\u201d Zilmer said. \u201cIt may be a stone that combines different purposes.\u201d",
      "While much of the research is still ongoing, \u201cwe are still missing significant portions, so there are evident gaps,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a puzzle with holes, but nonetheless it will be very interesting to see how far we can get, how many of these small fragments, some of these also inscribed, that might be able to connect to each other,\u201d she added."

      "L\u00e9v\u00eaque is set to testify at France\u2019s largest-ever child sex abuse trial, which opens Monday in Vannes, a picturesque town in coastal Brittany. Former surgeon Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec, 74, is charged with raping or sexually assaulting 299 victims over three decades, most of them girls and boys under 15 whose average age was 11.",
      "Many victims have said they don\u2019t remember being assaulted and experienced similar symptoms to L\u00e9v\u00eaque\u2019s, their lawyers said. Others suffered sexual dysfunction and fell into substance abuse. When police, taking names from Le Scouarnec\u2019s writings, sought them out and showed them the passages written about them, those revelations triggered physical and psychological reactions of varying degrees, the lawyers added. Two men, both 25, died by suicide in 2020 and 2021.",
      "The case, which includes a dark history of incest, has raised questions about how a well-respected surgeon who worked in nine hospitals and clinics across five regions in northwest France was allowed to practice when there were so many red flags that legal observers say should have signaled that Le Scouarnec was dangerous, including a 2005 conviction for possessing material depicting child sexual abuse.",
      "Le Scouarnec\u2019s lawyers declined to comment, but prosecutors said he has admitted to many, but not all, of the charges. Unlike in the United States, defendants in France are brought to trial even if they admit guilt.",
      "Victims\u2019 advocates hope the trial, set to last four months, will prompt a hard look at what they call a lax pursuit of child abuse allegations, particularly when doctors \u2014 who are in short supply in many areas \u2014 are accused of misconduct.",
      "\u201cThere were warnings over 30 years,\u201d said Francesca Satta, who is representing 10 victims and families. \u201cThis man benefited from a system that opened the door for him to have his own hunting ground.\u201d",
      "\u2018Pedophile fantasies\u2019",
      "Beyond the medical world, the lines have often blurred in France over what constitutes child abuse versus seduction.\u00a0The once-celebrated writer Gabriel Matzneff, now 88, made having sex with adolescents a staple of his books, even boasting about the practice in an infamous TV interview, until a leading literary publisher, Vanessa Springora, called him out in her own 2020 book for grooming her for sex in the 1980s when she was 14 and he was 50.",
      "It is illegal for an adult to have sex with a minor under the age of 15, though child advocates say many adults are never charged. Earlier this month, in a closely watched case seen as a test of evolving attitudes toward sex with minors, the director Christophe Ruggia was convicted of sexually assaulting actress Ad\u00e8le Haenel, now 35, from the time he cast her in a film when she was 12 and he was 36. He was sentenced to two years of house arrest, with two years suspended.",
      "\u201cL\u2019Affaire Scouarnec\u201d has drawn parallels with another high-profile trial that transfixed the country late last year and led to the conviction of Dominique Pelicot, 72, for organizing and documenting the mass rape of his sleeping wife, whom he drugged, by dozens of men over a decade. He is now under investigation for two other alleged crimes involving drugging: the rape and murder of a young woman in 1991 and the attempted rape of another in 1999.",
      "As in the Pelicot case, investigators discovered a trove of allegedly incriminating evidence on hard drives seized in the suspect\u2019s house, including thousands of photos depicting child sexual abuse and videos, many of them violent, French media reported.",
      "Le Scouarnec allegedly told investigators he was \u201cobsessed and tyrannized\u201d by his \u201cpedophile fantasies\u201d and began keeping a diary, according to court documents. Those digital files date to the early 1980s and include the names of patients and others, including young family members, along with their ages, addresses and a detailed account of what was done to them, the\u00a0documents show.",
      "The assaults tracked in the digital diaries stop in March 2017, when Le Scouarnec was arrested on charges of raping his 6-year-old neighbor after luring her across a gap in the mesh fence between their gardens, according to testimony. In December 2020, he was convicted in that case, along with the rape and sexual assault of two of his nieces when they were children in the 1980s and \u201990s, and a 4-year-old patient.",
      "Le Scouarnec faces a maximum of 20 years in prison, which would run concurrently with the 15 years he is now serving in connection with the 2020 conviction. With his pretrial detention and parole eligibility taken into account, he could be out by 2030, said lawyer Marie Grimaud.",
      "Grimaud, who is representing 37 victims, and other lawyers say the penalties for sex crimes and child abuse should be much more severe.",
      "\u201cIn France, if you rape one person, you rape 300, it\u2019s exactly the same number of years you\u2019re looking at,\u201d she said.",
      "Warning signs",
      "The first people who knew about Le Scouarnec\u2019s behavior were his family. As early as 1984, references to the rapes of a niece and a family friend appear in the surgeon\u2019s diaries, according to court documents. But none of the adults took action, even after the children told them, and the abuse continued, three family members told NBC News.",
      "\u201cThis is a man who sees children as sexual objects,\u201d Le Scouarnec\u2019s niece Alexandra, 47, told NBC News. She said her uncle isolated her and then raped her from ages 5 to 13. (NBC News does not name victims\u00a0of sexual assault, but Alexandra has asked that her first name be used.)",
      "She said she will testify at the upcoming trial, along with a family friend who was also one of the first victims mentioned in the diaries, though Le Scouarnec cannot be charged in their cases because the acts happened too long ago under French law.",
      "Some children knew Le Scouarnec\u2019s \u201cexam\u201d was not appropriate, but their parents brushed aside their complaints, said Hugo Lemonier, a journalist who spent three years researching a new book about the case, \u201cTrapped: In the Intimate Diaries of Dr. Le Scouarnec.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat we see in this case is the omnipotence of the medical profession,\u201d he said.",
      "French authorities were first alerted in January 2004, when the FBI told them Le Scouarnec\u2019s credit card was linked to a pedophile website the agency was monitoring, court records show. There is no indication that medical authorities were notified as the police carried out their investigation.",
      "At his trial for possession of child sexual abuse material in the fall of 2005, the surgeon was \u201calmost considered a victim,\u201d Lemonier said. Le Scouarnec presented himself as a man \u201cin a moment of great distress,\u201d recounting how his wife had left him, taking their three kids, and in his solitude he \u201cfound a refuge, an escape\u201d in viewing the material, he added.",
      "The surgeon, who specialized in appendectomies and abdominal and gynecological surgery, got a break when the judge imposed a four-month suspended sentence with no restrictions.",
      "\u201cThe judge could have ordered him to stop practicing or seek treatment, but he didn\u2019t,\u201d said Homayra Sellier, founder of the child protection agency Innocence in Danger. \u201cHe should have lost his medical license.\u201d",
      "Another opportunity was missed in June 2006, when a psychiatrist at the hospital where Le Scouarnec worked in Quimperl\u00e9, on the southern coast of Brittany, learned about his conviction and wrote a letter alerting the hospital director, who passed it along to the local medical board and ordered the surgeon to be accompanied whenever he was with minors, according to France Info.",
      "\u2018A nutcase in Brittany\u2019",
      "The local medical board requested a copy of the conviction, but it took the prosecutor\u2019s office five months to send it, which was then forwarded to state authorities, Lemonier said. \u201cAfter that, they washed their hands of it.\u201d",
      "Back at the hospital, the order requiring the surgeon to be shadowed was never carried out, and Le Scouarnec, whose modus operandi was to isolate victims under the guise of examining them, would go on to abuse at least 54 more victims from 2004 to 2017, all of whom are part of the current case, Lemonier said.",
      "Not all of the victims in the diaries have been pursued by investigators, he said, adding that according to his count the total could top 400.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a chain of failures where nobody wanted to take responsibility,\u201d Lemonier said. \u201cThe police, the courts, the medical association, the hospitals, the health authorities and the state are all responsible.\u201d",
      "The hospital director, Andr\u00e9 Labat, died in 2013. The current administration declined to comment when contacted by NBC News, as did all of the boards that could have imposed sanctions or revoked Le Scouarnec\u2019s medical license, including the local and regional medical boards and the regional health agency. The national Health Ministry did not respond to requests for comment. The local branch of the national police referred questions to the national police press office, which also did not respond.",
      "\u201cThe French authorities were warned that we had a nutcase in Brittany,\u201d said lawyer Maud Touitou, who represents eight victims. She called local oversight boards \u201cbarons\u201d that \u201crevel in their provincial social status, who have no other goal but to continue to have and exercise their little power.\u201d",
      "In June 2008, Le Scouarnec moved to a hospital in Jonzac, about five hours\u2019 drive south, where he was considered the \u201cwise man\u201d on staff, Le Monde reported. The hospital\u2019s former director, Mich\u00e8le Cals, told police in 2017 that she didn\u2019t take \u201cany special measures\u201d when the surgeon told her about his conviction because there had been \u201cno physical aggression,\u201d according to Radio France, which counted more than 20 victims at the Jonzac hospital. Cals could not be reached for comment, and the Jonzac hospital declined to comment.",
      "\u200b\u200bChildren\u2019s advocates are hoping the trial will prompt sweeping changes beyond tougher laws. They are hoping that the accounts of victims will be given greater credence.",
      "For the victims, who have waited nearly eight years since the investigation began to tell their stories \u2014 some have waited decades \u2014 the trial represents a chance to heal.",
      "\u201cThe only fear they have is that the entire trial will focus on Le Scouarnec,\u201d Grimaud said.",
      "\u201cThey want to be recognized.\u201d",
      "Linda Hervieux reported from Paris, and Gabrielle Nolin from London.",
      "If you are a child being abused, or know a child who may be facing abuse, call the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline at\u00a0(800) 422-4453, or go to\u00a0www.childhelphotline.org. States often have child abuse hotlines, but if you suspect a child\u2019s life is in imminent danger, call 911.",
      "If you or someone you know has been sexually assaulted, call the\u00a0National Sexual Assault Telephone Hotline\u00a0at\u00a01-800-656-4673.

The fiery rhetoric comes just as the U.S., Canada, and Mexico prepare to co-host the World Cup in 2026, with Trump\u2019s threat of tariffs on both nations looming.",
      "Since winning the presidential election in November, Trump has repeatedly stated that Canada should become America\u2019s 51st state, a thought that doesn\u2019t sit well with Canada\u2019s Wisconsin-born soccer coach Jesse Marsch.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d like to address the 51st state discourse, which I find unsettling and frankly insulting,\u201d said Marsch while speaking to the press in Los Angeles this week. \u201cIf I have one message to our president, it\u2019s lay off the ridiculous rhetoric about Canada being the 51st state.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs an American, I\u2019m ashamed of the arrogance and disregard that we\u2019ve shown one of our historically oldest, strongest and most loyal allies,\u201d said Marsch.",

      "\u201cCanada is a strong, independent nation that\u2019s deep-rooted in decency,\u201d said Marsch, who at one time was touted to take over the U.S. men\u2019s soccer team. \u201cIt\u2019s a place that values high ethics and respect, unlike the polarized, disrespectful and often now hate-fueled climate that\u2019s in the U.S.\u201d",

      "On Thursday morning, Trump blasted Canada and Mexico, writing on his Truth Social social media platform: \u201cDrugs are still pouring into our Country from Mexico and Canada at very high and unacceptable levels.\"",
      "While U.S. Customs officials intercepted 20,000 pounds of fentanyl at the Mexican border in 2024, only 43 pounds of fentanyl were intercepted at the Canadian border last year, according to an NBC News analysis of U.S. Customs and Border Protection data.",
      "Trump also said in his post that tariffs on Canada and Mexico would go into effect on Tuesday \"as scheduled.\"",
      "During his Cabinet meeting, Trump outlined the crippling effects his tariffs will have on Canada. \u201cThe tariffs will make it impossible for them to sell cars into the United States. The tariffs will make it impossible for them to sell lumber or anything else into the United States,\u201d he said.",
      "Since Trump\u2019s pugilistic tone toward Canada has taken shape, the tension between the longtime allies has boiled over into the world of sports.

      "\u201cThese international tournaments for Canada means something different now,\u201d acknowledged Marsch.",

      "An unscheduled China Southern Airlines flight left the Don Mueang airport in Bangkok at 4:48 a.m. local time (4:48 p.m. Wednesday ET) and landed six hours later in the city of Kashgar in Xinjiang, according to data from the tracker Flightradar24.",
      "Speaking to reporters earlier in the day before the deportation was reported by Chinese state media, Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra did not confirm whether anyone had been deported.",
      "\u201cThis sort of issue, for any country, one has to follow the law, international process and human rights,\u201d she told lawmakers, according to Reuters.",
      "Thailand was previously criticized in 2015 when it deported more than 100 members of the original Uyghur group to China. Most of the rest of the group was sent to Turkey, while 53 remained in Thailand.",
      "Five of those 53 have since died, including two children, according to United Nations human rights experts. They say almost half of the remaining 48 Uyghurs were suffering from serious health conditions, including diabetes, kidney dysfunction, and heart and lung conditions.",
      "The status of the eight Uyghur detainees who do not appear to have been deported to China on Thursday was not immediately clear.",
      "Rights activists have criticized the Uyghurs\u2019 condition in Thai detention, saying they were denied access to family members, lawyers and international organizations. In a letter to the Thai government last year, U.N. experts said its treatment of the Uyghur detainees could be a violation of international law.",
      "Amid concerns that their deportation to China was imminent, the U.N. had urged Thailand not to repatriate the Uyghur detainees, saying last month that they were \u201cat real risk of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment if they are returned.\u201d",
      "Rights groups say Uyghurs in China face discrimination and the suppression of their cultural identity. The U.S. and other Western governments have said that Beijing\u2019s policies on Uyghurs, including the forced detention of possibly a million or more people, amount to genocide.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a longtime critic of China\u2019s human rights record, said during his confirmation hearing last month that he would lobby Bangkok not to deport the Uyghur detainees, citing the strong U.S. relationship with Thailand.",
      "Members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said Monday that the United States had \u201cput practical options on the table\u201d aimed at protecting the Uyghur detainees\u2019 human rights.",
      "\u201cWe urge Thai leaders to engage with the United States on those proposals, rather than take this ill-advised step,\u201d they said in a statement.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration said it is eliminating more than 90% of the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration said it is eliminating more than 90% of the\u00a0U.S. Agency for International Development\u2019s\u00a0foreign aid contracts and $60 billion in overall U.S. assistance around the world, putting numbers on its plans to eliminate the majority of U.S. development and humanitarian help abroad.",
      "The cuts detailed by the administration would leave few surviving USAID projects for advocates to try to save in what are ongoing\u00a0court battles with the administration.",
      "The Trump administration outlined its plans in both an internal memo obtained by The Associated Press and filings in one of those federal lawsuits Wednesday.",
      "The Supreme Court intervened in that case late Wednesday and temporarily blocked a court order requiring the administration to release billions of dollars in foreign aid by midnight.",
      "Wednesday\u2019s disclosures also give an idea of the scale of the administration\u2019s retreat from U.S. aid and development assistance overseas, and from decades of U.S. policy that foreign aid helps U.S. interests by stabilizing other countries and economies and building alliances.",
      "The memo said officials were \u201cclearing significant waste stemming from decades of institutional drift.\u201d More changes are planned in how USAID and the State Department deliver foreign assistance, it said, \u201cto use taxpayer dollars wisely to advance American interests.\u201d",
      "President\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0and ally\u00a0Elon Musk\u00a0have hit foreign aid harder and faster than almost any other target in their push to cut the size of the federal government. Both men say USAID projects advance a liberal agenda and are a waste of money.",
      "Trump on Jan. 20 ordered what he said would be a 90-day program-by-program review of which foreign assistance programs deserved to continue, and cut off all foreign assistance funds almost overnight.",
      "The funding freeze has stopped thousands of U.S.-funded programs abroad, and the administration and Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency teams have pulled the majority of USAID staff off the job through forced leave and firings.",
      "Widely successful USAID programs credited with containing outbreaks of Ebola and other threats and saving more than 20 million lives in Africa through HIV and AIDS treatment are among those still cut off from agency funds, USAID officials and officials with partner organizations say. Meanwhile, formal notifications of program cancellations are rolling out.",
      "In the federal court filings Wednesday, nonprofits owed money on contracts with USAID describe both Trump political appointees and members of Musk\u2019s teams terminating USAID\u2019s contracts around the world at breakneck speed, without time for any meaningful review, they say.",
      "\u201c\u2018There are MANY more terminations coming, so please gear up!\u2019\u2019\u2019 a USAID official wrote staff Monday, in an email quoted by lawyers for the nonprofits in the filings.",
      "The nonprofits, among thousands of contractors, owed billions of dollars in payment since the freeze began, called the en masse contract terminations a maneuver to get around complying with the order to lift the funding freeze temporarily.",
      "So did a Democratic lawmaker.",
      "The administration was attempting to \u201cblow through Congress and the courts by announcing the completion of their sham \u2018review\u2019 of foreign aid and the immediate termination of thousands of aid programs all over the world,\u201d said Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.",
      "A coalition representing major U.S. and global businesses and nongovernmental organizations and former officials expressed shock at the move. \u201cThe American people deserve a transparent accounting of what will be lost \u2014 on counterterror, global health, food security, and competition,\u201d the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition said.",
      "The State Department said Secretary of State Marco Rubio had reviewed the terminations.",
      "In all, the Trump administration said it will eliminate 5,800 of 6,200 multiyear USAID contract awards, for a cut of $54 billion. Another 4,100 of 9,100 State Department grants were being eliminated, for a cut of $4.4 billion.",
      "The State Department memo, which was first reported by the Washington Free Beacon, described the administration as spurred by a federal court order that gave officials until the end of the day Wednesday to lift the Trump administration\u2019s monthlong block on foreign aid funding.",
      "\u201cIn response, State and USAID moved rapidly,\u201d targeting USAID and State Department foreign aid programs in vast numbers for contract terminations, the memo said.",
      "Trump administration officials \u2014 after repeated warnings from the federal judge in the case \u2014 also said Wednesday they were finally beginning to send out their first or any payments after more than a month with no known spending. Officials were processing a few million dollars of back payments, officials said, owed to U.S. and international organizations and companies.",
      "But U.S. District Judge Amir H. Ali\u2019s order to unfreeze billions of dollars by midnight Wednesday will remain on hold until the Supreme Court has a chance to weigh in more fully, according to the brief order signed by Chief Justice John Roberts.",
      "Ali had ordered the federal government to comply with his decision temporarily blocking a freeze on foreign aid, ruling in a lawsuit filed by nonprofit groups and businesses. An appellate panel refused the administration\u2019s request to intervene before the high court weighed in.",
      "The plaintiffs have until noon Friday to respond, Roberts said.",
      "The administration has filed an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court in one other case so far, arguing that a lower court was wrong to reinstate the head of a federal watchdog agency after Trump fired him."

      "VIENNA \u2014\u00a0Iran\u2019s stock of\u00a0uranium\u00a0close to weapons\u00a0grade has jumped since it announced\u00a0a\u00a0dramatic acceleration\u00a0in\u00a0enrichment in\u00a0December and there has been no progress on resolving outstanding issues, two reports by the U.N. nuclear watchdog said\u00a0Wednesday.",
      "The stock of\u00a0uranium\u00a0enriched to up to 60% fissile purity, close to the roughly 90% of bomb grade, has been a long-standing concern for Western powers, which say there is no civil justification for enriching\u00a0uranium\u00a0to such a high level.\u00a0Iran\u00a0says it seeks only peaceful nuclear energy.",
      "While President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has said it plans to pressure\u00a0Iran\u00a0over its nuclear program, the International Atomic Energy Agency has\u00a0said\u00a0time is running out for diplomacy to impose new restrictions on\u00a0Iran\u2019s activities.",
      "\u201cThe significantly increased production and accumulation of high enriched\u00a0uranium\u00a0by\u00a0Iran, the only non-nuclear weapon state to produce such nuclear material, is of serious concern,\u201d the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a passage that, unusually, was included in both its quarterly reports\u00a0on\u00a0Iran.",
      "Those confidential reports, sent to member states on Wednesday and both seen by Reuters, showed that while the stock of 60% material grew by half, there was no real progress on resolving long-running outstanding issues including the unexplained presence of\u00a0uranium\u00a0traces at undeclared sites.",
      "The stock of\u00a0uranium\u00a0refined to up to 60% in the form of\u00a0uranium\u00a0hexafluoride grew by 92.5 kg in the past quarter to 274.8 kg, one of two confidential IAEA reports said.",
      "That is enough in principle, if enriched further, for six nuclear bombs, according to an IAEA yardstick. There is enough for more weapons at lower enrichment levels.",
      "Where before its latest acceleration\u00a0Iran\u00a0was producing between 6 and 9 kilograms (13 and 20 pounds) of\u00a0uranium\u00a0enriched to up to 60% per month, now that figure is between 35 and 40 kg, a senior diplomat said. This is just short of the 42 kg that is enough in principle for one bomb, if refined further.",
      "One of the reports spelled out the lack of progress on the outstanding issues such as explaining the\u00a0uranium\u00a0traces, which the IAEA has been asking the Islamic Republic to do for years.",
      "\u201cIran\u00a0states that it has declared all of the nuclear material, activities and locations required under its Safeguards Agreement. This is inconsistent with the Agency\u2019s assessments,\u201d it\u00a0said.",
      "\u201cThe Agency is, therefore, at an impasse with regard to resolving these outstanding safeguards issues.\u201d",
      "During his first term as president, Trump withdrew the United States from a landmark deal between\u00a0Iran\u00a0and major powers that placed strict limits on Tehran\u2019s nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. After Trump pulled out in 2018,\u00a0Iran\u00a0breached and far surpassed those limits.",
      "With the deal now largely in tatters, European powers are seeking to either have the U.S. help agree to new limits on\u00a0Iran\u2019s nuclear program or use a mechanism in the deal to reimpose all sanctions before the deal expires in October."

      "MAE SOT, Thailand \u2014 A new crackdown on online scam centers has led to over 7,000 people from around the world being held in a Myanmar border town awaiting repatriation, and those helping them say the unprecedented number is straining the resources of Thailand just across the border and leading to delays.",
      "The crackdown coordinated among Thailand, Myanmar and China follows Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra\u2019s visit to Beijing this month, where she told Chinese leader Xi Jinping that Thailand would act against the scam networks that have drawn in hundreds of thousands of people.",
      "They are often lured under false pretenses to work in scam centers in Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos, where they financially exploit people around the world through false romances, bogus investment pitches and illegal gambling schemes.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 A small group of foreign tourists has visited North Korea in the past week, making them the first international travelers to enter the country in five years except for a group of Russian tourists who went to the North last year.",
      "The latest trip indicates North Korea may be gearing up for a full resumption of its international tourism to bring in much-needed foreign currency to revive its struggling economy, experts say.",
      "The Beijing-based travel company Koryo Tours said it arranged a five-day trip from Feb. 20 to Feb. 24 for 13 international tourists to the northeastern North Korean border city of Rason, where the country\u2019s special economic zone is located.",
      "Koryo Tours General Manager Simon Cockerell said the travelers from Britain, Canada, Greece, New Zealand, France, Germany, Austria, Australia and Italy crossed by land from China. He said that in Rason, they visited factories, shops, schools and the statues of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, the late grandfather and father of current leader Kim Jong Un.",
      "\u201cSince January of 2020, the country has been closed to all international tourists, and we are glad to have finally found an opening in the Rason area, in the far north of North Korea,\u201d Cockerell said.",
      "\u201cOur first tour has been and gone, and now more tourists on both group and private visits are going in, arranging trips,\u201d he added.",
      "After the pandemic began, North Korea quickly banned tourists, jetted out diplomats and severely curtailed border traffic in one of the world\u2019s most draconian Covid-19 restrictions. But since 2022, North Korea has been slowly easing curbs and reopening its borders.",
      "In February 2024, North Korea accepted about 100 Russian tourists, the first foreign nationals to visit the country for sightseeing. That surprised many observers, who thought the first post-pandemic tourists would come from China, North Korea\u2019s biggest trading partner and major ally.",
      "A total of about 880 Russian tourists visited North Korea throughout 2024, South Korea\u2019s Unification Ministry said, citing official Russian data. Chinese group tours to North Korea remain stalled.",
      "This signals how much North Korea and Russia have moved closer to each other as the North has supplied weapons and troops to Russia to support its war against Ukraine. Ties between North Korea and China cooled as China showed its reluctance to join a three-way, anti-U.S. alliance with North Korea and Russia, experts say.",
      "Before the pandemic, tourism was an easy, legitimate source for foreign currency for North Korea, one of the world\u2019s most sanctioned countries because of its nuclear program.",
      "North Korea is expected to open a massive tourism site on the east coast in June. In January, when President Donald Trump boasted about his ties with Kim Jong Un, he said that \u201cI think he has tremendous condo capabilities. He\u2019s got a lot of shoreline.\u201d That likely refers to the eastern coast site.",
      "A return of Chinese tourists would be key to making North Korea\u2019s tourism industry lucrative because they represented more than 90% of total international tourists before the pandemic, said Lee Sangkeun, an expert at the Institute for National Security Strategy, a think tank run by South Korea\u2019s intelligence agency. He said that in the past, up to 300,000 Chinese tourists visited North Korea annually.",
      "\u201cNorth Korea has been heavily investing on tourism sites, but there have been not much domestic demand,\u201d Lee said. \u201cWe can assess that North Korea now wants to resume international tourism to bring in many tourists from abroad.\u201d",
      "The restrictions that North Korea has typically imposed on foreign travelers \u2014 such as requirements that they move with local guides and the banning of photography at sensitive places \u2014 are likely to hurt its efforts to develop tourism. Lee said that Rason, the eastern coast site and Pyongyang would be the places where North Korea feels it can easily monitor and control foreign tourists."
