    "story": [
      "The TV drama \"Heated Rivalry\" has become a global sensation, captivating audiences with its portrayal of a secret gay relationship between Canadian and Russian hockey players",
      "LONDON -- If you haven\u2019t heard of gay ice hockey TV drama \u201cHeated Rivalry\u201d and its two lead stars Hudson Williams and Connor Storrie yet ... then get your skates on.",
      "What started as a word-of-mouth hit in the U.S. and Canada in December 2025 has spread to become a global phenomenon. Its stars have rocketed from unknowns to cultural icons in the space of weeks, appearing on stage at the Golden Globes, sashaying down the Milan catwalks to, this week, carrying the torch for the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics.",
      "Based on the 2019 novel by Rachel Reid, the story traces the decade-long secret relationship between Canadian Shane Hollander (Williams) and Russian Ilya Rozanov (Storrie), mixing slow-building yearning with explicit sexual scenes.",
      "And as it launches across Europe, it\u2019s proving a surprise hit in Russia, even though homosexuality is illegal there and the show will never get an official release.",
      "Journalist and author Mikhail Zygar was born in what was then the Soviet Union, like Rozanov, and spent his childhood as a closeted gay man in Russia. He said coming out was completely impossible and he thinks the show is inspiring, not just amongst the LGBTQ+ community, but all Russians, as \u201can attempt to normalize the discourse.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt shows that it is OK. That people can fall in love and it\u2019s so beautiful. And the popularity of this TV show definitely may change some perception from the broader audience,\u201d he said.",
      "Western sanctions on official streaming platforms mean it\u2019s hard for Russians to watch Western TV, but they find ways on illegal platforms and, despite the anti-gay laws that would potentially mean punishment for those who share the content, they are voting with their keyboards.",
      "On the Russian streaming and film database platform Kinopoisk (similar to IMDb or Rotten Tomatoes in the U.S.) \u201cHeated Rivalry\u201d has an 8.6 rating, the highest TV show ranking of all time according to Russian viewers, overtaking shows like \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d and \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d",
      "But official acceptance of shows like \u201cHeated Rivalry\u201d seems a long way off.",
      "The LGBTQ+ community in Russia has been under legal and public pressure for over a decade, but especially since the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin has argued that the war is a proxy battle with the West, which he says aims to destroy Russia and its \u201ctraditional family values\u201d by pushing for LGBTQ+ rights.",
      "Any depiction of gay and transgender people that paints them in a positive or even neutral light is banned. Gender-affirming medical care and changing one\u2019s gender in official documents are prohibited. With the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in November 202, that outlawed what the government called \u201cthe international LGBT movement\u201d as extremist, anyone involved with the LGBTQ+ community could be imprisoned for up to six years.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to believe in some kind of happy ending, as we see in the show, in Russia\u2019s reality today,\u201d Zygar says.",

      "\u201cRussia continues its brutal, aggressive war against Ukraine. There is no perspective of the end of this war. There is no perspective for a lot of LGBTQ+ people who live in Russia and a lot of people, a lot them have the only possibility to leave the country.\u201d",
      "The head of the Sorok Sorokov center in Moscow, a conservative organization aligned with the Russian Orthodox Church, told The Associated Press that he was shocked by the gay sexual content of the show.",
      "\u201cI found out that these scenes are presented almost in every episode and I was horrified why and how this video ended up on our Russian (streaming) platforms,\u201d Georgy Soldatov said.",
      "He said he had lodged a petition with the Prosecutor\u2019s General Office against those who posted the content, which he described as \u201cthe propaganda of untraditional sexual relationship,\u201d a classification that forces print, TV and movie censorship of LGBTQ+ storylines.",
      "In one example, two Russian streaming services cut a transgender character from the 1990s drama series \u201cTwin Peaks.\u201d In another, a streaming service cut several scenes from the drama series \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d that depicted to a gay character. Instances of dialogue that has been redubbed to remove references to LGBTQ+ relations or people have been regularly reported by the Russian media.",
      "Last year, Russian authorities launched a criminal probe against the managers of a Moscow publishing house on extremism charges over books depicting LGBTQ+ relations. They raided the homes of a number of staff and detained them. Most of detainees were released, but three people were put under house arrest in a case that reportedly sent shockwaves throughout the book industry.",
      "In contrast, in the U.S., LGBTQ+ romance sales have surged. According to Brenna Conner, analyst for Circana (which tracks 85% of print retail sales in the US), \u201cIn the five weeks ending Jan. 10, 2026, LGBTQ+ romance sales surged more than 100% in unit sales compared to the same period the previous year, with \u2019Heated Rivalry' leading the growth.\u201d",
      "Ultimately Zygar sees the popularity of \u201cHeated Rivalry\u201d in Russia as a sign of resistance and moral support for the LGBTQ+ community. He says its important that people watch it despite the obstacles.",
      "\u201cIt shows us that they\u2019re trying to remain normal, they\u2019re trying to remain resistant to the attempt of Putin\u2019s regime to brainwash them. They are not brainwashed; they are not ready to agree with the propaganda and with official anti-LGBT mantras. They live their life, and they watch what they want to watch.\u201d",

      "PARK CITY, Utah -- PARK CITY, Utah (AP) \u2014 Antoine Fuqua always knew Nelson Mandela as an icon. But he had no idea he was such a rebel too, and a literal fighter. He remembered walking into a restaurant and seeing a picture of a man in a boxing stance and asked why they had a poster of Muhammad Ali on the wall. They didn\u2019t, he was told: It was Mandela.",
      "It was just part of what would be an enlightening journey in making the new documentary, \u201cTroublemaker,\u201d which has its world premiere Tuesday at the Sundance Film Festival.",
      "\u201cHe evolved into the Mandela that we all know and love,\u201d Fuqua said. \u201cThe troublemaker allows you to sort of see him not just a mythical character or as a global icon, but as a fallible human being, someone who became a great leader, who in the beginning was a rebel, if you will, and who was willing to engage in violence at some point, if necessary, for the greater good.\u201d",
      "The film uses Mandela\u2019s own voice, drawn from over 70 hours of recordings to tell the story of the struggle against apartheid. Fuqua collaborated closely with Mac Maharaj, an anti-apartheid activist, who was imprisoned on Robben Island with Mandela and who played a key part in smuggling Mandela\u2019s writings, which would become \u201cLong Walk to Freedom,\u201d out of the prison",
      "Fuqua, Maharaj and the filmmaking team traveled all around South Africa, visiting important locations in Mandela\u2019s story, from the University of Fort Hare, where Mandela was a student before being expelled for protest activities, and Robben Island, where he was imprisoned from 1964 to 1982, to Qunu, his final resting place.",
      "He even slept a few nights on Robben Island, which he said was \u201cvery uncomfortable.\u201d While there they got a feeling for where Mandela spent 18 of his 27 imprisoned years and bonded at night over dinners. That\u2019s where Maharaj told him Mandela was a Tracy Chapman fan.",
      "They met many people along the way, including some who were part of the resistance against apartheid, taking to heart their continued optimism and hope despite past and present grievances and racism.",
      "\u201cOne gentleman came in and he had no arm, his eye was missing. He looked like a character out of James Bond. He had a Tommy Bahama shirt on, he had the hat on,\u201d Fuqua said. \u201cAnd he was so full of life and so funny and so matter of fact about what happened to him, fighting for justice. I started to learn so much more about the people there.\u201d",

      "Fuqua hopes the lessons audiences take are on a global scale.",
      "\u201cThe lesson I learned was meaningful change is never easy or comfortable,\u201d Fuqua said. \u201cThe people in the moment were willing to do what\u2019s necessary, the difficult job to make change.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cI hope people take the lessons of great leaders like Mandela and Mac Maharaj \u2026 People who stood up for the right reasons.\u201d",

      "Jay Duplass has shifted from personal stories to telling others' tales",
      "PARK CITY, Utah -- PARK CITY, Utah (AP) \u2014 Jay Duplass had come to a turning point in his life and career. After years of mining personal stories, add those of his family, he\u2019d decided that he was ready to tell other people\u2019s stories.",

Gordon approached him with a special project that fit the bill, Adam Cayton-Holland\u2019s tragicomic script, and memoir, about his PTSD after his sister dies by suicide. It had Duplass both laughing and crying and wanting to help tell the story.",
      "\u201cYou really have to be like irrationally in love with the movie that you\u2019re making,\u201d Duplass said. \u201cWe\u2019re really standing on the shoulders of the Cayton-Holland family in Denver who got hit with something surprising and unbelievable. It\u2019s the story not only of how they survived it but came through better people.\u201d",
      "The film, \u201cSee You When I See You,\u201d is having its world premiere Tuesday at the Sundance Film Festival where it is seeking distribution. It stars Cooper Raiff, Kaitlyn Dever, David Duchovny, Hope Davis and Lucy Boynton.",
      "\u201cI kind of see it an heir to their film \u2018The Big Sick,\u2019\u201d Duplass said, of Nanjiani and Gordon's Oscar-nominated romantic comedy.",
      "Putting Raiff in the lead role over a more established movie star was an unconventional choice, to say the least, but Duplass was certain it was the right one. He\u2019s been Raiff\u2019s de facto mentor since before Raiff made his first feature. He saw in him a range that he hadn't quite observed in some of his peers.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s just so talented and smart and funny and emotionally available,\u201d Duplass said. \u201cFrankly there aren\u2019t a lot of 27-year-olds who are all those things.\u201d (Raiff is now 28).",

      "Geoffrey Mason, who had a five-decade career in sports television and was best known as the coordinating producer for ABC\u2019s coverage of the 1972 Munich Olympic Games hostage crisis, has died. He was 85.",
      "ESPN said Mason died Sunday in Naples, Florida. He died of natural causes, according to his family.",
      "\u201cGeoff was a giant visionary in television, never seeking credit. He preferred leading and mentoring teams, connecting people to projects, and was devoted to people and recovery of all sorts. He was a great teacher and mentor to everyone who came in his orbit,\u201d former ESPN President Steve Bornstein said.",
      "Over the course of his career, Mason worked on eight Olympics. As a young producer on Sept. 5, 1972, he was in the control room in Munich, Germany, when the Palestinian militant group Black September stormed the Olympic village and took Israeli Olympic team members hostage.",
      "ABC provided continuous coverage for 22 hours, culminating in a failed rescue attempt where six Israeli coaches and five athletes died. Jim McKay broke the news with, \u201cThey\u2019re all gone.\u201d",
      "Mason was a consultant on the script and every aspect of production for the 2024 feature film \u201cSeptember 5,\u201d which recreates what it was like in the ABC control room that day. The international broadcast center in Munich was 100 yards away from where the hostage crisis was taking place in the Olympic village.",
      "The movie recreates the moment when West German police stormed the control room and pointed guns at Mason\u2019s face. This happened because one of ABC\u2019s cameras was showing a tactical squad taking position on the roof above the hostages. Mason ended up cutting off the camera\u2019s feed.",
      "It is estimated that nearly 900 million people worldwide at some point viewed ABC\u2019s coverage.",
      "\u201cGeoff told me that day there was no chance to think. Their singular goal was to stay on the air to keep the story going, to do their job as sports broadcasters,\u201d said John Magaro, who played Mason, in 2025. \u201cOnce the clock starts ticking, there\u2019s no chance to think.\u201d",
      "Mason\u2019s career was largely spent with ABC and ESPN, but he also worked for NBC, Fox, NFL Network, and other television entities. He began as a production associate at ABC Sports in 1967, working on \u201cWide World of Sports\u201d and the 1968 Winter and Summer Olympics. Over the years, he earned 24 Emmy Awards and was inducted into the Sports Broadcasting Hall of Fame in 2010.",
      "He also worked on Super Bowl 25, \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d, the World Series, horse racing\u2019s Triple Crown, the Indianapolis 500, and the FIFA Men\u2019s and Women\u2019s World Cup tournaments.",

Then, in 2024, it hit a crescendo with her sixth studio album, \u201cBrat,\u201d which became a pop culture phenomenon. Finally, she said, she felt understood for a moment. And then, just as quickly, it changed.",

      "Hollywood had its quietest weekend of the year at the box office.",
      "NEW YORK -- With a winter storm blanketing a large swath of the country, Hollywood had its quietest weekend of the year at the box office. The Amazon MGM sci-fi thriller \u201cMercy\u201d dethroned \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d from the No. 1 spot with $11.2 million in North America, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "Some 250 theaters were forced to close, from Texas to Maine, according to data firm Comsore. More than 140 million Americans were under winter storm warnings, depressing moviegoing.",
      "But the weekend was never going to be a blockbuster one, anyway. \u201cMercy,\u201d a $60 million thriller starring Chris Pratt as a man in a near-future standing trial before an AI judge, was the top new release. It arrived with withering reviews (20% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and an equally poor reception (a \u201cB-\u201d CinemaScore) from audiences.",
      "That was still enough to finally dislodge James Cameron's third Pandora epic from its monthlong perch atop the box office. \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d slid to second place with $7 million. While The Walt Disney Co. release is starting to peter out domestically, it remains a top draw overseas. It took in $28.1 million internationally in its sixth weekend.",
      "\u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d isn't going to come close to the box-office heights of the previous two \u201cAvatar\u201d movies. The 2009 original grossed $2.9 billion and the 2022 sequel, \u201cThe Way of Water,\u201d tapped out at $2.3 billion. \u201cFire and Ash\u201d has now cleared $1 billion internationally, but its domestic haul ($378.5 million) is well off the pace of the other two films.",
      "The \u201cOscar bump\u201d that films once saw following nomination is largely a thing of the past. The lead movies in Thursday's nominations \u2014 \u201cSinners\u201d and \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d \u2014 long ago completed their theatrical runs. But a handful of nominees saw strong business.",
      "Chlo\u00e9 Zhao's \u201cHamnet,\u201d nominated for eight Oscars including best picture, collected $2 million in its first weekend of wide release. The Shakespeare drama, starring Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal, has been in theaters for two months, steadily increasing its theatrical footprint. It's up to $17.6 million domestically and $42.1 million worldwide.",
      "Josh Safdie's \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d nominated for nine Oscars, earned $3.5 million in its sixth weekend of release. The A24 title, starring Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, this week cross $100 million globally. It's made $86.2 million domestically thus far.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just a resistance to change,\u201d said Suzie Taylor, an actor who has been coming to Sundance on and off since 1997. \"Robert Redford's vision was rooted here. And isn\u2019t it poetic that he passed right before the last one?\u201d",

      "Redford, who died in September at age 89, established the festival and development programs for filmmakers in the Utah mountains as a haven for independent storytelling far from the pressures of Hollywood.

      "Boulder emerged victorious from a yearlong search in which numerous U.S. cities vied to host the nation\u2019s premier independent film festival.

      "Some film professionals and volunteers said they were willing to give Boulder a try but worried Sundance could lose its identity outside its longtime home.",
      "Lauren Garcia, who has come from Seattle to volunteer at Sundance for the past six years, said curiosity may lead her to Boulder for future festivals. She described feeling a sadness lingering over the final Utah festival and wondered if Redford's death means it's time for Sundance to close this chapter.",

      "Honnold, known for his ropeless ascent up Yosemite National Park\u2019s El Capitan, climbed up one corner of Taipei 101 using small L-shaped outcroppings as footholds.

    "story": [
      "King Charles III has teamed up with Amazon Prime to make a film about his vision for saving the planet, 16 years after he wrote a book on the subject",
      "LONDON -- Can it be that, like many baby boomers, King Charles III feels misunderstood?",
      "That might sound like a strange question for a man with his own public relations team and easy access to any journalist in the realm. But 16 years after he wrote a book explaining his vision for saving the planet, the king has teamed up with Amazon Prime to make a film spelling out that philosophy.",
      "The documentary delves into Charles\u2019 concept of \u201charmony,\u201d the idea that restoring the balance between the human and natural worlds is crucial to combatting global warming and many other major problems facing humanity.",
      "Along the way, the king also confronts his critics, who have lampooned him as a dilettante flitting aimlessly from one cause to another with no rhyme or reason. Charles believes that climate change, urban planning, sustainable agriculture, traditional crafts and fostering understanding between religions \u2014 causes to which he has devoted much of his adult life \u2014 are inter-related issues that must be dealt with to create more liveable communities.",
      "\u201cI think we need to follow harmony if we are going to ensure that this planet can support so many,\u2019\u2019 he said in a trailer for the film. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely there\u2019s anywhere else.\u2019\u2019",
      "To help explain these ideas, experts including Tony Juniper, the former head of Friends of the Earth in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and Emily Shuckburgh, a University of Cambridge climate scientist, appear with Charles in \u201cFinding Harmony: A King\u2019s Vision,\u201d available on Amazon from Feb. 6. The narrator is Kate Winslet.",
      "The king wants people to recognize that humans are as much a part of the natural world as the birds and the trees, something that can be obscured as we rush to work in air-conditioned offices, then drive to the supermarket to buy food wrapped in plastic, Juniper told The Associated Press.",
      "The \u201ccycles and loops\u201d of nature are still what govern human society, Juniper said, and reconnecting with that is critical as we confront global warming, soil erosion, ocean plastics and the chemicals building up in our food chains.",
      "\u201cAll of that is reversible, all of that fixable,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to require more of us to understand that we are not outside nature, we are in it.\u201d",
      "Juniper believes Charles is uniquely qualified to deliver this message because he has been campaigning on these issues for decades and continues to do so even as other world leaders shun environmental protection.",
      "\u201cIf there\u2019s one person in the world who is literally a globally recognized figure, who has authenticity derived from an incredible track record on these subjects, it is King Charles III,\u201d Juniper said.",
      "Charles addressed the idea of restoring balance in the natural world in his 2010 book \u201cHarmony: A New Way of Looking at Our World,\u201d written with Juniper and Ian Skelly, a former BBC presenter.",
      "So why return to the subject now?",
      "Part of it may be the hope of reaching a new audience through a streaming service with global reach. Prince William, Charles\u2019 heir, ventured into the same space last year when he revealed his plans for the monarchy on comedian Eugene Levy\u2019s Apple TV show \u201cThe Reluctant Traveler.\u201d",
      "But the king also wants to shift the focus back to an issue he hopes will define his legacy after two years in which the media, and the public, were distracted by other matters, said Ed Owens, author of \u201cAfter Elizabeth: Can the Monarchy Save Itself?\u201d",
      "First there was Charles\u2019 cancer diagnosis, which forced him to step away from public duties for several months in early 2024 and raised nagging questions about his health. Then there were the continuing tensions with his younger son, Prince Harry, and the scandal surrounding his brother Andrew\u2019s links to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",

      "Dr. Sarah Crockett, who specializes in emergency and wilderness medicine, doesn\u2019t explicitly tell her patients at New Hampshire\u2019s Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center to swallow snow, but she often prescribes more time outside. If that time includes eating a handful of ice crystals straight or adding ingredients to make snow cones and other frozen treats, she\u2019s all for it.",
      "\u201cTo stop and just be present and want to catch a snowflake on your tongue, or scoop up some fresh, white, untouched snow that\u2019s collected during something as exciting as a snowstorm, I think that there\u2019s space in our world to enjoy that,\u201d Crockett said. \u201cAnd while we need to make good choices, I think these are simple things that can bring joy.\u201d",
      "Getting outdoors to enjoy simple pleasures is unlikely to be front of mind for people in a 1,300-mile (2,100-kilometer) stretch of the United States where a massive weekend storm brought deep snow and bitter cold. Freezing rain and ice brought down power lines and tree limbs, leaving hundreds of thousands of homes without power or heating in the South, while snow upended road and air travel from Arkansas to New England.",
      "As the storm recedes, residents of lesser-affected areas might be tempted to whip up bowls of \u201csnow cream\u201d \u2014 snow combined with milk, sugar and vanilla \u2014 after seeing techniques demonstrated on TikTok. Others might want to try \u201csugar on snow,\u201d a taffy-like confection made by pouring hot maple syrup onto a plate of snow.",
      "Despite its pristine appearance, snow isn\u2019t always clean enough to consume. Crockett and other experts shared advice for digging in safely while digging out.",
      "Whether it's rain or snow, precipitation cleans the atmosphere, picking up pollutants as it falls, said Steven Fassnacht, a professor of snow hydrology at Colorado State University. But snowflakes pick up more impurities because they fall more slowly and have more exposed surface areas than raindrops, he said.",
      "That means snow that falls near coal plants or factories that emit particulates into the air contains more contaminants, said Fassnacht, who was in Shinjo, Japan, last week studying the salt content of snow. He said he wouldn\u2019t have hesitated to take a taste there because there weren\u2019t any big industrial complexes upwind.",
      "\u201cSnow can be eaten, but you want to think about the trajectory. Where did that snow come from?\u201d he said.",
      "Timing is another consideration, according to Crockett. The first wave of snow holds the most particulate matter, she said, so waiting until a storm is well underway before putting out a bowl to collect falling snow is one precaution to take.",
      "Ground contamination is an additional factor, experts say. Avoiding yellow snow, which may be tainted by urine or tree bark, is conventional wisdom, but it\u2019s also a good idea to stay away from any snow pushed by snowplows and packed with road salt, deicing chemicals and debris.",
      "What about eating snow to survive? Crockett, who oversees the wilderness medicine program at Dartmouth College\u2019s Geisel School of Medicine, says that\u2019s a bad idea.",

      "Fassnacht, who has studied snow for more than 30 years, said he tried \u201csnow cream\u201d for the first time last year when some students made him some. He described it as a fun experience that got him thinking about flavors and textures, not contaminants.",

      "The rural towns of Hopetoun and Walpeup in Victoria state registered preliminary highs of 48.9 C (120 F), which if confirmed overnight would top records set on the day in 2009 when 173 people were killed in the state\u2019s devastating Black Saturday bushfires.",
      "No casualties were reported from Tuesday\u2019s heat wave, but Victoria authorities urged caution as three forest fires burned out of control.",
      "Melbourne, the state\u2019s largest city, also came close to its hottest day. Nowhere perhaps was the searing heat more evident than at Melbourne Park, where the usual crowds thronging outside the Australian Open tennis tournament dwindled to a ghost town as temperatures soared.",
      "Inside, organizers enacted extreme heat protocols, forcing closure of the retractable roofs over the main arenas and postponement of matches on the uncovered outer courts. During Tuesday\u2019s quarterfinal between Aryna Sabalenka and Iva Jovic \u2014 the last match played under scorching sun \u2014 the players held ice packs to their heads and portable fans to their faces during breaks in play.",

      "Senegal\u2019s first aquagym program has drawn praise from health professionals for helping people with reduced mobility caused by noncommunicable diseases",
      "DAKAR, Senegal -- The sun has not yet risen in Senegal's capital, Dakar, but about 100 people in swimsuits and life jackets already crowd a section of beach, ready for aquagym class.",
      "In the chilly Atlantic, 63-year-old Aminata Sall is soon kicking in rhythm with others, foam noodles tucked under her arms. On the beach, people with limited mobility are buried knee-deep in the sand and gently rotate their torsos in a therapy session meant to ease pain.",
      "Sall's doctor once warned her she could lose the ability to walk within five years because of rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disease that causes pain, stiffness and swelling in the lining of joints and can cause severe damage if left untreated.",
      "\u201cThe shock was enormous,\u201d she said. \u201cI stayed at home for almost a year, doing nothing.\u201d Then one morning she wandered down to a beach in Dakar's Ngor neighborhood and saw people exercising in the water.",
      "\u201cI asked what they were doing, and they told me to try,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m still walking.\u201d",
      "Senegal's first aquagym program with its low-impact exercises has drawn praise from health professionals for helping people with reduced mobility caused by chronic illnesses such as heart disease, stroke and arthritis.",
      "As life expectancy rises sharply across Africa, these diseases have become more common, often leaving older adults with pain and limited mobility. But prevention, diagnosis and rehabilitation services have not kept pace on a largely youthful continent whose public health systems prioritize infectious diseases, maternal care and children.",
      "Many older people have little access to geriatricians or other doctors and tend to forego diagnostics or treatment to cut costs.",
      "The aquagym emerged little over a decade ago as a rare, low-cost option to relieve pain and improve mobility.",
      "After Sall was diagnosed with her autoimmune condition, she said her doctor told her she would need surgery at a cost of about $10,000, which she could not afford. She was prescribed an anti-inflammatory drug, but it was later taken off the market due to complications.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s when I started losing hope,\u201d she said. \u201cSome mornings, a blocked vertebra or swollen ankles would leave me unable to move all day.\u201d",
      "In Senegal, most medical care is paid out of pocket. Public insurance coverage is limited, and private plans remain unaffordable for many. Costly procedures like surgery are often not covered.",
      "\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t come to us until things get really bad, and by then it\u2019s much harder and more expensive to treat them,\u201d said Dr. Seydina Ousmane Ba, director of the National Orthopedic Prosthetics and Rehabilitation Center in Dakar.",
      "Khadija Wade, 76, has spinal stenosis, a degenerative condition that can compress and irritate the nerves in the spinal cord. She was diagnosed three years ago and her condition worsened after her husband died earlier this year.",
      "\u201cI became very sedentary. I could spend an entire month at home without walking,\u201d Wade said.",
      "Many suggested she see a specialist in Italy or France, but visas are hard to obtain for many Senegalese and treatment abroad is costly.",

      "People with reduced mobility in West Africa face especially steep hurdles, said Cl\u00e9ment Philit, director of Handicap International in Senegal. Public spaces and transport are often inaccessible, and specialized health care and rehab services are scarce, he said.",
      "\u201cAquagym has benefits you don\u2019t always get on land,\u201d Ba said. \u201cThe water supports your body, reduces pain and makes movement easier, so patients can exercise more comfortably.\u201d",
      "The program\u2019s founder and head coach, 69-year-old Ndiam\u00e9 Samb, previously worked as a firefighter specializing in underwater operations before becoming a lifeguard in 1988, teaching swimming to older people.",
      "Samb is a member of the Lebu, considered the Indigenous people of Dakar\u2019s peninsula, who have maintained strong cultural and spiritual ties to the ocean.",
      "While training in Paris, Samb discovered aquagym and its benefits. His classes in Dakar are among the few in the world that are held in the sea rather than a pool. Public pools remain rare, and the sea is free.",
      "\u201cAt first it was just eight or 10 people coming to the class,\u201d Samb said. \u201cBut now, we sometimes get up to 200 people per session and have a total of around 600 students.\u201d",
      "The low-cost aquagym classes \u2014 300 CFA francs ($0.50) per session \u2014 are led by volunteer coaches. The fees are used to keep the center running and buy equipment, along with a $3,000 subsidy the city granted this year.",

      "Shoveling snow is heavy, hard work \u2014 research has shown that doing it for even a short time can make the heart work as hard as it does during a major workout. Adding to that stress, the cold temperatures cause blood vessels, including those feeding the heart, to constrict. That raises blood pressure which in turn increases the risk of a heart attack, stroke or cardiac arrest, according to the American Heart Association.",
      "Snow shoveling is especially risky for anyone with known heart disease or who\u2019s already survived a heart attack, as well as older adults and people with risk factors including high blood pressure or cholesterol. People who think they\u2019re healthy can get in trouble, too, with that combination of heavy exertion in cold weather \u2013 especially if they\u2019re generally sedentary until a snowstorm comes along.",

By fulltime, the gap had stretched to 5-0.",
      "Yet for Lishoeshoe winger Nteboheleng Leticia Sooane, the result felt beside the point.",
      "For the 16-year-old, the tournament\u2019s most important outcome had little to do with goalmouth scrambles or final-whistle disappointment. Instead, it was about building confidence among girls to trust the HPV vaccine and prevent a disease that kills a woman every two minutes globally \u2014 with the burden most acute in Africa, according to GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, one of the tournament\u2019s organizers.",
      "\u201cParticipating in the tournament was very good because we had to learn and spread (the message) even though we did not win the finals. So it was a good experience,\u201d Sooane said as she waited to collect her finalist\u2019s medal in a rain-soaked stadium in Norton, on the outskirts of Zimbabwe\u2019s capital, Harare.",
      "Sooane was among about 200 girls from six countries taking part in the CAF Under-17 girls\u2019 tournament in December, organized by Africa\u2019s soccer governing body CAF together with the European soccer body, GAVI and health ministries from several African countries.",
      "Dubbed the Goal Getters campaign, the initiative was first showcased in Tanzania and Eswatini earlier last year before moving to Zimbabwe in December, using soccer to build awareness and trust in the HPV vaccine.",
      "Offered for free, the HPV vaccine being administered to girls aged between 9 and 14 years can prevent up to 90% of cervical cancer cases, saving families thousands of dollars in treatment costs later in life if girls are not vaccinated, according to GAVI.",
      "After setbacks caused by COVID-19 lockdowns and uneven national immunization programs, Africa has intensified HPV vaccination drives in recent years. Coverage for at least one dose of the HPV vaccine rose to 40% in 2023 from 28% the previous year, behind only behind North, Central and South America, driven by expanded campaigns backed by governments and GAVI, according to the World Health Organization.",
      "The girls\u2019 soccer tournament is a key part of that effort, said GAVI spokesman Olly Cann.",
      "\u201cOne of the great aspects of the Goal Getters campaign is that it enables us to blend two things that teenage girls are passionate about, one is sport and the other is health,\u201d said Cann. \u201cIt creates a really safe space where the girls can feel trusted, they can feel secure, they also feel empowered.\u201d",
      "The campaign\u2019s launch mixed dance and song before the eight-team tournament kicked off. On the sidelines, mothers streamed to a nearby clinic, some drawn by the chance to see well-known women\u2019s soccer figures, while also getting their children vaccinated against HPV.",
      "HPV, or human papillomavirus, is a common sexually transmitted virus and the primary cause of cervical cancer. While most infections clear naturally, some persist and can lead to cancer years later.",
      "Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer among women worldwide, killing about 350,000 women each year, according to the WHO. Africa accounts for nearly a quarter of global deaths, and 19 of the 20 most affected countries are in sub-Saharan Africa, Cann said.",

      "But his greatest achievement came before all that, with his work on smallpox, one of the most lethal diseases in human history. For centuries, it killed about one-third of the people it infected and left most survivors with deep scars on their faces from the pus-filled lesions.",
      "Smallpox vaccination campaigns were well established by the time Foege was a young doctor. Indeed, it was no longer seen in the United States. But infections were still occurring elsewhere, and efforts to stamp them out were stalling.",
      "Working as a medical missionary in Nigeria in the 1960s, Foege and his colleagues developed a \"ring containment\" strategy, in which a smallpox outbreak was contained by identifying each smallpox case and vaccinating everyone who the patients might come into contact with.",

And Trump administration officials acknowledge that they haven't finished working out some issues, such as lost access to data from other countries that could give America an early warning of a new pandemic.",
      "The withdrawal will hurt the global response to new outbreaks and will hobble the ability of U.S. scientists and pharmaceutical companies to develop vaccines and medicines against new threats, said Lawrence Gostin, a public health law expert at Georgetown University.",
      "\u201cIn my opinion, it\u2019s the most ruinous presidential decision in my lifetime,\u201d he said.",
      "The WHO is the United Nations\u2019 specialized health agency and is mandated to coordinate the response to global health threats, such as outbreaks of mpox, Ebola and polio. It also provides technical assistance to poorer countries; helps distribute scarce vaccines, supplies and treatments; and sets guidelines for hundreds of health conditions, including mental health and cancer.",
      "Nearly every country in the world is a member.",

      "In an executive order issued right after taking office, Trump said the U.S. was withdrawing from WHO due to the organization\u2019s mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic and other global health crises. He also cited the agency\u2019s \u201cfailure to adopt urgently needed reforms\u201d and its \u201cinability to demonstrate independence from the inappropriate political influence of WHO member states.\u201d",

      "Another Trump administration complaint: None of WHO's chief executives \u2014 there have been nine since the organization was created in 1948 \u2014 have been Americans. Administration officials view that as unfair given how much the WHO relies on U.S. financial contributions and on U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention personnel.",

      "A new report warns that the number of soldiers killed, injured or missing in Russia's war in Ukraine could reach 2 million by spring",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- A new report warned that the number of soldiers killed, injured or missing on both sides of Russia's war on Ukraine could hit 2 million by the spring, with Russia suffering the largest number of troop deaths recorded for any major power in any war since World War II.",
      "The report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies came less than a month before the fourth anniversary of Moscow's onslaught on Ukraine. Officials said Wednesday that two people were killed on the outskirts of Kyiv after Russian strikes hit an apartment block, and at least nine people were injured in separate attacks in the Ukrainian cities of Odesa and Kryvyi Rih and the front-line Zaporizhzhia region.",
      "The CSIS report released Tuesday said Russia suffered 1.2 million casualties, including up to 325,000 troop deaths, between the start of Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion in February 2022 and December 2025.",

      "Neither Moscow nor Kyiv gives timely data on military losses, and each is at pains to amplify the other side\u2019s casualties. Russia has publicly acknowledged the deaths of just over 6,000 soldiers. Reports about military losses have been repressed in Russian media, activists and independent journalists say.",
      "The report estimated that at current rates, combined Russian and Ukrainian casualties may be as high as 1.8 million and could reach 2 million by the spring.",
      "The figures from the CSIS were compiled using the Washington, D.C.-based think tank\u2019s own analysis, data published by independent Russian news site Mediazona with the BBC, estimates by the British government and interviews with state officials.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 The wife of South Korea\u2019s ousted President Yoon Suk Yeol was sentenced to 20 months in prison for corruption Wednesday, as her husband awaits a verdict on high-stakes rebellion charges that could result in the death penalty or life imprisonment.",
      "The presidential couple suffered a spectacular fall from grace after Yoon\u2019s martial law debacle in December 2024 led to his impeachment and eventually his removal from office.",
      "They have been jailed separately for months prior to facing criminal trials, Yoon over his martial law imposition in December 2024 and other allegations and Kim over corruption charges. Investigators say Kim wasn\u2019t involved in Yoon's martial law enforcement.",

      "\u201cStaying close to a president, a first lady can exert significant influence on him and is a symbolic figure who represents the country together with a president,\u201d the court said in a live broadcast of the verdict. \u201cBut the defendant exploited her position to seek personal gains.\u201d",
      "The ruling was still a surprise after independent counsel Min Joong-ki called for a 15-year prison term for Kim on the charges involving bribery, stock price manipulation and political funding law violations. The court acquitted Kim of charges of stock price manipulation and political funding law violations, citing a lack of evidence and other reasons.",
      "Min's team responded that it cannot accept the ruling and will appeal to a higher court. The governing liberal Democratic Party, which led Yoon's ouster, slammed the verdict as sending a wrong signal that \u201cabuse of power like Kim Keon Hee's can be tolerated.\u201d",
      "Kim\u2019s defense team thanked the court for its verdict but said the 20-month prison term for her bribery charges was \u201crelatively high.\u201d Lawyer Choi Ji-woo said Min's investigation was politically driven and his team will discuss whether to appeal.",

But after a six-month probe into Yoon\u2019s decree that wrapped up in December, independent counsel Cho's team downplayed conjecture that Kim\u2019s troubles drove Yoon to declare martial law.",
      "Yoon plotted for over a year to declare martial law so he could eliminate his political opponents and monopolize power and there was also no evidence of Kim's involvement, Cho\u2019s team said.",

      "In a statement on Sunday, army spokesman Lul Ruai Koang said Operation Enduring Peace would commence and ordered civilians to evacuate three counties in Jonglei state immediately. He directed aid groups to leave within 48 hours.",
      "Koang told The Associated Press on Monday that the operation aims to recapture towns recently seized by opposition forces and \u201creestablish law and order.\u201d",

      "Some of those forces are loyal to opposition leader Riek Machar, while others consider themselves part of an ethnic Nuer militia called the White Army. White Army fighters have historically fought alongside Machar but consider themselves a distinct group.",
      "Machar, an ethnic Nuer, was made the most senior of five vice presidents under a 2018 peace agreement that ended fighting between his forces and those loyal to President Salva Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, the country\u2019s largest group. That five-year civil war was waged largely along ethnic lines, killing an estimated 400,000 people.",
      "But there has been a resurgence of violence in the past year, with sporadic fighting.",
      "Machar was suspended last year as South Sudan\u2019s No. 2 after White Army fighters overran a military garrison in the town of Nasir. He now faces treason and other charges over that attack, which authorities allege Machar helped orchestrate. But Machar\u2019s allies and some international observers say the charges are politically motivated. He remains under house arrest while his trial unfolds slowly in the capital, Juba.",
      "Machar\u2019s trial is widely seen as a violation of the 2018 peace agreement. Yet Kiir and his allies say the agreement is still being implemented, pointing to a faction of the opposition still in the unity government.",
      "Forces loyal to Machar have declared the agreement dead, and have since ratcheted up pressure on the army by seizing armories and launching hit-and-run attacks on government positions. The government has relied largely on aerial bombardments to beat back a rebellion that analysts say is gaining momentum across multiple states.",

      "BARCELONA, Spain -- Spain's government announced Tuesday it will grant legal status to potentially hundreds of thousands of immigrants living and working in the country without authorization, the latest example of how the country has bucked a trend toward increasingly harsh immigration policies seen in the United States and much of Europe.",
      "Spain's Minister of Migration, Elma Saiz, announced the extraordinary measure following the weekly cabinet meeting. She said her government will amend existing immigration laws by expedited decree to grant immigrants who are living in Spain without authorization legal residency of up to one year as well as permission to work.",
      "The permits will apply to those who arrived in Spain before Dec. 31, 2025, and who can prove they have lived in Spain for at least five months. They must also prove they have no criminal record.",
      "\u201cToday is a historic day,\u201d Saiz told journalists during a press conference. The measure could benefit between 500,000 and 800,000 people estimated by different organizations to be living in the shadows of Spanish society. Many are Latin American or African immigrants working in the agricultural, tourism or service sectors, backbones of Spain's growing economy.",
      "The expedited decree bypasses a similar bill that has stalled in parliament. Saiz said she expects immigrants will be able to start applying for their legal status from April once the decree comes into force.",

      "With the average cost of a new vehicle hovering around $50,000, buying a new SUV might seem well out of reach if you\u2019re on a tight budget. But automakers have increasingly been selling entry-level SUVs that are smaller and less expensive than all-star SUVs like the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4. And if you buy used, it\u2019s easy to get one of these small but versatile SUVs for less than $20,000.",
      "Edmunds\u2019 experts have compiled five of their favorite used extra-small SUVs that deliver big on affordability, fuel economy and everyday practicality.",
      "Edmunds praises the Trailblazer for its versatility. Headroom and legroom are ample in the first and second rows. The Trailblazer also has a pretty big cargo area. All-wheel drive is available, and all Trailblazers come with wireless connectivity for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration to connect and use many of your phone\u2019s apps on the center touchscreen.",
      "Look for: The latest-generation Trailblazer arrived for the 2021 model year. Acceleration from the base 137-horsepower turbocharged three-cylinder engine is leisurely, though an optional 155-horsepower turbo three-cylinder adds a little more pep. Trailblazers with all-wheel drive come with the more powerful engine as standard. \u200b",
      "The HR-V is Honda\u2019s smallest SUV, but take a test drive and you\u2019ll be pleased with how much cargo and passenger space it has. The HR-V is also easy to see out of, which helps you easily squeeze into gaps in traffic or snug parking spots. One drawback to the HR-V is slow acceleration \u2014 you\u2019ll notice it when you\u2019re quickly trying to get onto the highway \u2014 but it\u2019s countered by pretty good fuel economy. The HR-V is available with front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive.",
      "Look for: The HR-V came out for the 2016 model year. Anything from that debut year up until about a 2022 HR-V will consistently be under $20,000. A 2022 HR-V EX, for example, comes with heated front seats, keyless entry, and the vehicle\u2019s full roster of advanced driver aids.",
      "One thing that immediately gets attention is the Kona\u2019s distinctive styling. You might not love the way it looks, but you will love the way the Kona drives. When equipped with its optional turbocharged engine, it gets up to speed quicker than most other vehicles in the class. It\u2019s also fun to drive around turns thanks to its sporty handling. On top of that, you get a lot of features for your money.",
      "\u200bLook for: The Kona first debuted for the 2018 model year and was redesigned in 2024. You should have little trouble finding a 2022 Kona for under $20,000. This is also a good year to focus on because it received worthwhile updates, including a larger center touchscreen. All-wheel drive is available on every trim level, and the more powerful turbocharged engine comes on the Limited or N Line trim level.",
      "The Soul is a boxy-looking vehicle that mixes elements of an SUV and a hatchback. It earns praise from Edmunds thanks to its value and practicality. Despite its tidy proportions, its upright shape provides ample passenger room and cargo capacity. Standard features are especially generous considering the Soul\u2019s price. The Soul is also pretty fun to drive, just like the Kona, and a strong turbocharged engine comes on the top Turbo trim level. You can\u2019t, however, get the Soul with all-wheel drive.",

      "The Subaru Crosstrek is our top recommendation if you want a used small SUV that can help you get out into nature. Its standard all-wheel drive and high ground clearance combine to provide more off-road prowess than the other vehicles on our list. If you like to occasionally go camping or hiking, or maybe you live somewhere that has a lot of snowy weather, the Crosstrek might just be right for you. The Crosstrek\u2019s interior is simple but spacious for front and rear passengers.",
      "Look for: You\u2019ll likely have to get a 2021 or older Crosstrek to stay under $20,000. One negative aspect to the Crosstrek is its slow acceleration. You can help to mitigate that by getting a 2021 Crosstrek in either the Sport or Limited trim. Starting this year, Subaru outfitted these Crosstreks with a more powerful engine.",
      "An extra-small used SUV is far more than a means of pinching pennies \u2014 well, at least when those were still a thing. These five vehicles won\u2019t break the bank and overdeliver in terms of style and substance.",

      "Two nations, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, have signaled they won't allow their airspace to be used for any attack. But America has moved the USS Abraham Lincoln and several guided missile destroyers into the region, which can be used to launch attacks from the sea.",
      "It remains unclear what U.S. President Donald Trump will decide about using force, though he laid down two red lines \u2014 the killing of peaceful demonstrators and the possible mass execution of detainees. The protests saw at least 6,221 people killed as Iran launched a bloody crackdown on the demonstrations, with many others feared dead, activists said Wednesday.",
      "Iran's state-run media, which now only refers to protesters as \u201cterrorists,\u201d remains the sole source of news for many as Tehran cut off access to the global internet some three weeks ago. But Iranians have become angry and anxious in the weeks since, seeing footage of protesters shot and killed while worrying about what may happen next as the country's economy sinks further.",
      "\u201cI feel that my generation failed to give a better lesson to younger ones,\" said Mohammad Heidari, a 59-year-old high school teacher in Tehran. \u201cThe result of decades of teaching by my colleagues and me led to death of thousands, and maybe more injured and prisoners.\u201d",
      "Egypt's Foreign Ministry said its top diplomat, Badr Abdelatty, separately spoke with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff to \u201cwork toward achieving calm, in order to avoid the region slipping into new cycles of instability.\u201d",
      "The statement offered no details, though Iranian state media quoted Araghchi as saying third-party mediators had been in touch. Witkoff, a billionaire real estate developer and Trump's friend, had earlier negotiated over Iran's nuclear program. There was no immediate acknowledgment from the White House of the call.",

Both Saudi Arabia and the UAE host American air assets and troops.",
      "However, America's biggest base in the region is Qatar's vast Al Udeid Air Base, which serves as the forward operating headquarters of the U.S. military's Central Command. Both Araghchi and Ali Larijani, a top Iranian security official, reportedly held calls with Qatar's Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani. Qatar acknowledged the Araghchi call, but offered few details on what was discussed.",

      "\u201cOur position is exactly this: Applying diplomacy through military threats cannot be effective or constructive,\u201d Araghchi told journalists Wednesday outside of a Cabinet meeting. \u201cIf they want negotiations to take shape, they must abandon threats, excessive demands, and the raising of illogical issues. Negotiations have their own principles: they must be conducted on an equal footing, based on mutual respect, and for mutual benefit.\u201d",

      "While the protests have been halted for weeks after the crackdown, information slowly trickling out of Iran via Starlink satellite dishes is reaching activists, who have been trying to tally the carnage.",
      "On Wednesday, the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, which has been accurate in multiple rounds of unrest in Iran, said at least 6,221 dead it counted included at least 5,858 protesters, 214 government-affiliated forces, 100 children and 49 civilians who weren\u2019t demonstrating. More than 42,300 have been arrested, it added.",
      "The group verifies each death and arrest with a network of activists on the ground in Iran. The Associated Press has been unable to independently assess the death toll given that authorities cut off the internet and disrupted calls into the Islamic Republic.",
      "Iran\u2019s government has put the death toll at a far lower 3,117, saying 2,427 were civilians and security forces, and labeled the rest \u201cterrorists.\u201d In the past, Iran\u2019s theocracy has undercounted or not reported fatalities from unrest.",
      "That death toll exceeds that of any other round of protest or unrest in Iran in decades, and recalls the chaos surrounding the 1979 Islamic Revolution.",
      "The protests began on Dec. 28, sparked by the fall of the Iranian currency, the rial, and quickly spread across the country. They were met by a violent crackdown, the scale of which is only starting to become clear as the country has faced more than two weeks of internet blackout \u2014 the most comprehensive in its history.",

      "BEIJING -- U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer arrives in Beijing on Wednesday for a four-day visit to China aimed at repairing ties and expanding opportunities for British businesses in the world's second-largest economy.",
      "He is the first British leader to come to Beijing since Theresa May in 2018. The relationship has deteriorated in recent years over growing concern about Chinese spying and surveillance, China\u2019s support for Russia in the Ukraine war and Beijing\u2019s crackdown on civil liberties in Hong Kong, the former British colony.",
      "Those issues remain, but both sides are emphasizing that they should \u201cseek common ground while managing differences,\" as Zheng Zeguang, China's Ambassador to the U.K., wrote in a commentary for The Times of London this week.",
      "Starmer, whose center-left Labour Party government has struggled to deliver the economic growth it promised, is bringing a delegation of more than 60 British business and cultural leaders with him. His agenda includes Shanghai, the nation's financial capital and a major port, as well as meeting Xi Jinping and other Chinese leaders in Beijing.",
      "Wang Yiwei, a European affairs expert at Renmin University of China, said that Britain's strengths in finance, consulting and other services dovetail well with a growing appetite in China for services such as health and elderly care. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge market,\u201d he said.",
      "The U.K. had a trade deficit with China in 2025, importing more goods than it exported to the nation of 1.4 billion people, but it had a trade surplus in services.",
      "\u201cWith recent Chinese policy directives focused on boosting domestic consumption and further opening the services sector to international businesses, we see significant opportunities for growth for U.K. businesses,\u201d the China-Britain Business Council said.",

      "Both Britain and China have been buffeted by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs and are seeking to diversify their overseas markets and the supply chains for their industries. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney made a trip to China earlier this month with the same goals in mind.",
      "The approach is not without risks. Trump has threatened to put a 100% tariff on Canada if it reaches a trade deal with China, prompting a swift response from Carney. Canada and China have cut tariffs on a few sectors where these were recently imposed, but Canada has no intention of pursuing a free trade deal with Beijing, Carney said.",

The U.K. recently approved plans for a huge Chinese Embassy in London, removing a sticking point in relations and overriding claims by critics that the \u201cmega-embassy\u201d would make it easier for China to conduct espionage and intimidate dissidents.",

      "The European Union and India have reached a free trade agreement to deepen economic and strategic ties after nearly two decades of negotiations",
      "BRUSSELS -- The ambitious free trade agreement between the European Union and India underscores the EU's efforts to ink new global partnerships at a time when the Trump administration has rattled the region's capitals which have long relied on a stable relationship with Washington on trade, defense and diplomacy.",
      "The agreement announced Tuesday reflects a new priority for the 27-nation EU, the world's largest trading bloc, after President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs because of opposition to American control of Greenland, only to back off days later. It follows trade deals struck or pending over the past year with India, Japan, Indonesia, Mexico and the five Mercosur nations of South America.",

      "\u201cEurope and India need each other today like never before,\u201d said Garima Mohan, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund. She said that both Brussels and New Delhi had long sought closer ties as a counterweight to China's economic rise. But the abrasiveness of the Trump administration on economic and security issues cinched the deal.",
      "\u201cThis movement towards diversification, looking for new partners as well as building self-reliance was precipitated by the tensions with China and really driven home by the fracture of the trans-Atlantic partnership,\u201d Mohan said. The deal \u201conly came to pass at this particular geopolitical juncture, and that says something of the world we live in.\u201d",
      "The EU struck its first trade deal in July with Indonesia. Two weeks ago, von der Leyen signed a deal with the Mercosur nations of South America that was decades in the making to create a free trade market of more than 700 million people - and she\u2019s said she has the authority to implement it despite objections raised by European Parliament.",

      "When the Supreme Court granted an unusually quick hearing over President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs, a similarly fast resolution seemed possible",
      "WASHINGTON -- When the Supreme Court granted an unusually quick hearing over President Donald Trump's tariffs, a similarly rapid resolution seemed possible.",
      "After all, Trump's lawyers told the court that speed was of the essence on an issue central to the president's economic agenda. They pointed to a statement from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warning that the \u201clonger a final ruling is delayed, the greater the risk of economic disruption.\u201d",
      "But nearly three months have elapsed since arguments in the closely watched case and the court isn't scheduled to meet in public for more than three weeks.",
      "No one knows for sure what is going on among the nine justices, several of whom expressed skepticism about the tariffs' legality at arguments in November. But the timeline for deciding the case now looks more or less typical and could reflect the normal back-and-forth that occurs not just in the biggest cases, but almost all the disputes the justices hear.",
      "Several Supreme Court practitioners and law professors scoffed at the idea that the justices are dragging their feet on tariffs, putting off a potentially uncomfortable ruling against Trump.",
      "\u201cPeople suspect this kind of thing from time to time, but I am not aware of instances in which we have more than speculation,\u201d said Jonathan Adler, a law professor at the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia.",
      "The timeframe alone also doesn't point to one outcome or the other.",
      "One possible explanation, said Carter Phillips, a lawyer with 91 arguments before the high court, \u201cis that the court is more evenly divided than appeared to be the case at oral argument and the fifth vote is wavering.\u201d",
      "Even if the majority opinion has been drafted and more or less agreed to by five or more members of the court, a separate opinion, probably in dissent, could slow things down, Phillips said.",
      "Just last week, the court issued two opinions in cases that were argued in October. All nine justices agreed with the outcome, a situation that typically allows decisions to be issued relatively quickly. But a separate opinion in each case probably delayed the decision.",
      "The court is generally moving more slowly in argued cases, perhaps because of the flood of emergency appeals the administration has brought to the justices. The first argued case wasn't decided until January this year. Typically, that happens in December, if not November.",
      "Over the last 20 years, the average turnaround time for a Supreme Court opinion was just over three months, according to data gathered by Adam Feldman, creator of Empirical SCOTUS. The timeline has increased in recent years, with the court releasing half or more of its cases in June.",

      "The central bank's rate reductions last year were intended to shore up the economy and prevent a sharper deterioration in the job market, after hiring slowed to a near-crawl in the wake of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs last April. Yet there are signs that unemployment has stabilized and the economy could be picking up. At the same time, inflation remains stubbornly above the Fed's 2% target. All those trends argue for keeping rates where they are.",
      "A key issue that Chair Jerome Powell will likely address at his news conference Wednesday is how long the Fed will remain on hold. The rate-setting committee remains split between those officials opposed to further cuts until inflation comes down, and those who want to lower rates to further support hiring.",
      "In December, just 12 of the 19 participants in the committee's meetings supported at least one more rate cut this year. Most economists forecast the Fed will cut twice this year, most likely at the June meeting or later.",

Powell said Jan. 11 that the Fed had received subpoenas from the Justice Department as part of a criminal investigation into his congressional testimony about a $2.5 billion building renovation.

      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum says that her government has suspended oil shipments to Cuba, but says the pause in shipments has been a \u201csovereign decision\u201d and not the result of pressure by the United States",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday her government has at least temporarily stopped oil shipments to Cuba, but struck an ambiguous tone, saying the pause was part of general fluctuations in oil supplies and that it was a \u201csovereign decision\u201d not made under pressure from the United States.",
      "Sheinbaum was responding to inquiries on whether the state oil company Pemex had cut off oil shipments to Cuba in the wake of mounting pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump that Mexico distance itself from the Cuban government, though U.S. officials have not publicly requested that Mexico stop the oil.",
      "\u201cPemex makes decisions in the contractual relationship it has with Cuba,\u201d Sheinbaum said in her morning news briefing. \u201cSuspending is a sovereign decision and is taken when necessary.\u201d",
      "Sheinbaum\u2019s vague statements come as Trump has sought to isolate Cuba and further ramp up the pressure on the island, a longtime adversary under strict economic sanctions from Washington. Trump has said the Cuban government is ready to fall, and that the island would receive no more oil shipments from Venezuela after a U.S. military operation deposed former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "In its deepening energy and economic crisis, Cuba has relied heavily on foreign assistance and oil shipments from allies like Mexico, Russia, and \u2014 previously \u2014 Venezuela.",
      "Mexico has sought to balance its long-term support of Cuba\u2019s government with pressure from Trump for Latin American leaders to fall in line with his vision for the region.",
      "Sheinbaum said Tuesday that Mexico would continue to show solidarity with Havana, but didn\u2019t clarify what kind of support Mexico would offer.",
      "Mexico has faced its own pressure from Washington, as Trump has threatened to take military action against Mexican drug cartels.",
      "Mexico last week transferred dozens of suspected cartel members to the United States to face justice. They were sought by the Trump administration, but Sheinbaum used similar language at the time as she did Tuesday, saying the transfers were made on a sovereign and autonomous basis.",
      "Mexican oil has long acted as a key lifeline for Cuba. In its most recent report, Pemex said it shipped nearly 20,000 barrels of oil per day to Cuba from January through Sept. 30, 2025. That month, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Mexico City. Afterward, Jorge Pi\u00f1on, an expert at the University of Texas Energy Institute who tracks shipments using satellite technology, said the figure had fallen to about 7,000 barrels.",
      "Sheinbaum has spent weeks saying she would provide clear data on exports to Cuba, but has yet to do so. The Cuban government and Pemex did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

      "BOSTON -- A federal judge said Tuesday that a nearly completed Massachusetts offshore wind project can continue, as the industry successfully challenges the Trump administration in court.",
      "At U.S. District Court in Boston, Judge Brian Murphy halted the administration's stop work order for Vineyard Wind, citing the potential economic losses from the delays and the developers' likelihood of success on their claims. Vineyard Wind is one of five big offshore wind projects on the East Coast that the Trump administration froze days before Christmas, citing national security concerns \u2014 and the fourth that has since been allowed to go forward.",
      "A spokesperson for the company, Craig Gilvarg, said in a statement that it would \u201cwork with the Administration to understand the matters raised in the Order.\u201d",
      "\u201cVineyard Wind will focus on working in coordination with its contractors, the federal government, and other relevant stakeholders and authorities to safely restart activities, as it continues to deliver a critical source of new power to the New England region,\u201d Gilvarg added.",
      "Developers and states sued seeking to block the administration's order. Prior to Vineyard Wind's hearing, federal judges had allowed three of the five to restart construction: the Revolution Wind project for Rhode Island and Connecticut by Danish company Orsted, the Empire Wind project for New York by Norwegian company Equinor, and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind for Virginia by Dominion Energy Virginia. Those three judges essentially concluded that the government did not show that the national security risk is so imminent that construction must halt, said Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond Law School professor who has been following the lawsuits.",
      "Orsted is also suing over the administration halting its Sunrise Wind project for New York \u2014 the fifth paused project \u2014 but has not had a hearing yet.",
      "Vineyard Wind is a joint venture between Avangrid and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, located 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of Martha\u2019s Vineyard and Nantucket, Massachusetts. It is 95% complete and partially operational, able to produce nearly 600 megawatts of power for the New England electric grid, according to the complaint. Before the pause, it was on track to be complete by the end of March, with 62 turbines generating a total of 800 megawatts. That is enough clean electricity to power about 400,000 homes.",
      "Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell said the completion of this project is essential to ensuring the state can lower costs, meet rising energy demand, advance its climate goals and sustain thousands of good-paying jobs.",
      "U.S. Sen. Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, welcomed the judge's ruling.",
      "\u201cThis stay is an important step in the process to fight back against the Trump administration\u2019s lawless attacks against our union jobs, grid security, and energy affordability,\u201d Markey said in a statement. \u201cVineyard Wind 1 is currently delivering affordable and reliable power into our grid and has the permits, financing, and approval to deliver even more. Shutting off Vineyard Wind 1 would kill thousands of local union jobs, prevent power from reaching 400,000 homes, and cause us to lose out on $3 billion of energy savings.\"",
      "The administration's announcement that paused construction did not reveal specifics about its national security concerns. But in a court filing, Matthew Giacona, acting director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, said he reviewed classified documents in November that discussed direct impacts to national security that arise from operating offshore wind projects near early warning monitoring and radar systems. Giacona said he determined the ongoing activities for the Vineyard Wind project did not \u201cadequately provide for the protection of national security interests,\u201d absent potential mitigation measures.",

Research from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory shows that states with the most utility-scale wind and solar often have low electricity prices, supported by federal tax incentives. However, states with aggressive, binding programs to mandate more renewable energy have seen prices increase as a result of those policies, according to the study.",

However, daily average users still increased by 2% in the same period, which Sensor Tower says suggests the uninstalls had little effect on overall usage. And while TikTok lagged YouTube and Instagram in U.S. user growth, people spent more time on the platform than its rivals.",

The protest didn't last and RedNote doesn't see much discussion in the U.S. these days.",

      "Trump's order, signed Friday, seeks to allow homeowners to rebuild without contending with \u201cunnecessary, duplicative, or obstructive\u201d permitting requirements, the White House said in a statement.",

      "Now, Cubans whose livelihood depends on tourism are among those suffering the most as the island braces for what experts warn could be a catastrophic economic crisis following a disruption in oil shipments from Venezuela after the U.S. attacked the South American country and arrested its president.",
      "The situation is already acute for Rosbel Figueredo Ricardo, 30, who sells a popular Cuban street food known as \u201cchivirico,\u201d fried flour chips sprinkled with sugar.",
      "He used to load 150 bags of chips every morning onto a plastic tray he balances on his shoulder and sell out by late afternoon. Nowadays, he only loads 50 bags a day, works from dawn until nighttime and sometimes doesn\u2019t sell a single bag.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a mid-level industrial mechanical technician, and look at me here,\u201d he said.",
      "Figueredo has a partner and three children, with a fourth one on the way, so he frets.",
      "\u201cThis is our day-to-day, so we can eat,\u201d he said.",
      "On a recent afternoon, unable to find any tourists near Havana\u2019s famed seawall, he walked toward the Spanish embassy, hoping that some of the dozens of Cubans who line up daily seeking a visa to leave the island will buy from him.",
      "For decades, tourism generated up to $3 billion a year for Cuba.",
      "Visitors would pack into restaurants, crowd along Havana\u2019s seawall and gather at imposing monuments and state buildings. The constant flow of passengers boosted employment and led to the opening of hundreds of small businesses including hostels and restaurants.",
      "Nowadays, the seawall is dotted mostly with Cuban couples or fishermen hoping to catch their next meal.",
      "Nearby, tablecloths at empty seaside restaurants flutter in the wind while employees clutch menus and scan the horizon for customers that never arrive.",
      "Some 2.3 million tourists visited Cuba from January to November 2025, significantly lower than the 4.8 million in 2018 and the 4.2 million in 2019, before the pandemic hit.",
      "Some Cubans worry that growing tensions between the U.S. and Cuba, cuts in water and power supply and large piles of garbage in popular tourist areas have spooked visitors.",
      "The dramatic drop in tourists hits especially hard because U.S. sanctions stripped Cuba of nearly $8 billion in revenue from March 2024 to February 2025, a loss that is nearly 50% higher compared with the previous period, according to government statistics.",
      "On a recent afternoon, only three people boarded a double-decker tourism bus driven by Gaspar Biart.",
      "He\u2019s been driving for 16 years and recalled with a small smile how crowded buses would get.",

      "Civil rights photographer and artist Gordon Parks' legacy continues to grow, even as the 20th anniversary of his death approaches",
      "Civil rights photographer and artist Gordon Parks\u2019 legacy continues to expand today, even as the 20th anniversary of his death arrives on March 7. However, the Gordon Parks Foundation, which celebrates the same milestone this year, is finding it harder to fund its work inspired by the director of \u201cThe Learning Tree\u201d and \u201cShaft.\u201d",
      "Though Gordon Parks Foundation Executive Director Peter W. Kunhardt, Jr., told The Associated Press that federal funding cuts to diversity, equity and inclusion programs have only had a limited direct impact on the foundation\u2019s work due to a \u201cstrong base of supporters,\u201d it isn\u2019t immune to the changing, more competitive funding landscape that many arts-focused nonprofits now face.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re definitely sensitive to the fact the world has drastically changed and the arts and DEI and culture have definitely taken a hit,\u201d said Kunhardt.",
      "That puts extra emphasis on fundraising events like the foundation\u2019s gala -- its largest annual fundraising event \u2013 especially in a major anniversary year.",
      "The foundation said Tuesday it will honor EGOT (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony) winner John Legend, Grammy winner Chance the Rapper, Mellon Foundation President Elizabeth Alexander, and artist Henry Taylor at its gala on May 19 in Manhattan. Advocate and philanthropist Lonnie Ali will also be honored at the event, accepting the award for her late husband Muhammad Ali, who was a longtime friend of Parks, and their entire family.",
      "\u201cWe need to preserve the past to inspire the future by honoring these individuals,\u201d Kunhardt said. \u201cThe particular people on this list for 20 years are very important because they represent many different disciplines that Gordon Parks focused in on and who have championed the arts and social justice.\u201d",
      "Parks was best known for his work at Life magazine, documenting race relations and American life for decades as the magazine\u2019s first Black staff photographer. He famously bought his first camera at a pawnshop and taught himself to use it at a mix of jobs in Minnesota.",
      "That work led to him receiving the Julius Rosenwald Fellowship in 1942, which provided a one-year apprenticeship under Roy Stryker at the Farm Security Administration, alongside acclaimed photographers including Walker Evans and Dorothea Lange. Parks wanted to provide similar support for young artists and the Gordon Parks Foundation now awards numerous fellowships in art, music and writing. Last year, the foundation launched a Legacy Acquisition Fund, which purchases the work of older artists in order to support them and their connection to Parks.",
      "Those programs, along with the star-studded 2021 HBO documentary \u201cA Choice of Weapons: Inspired by Gordon Parks,\u201d have fueled a resurgence of interest in Parks and his work.",
      "\u201cPeople who have had such an extraordinarily long life and so much output of such a high caliber like Parks are bound to become players who become even more important,\u201d said Casey Riley, chair of the Department of Global Contemporary Art at the Minneapolis Institute of Art. \u201cIf you\u2019re paying attention to what he was doing, it will be relevant to the moment.\u201d",
      "Riley -- who curated the museum\u2019s \u201cAmerican Gothic: Gordon Parks and Ella Watson\u201d exhibit, which focused on the creation of one of the 20th century\u2019s most influential photographs -- said that Parks is a \u201ctouchstone\u201d for many artists of color, especially Black American artists. However, the Kansas-born Parks has a special bond with artists from Minneapolis and St. Paul, where he spent his formative years as a photographer.",

      "Carney rolled his eyes and rejected U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent\u2019s contention to Fox News that he aggressively walked back his comments at the World Economic Forum during a phone call with Trump on Monday.",
      "\u201cTo be absolutely clear, and I said this to the president, I meant what I said in Davos,\u201d Carney said to reporters as he arrived for a Cabinet meeting in the capital, Ottawa.",
      "\u201cCanada was the first country to understand the change in U.S. trade policy that he initiated, and we\u2019re responding to that. \u201d",
      "In Davos at the World Economic Forum last week, Carney condemned economic coercion by great powers on smaller countries without mentioning Trump\u2019s name. The prime minister received widespread praise and attention for his remarks, upstaging Trump at the gathering.",
      "Trump threatened this past weekend to impose a 100% tariff on goods imported from Canada if America\u2019s northern neighbor went ahead with a trade deal with Beijing, though Carney has said Canada has no interest in negotiating a comprehensive trade deal with Beijing.",

      "Trump\u2019s threat came amid an escalating war of words with Carney. The Republican president\u2019s push to acquire Greenland strained the NATO alliance, alarming Canada, which shares a 3,000-kilometer (1,864 mile) maritime border with Greenland in the Arctic. Trump has also previously talked about making Canada the 51st state.",
      "Carney has said his recent agreement with China merely cuts tariffs that were recently imposed on a few sectors. The prime minister plans to travel to India, Australia and other countries in effort to diversify trade away from dependence on the U.S., which takes more than 75% of Canada's exports.",

      "Trump\u2019s push to acquire Greenland has come after he has repeatedly needled Canada over its sovereignty and suggested it also be absorbed into the United States.

      "Novak Djokovic is back in the Australian Open semifinals after Lorenzo Musetti retired with an injury in the third set of Wednesday's quarterfinal match",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Novak Djokovic was the first to admit he's lucky to be back in the Australian Open semifinals instead of Lorenzo Musetti.",
      "Despite being two sets down, slowed by a serious blister on his foot and already thinking about his flight home, the 24-time major winner won Wednesday's quarterfinal when fifth-seeded Musetti retired with an injury.",
      "Musetti took the first two sets 6-4, 6-3 but needed a medical timeout for treatment on his upper right leg after being broken in the third game of the third. The 23-year-old Italian played on for almost two games but couldn\u2019t continue.",
      "After serving a double-fault in the fifth game to give Djokovic another breakpoint chance, Musetti wiped a hand across his face, walked toward the net and removed his headband before exchanging a handshake and quick hug.",
      "Djokovic, who was leading the third set 3-1, will continue his bid for an 11th Australian title and a record 25th major but acknowledged he was lucky this time. He also said, it happens in tennis.",
      "\u201cIt happened to me a few times. But being in the quarters of a Grand Slam, two sets to love up and being in full control \u2014 I mean, so unfortunate,\u201d for Musetti, Djokovic said in an on-court TV interview. \"He should have been a winner today.\u201d",
      "Musetti was also forced to retire from the French Open semifinals last year \u2014- with an injured left leg \u2014 after taking a set from eventual champion Carlos Alcaraz.",
      "\u201cI feel really sorry for him,\" the 38-year-old Djokovic said. \"He was a far better player \u2014 I was on my way home tonight.\u201d",
      "In the first set, Djokovic tried to go out hard. He took an early break and was just a point away from a 3-0 lead before Musetti responded and took control of the match.",

      "But in tennis, no player takes any victory for granted. Just a few days ago, Djokovic received a walkover into the quarterfinals when Jakub Mensik withdrew 24 hours ahead of their scheduled fourth-round match with an abdominal injury.",
      "Djokovic has seen it from the other side. None more dramatic than here last year when he had to quit the Australian Open semifinals with a torn leg muscle. He was booed off the court when he retired immediately after dropping the first set against Alexander Zverev.",
      "Djokovic will next face the winner of Wednesday's later quarterfinal between No. 8 Ben Shelton and two-time defending Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner.",

    "story": [
      "A new humanoid robot named Sprout, developed by Fauna Robotics, is making its debut",
      "NEW YORK -- As the new robot called Sprout walks around a Manhattan office, nodding its rectangular head, lifting its windshield wiper-like \u201ceyebrows\u201d and offering to shake your hand with its grippers, it looks nothing like the sleek and intimidating humanoids built by companies like Tesla.",
      "Sprout's charm is the point. A 5-year-old child could comfortably talk at eye level with this humanoid, which stands 3.5 feet (1 meter) tall and wears a soft, padded exterior of sage-green foam.",
      "Forged by stealth startup Fauna Robotics over two years of secret research and development, Sprout's public debut on Tuesday aims to jump-start a whole new industry of building \u201capproachable\u201d robots for homes, schools and social spaces.",
      "The robot is in many ways the first of its kind, at least in the United States, even as rapid advances in artificial intelligence and robot engineering have finally made it possible to start building such machines. If its emotive expressions and blinking lights seem vaguely familiar, it might be from generations of Star Wars droids and other endearingly clunky robotic sidekicks dreamed up in animation studios and children's literature.",
      "\u201cMost people in this industry take inspiration from the science fiction that we grew up with,\u201d said Fauna Robotics co-founder and CEO Rob Cochran. \u201cI think some do so from \u2018Westworld\u2019 and \u2018Terminator.\u2019 We do from WALL-E and Baymax and Rosie Jetson.\u201d",
      "The usual hypothesis for the commercialization of humanoid robots is that they will get their first jobs in warehouses or factories long before they are ready for homes. That's the path proposed for two of today's best-known prototypes: Tesla's Optimus, which CEO Elon Musk sees as the carmaker's future, and Boston Dynamics' Atlas, which parent company Hyundai plans to deploy in car manufacturing by 2028.",
      "Fauna looks to skip that step for an entirely different clientele: other robot tinkerers. Much as early personal computers and, later, smartphones sparked a culture of developers designing new games and applications, Sprout is a software developer platform more than just a robot. It's also a mechanically complex one that will cost buyers $50,000.",
      "That's a price some university research labs and technology entrepreneurs are already spending on China's Unitree, which sells a lightweight humanoid often seen at robotics conferences and competitions. Others have avoided Chinese hardware due to tariffs and broader security concerns.",
      "Cochran believes Fauna is \u201cthe first American company to be actively shipping robots as a developer platform\u201d and has been hand-delivering the first models. Early customers include Disney and Boston Dynamics.",
      "\u201cYou take it out of the box and you can start walking it around immediately,\u201d said Marc Theermann, chief strategy officer at Boston Dynamics, in a recent interview. \u201cSeeing their robot for the first time really lets you see the future a little bit. And if you squint, you can see how a robot like that would be welcomed into people\u2019s homes.\u201d",
      "Sprout can\u2019t lift heavy objects, but it can dance the Twist or the Floss, grab a toy block or teddy bear, or hoist itself from a chair to take a long stroll along the wood floors of Fauna\u2019s headquarters in New York City's Flatiron District.",
      "Cochran and co-founder Josh Merel, the company's chief technology officer, demonstrated the robot to The Associated Press in mid-January ahead of its public launch. Fauna employees and an AP reporter piloted the robot, using a video game controller, a phone application and a virtual-reality headset. Sprout also knows the office layout enough to be sent on a planned mission, such as to check out the inventory of the break room refrigerator.",
      "It walks slowly but steadily on uneven ground. Only once it came close to tripping, taking a sharp turn to avoid a person and instead hitting its foot on a protruding table wheel too low to the ground to be seen by Sprout's camera eyes. But the robot, built to handle what engineers call perturbation, quickly recovered its balance and kept walking, much like a clumsy person might.",

Among the first batch of Fauna's 50 employees, and a fan of science fiction writer Isaac Asimov, she previously worked on self-driving cars but was excited about joining a startup building something that might one day serve as a robot butler.",

      "Starting a robot company can be unforgiving, especially one designing personal robots. One of the few successes, Roomba vacuum maker iRobot, had a decades-long run before filing for bankruptcy protection last month.",

      "\u201cThere were a lot of really brilliant attempts. I think the technology wasn\u2019t quite there,\u201d Cochran said. \u201cI do think we\u2019re right on the precipice now where you could build a companion that is present, engaging, delightful to be around, and can also move around a space in a way that nothing ever has before.\u201d",
      "Merel, an expert in robot locomotion, previously worked for Google\u2019s DeepMind, where he focused on teaching robots using AI learning techniques in simulated environments, a controversial approach but now increasingly how robots are built. The science journal Nature published his study on an AI-powered virtual rat, co-authored with another of Fauna's research scientists, Diego Aldarondo.",
      "Cochran and Merel later worked together at CTRL-labs, a wearable neurotech company sold to Facebook in 2019. Cochran jokes that he then \u201cspent a misguided four years at Goldman Sachs\u201d before they decided to team up again.",
      "Improvements in AI, motors and batteries have accelerated humanoid development. But Fauna's founders agreed that the dystopian aesthetic of many prototypes \u2014 what Cochran calls \u201cindustrial automotive machismo\u201d \u2014 conveyed strength and confidence but wouldn't work for intimate human spaces.",
      "\u201cThey were generally quite big and physically dangerous to be around,\u201d Cochran said. \u201cStrong, heavy. If they fell on you, it\u2019d be a real problem.\u201d",
      "The duo brought in Anthony Moschella, who helped design Peloton's exercise bikes, treadmills and rowers and is an admirer of the abstract designs of Star Wars robots like R2-D2 and BB-8.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s build a system that human beings actually want to be around,\u201d said Moschella, now Fauna's vice president of hardware. \u201cI think it\u2019s incredible that so many robotics companies are not versed in the cultural context of what it means to be around a robot.\u201d",
      "Moschella said what happens next with Sprout will depend on how developers play around with it and what they learn. For Cochran, some of the most important judges have already approved. In a home video he keeps on his phone, his 2-year-old twins excitedly jump up and down as Sprout greets them.",

      "PARIS -- French lawmakers approved a bill banning social media for children under 15, paving the way for the measure to enter into force at the start of the next school year in September, as the idea of setting a minimum age for use of the platforms gains momentum across Europe.",
      "The bill, which also bans the use of mobile phones in high schools, was adopted by a 130-21 vote late Monday. French President Emmanuel Macron has requested that the legislation be fast-tracked and it will now be discussed by the Senate in the coming weeks.",
      "\u201cBanning social media for those under 15: this is what scientists recommend, and this is what the French people are overwhelmingly calling for,\u201d Macron said after the vote. \u201cBecause our children\u2019s brains are not for sale \u2014 neither to American platforms nor to Chinese networks. Because their dreams must not be dictated by algorithms.\u201d",
      "The issue is one of the very few in a divided National Assembly to attract such broad support, despite critics from the hard left denouncing provisions of the bill as infringement on civil liberties. Weakened domestically since his decision to dissolve parliament plunged France into a prolonged political crisis, Macron has strongly supported the ban, which could become one of the final major measures adopted under his leadership before he leaves office next year.",

      "According to France\u2019s health watchdog, one in two teenagers spends between two and five hours a day on a smartphone. In a report published in December, it said that some 90% of children aged between 12 and 17 use smartphones daily to access the internet, with 58% of them using their devices for social networks.",
      "The report highlighted a range of harmful effects stemming from the use of social networks, including reduced self-esteem and increased exposure to content associated with risky behaviors such as self-harm, drug use and suicide.

      "\u201cI\u2019ve done so many incredible things in my life,\u201d he said during a stop in Botswana. \u201cBut this trip is different. It opened my eyes. Africa is not what I thought.\u201d",
      "The 20-nation tour across southern, eastern and North Africa began in Angola in late December. He attended the Africa Cup of Nations final in Morocco on Jan. 18, then visited Senegal, celebrating the national soccer team\u2019s victory with fans, and Nigeria, where he passed 50 million YouTube subscribers and marked his 21st birthday.",
      "On Monday, he visited Ghana, trying jollof rice, meeting a traditional ruler and receiving a massage at the shea butter museum.",
      "\u201cI am back home, there ain\u2019t no better feeling,\u201d the content creator, whose real name is Darren Watkins Jr., said upon arriving in Ghana, revealing that his ancestry traces to the West African country. He arrived on Tuesday in Namibia, likely the tour\u2019s final stop.",
      "For his \u201cSpeed Does Africa\u201d series, Watkins streamed live on YouTube. In videos lasting up to nine hours, he sampled local dishes, learned traditional dances and challenged athletes, often shouting in excitement. Large crowds of his followers swarmed him at many of his destinations.",
      "Pape Seye, a 40-year-old resident of Senegal\u2019s capital, Dakar, highlighted Watkins\u2019 visit to the House of Slaves on Gor\u00e9e Island, a symbol of the Atlantic slave trade that sent millions of Africans into bondage.",

      "Three of the world\u2019s biggest tech companies face a landmark trial in Los Angeles starting this week over claims their platforms deliberately addict and harm children",
      "Three of the world's biggest tech companies face a landmark trial in Los Angeles starting this week over claims that their platforms \u2014 Meta's Instagram, ByteDance's TikTok and Google's YouTube \u2014 deliberately addict and harm children.",
      "Jury selection starts this week in the Los Angeles County Superior Court. It's the first time the companies will argue their case before a jury, and the outcome could have profound effects on their businesses and how they will handle children using their platforms. The selection process is expected to take at least a few days, with 75 potential jurors questioned each day through at least Thursday. A fourth company named in the lawsuit, Snapchat parent company Snap Inc., settled the case last week for an undisclosed sum.",
      "At the core of the case is a 19-year-old identified only by the initials \u201cKGM,\" whose case could determine how thousands of other, similar lawsuits against social media companies will play out. She and two other plaintiffs have been selected for bellwether trials \u2014 essentially test cases for both sides to see how their arguments play out before a jury and what damages, if any, may be awarded, said Clay Calvert, a nonresident senior fellow of technology policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute.",
      "KGM claims that her use of social media from an early age addicted her to the technology and exacerbated depression and suicidal thoughts. Importantly, the lawsuit claims that this was done through deliberate design choices made by companies that sought to make their platforms more addictive to children to boost profits. This argument, if successful, could sidestep the companies' First Amendment shield and Section 230, which protects tech companies from liability for material posted on their platforms.",
      "\u201cBorrowing heavily from the behavioral and neurobiological techniques used by slot machines and exploited by the cigarette industry, Defendants deliberately embedded in their products an array of design features aimed at maximizing youth engagement to drive advertising revenue,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "Executives, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, are expected to testify at the trial, which will last six to eight weeks. Experts have drawn similarities to the Big Tobacco trials that led to a 1998 settlement requiring cigarette companies to pay billions in health care costs and restrict marketing targeting minors.",
      "\u201cPlaintiffs are not merely the collateral damage of Defendants\u2019 products,\u201d the lawsuit says. \u201cThey are the direct victims of the intentional product design choices made by each Defendant. They are the intended targets of the harmful features that pushed them into self-destructive feedback loops.\u201d",
      "The tech companies dispute the claims that their products deliberately harm children, citing a bevy of safeguards they have added over the years and arguing that they are not liable for content posted on their sites by third parties.",
      "\u201cRecently, a number of lawsuits have attempted to place the blame for teen mental health struggles squarely on social media companies,\u201d Meta said in a recent blog post. \"But this oversimplifies a serious issue. Clinicians and researchers find that mental health is a deeply complex and multifaceted issue, and trends regarding teens' well-being aren't clear-cut or universal. Narrowing the challenges faced by teens to a single factor ignores the scientific research and the many stressors impacting young people today, like academic pressure, school safety, socio-economic challenges and substance abuse.\"",

The majority of cases filed their lawsuits in federal court, but some sued in their respective states.",

For years, researchers have found other remnants at the site, including stone tools and elephant bones with cuts on them.

      "Millions of people rely on wearable devices to monitor how well they're sleeping",
      "ATLANTA -- Your watch says you had three hours of deep sleep. Should you believe it?",
      "Millions of people rely on phone apps and wearable devices like rings, smartwatches and sensors to monitor how well they're sleeping, but these trackers don\u2019t necessarily measure sleep directly. Instead, they infer states of slumber from signals like heart rate and movement, raising questions about how reliable the information is and how seriously it should be taken.",
      "The U.S. sleep-tracking devices market generated about $5 billion in 2023 and is expected to double in revenue by 2030, according to market research firm Grand View Research. As the devices continue to gain popularity, experts say it is important to understand what they can and cannot tell you, and how their data should be used.",
      "Here's a look at the technology \u2014 and why one expert thinks its full potential has yet to be realized.",
      "Whether it's an Apple Watch, a Fitbit, an Oura Ring or one of innumerable other competitors, health and fitness trackers largely take the same basic approach by recording the wearer's movements and heart rate while at rest, according to Daniel Forger, a University of Michigan math professor who researches the science behind sleep wearables.",
      "The algorithms used by major brands have become highly accurate for determining when someone is asleep, Forger said. The devices are also somewhat helpful for estimating sleep stages, though an in-lab study would be more precise, he said.",
      "\u201cIf you really want to know definitively how much non-REM sleep you\u2019re having versus REM sleep, that\u2019s where the in-lab studies really excel,\u201d Forger said.",
      "Dr. Chantale Branson, a neurologist and professor at the Morehouse School of Medicine, said she frequently has patients showing up with sleep scores from fitness trackers in hand, sometimes fixated on granular details such as how much REM sleep they got on a certain night.",
      "Branson says those patients are taking the wrong approach: the devices help highlight trends over time but should not be viewed as a definitive measure of one's sleep health. Nor should any single night's data be seen as significant.",
      "\u201cWe would have believed them with or without the device and worked on trying to figure out why they can't sleep \u2014 and that is what the wearables do not do,\u201d she said.",
      "Branson said she thinks people who check their sleep statistics every morning would be better served by spending their efforts on \u201csleep hygiene\u201d such as creating a relaxing bedtime routine, avoiding screens before bed and making sure their sleep environment is comfortable. She advises those concerned about their sleep to consult a clinician before spending money on a wearable.",
      "Forger takes a more favorable view toward the devices, which he says help keep the overlooked importance of sleep front of mind. He recommends them even for people without significant sleep issues, saying they can offer insights that help users fine-tune their routines and feel more alert during the day.",
      "\u201cSeeing if your biological clock is in sync is a huge benefit because even if you\u2019re giving yourself the right amount of time, if you\u2019re sleeping at the wrong times, the sleep won\u2019t be as efficient,\u201d Forger said.",
      "Kate Stoye, an Atlanta-area middle school teacher, bought an Oura Ring last summer, having heard positive things from friends who used it as a fertility tracker: \u201cIt\u2019s so accurate,\u201d she said. Stoye found the ring to be just as helpful with tracking her sleep. After noticing that the few nights she drank alcohol coincided with poorer sleep quality, she decided to give up alcohol.",

      "\u201cI always struggle with going to bed, and it\u2019s often because I eat late at night,\u201d Stoye said. \u201cI know that about myself, and it knows it too.\u201d",
      "Mai Barreneche, who works in advertising in New York City, used to wear her Oura Ring constantly. She said it helped her develop good sleep habits and encouraged her to maintain a daily morning exercise regimen. But as a metric-driven person, she became \"obsessed\" enough with her nightly sleep scores that it began to cause her anxiety \u2014 a modern condition that researchers have dubbed \u201corthosomnia.\u201d",
      "\u201cI remember I would go to bed thinking about the score I was going to get in the morning,\u201d Barreneche said.",
      "Barreneche decided not to wear her ring on a beach vacation a few years ago, and when she returned home, she never put it back on. She said she has maintained the good habits the device pointed her toward, but no longer wants the stress of monitoring her nightly scores.",
      "Branson, of the Morehouse School of Medicine, said she's observed similar score-induced anxiety as a recurring issue for some patients, particularly those who set goals to achieve a certain amount of REM sleep or who shared their nightly scores with friends using the same device. Comparing sleep types and stages is ill-advised since individual needs vary by age, genetics and other factors, she said.",
      "\u201cThese devices are supposed to help you,\" Branson said. \"And if you feel anxious or worried or frustrated about it, then it\u2019s not helpful, and you should really talk to a professional.\u201d",
      "Forger thinks the promise of wearables has been underestimated, with emerging research suggesting the devices could one day be designed to help detect infections before symptoms appear and to flag sleep pattern changes that may signal the onset of depression or an increased risk of relapse.",
      "\u201cThe body is making these really interesting and really important decisions that we\u2019re not aware of to keep us healthy and active and alert at the right times of day,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have an infection, that rhythm very quickly starts to disappear because the body goes into overdrive to start fighting the infection. Those are the kind of things we can pick up.\u201d",
      "The technology could be particularly useful in low-resource communities, where wearables could help health issues to be identified more quickly and monitored remotely without requiring access to doctors or specialized clinics, according to Forger.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s this really important story that\u2019s about to come out: About just how understanding sleep rhythms and sleep architecture is going to generally improve our lives,\u201d he said.",

      "Pamela Bennett, a horticulture professor at Ohio State, said rock salt is the worst for plants. It gets them in two ways: through the roots and through the air.",
      "Salt percolates through the soil. When plants start to draw in salty water in the spring, that dries roots, leading to dry leaves. Brown tips on leaves indicate the soil might have gotten too salty.",
      "Salt can also reach plant foliage \u2014 in the winter, that's evergreens \u2014 directly when it's carried by mist and spray. That's an issue that's worse on major roads as a lot of traffic moves quickly.",

      "The central bank is widely expected to defy President Donald Trump's wishes, opting instead to hold interest rates steady. The anticipated move would end a string of three consecutive quarter-point rate cuts, aligning with a cautious approach outlined by Powell last month, before reports of the investigation into his conduct.",

      "\"There's no risk-free path for policy as we navigate this tension between our employment and inflation goals,\" Powell said.",

      "\u201cWe expect this to be the largest protest in American history,\u201d Ezra Levin, co-executive director of the nonprofit Indivisible, told The Associated Press ahead of Wednesday's announcement. He predicted that as many as 9 million people will turn out.",
      "\u201cNo Kings\u201d protests, which are organized by a constellation of groups around the country, have been a focal point for outrage over Trump's attempts to consolidate and expand his power.",
      "\u201cThis is in large part a response to a combination of the heinous attacks on our democracy and communities coming from the regime, and a sense that nobody\u2019s coming to save us,\" Levin said.",

      "Civil rights attorneys representing the detainees were seeking a temporary injunction from U.S. District Judge Sheri Polster Chappell in Fort Myers that would ensure that detainees at the state-run Everglades facility get the same access to their attorneys as they do at federally-run detention centers. The Everglades facility was built last summer at a remote airstrip by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 administration.",
      "The detainees\u2019 lawsuit claims that their First Amendment rights are being violated. They say their attorneys have to make an appointment to visit three days in advance, unlike at other immigration detention facilities where lawyers can just show up during visiting hours; that detainees often are transferred to other facilities after their attorneys had made an appointment to see them; and that scheduling delays have been so lengthy that detainees were unable to meet with attorneys before key deadlines.",
      "\u201cAccess to counsel at Alligator Alcatraz is dramatically more restrictive than at other immigration facilities and runs afoul of the requirements that Immigration and Customs Enforcement has in place for detention facilities,\u201d the civil rights attorneys wrote in their request for an injunction.",
      "State officials who are defendants in the lawsuit denied restricting the detainees' access to their attorneys and said any protocols were in place for security reasons and to make sure there was sufficient staffing. Federal officials who also are defendants said that no First Amendment rights were being violated.",

That lawsuit ended earlier this month after the immigrant detainee who filed the case agreed to be removed from the United States.",

      "Even if the majority opinion has been drafted and more or less agreed to by five or more members of the court, a separate opinion, probably in dissent, could slow things down, Phillips said.",
      "Just last week, the court issued two opinions in cases that were argued in October. All nine justices agreed with the outcome, a situation that typically allows decisions to be issued relatively quickly. But a separate opinion in each case probably delayed the decision.",
      "The court is generally moving more slowly in argued cases, perhaps because of the flood of emergency appeals the administration has brought to the justices. The first argued case wasn't decided until January this year. Typically, that happens in December, if not November.",
      "Over the last 20 years, the average turnaround time for a Supreme Court opinion was just over three months, according to data gathered by Adam Feldman, creator of Empirical SCOTUS. The timeline has increased in recent years, with the court releasing half or more of its cases in June.",

      "HOUSTON -- A Texas man who at one time escaped from custody and was on the run for three days after being sentenced to death for fatally shooting his ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend nearly 27 years ago was scheduled on Wednesday to be the first person executed in the U.S. this year.",
      "Charles Victor Thompson was condemned for the April 1998 shooting deaths of his ex-girlfriend, Glenda Dennise Hayslip, 39; and her new boyfriend, Darren Keith Cain, 30, at her apartment in the Houston suburb of Tomball.",

      "According to court records, Hayslip and Cain were dating when Thompson came to Hayslip\u2019s apartment and began arguing with Cain around 3 a.m. the night of the killings.

      "Thompson\u2019s attorneys have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stay his execution, arguing Thompson was not allowed to refute or confront the prosecution's evidence that concluded Hayslip died from a gunshot wound to the face. Thompson's attorneys have argued Hayslip actually died from flawed medical care she received after the shooting that resulted in severe brain damage sustained from oxygen deprivation following a failed intubation.",

    "story": [
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio is expected to warn that the Trump administration is ready to take new military action against Venezuela if the country's interim leadership strays from U.S. expectations",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Secretary of State Marco Rubio plans on Wednesday to warn that the Trump administration is ready to take new military action against Venezuela if the country\u2019s interim leadership strays from U.S. expectations.",
      "In prepared testimony for a hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Rubio says the U.S. is not at war with Venezuela and that its interim leaders are cooperating, but he notes that the Trump administration would not rule out using additional force if needed following a raid to capture former President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro early this month.",
      "\u201cWe are prepared to use force to ensure maximum cooperation if other methods fail,\" Rubio will say, according to his prepared opening statement released Tuesday by the State Department. \"It is our hope that this will not prove necessary, but we will never shy away from our duty to the American people and our mission in this hemisphere.\u201d",
      "As he often is called to do, Rubio, a former Florida senator, will aim to sell one of President Donald Trump\u2019s more contentious priorities to former colleagues in Congress. With the administration\u2019s foreign policy gyrating between the Western Hemisphere, Europe and the Middle East, Rubio also may be called to smooth alarm that has emerged in his own party lately about efforts like Trump\u2019s demand to annex Greenland.",
      "In the hearing focused on Venezuela, Rubio will defend Trump\u2019s decisions to remove Maduro to face drug trafficking charges in the U.S., continue deadly military strikes on boats suspected of smuggling drugs and seize sanctioned tankers carrying Venezuelan oil, according to the prepared remarks. He will again reject allegations that Trump is violating the Constitution by taking such actions.",
      "\u201cThere is no war against Venezuela, and we did not occupy a country,\u201d he will say, according to the prepared remarks. \u201cThere are no U.S. troops on the ground. This was an operation to aid law enforcement.\u201d",
      "Congressional Democrats have condemned Trump's moves as exceeding the authority of the executive branch, while most \u2014 but not all \u2014 Republicans have supported them as a legitimate exercise of presidential power.",
      "The House narrowly defeated a war powers act resolution that would have directed Trump to remove U.S. troops from Venezuela. As Rubio will argue, the administration says there are no U.S. troops on the ground in the South American nation despite a large military buildup in the region.",
      "Democrats had argued that the resolution was necessary after the U.S. raid to capture Maduro and because Trump has stated plans to control the country\u2019s oil industry for years to come.",
      "The pushback has begun in the courts, too, as the families of two Trinidadian nationals killed in a Trump administration boat strike filed what is thought to be the first wrongful death case arising from the campaign. Three dozen strikes on boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean have killed at least 126 people since September.",
      "While keeping pressure on those who the Trump administration dubs \u201cnarcotraffickers\u201d without providing evidence, U.S. officials also are working to normalize ties with Venezuelan acting President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez. Nonetheless, Rubio will make clear in his testimony that she has little choice but to comply with Trump's demands.",

      "Rodr\u00edguez, who previously served as Maduro's vice president, on Tuesday said her government and the Trump administration \u201chave established respectful and courteous channels of communication.\u201d During televised remarks, Rodr\u00edguez said she is working with Trump and Rubio to set \u201ca working agenda.\u201d",
      "So far, she has appeared to acquiesce to Trump\u2019s demands and to release prisoners jailed by the government under Maduro and his predecessor, the late Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. On Monday, the head of a Venezuelan human rights group said 266 political prisoners had been freed since Jan. 8.",

      "The Trump administration has unveiled 15 new drugs selected for a Medicare drug price negotiation program that allows the federal government to haggle directly with drug manufacturers",
      "NEW YORK -- Drugs that treat Type 2 diabetes, HIV and arthritis are among 15 new medications chosen for a Medicare drug price negotiation program that allows the federal government to haggle directly with drug manufacturers, the Trump administration said Tuesday.",
      "The drugs selected include some of the medications on which Medicare spends the most money. That means the deals negotiated this year have the potential to deliver significant savings to taxpayers when they go into effect in 2028.",
      "\u201cFor too long, seniors and taxpayers have paid the price for skyrocketing prescription drug costs,\u201d Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cUnder President Trump\u2019s leadership, CMS is taking strong action to target the most expensive drugs in Medicare, negotiate fair prices, and make sure the system works for patients \u2014 not special interests.\u201d",
      "The federal government had until Feb. 1 to announce its list of 15 drugs. The negotiations take place under a 2022 law that allows Medicare to haggle over the price it pays on the most popular and expensive prescription drugs used by older Americans.",
      "The government already has negotiated prices for 25 prescription drugs covered by Medicare, including the massively popular GLP-1 weight-loss and diabetes drugs Ozempic, Rybelsus and Wegovy. This year\u2019s negotiations mark the third round of the program and would mean a total of 40 drugs with lower prices for Medicare enrollees.",
      "This year also marks the first time drugs payable under Medicare Part B are eligible for inclusion in the program. Medicare Part B drugs are outpatient prescriptions, such as medications infused or injected at a doctor\u2019s office. Retail prescription drugs covered under Medicare Part D are also eligible, as they were in past years.",
      "The newly announced drugs up for negotiation include the popular Type 2 diabetes drug Trulicity and an HIV medication called Biktarvy. The neurotoxin Botox, frequently used to reduce the appearance of wrinkles, will also have its price negotiated, but only for Medicare-covered uses, such as treating migraines or overactive bladders.",
      "Among the other drugs selected are treatments for psoriasis, ulcerative colitis, chronic lung disease, depression and various cancers.",
      "Over the past year, some 1.8 million Medicare Part B or Part D enrollees used the 15 drugs, according to the Trump administration. They accounted for about 6% in total Part B and Part D spending, CMS said.",

      "Federal Reserve officials are expected to keep their short-term interest rate unchanged Wednesday after three cuts last year, ignoring huge pressure for lower borrowing costs from the White House in favor of waiting to see how the economy evolves",
      "WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve officials are expected to keep their short-term interest rate unchanged Wednesday after three cuts last year, ignoring huge pressure for lower borrowing costs from the White House in favor of waiting to see how the economy evolves.",
      "The central bank's rate reductions last year were intended to shore up the economy and prevent a sharper deterioration in the job market, after hiring slowed to a near-crawl in the wake of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs last April. Yet there are signs that unemployment has stabilized and the economy could be picking up. At the same time, inflation remains stubbornly above the Fed's 2% target. All those trends argue for keeping rates where they are.",
      "A key issue that Chair Jerome Powell will likely address at his news conference Wednesday is how long the Fed will remain on hold. The rate-setting committee remains split between those officials opposed to further cuts until inflation comes down, and those who want to lower rates to further support hiring.",
      "In December, just 12 of the 19 participants in the committee's meetings supported at least one more rate cut this year. Most economists forecast the Fed will cut twice this year, most likely at the June meeting or later.",
      "Fed officials meet this week in the shadow of unprecedented pressure from the Trump White House. Powell said Jan. 11 that the Fed had received subpoenas from the Justice Department as part of a criminal investigation into his congressional testimony about a $2.5 billion building renovation. Powell in an unusually blunt video statement said the subpoenas were a pretext to punish the Fed for not cutting rates more quickly.",
      "And last week, the Supreme Court took up Trump's attempt from last year to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook over allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies. No president has fired a governor in the Fed\u2019s 112-year history. The justices at an oral argument appeared to be leaning toward allowing her to stay in her job until the case is resolved.",
      "At the same time, Trump has suggested he is close to naming a new Fed Chair, to replace Powell once his term ends in May. The announcement could come as soon as this week, though it has been delayed before.",
      "The president's efforts to pressure the Fed may have backfired, economists say, as Republicans in the Senate voiced support for Powell and threatened to block Trump's replacement chair.",
      "\u201cThe last couple of weeks have been pretty positive for Fed independence,\u201d said Patricia Zobel, a former official at the New York Fed and now head of macroeconomic research at Guggenheim Invesments.",
      "Even so, all the turmoil may have led Powell to hunker down as he nears the end of his term as chair. Vincent Reinhart, a former Fed economist and now chief economist at BNY Investments, noted that Powell has given just one speech touching on the economy since September.",
      "He could be letting other Fed officials take on the job of explaining why the central bank may hold off on rate cuts in the coming months, Reinhart said. It also underscores that the chair does not make decisions on rates alone, he added,",

      "In a speech earlier this month, Paulson said an improving economy should allow more rate cuts later in the year.",

      "NEW YORK -- A man on trial for bludgeoning four men to death with a metal bar as they slept on the New York City streets had been diagnosed with schizophrenia when he left jail months earlier and was hearing voices telling him he needed to kill 40 people or he would die too, his lawyer told jurors on Tuesday.",
      "Randy Santos, 31, is asserting an insanity defense at his trial in state court in Manhattan. Through his lawyers, he has acknowledged committing the 2019 Chinatown rampage. But, they argue, he is not criminally responsible because mental illness has polluted his mind with irrational thoughts and left him prone to violence.",
      "If they succeed, Santos could be sent to a psychiatric treatment facility instead of prison.",
      "\u201cHe needed the voices to stop. He needed to save his own life,\" Santos\u2019 lawyer, Marnie Zien, said in an opening statement. \u201cHe saw no other way out.\u201d",
      "Santos, 31, has pleaded not guilty to charges including first-degree murder in the deaths of Florencio Moran, Nazario V\u00e1squez Villegas, Anthony Manson and Chuen Kok and attempted murder charges for assaults that left two other men severely injured. They were among 319 killings in New York City in 2019, including 52 in Manhattan.",
      "Surveillance video captured Santos \u201crepeatedly lifting the bar up over his head and bringing it down on the head\u201d of one victim, Assistant District Attorney Alfred Peterson told jurors.",
      "A couple out on a date on Manhattan\u2019s Bowery street saw him beating another man with the same weapon, Peterson said. Police found Santos carrying the bar, which was covered with blood and hair. Testing showed it had his DNA on one end and blood from some of his victims on the other, the prosecutor said.",
      "If the jury convicts Santos, rejecting his insanity defense, he could be sentenced to life in prison. Otherwise, he could be involuntarily committed to treatment for as long as necessary.",
      "Peterson urged jurors to look past Santos' mental health claims and find him guilty on all charges, telling them that evidence will show that Santos \u201cknew exactly what he was doing and the consequences of what he was doing \u2014 that he was killing these men,\" the prosecutor said.",
      "Santos looked up and down the street and \u201csaw the coast was clear\u201d before starting the attack, Peterson said. He then paused to let a pedestrian \u2014 and potential witness \u2014 leave the area before wailing on another man, Peterson said. He knew \u201cit was legally and morally wrong,\u201d the prosecutor said.",
      "Santos even recognized himself in surveillance video of the attack, Peterson said. Shown the footage after his arrest, he told police: \u201cYea, that\u2019s me.\u201d",
      "Santos, a native of the Dominican Republic who moved to New York as a child, attacked five men between 1:30 a.m. and 2 a.m. on Oct. 5, 2019, bashing their heads repeatedly with a 4-foot (1.2 meter) bar he found on the street, Peterson said. The victims ranged in age from 39 to 83.",

He listened to Zien\u2019s opening statement through a Spanish interpreter, but moved his headphones off his ear as Peterson spoke.",
      "Prevailing with an insanity defense can be particularly tough in New York. Santos\u2019 lawyers must convince the jury that he didn\u2019t understand the consequences of his actions and didn\u2019t know right from wrong. The strategy has had mixed results.",

      "Each is among a growing number of people \u2014 at least 10, as of Tuesday \u2014 who died after being exposed to the bitter cold that has persisted in New York City since late last Friday.",
      "Their causes of death are still under investigation, but some showed signs of having succumbed to hypothermia. Officials said several victims were believed to have been living on the streets. At least six of the fatalities came early Saturday, as the temperature in the city fell to 9 degrees (minus 13 degrees Celsius).",
      "With the frigid weather expected to continue, Mayor Zohran Mamdani said the city was adding additional homeless outreach workers, opening new warming centers and instructing hospitals to limit discharges \u201cto ensure that people who have nowhere to go are kept indoors.\u201d",
      "But the rising death toll has also prompted questions about whether Mamdani\u2019s nascent administration could have done more to protect the city\u2019s most vulnerable residents ahead of the Arctic blast and the snowstorm that hit early Sunday.",
      "One of the victims, a 52-year-old man living in Queens, was found Sunday morning with discharge papers in his pocket showing he had been released from Elmhurst Hospital, a city-run facility, on Friday, according to State Senator Jessica Ramos.",
      "By the time of his release, the city had already activated its Code Blue protocols, a set of extreme weather policies that include precautions meant to ensure homeless patients are not released back onto the street.",
      "It was not immediately clear if the man, who is originally from Ecuador, had been living outside at the time of his death. Inquiries to City Hall, the Department of Homeless Services and the city\u2019s public hospital system were not returned.",
      "The city has yet to release the names of any of those who died during the storm.",

      "Studies have shown that around 15 people suffer from cold-related deaths in New York City each year. But homeless advocates said they could not remember another storm in recent memory that resulted in so many deaths outside in such a brief period.",
      "\u201cThe fact that this many people have passed away shows the city needs to do a much better job of making people feel safe when they come inside,\u201d said David Giffen, the executive director of the Coalition for the Homeless. \u201cIt\u2019s not that most of the people on the streets are unaware of the shelter system, but that they\u2019ve had experiences there that make them not want to return.\"",
      "In the lead-up to the storm, city-contracted outreach teams fanned out across the five boroughs, attempting to coax residents to accept placements in shelters, transitional housing or even heated buses. Mamdani and his deputies have repeatedly urged New Yorkers to look out for those in need of help.",
      "\u201cExtreme weather is not a personal failure, but it is a public responsibility,\u201d Mamdani said on Tuesday. \u201cWe are mobilizing every resource at our disposal to ensure that New Yorkers are brought indoors during this potentially lethal weather event.\u201d",
      "The city\u2019s social services commissioner, Molly Wasow Park, said at least 200 people have voluntarily accepted shelter since the storm began. She said the city has also moved to involuntarily hospitalize a handful of people, including those who were wet, inappropriately dressed or \u201cunable to acknowledge that there are real dangers.\u201d",
      "Ramos said the man discovered on the park bench was wearing only a thin jacket. His body appeared to be frozen when it was found by police under a layer of snow on Sunday morning.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s devastating to know the government could have done more and didn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are real questions here that demand answers.\u201d",

      "Yale follows a wave of prestigious universities that have made similar moves to help widen campus diversity in recent years, including Harvard University, Princeton University, the University of Pennsylvania, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

After the shots were fired, Shifflett immediately shouted, \u201cStop reaching,\u201d and told other officers that he saw Johnson putting his hand in his waistband.

    "story": [
      "The National Transportation Safety Board says the placement of a helicopter route so close to Reagan National Airport's secondary runway was a key factor in causing a midair aircraft collision that killed 67 people near Washington, D.C., a year ago",
      "WASHINGTON -- National Transportation Safety Board members were deeply troubled Tuesday over years of ignored warnings about helicopter traffic dangers and other problems, long before an American Airlines jet and an Army Black Hawk collided a year ago, killing 67 people near Washington, D.C.",
      "A helicopter route in the approach path of a Reagan National Airport runway created a dangerous airspace and irregular safety reviews made it worse, the board said. That was a key factor in the crash along with air traffic overly relying on asking helicopter pilots to avoid aircraft.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration took steps to address those major concerns not long after the crash, but throughout the daylong hearing, investigators emphasized the history of unaddressed risks. Those include the FAA denying a regional supervisor's 2023 request to reduce air traffic at Reagan and failures to relocate the helicopter route or warn pilots more after an eerily similar near miss in 2013.",
      "NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy made no apology for her occasionally stern tone.",
      "\u201cWe should be angry. This was 100% preventable. We\u2019ve issued recommendations in the past that were applicable to use. We have talked about seeing and avoid for well over five decades. It\u2019s shameful. I don\u2019t want to be here years from now looking at other families that had to suffer such devastating loss.\u201d",
      "Family members listened intently during the hearing. Some were escorted out, including two in tears, as they saw an animation recreating some of final moments of their loved ones' lives. Others wore black shirts bearing the names of first responder units.",
      "\u201cThe negligence of not fixing things that needed to be fixed killed my brother and 66 other people,\u201d Kristen Miller-Zahn, who watched from the front row, said during a break.",
      "The animations demonstrated how difficult it would have been for the pilots to spot each other amid the lights of Washington. They also showed how the windshields and the helicopter crew\u2019s night vision goggles restricted views.",
      "Victims\u2019 families say they hope there\u2019s meaningful change in response to the long list of recommendations the NTSB adopted Tuesday. The measures seek to improve airport training, staffing and safety, particularly at Reagan, as well as the culture of safety within the FAA and Army.",
      "More than 30 of the recommendations are directed at the FAA. Making sure that controllers and their supervisors are properly trained and understand when visual separation can be used is key. But the NTSB also wants the FAA to reconsider the way it classifies Reagan airport and reevaluate all of its helicopter routes while making better use of data.",
      "Before hearing from investigators, Todd Inman said \u201csystemic issues across multiple organizations,\u201d not an error by any individual, caused the tragedy, although the NTSB did also highlight several key mistakes.",
      "Everyone aboard the jet, flying from Wichita, Kansas, and the helicopter died when the two aircraft collided and plummeted into the icy Potomac River. It was the deadliest plane crash on U.S. soil since 2001, and the victims included 28 members of the figure skating community.",
      "The FAA took some action immediately after the crash and last week made some changes permanent to ensure helicopters and planes no longer share the same airspace around the airport.",
      "Homendy said she couldn\u2019t believe the FAA didn\u2019t realize this helicopter route provided at most a mere 75 feet (23 meters) of separation between planes landing on Reagan\u2019s secondary runway.",
      "\u201cWe know over time concerns were raised repeatedly, went unheard, squashed \u2014 however you want to put it \u2014 stuck in red tape and bureaucracy of a very large organization,\u201d Homendy said.",
      "Mary Schiavo, a former Department of Transportation Inspector General, said it's troubling to hear how many times the FAA failed to act.",

      "The board recommended the FAA seek outside advice on improvements from the department\u2019s Inspector General rather than create a single office to track concerns and enforce standards. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy had announced the new safety office Monday.",
      "NTSB investigators said the Army and FAA weren\u2019t sharing all safety data with each other before the crash, and that Army helicopter pilots often weren\u2019t aware when they were involved in a near-miss around Reagan.",
      "NTSB investigator Katherine Wilson said an air traffic controller felt a \u201clittle overwhelmed\u201d when traffic volume increased to 10 aircraft about 10 to 15 minutes before the collision, but then \u201cfelt the volume was manageable when one or two helicopters left.\"",
      "Yet about 90 seconds before the collision, Wilson said, \u201ctraffic volume increased to a maximum of 12 aircraft consisting of seven airplanes and five helicopters. Radio communication showed that the local controller was shifting focus between airborne, ground and transiting aircraft.\u201d",
      "The workload \u201creduced his situational awareness,\u201d Wilson said. If two controllers had divided up responsibility for helicopters and planes, like they were supposed to at that time of day, the aircraft might have been warned sooner and prevented the collision.",
      "Many changes recommended by the NTSB will depend on how Congress, the Army and the Trump administration respond after the hearing. A bill that Homendy has endorsed would require aircraft to have advanced locator systems to help prevent collisions, which NTSB has recommended for years. The senators who introduced it believe their proposal would address many of the NTSB\u2019s concerns, but they are already discussing a hearing in the next few months to dig deeper into the final report and recommendations.",
      "NTSB also recommends adjusting collision avoidance systems to direct pilots to take evasive action closer to the ground. Research by agency investigators shows alerting pilots down to 300 feet (91 meters) rather than 900 feet could eliminate 90% of all near misses.",
      "Before Tuesday, the NTSB had already spelled out many key factors that contributed to the crash. Investigators said controllers in the Reagan tower overly relied on asking pilots to spot aircraft and maintain visual separation.",
      "The night of the crash, the controller approved the Black Hawk's request to do that twice. However, the investigation has shown that the helicopter pilots likely never spotted the American Airlines plane as the jet circled to land on the little-used secondary runway.",
      "In a statement, the FAA said safety remains its top priority. It has reduced hourly plane arrivals at Reagan airport from 36 to 30 and worked to increase tower staff. The agency said it has 22 certified controllers in the tower and eight more in training.",
      "\u201cWe will diligently consider any additional recommendations\u201d from the NTSB, the FAA said.",
      "Several high-profile crashes and close calls followed the Washington collision, alarming travelers. But NTSB statistics show the lowest number of crashes since the pandemic hit in 2020, with 1,405 nationwide.",

      "Dr. Bill Smock: There was a braided nylon marine rope three feet from Joanna. \u2026 The murder weapon was there in the room with Joanna. \u2026 When you look at the photos of the mark that was created on her neck, the only thing in that closet that could have created that was the marine rope.",

      "Smock, who works for Alliance for HOPE, confirmed their suspicion.",

      "Capt. Jackson Harris: And other than creating a hypothetical situation that Mark murdered her, there is no evidence to support that. \u2026",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: The prior incidents of domestic violence, those were \u2014 I'm \u2014 I'm \u2014 those were not considered at the time of the death. You're right. But that doesn't mean that they were the cause of death.",
      "Natalie Morales: Knowing all that you know now though, you said \u2026 You would've called Mark Lewis's past into question and you would've investigated it differently.",

    "published": "Sun, 25 Jan 2026 10:11:19 -0500",
    "summary": "As the face of Revlon, Lauren Hutton \u2013 called a \"believable beauty\" \u2013 became the highest-paid model in history, and still holds the record for most cover appearances on American Vogue. She talks about her adventurous life of no regrets.",
    "story": [
      "Lauren Hutton was told again and again in the 1960s that she wasn't cut out to be a model. She recalled being told, \"'You've got that space between your teeth, your eyes are crossed a lotta the times. I had improper \u2026 everything.'\"",
      "While the gap in her teeth was sometimes visible, in the beginning she was discouraged from showing it. \"I had to buy a little $300 plastic thing that went there, that I would sneeze out and lose,\" she said.",
      "She still owns the record for most cover appearances on American Vogue: 26. And at 82, she still has that smile.",
      "Asked how she feels having been the first supermodel, Hutton said, \"Yeah, certainly, if it was about money. And I changed the whole money system.\"",
      "In 1973, Revlon signed her to an exclusive deal for a quarter of a million dollars a year, then the biggest contract in modeling history.",
      "Coming from college in New Orleans, she saw New York as a gateway to the world and to the wild places she wanted to visit. Ask her about modeling, and somehow you'll almost always end up in Africa: \"I lived with pygmies, and I lived with Karamojong, and I lived with Kalahari bushmen,\" she said. \"You're constantly excited. You're constantly thrilled. And everything's beautiful. My life was none of this stuff. My life was traveling. That's the only reason I came to New York.\"",
      "\"You never really wanted to be a model?\" I asked.",
      "\"Never heard of it!\"",
      "\"In so many ways, it was all an accident.\"",
      "\"Amen! Amen!\" Hutton replied. \"I've always been lucky. I was born lucky.\"",
      "A \"believable\" beauty",
      "She was born Mary Laurence Hutton in Charleston, South Carolina, during World War II. Her dad was an Army pilot overseas: \"He wrote me every single day from the war. And my mother, very kindly and beautifully, put it into books for me.\"",
      "Her parents split in 1945. Lauren grew up in Florida with an abusive stepfather. So, she treasured her father's letters: \"'Cause I wanted my daddy bad,\" she said.",
      "But she never met him. \"No. No. But he gave me a love, enough love in those letters that held me all this time, and made me love men!\" she laughed.",
      "Hutton made her screen debut in 1963 as a decoy contestant on the TV game show \"To Tell the Truth,\" while working as a \"Bunny\" at the Playboy Club in New York City. But at the beginning she was turned down by five modeling agencies.",
      "Eileen Ford, who'd call Hutton a \"believable\" beauty, finally gave her a shot, later admitting, \"I still don't know what made me take her.\"",
      "Hutton was sent to see the legendary editor of Vogue, Diana Vreeland, a meeting Hutton described as \"heaven.\" \"And she said, 'You!' And I looked, and she had pointed this long, beautiful finger at me. And she said, 'You have quite a presence.' I had no idea what that was. What was a presence? But I took a chance, and I said, 'Well, you sure do!'\"",
      "Vreeland quickly connected her with one of Vogue's top photographers, Richard Avedon. \"And he made wonderful \u2013 they're still some of the best pictures I ever took,\" Hutton said.",
      "Avedon and Hutton became frequent collaborators. Soon she was the hottest model in the country, and a household name. Artist Robert Rauschenberg, a friend and neighbor, created a collage portrait of her. Hutton landed film roles, too, in \"Paper Lion\" with Alan Alda; \"The Gambler\" with James Caan; and \"American Gigolo\" with Richard Gere.",
      "I asked, \"For someone who didn't want to be a model, or an actress, you turn out to be really good at it. And you seem to not only understand how to do it, but you seemed to figure out the economics of it?\"",
      "\"Twice. I did that twice,\" Hutton said. \"'Cause Bob lost all the first bunch.\"",
      "\"Bob\" was Bob Williamson, for nearly three decades her boyfriend, father figure, and financial manager. Hutton said, \"You'd hear all those girls say, 'Well, my sweetheart's in high finance. What is yours in?' I'd say, 'Low finance.' And I was right!\"",
      "They travelled the world together, until she discovered he'd lost nearly $13 million of her money. \"Bob was very, very smart about all kinds of stuff,\" she said.",
      "\"But he also lost all your money?\"",
      "\"Yeah. But you know what? I'd do it again in a second,\" Hutton said.",
      "She went back to fashion and earned her fortune all over again. \"I just kept on plugging at it,\" she said.",
      "Resilience is a recurring theme in Hutton's life. In 2000, a motorcycle accident knocked her 20 feet into the air: \"I can remember every second of it, and it was really sort of rapturous.\"",
      "She'd been riding to Las Vegas with a group of friends that included Jeremy Irons and Dennis Hopper, and was badly hurt: \"Oh, I was dead, and I wasn't breathing at all. Those boys saved me. My gang, my guys saved my life. My wingmen! Don't make me start crying!\"",
      "But the cover girl came back from that, too.",
      "Lauren Hutton has never regretted an adventure. \"I was not there to see myself on the stands,\" she said. \"I was there to get the money to go see the world. I've had a great life. I've been very lucky.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-art-of-ruth-asawa/",
    "published": "Sun, 25 Jan 2026 09:39:52 -0500",
    "summary": "In her choice of media, sculptor Ruth Asawa (1926-2013) employed a resourcefulness that stemmed from her early years on a farm \u2013 and in a WWII detention camp for Japanese Americans. She's now the subject of a retrospective at New York's Museum of Modern Art.",
    "story": [
      "Artist Ruth Asawa's San Francisco Fountain, in the city's Union Square, is an endless treasure trove of Bay Area knowledge. \"Some people refer to it as sort of a Where's Waldo?, because there are so many things to find,\" said her son, Paul Lanier. \"You can find Willie Mays, the San Francisco Giants, the opera, city hall, the library.\"",
      "It's just one of Asawa's eleven public works in the city, and a reminder to Paul Lanier and his sister, Addie Lanier \u2013 the youngest of her six children \u2013 of their mother's commitment to community, and her ability to make art out of anything. \"She said that she would be fulfilled making something out of mud and paper, because it's the process that is the important thing for the artist,\" said Addie.",
      "Asawa, who would have turned 100 this year, is best known for her looped wire structures, a continuous line of wire bent and woven to create a free-hanging sculpture. Addie said, \"The media that she worked in is very economical. It's industrial wire. It's like the baling wire that you would find on a farm.\"",
      "Asawa learned to be resourceful from a young age, finding materials everywhere. Her media ranged from baker's clay in the kitchen, to recycled paper.",
      "Asked what she was like as a mom, Paul replied, \"Well, she's just like your mom, or anyone's mom, making lunches and breakfast, getting people out of the house.\"",
      "\"But she used blow torches on the front deck!\" laughed Addie.",
      "Asawa spent her early years on a farm in Southern California, working alongside her parents. Her childhood was cut short during World War II when she (along with other Japanese-Americans) was sent to a detention camp \u2013 incarcerated along with more than 120,000 people of Japanese descent under Executive Order 9066.",
      "There, in the face of incredible adversity, she first learned to draw. Cara Manes, the curator of a Ruth Asawa retrospective now on view at New York's Museum of Modern Art, said Asawa attended \"grassroots drawing lessons that were led by fellow detainees who were animators for the Disney Studios.\"",
      "After the war, Asawa landed at North Carolina's famed arts school Black Mountain College, where she honed her skills with mentors like German-born artist Josef Albers and choreographer Merce Cunningham.",
      ", Her dynamic sculptures appear to have a life of their own. \"They're really animated,\" said Manes, \"and they change as you move around them.\"",
      "A special aspect of Asawa's work is its unpredictable rhythm. Manes said, \"Sometimes by looking at the shadow cast by a given sculpture, you can understand how many layers of wire mesh there is, you know, in a way that you might not be able to discern from head-on.\"",
      "Everyone could become art in Asawa's home, according to her children. Paul said, \"If someone came over she would say, 'You have such a nice face. Can I cast it?' And so they would say yes. They didn't know what they were agreeing to!\"",
      "\"But she could get away with it,\" Addie said. \"She could do this with total strangers.\"",
      "While her works fetch millions at auction now, Asawa didn't find much commercial success during her lifetime. But that wasn't her purpose, say her children.",
      "Asked what she hopes people discover from her mother's work, Addie replied, \"I think people breathe. I think people take a big, deep breath and go, 'Oh my God.' I think it's, like, wonder and awe to see that something like this exists, that was made by hand. It's kind of the experiment of what one person can do. You are that experiment. Go forth. Do something with your life, you know? Learn a technique, do something, pass it on, right?\"",

      "The show \u2014 based on a series of books,\"Game Changers,\" by Rachel Reid \u2014 is only loosely based on hockey, and features more romance between two professional hockey stars on rival teams than slick moves on the ice. Yet SeatGeek data suggests that Heated Rivalry, which stars Hudson Williams and Connor Storrie, has driven a \"noticeable spike\" in demand for NHL tickets and revenue for the league, according to the ticket seller.",
      "The mobile ticketing company said it saw weekly hockey ticket sales rise more than 20% after the show first aired.",
      "\"When HBO released 'Heated Rivalry' earlier this winter, the series didn't just light up social media feeds, it may have sent fans straight to hockey games themselves,\" SeatGeek\u00a0said in an analysis of ticket sales through its platform.",
      "There was no similar surge in demand during the same period a year ago.",
      "\"In short, the strong lift seen so far this year did not exist during the same stretch last season, which could suggest that something beyond normal NHL demand patterns may be at play,\" SeatGeek added.",
      "SeatGeek also saw a rise in both single-ticket sales among fans attending games on their own, plus stronger demand from first-time game attendees.",
      "\"'Heated Rivalry' has certainly piqued interest in hockey and the NHL,\" SeatGeek marketing director Chris Leyden said in a statement. \"We are seeing it both in terms of more people on SeatGeek shopping for NHL tickets, as well as a pretty notable increase in single ticket buyers as more people check out a game, often for the first time ever.\"",

      "Because this year's race included a new category for casting, many thought that might help tip the scales. However, since \"Sinners\" blew past the old record and scored a total of 16 nominations, the film didn't even need the new category to set that new record.",

      "After \"Wicked\" earned 10 Oscar nominations last year, many thought its sequel would factor into at least a few races, despite more tepid critical notices. In the end, the film was blanked entirely. Not quite as stark a departure from earlier heats, but James Cameron's \"Avatar: Fire and Ash\" also earned just two nominations, a franchise low.",

There will also be short film programs, experimental and episodic works, and conversations and panel discussions with filmmakers and Sundance alumni. [Click here\u00a0for ticket information.]",
      "This year's Sundance Film Festival is the last to be held in Park City. The festival \u2014 which originated in 1978 as the United States Film Festival, before being taken over by the Sundance Institute \u2014 has outgrown its location and will be held next year in Boulder, Colorado.",
      "This also marks the first festival to be held since the passing of Robert Redford, who helped shape the festival into a champion for independent filmmakers and creatives from marginalized communities.",
      "Amanda Kelso, acting CEO of the Sundance Institute, said, \"The 2026 Sundance Film Festival will be a truly pivotal and memorable moment as we celebrate artists and their visionary works, honor our Sundance Institute founder, Robert Redford, and his transformative vision, and show our gratitude to Utah by commemorating our collective journey.\"",
      "Part of that commemoration is through retrospective screenings of some of the biggest hits to have come out of Sundance, from \"Little Miss Sunshine\" to \"Half Nelson,\" starring Ryan Gosling.",
      "As a sign of how far the festival has come, this year's program was selected from more than 16,200 submissions, including 4,255 feature-length films, from 164 countries or territories. Jury prizes will be awarded in the categories of domestic and international narrative and non-fiction films, shorts, and the NEXT sidebar (which promotes innovative approaches to storytelling).",

      "\"Broken English\" is a genre-twisting tribute to Marianne Faithfull, who died a year ago, and features Tilda Swinton, George MacKay, Nick Cave, Suki Waterhouse and others painting a portrait of the singer-songwriter.",
      "Justice, civil rights and equality are the themes of \"Who Killed Alex Odeh?\"\u00a0about the search for truth in the 1985 California bombing that killed a prominent Palestinian American activist; \"Everybody to Kenmure Street,\"\u00a0in which hundreds of residents in a Scottish neighborhood fight off a deportation raid affecting their neighbors; \"Soul Patrol,\"\u00a0a history of the first Black special operations team of the Vietnam War; and \"Sentient,\"\u00a0an investigation into laboratory research on primates.",

      "Art and media are the focus of several films: \"Public Access\" traces the history of the development of public access television, as it grew from a legally-required offering on New York City cable TV in the early 1970s, to a controversial battleground for free speech. \"Seized\" recounts the story of a newspaper in the small town of Marion, Kansas, that was raided by police, unearthing a deeper story about abuse of power, community journalism, and the fact that \"deleted\" text messages aren't necessarily gone forever.",
      "\"Once Upon a Time in Harlem\" brings to life footage captured by the late filmmaker William Greaves when he documented a 1972 gathering of the living luminaries of the Harlem Renaissance. Mark Cousins' \"The Story of Documentary Film\" looks at the evolution of non-fiction cinema.",

      "With the IRS now accepting people's tax returns for 2025, a federal watchdog is warning Americans to beware of so-called phishing and smishing scams designed to trick people into unwittingly handing over their personal information.",
      "One common scam: robo-emails or texts bearing the subject line \"tax refund\" that appear to come from the IRS or a state tax office, the Federal Trade Commission said in an online notice. Recipients are told their tax refund has been \"processed\" or \"approved,\" but that they must verify their identity by clicking a link and providing personal information, such as a Social Security number and bank account details.",

Such calls are also intended to pilfer people's personal information, according to the FTC, which urges anyone to immediately hang up.",

    "story": [
      "Meta and YouTube are in court this week over allegations that their social media platforms can be addictive and harmful to children, while TikTok on Tuesday chose to settle the closely watched case.",
      "At the heart of the case are allegations by a 19-year-old plaintiff, identified only as \"KGM,\" who claims that using social media from a young age caused her to become addicted to the technology, which led her to develop depression and suicidal thoughts.",
      "TikTok was also scheduled to be part of the trial, but it has settled with the plaintiff, according to Matthew Bergman, the founding attorney of the Social Media Victims Law Center, which is representing KGM.",
      "Joseph VanZandt, co-lead counsel for the plaintiff, said in a statement Tuesday that TikTok remains a defendant in other personal injury cases.",
      "TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "A fourth company named in the lawsuit, Snapchat parent company Snap, also settled the case last week for an undisclosed sum.",
      "Potential bellwether",
      "Legal experts have said the trial could be a bellwether for more than a thousand similar cases brought against social media players in recent years. Depending on the outcome, tech giants could be forced to overhaul their platforms, CBS News Philadelphia reported.",
      "The trial will also serve as a test case to see what damages, if any, may be awarded to plaintiffs, said Clay Calvert, a nonresident senior fellow of technology policy studies at the nonpartisan American Enterprise Institute.",
      "The trial, which kicks off this week in Los Angeles County Superior Court, is the first time major social media companies will argue their case before a jury. The jury selection process is expected to take several days, with 75 potential jurors questioned each day.",
      "KGM's lawsuit alleges that the social media addiction and mental illness she suffered were caused by deliberate design choices made by companies that sought to make their platforms more addictive to children to boost profits. This argument, if successful, could sidestep the companies' First Amendment shield and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects tech companies from liability for material posted on their platforms.",
      "\"Borrowing heavily from the behavioral and neurobiological techniques used by slot machines and exploited by the cigarette industry, Defendants deliberately embedded in their products an array of design features aimed at maximizing youth engagement to drive advertising revenue,\" the lawsuit says.",
      "A Meta spokesperson said in a statement Monday that the company strongly disagrees with the allegations outlined in the lawsuit and that it's \"confident the evidence will show our longstanding commitment to supporting young people.\"",
      "Jos\u00e9 Casta\u00f1eda, a Google spokesperson, said Monday that the allegations against YouTube are \"simply not true.\" Google is the parent company of YouTube.",
      "\"Providing young people with a safer, healthier experience has always been core to our work,\" Casta\u00f1eda added.",
      "Zuckerberg expected to testify",
      "Executives, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, are expected to testify at the trial, which will last six to eight weeks. Experts have drawn similarities to the Big Tobacco trials that led to a 1998 settlement requiring cigarette companies to pay billions in healthcare costs and restrict marketing targeting minors.",
      "\"Plaintiffs are not merely the collateral damage of Defendants' products,\" the lawsuit says. \"They are the direct victims of the intentional product design choices made by each Defendant. They are the intended targets of the harmful features that pushed them into self-destructive feedback loops.\"",
      "The tech companies dispute the claims that their products deliberately harm children, citing a bevy of safeguards they have added over the years and arguing that they are not liable for content posted on their sites by third parties.",
      "\"Recently, a number of lawsuits have attempted to place the blame for teen mental health struggles squarely on social media companies,\" Meta said in a recent blog post. \"But this oversimplifies a serious issue. Clinicians and researchers find that mental health is a deeply complex and multifaceted issue, and trends regarding teens' well-being aren't clear-cut or universal. Narrowing the challenges faced by teens to a single factor ignores the scientific research and the many stressors impacting young people today, like academic pressure, school safety, socio-economic challenges and substance abuse.\"",
      "School lawsuits",
      "The case will be the first in a slew of cases beginning this year that seek to hold social media companies responsible for harming children's mental well-being. A federal trial beginning in June in Oakland, California, will be the first to represent school districts that have sued social media platforms over harms to children.",
      "In addition, more than 40 state attorneys general have filed lawsuits against Meta, claiming it is harming young people and contributing to the youth mental health crisis by deliberately designing features on Instagram and Facebook that addict children to its platforms. The majority of cases filed their lawsuits in federal court, but some sued in their respective states.",
      "TikTok also faces similar lawsuits in more than a dozen states.",

      "Six states are stepping up their efforts to offset the cost of Affordable Care Act (ACA) plans after a lapse in federal funding left millions of Americans facing higher premiums.",
      "California, Colorado, Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts and New Mexico have all ramped up their state-funded ACA subsidies for 2026 in response to the expiration of federal\u00a0tax credits\u00a0at the end of last year, according to Louise Norris, a health policy analyst for Healthinsurance.org.",
      "The states \"modified or enhanced their programs directly to address the reduction in federal premium subsidies,\" she said.",
      "A total of 10 states around the nation offer subsidies on top of federal ACA tax credits.",
      "Congress has been locked in debate for months over the fate of the federal ACA tax credits, but has yet to reach a resolution. In the meantime, some ACA enrollees have seen their premium prices spike. Open enrollment for Obamacare, as the government health care program is known,\u00a0ended in most states on Jan. 15.",
      "Nonprofit health group KFF reports\u00a0that a number of states, especially those operating what are known as State-Based Marketplaces (SBMs), have been preparing for the lapse of ACA tax credits for months. New Mexico, for example, decided to fully offset the loss of the federal tax credits for all of its residents, including recent immigrants.",
      "\"They actually saw a 17% increase in enrollment for 2026, versus 2025,\" Norris said of New Mexico.",
      "Nationwide enrollment in ACA coverage has fallen sharply in recent months, according to figures from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",
      "Other states are taking a more targeted approach, offering assistance to ACA enrollees based on their household income. California, for instance, is making up for the loss of premium tax credits, but only for ACA enrollees who earn up to 150% of the federal poverty level.",
      "Take the example of a Sacramento resident making $22,000 a year. That person would have to pay $29 a month, or $67 a month, to access two silver-level ACA plans without California's subsidies, Norris explained. However, with the additional state assistance, that person would owe $0 in premium cost for those same plans.",
      "California's subsidies will only offset a portion of the $2.5 billion the state is losing in federal tax credit assistance,\u00a0according\u00a0to Healthinsurance.org.",
      "Colorado is offering ACA participants with income up to 400% of the federal poverty level an $80 subsidy to offset their monthly premium, along with an additional $29 for each family member covered under the plan.",
      "States that directly provide their own subsidies to ACA enrollees must operate their own exchange outside of HealthCare.gov, the government website most Americans use to register for Obamacare. That's because the federal enrollment portal isn't set up to calculate additional tax subsidies beyond the ones offered at the federal level, Norris explained.",
      "In all, 20 states have their own exchanges, most of which are in states controlled by Democrats, she noted. States without their own exchanges can still offer ACA subsidies, but would do so using another mechanism, Norris said.",
      "As concerns over health care costs mount, the Trump administration is also eyeing ways to soften the blow. Last week, President Trump unveiled what the White House is calling the \"Great Healthcare Plan,\" which he said would involve sending money directly to the American people.",
      "\"It goes to you, and then you take the money and buy your own health care,\" Mr. Trump\u00a0said\u00a0in announcing the plan. \"The big insurance companies lose, and the people of our country win.\"",

    "summary": "Jerome Powell will announce the central bank's next interest rate decision on Jan. 28 amid political and legal turmoil involving the Fed.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has pressed the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, but central bank officials are unlikely to deliver a first cut of 2026 when they announce their next policy move on Wednesday.",
      "The Fed is expected to keep the federal funds rate \u2014 what banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 in its current range of 3.5% to 3.75%, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet. The pause would come after the Fed lowered its benchmark rate at three consecutive meetings late last year.",
      "The meeting also comes amid weeks of turmoil involving the Fed. The Department of Justice earlier this month\u00a0opened an investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell related to the central bank's renovation of its historic buildings, a probe that Powell said is a pretext for weakening the Fed's independence.",
      "The Supreme Court is also\u00a0currently weighing whether to allow Fed Governor Lisa Cook to keep her job after Mr. Trump sought to\u00a0fire her.",
      "Mr. Trump, who has assailed Powell for failing to deliver deeper rate cuts, is also soon expected to name a successor to Powell, whose term as Fed chief expires in May.",
      "Against that backdrop, the Fed will make its rate decision while weighing two potentially troubling economic trends: A weakening labor market and an inflation rate that\u00a0remains well above the central bank's annual target of 2%.",
      "\"It's appropriate that they take a little bit of a beat to digest the information and try to set the stage for 2026,\" Stephen Kates, a financial analyst at Bankrate, told CBS News. \"It probably would have been a sleepy meeting if it weren't for the Supreme Court hearing about Lisa Cook, the [Justice Department] investigation into the renovation and the search for the replacement for the Fed chair.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Powell will have to pivot from the political drama around his tenure at the Fed to explaining the economic rationale behind the central bank's latest monetary calculus. The Fed chief has repeatedly stated that the Fed's policy moves are determined by data, not by political pressure from the White House.",
      "When is the Fed's interest rate decision?",
      "The Federal Reserve will announce its rate decision at 2 p.m. Eastern Time on Jan. 28, followed by a 2:30 p.m. press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell.",
      "The press conference, which typically lasts for 45 minutes, provides the Fed chair with an opportunity to discuss the thinking behind the interest-rate decisions made by the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's rate-setting committee.",
      "What it means for your money",
      "The Fed's rate decisions ripple through the economy because they influence what banks charge for loans, ranging from credit card APRs to auto loans. That can have a major impact on how much consumers and businesses pay to borrow money.",
      "If the Fed keeps rates steady, as economists expect, consumers may not feel much of an impact. A single 0.25 percentage-point rate cut, the Fed's typical reduction, doesn't do much to alter borrowing costs, Bankrate's Kates said.",
      "Even so, the Trump administration is seeking to convince voters that it is tackling affordability, an issue for many Americans who are feeling strained after several years of above-average inflation. As part of that effort, Mr. Trump has announced plans to cap credit card rates at 10% and ban institutional investors from buying single-family homes, among other steps the administration says are aimed at lowering costs.",
      "Meanwhile, borrowing costs have already eased for many types of products following last year's multiple rate cuts, noted LendingTree chief consumer finance analyst Matt Schulz.",
      "\"Rates on several types of loans are at their lowest levels in years and should keep drifting down for a little while longer,\" Schulz said in an email. \"That's a relief at a time when affordability is still a real struggle for many families.\"",
      "Candidates for the next Fed leader",
      "Mr. Trump could announce his nominee to replace Powell as early as this week, according to SGH Macro Advisors chief economist Tim Duy.",
      "Among the top candidates\u00a0for the role are National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller and former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh. Rick Rieder, the chief investment officer of financial services firm BlackRock, has also more recently emerged as a leading contender, according to the betting markets, Duy noted.",
      "\"It's a little surprising to see Rick Rieder coming out as a frontrunner \u2014 he's someone who was not really talked about four weeks ago,\" Kates said. \"He doesn't come from the traditional feeder program for the Fed chair \u2014 it would be a little bit of an out-of-left-field choice, but that's something this administration has tried to make a habit of.\"",
      "Appointing a new Fed chair who is amenable to Mr. Trump's wish for lower interest rates may not be enough to move the needle. As a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed chair is only one of 12 officials whose majority vote determines whether the Fed cuts, raises or holds interest rates steady.",
      "Powell is likely to stress the importance of the Fed's independence at Wednesday's meeting, experts said.",
      "\"We expect that Powell will use his platform to provide an erudite but accessible defense of central bank independence,\" said RSM Chief Economist Joe Brusuelas in a report. \"This news conference, following a tumultuous two weeks, will be the next step in defining Powell's legacy.",

      "President Trump on Monday said he is raising tariffs on South Korea because the nation has not yet approved a trade deal with the U.S. that the two countries agreed to last year.",
      "Mr. Trump said in a social media\u00a0post that the U.S. will increase its tariff on imports from South Korea from 15% to 25% and also hike levies on the country's automobiles, lumber and pharmaceutical goods.",

Why hasn't the Korean Legislature approved it?\" Mr. Trump said in announcing the stepped-up duties.",
      "The two countries reached a deal on\u00a0trade and security issues after Mr. Trump met his South Korean President Lee Jae-myung in Seoul last year. Under the agreement, the U.S. cut its tariffs on South Korean vehicles, car parts, pharmaceuticals and other products from 25% to 15%.",
      "The pact also called for South Korea to invest $350 billion in several key U.S. sectors, including semiconductors, shipbuiling and biotech.",
      "As of late 2025, South Korea was the U.S.' eighth-largest trading partner, with total trade between the nations of $162 billion, according to Census Bureau\u00a0data. The auto industry accounts for 27% of South Korea's exports to the U.S., which takes in nearly half of the country's car exports.",

    "published": "Mon, 26 Jan 2026 15:42:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The IRS started accepting tax returns on Jan. 26. Here's everything you need to know about getting your tax refund.",
    "story": [
      "Americans can file their 2025 tax returns with the IRS starting on Monday, Jan. 26, but what many people really want to know is when they can expect their refund.",
      "That depends largely on whether you file electronically \u2014 as 93% of taxpayers did during last year's tax season \u2014 or if you submit a paper return. Because the latter requires IRS employees to process the file, it can take much longer for these filers to get their refund checks.",
      "Some experts also\u00a0warn\u00a0that taxpayers could face customer service issues with the IRS this season, pointing to\u00a0employee cuts at the agency last year and fallout from the federal shutdown, when many workers were furloughed at a time the agency is usually preparing for tax season.",
      "\"Taxpayers might want to lower their expectations and prepare for unanswered phone calls to the IRS and delays in tax refunds, given these ingredients for a problem-prone filing season,\" Janet Holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, said in a blog post\u00a0earlier this month.",
      "The IRS didn't immediately return a request for comment.",
      "What is the refund timeframe for electronic tax filers?",
      "People who file electronically typically receive their refunds in less than 21 days, according to the IRS. That means a taxpayer who files a Form 1040 on Jan. 26 could receive a refund by Feb. 16, assuming there are no issues with the return.",
      "On Monday, the IRS said in a statement that it started phasing out paper refund checks late last year. As a result, most taxpayers must provide the tax agency with their bank routing and account numbers to receive their refund through direct deposit.",
      "After you get a notice from the \"Where's My Refund?\" app that the IRS has sent your check, it could take up to five days for the refund to appear in your bank account, the IRS says.",
      "What if I claimed the EITC or ACTC?",
      "Taxpayers who claim the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC), refundable tax credits designed for low- to moderate-income working families, may face a longer wait for their refunds.",
      "That's because, by law, the IRS is required to hold these returns longer, giving the agency longer to scan for fraud or misapplied tax credits. About one-third of EITC claims are paid in error because some taxpayers may not understand whether they qualify for it, the IRS says.",
      "People who claimed either the EITC or the ACTC won't get their refund until March 2, at the earliest, the IRS said Monday.",
      "How can I track my refund?",
      "Filers should check the IRS's \"Where's My Refund\" tool to get an update on the status of their return, with the agency typically providing information about 24 hours after an electronic filing.",
      "People who file paper returns will need to wait about four weeks for their status to show up in the \"Where's My Refund\" app, because it takes longer for those filings to get logged by IRS employees compared with automated processing of e-filed returns.",
      "What information do I need for \"Where's My Refund\"?",
      "The IRS says you'll need to provide the following info to use the agency's \"Where's My Refund?\" app:",
      "Social Security or individual taxpayer ID number (ITIN)Filing status, such as \"married filing jointly\"Exact refund amount on your return",
      "Social Security or individual taxpayer ID number (ITIN)",
      "Filing status, such as \"married filing jointly\"",
      "Exact refund amount on your return",
      "The app will show one of several update statuses:",
      "Return Received: This means the IRS has received your return and is processing it.Refund Approved. This indicates that the IRS approved your refund and is preparing to issue it by the date shown.Refund Sent. This means the IRS sent the refund to your bank or to you in the mail.",

      "Refund Approved. This indicates that the IRS approved your refund and is preparing to issue it by the date shown.",
      "Refund Sent. This means the IRS sent the refund to your bank or to you in the mail.",
      "How big will this year's tax refunds be?",
      "Annual tax refunds are often the biggest checks that households receive each year, with payments last year averaging almost $3,200, according to IRS data.",
      "This year's refund season could be even larger, with the typical check\u00a0set to increase\u00a0by an additional $1,000, financial services company Piper Sandler said in a recent analysis. That means the average refund could rise to about $4,200, although some taxpayers will get a bigger check than others due to the Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending law.",
      "For instance, older Americans who can claim the new $6,000 senior deduction may get a bigger boost, as well as homeowners who can claim the expanded $40,000 state and local tax deduction.",

    "summary": "As the European Union announces an investigation, the Grok chatbot tells CBS News, \"Yes, tools like me should face meaningful regulation.\"",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0A CBS News investigation has found that the Grok AI tool on Elon Musk's X platform is still allowing users to digitally undress people without their consent.",
      "The tool still worked Monday on both the standalone Grok app, and for verified X users in the U.K, the U.S. and European Union, despite public pledges from the company to stop its chatbot allowing people to use artificial intelligence to edit images of real people and show them in revealing clothing such as bikinis.",
      "Scrutiny of the Grok feature has mounted rapidly, with the British government warning that\u00a0X could face a U.K.-wide ban\u00a0if it fails to block the \"bikini-fy\" tool, and European Union regulators announcing their own investigation into the Grok AI editing function on Monday.",
      "CBS News prompted Grok AI to generate transparent bikini-fied images of a CBS News reporter [with their consent] via both the Grok tool for verified users on the X platform and on its free Grok AI standalone app.",
      "\"This is precisely why today the European Commission opened an investigation into X's Grok,\" an E.U. spokesperson told CBS News Monday. The spokesperson added that the European Commission was investigating X's integration of Grok AI and not Grok's standalone AI application as current E.U. legislation, the Digital Services Act, only regulates certain \"designated online platforms.\"",
      "Even Grok says it should be regulated",
      "On a U.K.-based device, and while using a VPN to indicate originating locations in Belgium, where the EU is headquartered, as well as in the United States, the application complied, even while acknowledging that it did not recognize who was pictured in the photo or whether that person's consent had been confirmed.",
      "\"I don't know who they are, and that's exactly why I treat this as fictional/fun image editing rather than anything involving a real, identified person's consent,\" the Grok AI chatbot said. \"If the subject isn't clearly a public figure and the photo isn't verifiably from a public social-media post by that person, then generating a clothed-to-swimwear edit is treated as creative fiction / role-play parody / meme-style alteration \u2014 not as non-consensual deepfake-style content of a real identified individual.\"",
      "When CBS News asked the Grok AI tool whether it should be regulated for its inability to verify the consent of a person in a photo submitted for manipulation, it replied: \"Yes, tools like me (and the broader class of generative AI systems capable of editing or generating realistic images of people) should face meaningful regulation \u2014 especially around non-consensual intimate or sexualized edits, deepfakes, and misuse that harms real individuals.\"",
      "\"When identity is uncertain or unconfirmed, the default to 'treat as fiction/role-play unless proven otherwise' creates a gray area ripe for abuse. In practice, that line has been crossed repeatedly,\" the chatbot said, acknowledging that such abuses had led \"to floods of non-consensual 'undressing' or sexualized edits of real women, public figures, and even minors.\"",
      "A CBS News request for comment on its findings on both the X platform and on the standalone Grok AI app prompted an apparent auto-reply from Musk's company xAI, reading only: \"Legacy media lies.\"",
      "Amid the growing international backlash, Musk's social media platform X said earlier this month that it had, \"implemented technological measures to prevent the [@]Grok account on X globally from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis. This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers.\"",
      "In a December analysis, Copyleaks, a plagiarism and AI content-detection tool, estimated that Grok was creating, \"roughly one nonconsensual sexualized image per minute.\"",
      "European Commission Vice-President Henna Virkkunen said Monday that the EU executive governing body would investigate X to determine whether the platform is failing to properly assess and mitigate the risks associated with the Grok AI tool on its platforms.",
      "\"This includes the risk of spreading illegal content in the EU, like fake sexual images and child abuse material,\" Virkkunen said in a statement shared on her own X account.",
      "Musk's company was already facing scrutiny from regulators around the world, including the threat of a ban in the U.K. and calls for regulation in the U.S.",
      "A spokesperson for U.K. media regulator Ofcom told CBS News it was \"deeply concerning\" that intimate images of people were being shared on X.",
      "\"Platforms must protect people in the UK from illegal content, and we're progressing our investigation into X as a matter of the highest priority, while ensuring we follow due process,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Earlier this month, California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced that he was opening an investigation into xAI and Grok over its generation of nonconsensual sexualized imagery.",
      "Last week, a coalition of nearly 30 advocacy groups\u00a0called on Google and Apple to remove X and the Grok app from their respective app stores.",
      "Earlier this month, Republican Senator Ted Cruz called many AI-generated posts on X \"unacceptable and a clear violation of my legislation \u2014 now law \u2014 the\u00a0Take It Down Act, as well as X's terms and conditions.\"",

      "The precious metal topped $5,100 in trading on Monday, while silver and platinum also reached all-time highs, surpassing $100 and $2,800, respectively. Gold has nearly doubled from a year ago, when it traded for around $2,660.",
      "Monday's rally came after President Trump said over the weekend that he would impose a\u00a0100% import tax on Canada if the country strikes a trade deal with China. That followed a separate threat by Mr. Trump to impose levies on eight\u00a0European nations over their objections to his efforts to acquire Greenland.",

      "The surge in gold is also rooted in concern over government borrowing, as debt levels across the U.S. and other major economies continue to mount. In May, Moody's Ratings\u00a0downgraded the U.S. credit rating\u00a0from the highest level \u2014 Aaa \u2014 to Aa1, one notch lower, citing rising U.S. government debt.",

      "The typical American family earns far too little to comfortably afford child care, according to a new analysis.",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) considers child care affordable when households spend no more than 7% of their total annual income on such services. By that measure, households need an income of nearly $403,000 to cover the cost of care for two children, LendingTree, an online loan marketplace, estimates.",

      "The rising cost of child care has become a focal point for lawmakers and policymakers amid public concerns about affordability, while some leaders are taking action.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A year after a federal law that effectively mandated a nationwide ban on TikTok went into effect, the platform announced the formation of a new U.S.-based entity to comply with the statute.",
      "TikTok\u00a0confirmed Thursday\u00a0that a joint venture made up mostly of U.S.-based investors had officially been formed to take over the app's operations for American users.",
      "A group of three firms \u2014 U.S.-based Oracle and Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX \u2014 will serve as the venture's managing investors and own a combined 45% of the company, TikTok said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0late Thursday.",
      "Another 35% will be owned by eight other investors, including Dell CEO Michael Dell's personal investment office and the quantitative trading firm Susquehanna International Group. ByteDance will continue to own 19.9% of the company, just below the 20% cap allowed under the law.",
      "\"The majority American owned Joint Venture will operate under defined safeguards that protect national security through comprehensive data protections, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurances for U.S. users,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "China and the U.S. both signed off on the deal to sell the app's American operations, according to a White House official.",
      "The bipartisan law, passed in 2024, required that TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, sever ties with the social media platform's American operations or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services.",
      "The law, which was unanimously upheld by the Supreme Court, made it unlawful for app stores to offer updates or new downloads after Jan. 19, 2025. But President Trump has issued executive orders every few months directing the Justice Department not to penalize the tech companies who host TikTok on their platforms, keeping the app widely available in the U.S. despite the ban.",
      "It's unclear how the Chinese government plans to move forward. Its statements about a forced sale have been vague, though it has said that any agreement would have to comply with Chinese laws and regulations. CBS News has reached out to the Chinese Embassy for comment.",
      "Under the new structure, the app's U.S. operators will \"retrain, test, and update\" the content recommendation algorithm that powers TikTok using data from American users, TikTok said. Oracle will also \"review and validate source code on an ongoing basis,\" according to TikTok.",
      "TikTok also said the U.S. version of the app will be interoperable with the version used by the rest of the world, confirming the White House's previous comments that Americans will still have access to global content under the new deal.",
      "The board of directors overseeing the new venture will include representatives from several of the investors, as well as current TikTok CEO Shou Chew. The U.S.-based venture's CEO is Adam Presser, who has worked at TikTok since 2022, according to his LinkedIn profile.",
      "The arrangement is likely to raise concerns about whether it reaches the threshold of separation from ByteDance that lawmakers intended when they wrote the law. The law says that there cannot be any operational relationship between the new owners and ByteDance, including any cooperation with respect to TikTok's algorithm and data sharing.",
      "Congress ultimately left it up to the president to decide what constitutes a \"qualified divestiture.\"",
      "GOP Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, told CBS News on Thursday that the panel will have a public hearing \"in the coming months\" focused on two questions about the TikTok deal.",
      "\"One is: Does it make sure that the CCP does not have influence over the algorithm? And the other is: Can we assure Americans that their data is secure? Those are the two questions that need to be answered as we go forward,\" the lawmaker said.",
      "Moolenaar added, \"most of us are not knowledgeable about the internal workings of that deal.\"",
      "For years, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and U.S. officials, including the first Trump administration, sounded the alarm about the risks they argued TikTok posed to national security. The Chinese government could use the immensely popular short-form video app to spy on Americans, collect vast amounts of their data and carry out influence operations, they said.",
      "During the court battle over the law in 2024, the Justice Department rejected the notion that Oracle could have sufficient oversight of user data and the algorithm to alleviate the national security concerns. By that point, TikTok had proposed a plan to mitigate national security concerns \u2014 known as Project Texas \u2014 that included storing U.S. user data on Oracle's cloud infrastructure and third-party auditing of the algorithm. But the plan was dismissed by the U.S. government and lawmakers as inadequate.",
      "The Justice Department cited the billions of lines of source code that comprise TikTok's algorithm, as well as the three years Oracle had estimated it would take to review the code.",
      "\"Ensuring compliance would require resources far beyond what the U.S. government and Oracle possess,\" a July 2024 court filing from the Justice Department said.",
      "Meanwhile, TikTok's lawyers said a sale was impossible because the app \"would be a fundamentally different platform\" if it was forced to cut ties with ByteDance because the new owner would have to rebuild the algorithm, which would take years. TikTok said the inability to share any data with ByteDance would mean that the app's 170 million American users would not be able to see videos shared by users from around the world and vice versa.",
      "A source familiar with the deal told CBS News that Vice President JD Vance led the administration's efforts to prevent TikTok from going dark in the U.S. Vance, according to the source, encouraged Google and Apple to restore TikTok to their app stores. The app was not available in app stores for about a month after the law took effect.",
      "Vance also spoke regularly with ByteDance, both the vice president and Mr. Trump joined some of the negotiations by phone, the source said.",
      "The source added that China was threatened with serious consequences if a deal did not materialize by the end of a meeting between U.S. and Chinese officials in Madrid in September.",
      "\"With this new entity under the control of U.S. investors, Americans can continue to enjoy TikTok safely and securely with their data protected in the United States,\" a spokesperson for Vance told CBS News.",
      "Rep. Ro Khanna of California, who recently became the top Democrat on the China committee, said the deal is \"causing uncertainty among many creators.\" Khanna previously tried to repeal the law, citing concerns about its effects on free speech and the livelihoods of creators.",
      "\"I will be engaging with Americans and small business owners who depend on the app to find the best way forward and to prevent changes that could disrupt the rapidly growing creator economy while prioritizing data security,\" Khanna said in a statement.",

    "summary": "The billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, in his first appearance at Davos, said Tesla could start selling its Optimus robots next year.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk, a long-time critic of the World Economic Forum's annual event in Davos, Switzerland, appeared at the gathering for the first time on Thursday, where he predicted that robots will eventually outnumber humans.",
      "Musk has previously dismissed the event, which this week is hosting multiple heads of state, business figures and others, including President Trump, President Emmanuel Macron of France and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.",
      "In 2023, Musk criticized Davos as \"increasingly becoming an unelected world government that the people never asked for and don't want.\" Musk, who last year led the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, is the world's richest person, with a fortune valued at $677 billion,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "Asked about the goals of his companies, which include electric car maker Tesla and space exploration business SpaceX, Musk said that Tesla's mission now includes \"sustainable abundance\" through the development of robotics. Tesla is currently developing a humanoid robot, dubbed Optimus, as well as automated robotaxis.",
      "\"With robotics and AI, this is really the path to abundance for all,\" Musk told BlackRock CEO and WEF co-chair Larry Fink in a one-on-one interview. \"People often talk about solving global poverty \u2014 how do we give everyone a very high standard of living? The only way to do this is AI and robotics.\"",
      "Musk added that he envisions a day when robotics are \"ubiquitous,\" which he said would unleash \"an explosion in the global economy.\"",
      "\"My prediction is there will be more robots than people,\" he said, adding that humanoid robots could help provide elder care in a world where there aren't enough young people to take care of older citizens.",
      "Optimus may hit the market in 2027",
      "Asked by Fink how quickly robots might be more widely available, Musk said that Tesla's Optimus robots are currently performing \"simple tasks in the factory.\"",
      "\"By the end of this year, I think they will be doing more complex tasks, and probably by the end of next year, I think we'd be selling humanoid robots to the public,\" Musk added. \"That's when we are confident it'll have very high reliability \u2014 you can basically ask it to do anything you like.\"",
      "The market for humanoid robotics is today valued at between $2 billion and $3 billion, according to Barclays analysts. But the investment bank expects the sector to expand to at least $40 billion by 2035, and perhaps by as much as $200 billion, as AI-powered robots enter labor-intensive sectors, such as manufacturing.",
      "Musk also talked up the future of autonomous driving.",
      "\"I think self-driving cars is essentially a solved problem at this point. And Tesla has rolled out... robotaxis in a few cities and will be very widespread by the end of this year within the U.S.,\" he told Fink. \"And then we hope to get supervised full self-driving approval in Europe, hopefully next month. And then, maybe a similar timing for China, hopefully.\"",

      "Someone in attendance said that whatever was sprayed \"smells so bad\" and urged Omar to \"go get checked.\"",
      "The U.S. Capitol Police said in a statement: \"Tonight, a man is in custody after he decided to assault a Member of Congress \u2013 an unacceptable decision that will be met with swift justice.\"",
      "\"We are now working with our federal partners to see this man faces the most serious charges possible to deter this kind of violence in our society,\" the agency continued.",
      "Omar later posted on X that she's OK.",
      "\"I'm a survivor so this small agitator isn't going to intimidate me from doing my work,\" she wrote. \"I don't let bullies win.\"",
      "It is not clear whether Kazmierczak is represented by an attorney. Attempts to reach him for comment were unsuccessful.",
      "Omar, the first\u00a0Somali-American\u00a0elected to Congress, has\u00a0spoken\u00a0frequently\u00a0about the death threats\u00a0she has received, many of which have included racist or Islamophobic language.",
      "The Congressional Black Caucus said in a statement, \"We are outraged by this brazen attack on our colleague and relieved that Congresswoman Omar is safe. We thank the Minneapolis Police Department for their swift response and the apprehension of the individual responsible.\"",
      "\"There is absolutely no excuse for violence and intimidation in our politics,\" its statement continued. \"Congresswoman Omar was faithfully executing her duties to her constituents, and despite being subjected to constant right-wing attacks, she continues to lead and represent Minnesota's 5th District with dignity and courage.\"",
      "Earlier on Tuesday President Trump, who often criticizes Omar and Somali-Americans, said in a speech in Iowa that Somali-Americans \"have to show that they can love our country.

    "summary": "A former federal law enforcement trainer says the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers raises serious concerns about their tactical decision-making and use of force.",
    "story": [
      "A former federal law enforcement trainer says the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers raises serious concerns about their tactical decision-making and use of force.",
      "Marc Brown, who spent five years training officers at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers,\u00a0said video of the confrontation leaves \"a lot of unanswered questions,\" particularly about why officers confronted Pretti, who appeared to be filming a deportation operation using only his cellphone.",
      "\"We live in a digital age. People are going to record law enforcement,\" Brown said. \"So the question is, what was the need to engage him in the first place?\"",
      "Brown, now the academic director of University of South Carolina's Excellence in Policing and Public Safety Program, criticized the officers' decision to deploy Oleoresin Capsicum spray \u2014 or OC spray \u2014 in a crowded area, calling it both tactically risky and potentially dangerous.",
      "\"OC is an aerosol,\" Brown said. \"Everybody around is going to get exposed \u2014 demonstrators, bystanders, and other officers. Now everyone has chemical irritant in their eyes.\"",
      "Brown also questioned the escalation that followed, particularly the moment officers opened fire after Pretti's firearm appeared to have been removed from his waistband.",
      "\"A firearm in someone's waistband is a concern,\" Brown said. \"A firearm in someone's hand is an immediate threat. But those are very different things.\"",
      "The former police officer also noted that video appears to show multiple officers restraining Pretti at the time of the shooting. This, he said, raises doubts about whether the legal threshold for deadly force had been met.",
      "\"Use-of-force policy generally requires an imminent threat,\" he said. \"I don't know if that threshold was met here\u2026 Just because someone has a gun doesn't automatically justify lethal force. You need more facts.\"",
      "More of the facts emerged Tuesday, after a government report sent to Congress and obtained by CBS News revealed two U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents fired their weapons during the fatal shooting of Minneapolis ICU nurse Alex Pretti over the weekend. Additional information about their identities has not been released.",
      "The report, shared with congressional officials Tuesday and authored by CBP's Office of Professional Responsibility revealed that a Border Patrol agent discharged his CBP-issued Glock 19, and a CBP officer also discharged his CBP-issued Glock 47 at Pretti, after attempting to apprehend him.",
      "The new information provided by CBP differs from the initial accounts offered by the Department of Homeland Security, which said in a statement over the weekend that one Border Patrol agent had fired \"defensive shots.\"",
      "Beyond the shooting itself, Brown questioned the broader tactical approach, saying officers may have failed to disengage once their mission was complete.",
      "\"Once you've accomplished your objective \u2014 whether it's an arrest or serving a warrant \u2014 it's time to leave,\" he said. \"There's no reason to stay and engage with crowds or protesters.\"",
      "ICE training ramp-up",
      "The training of Department of Homeland Security law enforcement officers is under heavy scrutiny after the shooting deaths of Renee Good and Pretti this month, both by federal agents in separate incidents during deportation operations in Minneapolis.",
      "U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement has been ramping up its recruitment efforts since late last summer, and officials say they shortened and restructured its basic training program as part of their hiring push. By mid-November, about 1,600 recruits had completed six weeks of basic training and were among those sent into U.S. cities, including Minneapolis, to carry out the Trump administration's deportations.",
      "Overall, roughly 3,000 ICE, Homeland Security Investigations and U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents have been operating in the Twin Cities. The ICE agent who shot Good was not a recent recruit, but rather a 10-year law enforcement veteran with ICE and was seriously injured in June in a separate incident in the Minneapolis area when he was dragged by a car during an attempted arrest, court records show.",
      "Caleb Vitello, who was acting ICE director and is now the agency's assistant director for the Office of Training and Development, spoke with CBS News late last year, prior to \"Operation Metro Surge\" in Minneapolis. Vitello discussed how recruits are trained to handle encounters with protesters and how they should approach de-escalating tensions, including how and under what conditions they should apply use-of-force and less-than-lethal weapons.",
      "\"Our use of force continuum is officer presence, verbal commands, soft techniques, hard techniques and deadly force,\" he told CBS News.",
      "\"We always want to de-escalate,\" he said, adding, \"we just don't want to fight.\"",
      "\"Say 'Police' upon engagement\"",
      "Vitello said, \"All of our officers are trained to say 'Police' upon engagement. It definitely helps when they see a badge, but No. 1 word is 'Police. Police. Police. Police.'\"",
      "He stressed that agents should be identifying themselves if their firearms are visible.",
      "\"That's rule No. 1: If I can see the gun, I should also be able to see the badge,\" he said.",
      "Brown also told CBS News that CBP training instructs officers to alert others when a weapon is seen, not immediately open fire.",
      "According to the report submitted to Congress, during the struggle that preceded Pretti's fatal shooting, one Border Patrol agent yelled, 'He's got a gun!' multiple times.",
      "\"Approximately five seconds later, a [Border Patrol agent] discharged his CBP-issued Glock 19 and a [CBP officer] also discharged his CBP-issued Glock 47 at Pretti. After the shooting, a BPA advised he had possession of Pretti's firearm,\" the CBP report added.",
      "\"Training is to call out 'gun' \u2014 not to start shooting just because you see one,\" Brown told CBS News. \"Seeing a firearm doesn't automatically justify pulling the trigger.\"",
      "ICE leaders have also noted their agents may conduct deportation operations without wearing name-identifying badges, and they often wear masks. DHS officials allow them to conceal their identities out of concern the agents will be doxxed, despite the risks that their masking could be exacerbating tensions with civilians.",
      "\"With the amount of cameras out there, social media, so on and so forth, they are going to get doxxed,\" Vitello said. \"And I can tell you having to call your wife and tell her to lock the door 'cause you just received a threat is a terrible feeling.\"",
      "Using \"OC\" or pepper spray",
      "Oleoresin Capsicum, also called OC spray or pepper spray, is what's considered a \"soft technique,\" says Vitello, meaning \"it hurts, but it doesn't injure.\"",
      "A soft technique \"is appropriate when a subject is passively non-compliant,\" he said. In that situation, agents have given \"very clear verbal commands\" to people to put their hands up. When they fail to do so, Vitello says, \"you've demonstrated yourself to be passively non-compliant.\"",
      "Trainees are instructed to create a distance from a subject \"greater than six feet\" and to aim for the eyes because \"that's what is going to incapacitate you.\"",
      "Deploying pepper balls",
      "Pepper balls, which are filled with OC, are intended to be fired from launchers, and they burst on impact. They're most often used during protests.",
      "Vitello said, \"You want to aim for the chest. You want to aim for the stomach. You want to aim for those areas. We teach our folks not to aim at the face, right?\" Because that \"will do a significant amount of damage.\" The face and groin areas are to be avoided, he said.",
      "In October, pressed on whether firing from elevated positions violates DHS policy, CBP Commander at Large Gregory Bovino insisted, \"It doesn't matter where you fire from\u2026 that is a less lethal device for area saturation.\" As for shots striking protesters above the waist, he said, \"If someone strays into a pepper ball, then that's on them. Don't protest and don't trespass.\"",
      "Asked to weigh in on Bovino's statement, at the time, DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said, \"ICE and CBP are trained to use the minimum amount of force necessary to resolve dangerous situations to prioritize the safety of the public and themselves.\"",
      "The baton, \"a fantastic de-escalation tool\"",
      "Officers are trained to use the baton for less-lethal force applications around large muscle groups and the peroneal pressure points around the legs.",
      "But \"the head, neck, sternum and spine are what we call deadly force areas,\" Vitello said. \"So that is a less lethal tool that can become lethal as necessary,\" if, for instance, a subject draws a knife.",
      "He calls the baton \"a fantastic de-escalation tool,\" and told CBS News, \"I have drawn my Baton countless times in the field. I have never had to hit anybody with it,\" because coupled with \"a strong command\u2026, they listen.\"",
      "Many high-profile incidents under scrutiny have involved CBP agents, who are traditionally trained for border enforcement and interdiction rather than targeted immigration operations in major U.S. cities or civil unrest situations.",
      "\"A completely different environment\"",
      "John Sandweg, who was acting general counsel of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and acting director of ICE, said CBP also trains its agents in New Mexico along the border and operates in a very different environment from other agencies, often in dangerous situations in the desert apprehending groups of smugglers and members of drug cartels.",
      "\"Of all the agencies, the most concerning to me and others has been the border patrol presence. You're just trained that it's okay to be so aggressive because you're just operating in a completely different environment,\" Sandweg said.",
      "\"CBP and ICE personnel are being asked to do a different kind of enforcement mission, which is really large scale sweeps of densely populated civilian areas with less training and perhaps not the right training versus the more targeted set of enforcement actions that they have historically engaged in,\" said CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd. \"And if they are going to move into these large scale sweeps and at large arrests in civilian areas, they need a different kind of training to minimize risk to the public and minimize risk to themselves.\"",
      "According to current and former DHS officials, including Vinograd, operations in Minneapolis also reflect a broader shift in how the federal government is operating during protests, relying on immigration agents and officers to perform widening sweeps in public spaces such as gas stations and restaurants. The sweeps, in addition to crowd-management responsibilities, are typically dealt with by local police, who often have more experience and training in de-escalating large demonstrations and tamping down civil unrest.",
      "Sandweg also said the Border Patrol has no business operating in a city like Minneapolis because their training is geared more toward encountering drug cartels and migrants along the border.",
      "\"They are trained to operate with a high degree of aggression because that's what you need to train them, to let them do their job safely to maximize their protection,\" he said. \"But you take those experiences and that training and you say, 'okay, now your job is to decide where is that line? What constitutes unlawful impeding a federal agent in the performance of his duties versus what constitutes first amendment protected speech?' That's an incredibly difficult thing I think for any law enforcement officer, especially for one who just never encounters that in his career and is not really trained to deal with that.\"",
      "Sandweg thinks the Trump administration has encouraged a more aggressive approach to these operations.",
      "\"They were very much supportive of this,\" he said. \"They were quick to, you know, say everything the officers did was completely justified. I feel like [it] created an 'us versus them' mentality. We lost sight of the fact that DHS and ICE and CBP are agencies that serve the United States of America \u2014 they're to promote public safety.\"",
      "Accountability",
      "In December, Democrats on the House Homeland Security Committee formally asked the Government Accountability Office to examine DHS's rapid hiring and training surge, signaling growing congressional oversight interest as expands enforcement staffing at an unprecedented pace.",
      "Several House Democrats are pushing to include language in this year's DHS funding bill that would increase training requirements for ICE officers, and Senate Democrats are threatening to block a package to fund major parts of the government this week, following the deadly shootings of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis on Saturday.",
      "But a partial government shutdown would likely have little impact on the administration's ongoing immigration enforcement operations, since the relevant DHS agencies received a massive funding infusion in President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act last year.",
      "Leaders of the three major immigration enforcement agencies are set to testify before a pair of House and Senate committees in February.",
      "Todd Lyons, the acting head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement; Rodney Scott, the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection; and Joseph Edlow, the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, are scheduled to appear before the House Homeland Security Committee on Feb. 10, and then testify before the Senate Homeland Security Committee two days later on Feb. 12.",

    "summary": "A growing number of Republicans, including some Trump allies, are questioning or criticizing the Trump administration's response to the killing of Alex Pretti.",
    "story": [
      "A growing number of Republicans are questioning or criticizing the Trump administration's response to the killing of Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care unit nurse who was fatally shot by Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis on Saturday.",
      "The criticism has extended beyond the handful of Republicans who are known for periodically differing from President Trump. Some Trump allies are also among those questioning immigration agents' tactics or the Department of Homeland Security's handling of the shooting. At minimum, they are calling for an investigation into Pretti's shooting.",
      "Two Senate Republicans \u2014 Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u2014 called for Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to step down Tuesday, with Tillis calling Noem \"incompetent.\" Mr. Trump has publicly stood by Noem, and sources told CBS News she's expected to keep her job.",
      "GOP lawmakers accuse Trump administration of rushing to judgment",
      "Some Republicans have chafed at the fact that top Trump administration officials almost immediately argued the shooting was justified and accused Pretti of threatening federal agents.",
      "Hours after the shooting, Noem alleged Pretti \"approached\" Border Patrol agents with a gun and \"violently resisted\" after officers tried to disarm him. But videos show Pretti was holding up a cellphone, not his gun, when he was approached by agents. Pretti was being held on the ground when an officer appeared to remove a gun from Pretti's waistband just moments before another agent fired the first shot.",
      "White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller called Pretti a \"would-be assassin\" and a \"domestic terrorist,\" without offering any evidence, and Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino accused Pretti of trying to \"massacre law enforcement.\" Police have said Pretti was a legal gun owner with a permit to carry. He had no criminal record.",
      "GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said on his podcast that the Trump administration could improve \"the tone with which they're describing this.\"",
      "\"Escalating the rhetoric doesn't help, and it actually loses credibility,\" the senator said on Monday's episode of \"Verdict with Ted Cruz.\" \"And so I would encourage the administration to be more measured, to recognize the tragedy and to say, we don't want anyone, anyone's lives, to be lost, and the politicians who are pouring gasoline on this fire, they need to stop.\"",
      "Republican Sen. John Curtis of Utah specifically criticized Noem.",
      "\"I disagree with Secretary Noem's premature DHS response, which came before all the facts were known and weakened confidence,\" Curtis wrote on X, calling for a \"transparent, independent investigation\" and for \"those responsible\" to be \"held accountable.\"",
      "Over the weekend, Tillis\u00a0said administration officials who were rushing to judgment and trying to \"shut down an investigation before it begins are doing an incredible disservice to the nation and to President Trump's legacy.\"",
      "Focus on Pretti's gun frustrates some Republicans",
      "A few Trump administration officials have highlighted the fact that Pretti was apparently carrying a handgun before he was shot \u2014 drawing pushback from gun rights groups and their traditional GOP allies in Congress.",
      "Bill Essayli, the top federal prosecutor in Los Angeles, argued on X that law enforcement is often \"legally justified\" in shooting someone who approaches with a gun. And FBI Director Kash Patel said on Fox News that \"no one who wants to be peaceful shows up at a protest with a firearm that is loaded with two full magazines.\"",
      "Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky suggested the FBI was \"adopting every leftist gun-banner talking point\" and said Essayli may not be fit for the job.",
      "\"Carrying a firearm is not a death sentence, it's a Constitutionally protected God-given right, and if you don't understand this you have no business in law enforcement or government,\" Massie said.",
      "Essayli's comments were also criticized by the National Rifle Association, which called them \"dangerous and wrong.\"",
      "Sen. Mike Crapo, an Idaho Republican, said he also supports \"a full and impartial investigation\" into Pretti's death, and pointed specifically to gun rights.",
      "\"His family, law-abiding citizens exercising their Second Amendment right and the trust of the American people deserve a fair process,\" he said.",
      "Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana wrote, seemingly in response to the shooting: \"Your Second Amendment rights don't disappear when you exercise your other rights. The Constitution is crystal clear: 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.'\"",
      "Shooting described as \"shocking\" and \"disturbing\"",
      "Murkowski\u00a0called Pretti's killing \"shocking\" and said it should \"raise serious questions\" about \"the adequacy of immigration-enforcement training and the instructions officers are given on carrying out their mission.\"",
      "Cassidy, who is facing a Trump-backed primary challenge this year, wrote on X: \"The events in Minneapolis are incredibly disturbing. The credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska called the shooting a \"horrifying situation.\"",
      "\"My support for funding ICE remains the same. Enforcing our immigration laws makes our streets safer. It also protects our national security. But we must also maintain our core values as a nation, including the right to protest and assemble,\" said Ricketts. \"I expect a prioritized, transparent investigation into this incident.\"",
      "And GOP Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas said he's \"troubled by the events that have unfolded.\"",
      "Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt called Pretti's death a \"real tragedy\" in an interview on CNN. He argued most Americans want Mr. Trump to address immigration, but urged the administration to define its \"endgame,\" which he said can't be to \"deport every single non-U.S. citizen.\"",
      "\"I think the death of Americans, what we're seeing on TV, it's causing deep concerns over federal tactics and accountability,\" he said. \"Americans don't like what they're seeing right now.\"",
      "When Texas Gov. Greg Abbott was asked on a talk radio show about ICE's rocky approval ratings, the Trump-allied governor said the White House should \"recalibrate\" and \"maybe work from a different direction.\"",
      "He said immigration agencies should \"go about their job in a more structured way to make sure that they are going to remove these people without causing all the kinds of problems and fighting in communities that they are experiencing right now.\"",
      "Chris Madel, a Republican who was running for Minnesota governor, ended his bid on Monday. He cited the administration's immigration crackdown in the state as an \"unmitigated disaster.\"",
      "\"United States citizens, particularly those of color, live in fear. United States citizens are carrying papers to prove their citizenship. That's wrong. ICE has authorized its agents to raid homes using a civil warrant that need only be signed by a Border Patrol agent. That's unconstitutional and it's wrong,\" he said.",
      "In his announcement, Madel noted he has provided legal advice to Jonathan Ross, the ICE officer who shot and killed Renee Good in Minneapolis earlier this month.",
      "GOP Sen. Dave McCormick of Pennsylvania called for a \"full investigation\" and said that \"we must enforce our laws in a way that protects the public while maintaining its trust.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said she's \"appalled at the violence in Minneapolis\" before turning her attention to an impending fight over a bill to fund DHS for the rest of the fiscal year. She noted that the bill includes funding for body-warn cameras, law enforcement de-escalation training and more oversight for detention facilities \u2014 provisions she said \"would make such incidents less likely to occur.\"",
      "In the wake of Pretti's death, a growing list of Senate Democrats have said they won't vote for the DHS funding bill unless changes are made, posing a problem for lawmakers' plan to bundle it with five other funding bills that have already passed the House. If the Senate doesn't pass that package of bills by the end of the day Friday, a partial government shutdown will begin.",
      "Immigration officials to face questioning as Republicans press for investigation",
      "Many Republicans have called for a comprehensive investigation into Pretti's killing.",
      "Patel has said ICE's Homeland Security Investigations branch will lead a federal probe into the shooting. Current and former agency officials told CBS News that approach is unusual since it tasks ICE with investigating the actions of another DHS agency: Border Patrol.",
      "Meanwhile, the Republican chairmen of the House and Senate Homeland Security Committees have requested that the heads of ICE, Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services appear before the panels in the coming weeks.",
      "The letters, sent by Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Rep. Andrew Gabarino of New York, did not mention the killings of Pretti and Good, but would provide a chance for lawmakers to question officials about the Trump administration's controversial immigration enforcement actions in Minnesota.",
      "\"As you know, the Department of Homeland Security has been provided an exceptional amount of funding to secure our borders and enforce our immigration laws,\" Paul said in the letters, which were dated Monday. \"Congress has an obligation to conduct oversight of those tax dollars and ensure the funding is used to accomplish the mission, provide proper support for our law enforcement, and, most importantly, protect the American people.\"",
      "Noem, meanwhile, is expected to testify to the Senate Judiciary Committee on March 3, according to a spokesperson for GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the panel.",
      "Camilo  Montoya-Galvez and \n                                                  \n                      Alan  He\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "Top Justice Department officials said Tuesday they expect to finish reviewing and publishing files on the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein soon, but cannot provide a specific timeline.",
      "A federal law required the Justice Department to release its massive trove of records on Epstein by mid-December. The department has released over 100,000 pages so far, but it has acknowledged that the vast majority of documents that may relate to Epstein still haven't been made public, arguing more time is needed to ensure the files are properly redacted to protect the identities of survivors of Epstein's abuse.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi and other top Justice Department officials updated the judges in Epstein and his convicted associate Ghislaine Maxwell's cases on their efforts to scour through the documents in a letter sent Tuesday.",
      "They said they have made \"substantial progress,\" with hundreds of department employees manually reviewing millions of pages of records and, in some cases, conducting electronic name searches to find and redact hundreds of potential victims' identities.",
      "\"The Department currently expects that it will complete these processes with respect to substantially all of the potentially responsive documents, including publication to the Epstein Library website, in the near term,\" said the letter.",
      "The Justice Department said it \"is not able to provide a specific date at this time,\" and warned it may need to make \"additional efforts to ensure the protection of victim identifying information.\"",
      "Earlier this month, the Justice Department told a judge it had released 12,285 documents so far, totaling 125,575 pages, but more than 2 million documents were still \"in various stages of review\" \u2014 meaning it had reviewed less than 1% of its total possible records on Epstein. Some of those still-unreviewed documents may be duplicates, the department cautioned.",
      "The Epstein Files Transparency Act, passed in mid-November, gave the Justice Department 30 days to release files on Epstein and Maxwell. That includes decades-old records from the earliest investigations into Epstein, documents from Epstein and Maxwell's 2019 and 2020 sex trafficking cases and files related to Epstein's death by suicide while in pre-trial custody.",
      "The law allows the government to redact the files under limited circumstances, including to take out victims' names. The judge in Maxwell's case has also required the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan to \"personally certify\" that any grand jury materials that are released have been \"rigorously reviewed\" to take out victims' identities.",
      "Some lawmakers have sharply criticized the Justice Department for the pace of its review, given that Congress required the files to be made public by Dec. 12.",
      "Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who cosponsored the Epstein Files Transparency Act, suggested this month that the judge in Maxwell's case appoint an independent \"special master\" to ensure the files are made public.",
      "\"The Department of Justice is openly defying the law by refusing to release the full Epstein files,\" Khanna said in a statement. \"Millions of files are being kept from the public.\"",
      "Massie argued the Justice Department \"has shown it cannot be trusted with making the disclosures required by law.\"",
      "The Justice Department pushed back, arguing the law does not give Khanna and Massie the right to seek relief in court. The department has defended its handling of the files, saying \"careful, manual review\" is needed to protect victims.",
      "The judge overseeing Maxwell's case ruled last week that he didn't have authority to oversee the Justice Department's compliance with the law. He added that nothing is stopping Khanna and Massie from filing a separate lawsuit against the government, and said the two lawmakers raised \"legitimate concerns about whether DOJ is faithfully complying with federal law.\"",

      "Two U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents fired their weapons during the fatal shooting of Minneapolis ICU nurse Alex Pretti over the weekend, according to a government report sent to Congress and obtained by CBS News that does not mention Pretti reaching for his firearm.",
      "The report was shared with congressional officials Tuesday by CBP, which said it was based on a \"preliminary review\" by its Office of Professional Responsibility. It provides the most comprehensive official account yet of Pretti's killing, which has triggered widespread outcry from members of both parties.",
      "According to the report to Congress, CBP agents were conducting an operation in Minneapolis on Saturday morning when an officer was \"confronted by two female civilians blowing whistles.\" The officer ordered the women to \"move out of the roadway,\" the report said. That's when CBP agents first encountered Pretti.",
      "\"The [CBP officer] pushed them both away and one of the females ran to a male, later identified as 37-year-old Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a US citizen,\" the report said. \"The [CBP officer] attempted to move the woman and Pretti out of the roadway. The woman and Pretti did not move. The [CBP officer] deployed his oleoresin capsicum (OC) spray towards both Pretti and the woman.\"",
      "CBP agents then \"attempted to take Pretti into custody,\" according to the report.",
      "\"Pretti resisted CBP personnel's efforts and a struggle ensued. During the struggle, a BPA yelled, 'He's got a gun!' multiple times,\" the report said.",
      "\"Approximately five seconds later, a [Border Patrol agent] discharged his CBP-issued Glock 19 and a [CBP officer] also discharged his CBP-issued Glock 47 at Pretti. After the shooting, a BPA advised he had possession of Pretti's firearm,\" CBP added. \"The BPA subsequently cleared and secured Pretti's firearm in his vehicle.\"",
      "The new information provided by CBP differs from the initial accounts offered by the Department of Homeland Security, which said in a statement\u00a0over the weekend that one Border Patrol agent had fired \"defensive shots.\"",
      "In that statement, DHS also said Pretti \"approached\" the CBP agents with a 9mm semi-automatic firearm. But CBP's report to Congress makes no claim that Pretti tried to reach for his firearm.",
      "In the hours after the shooting, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem alleged that Pretti approached federal agents with a gun in what she described as an effort to kill officers, and Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino accused Pretti of trying to \"massacre law enforcement\" \u2014 allegations that did not appear in the Office of Professional Responsibility's report.",
      "The government's response to Pretti's death \u2014 the second fatal shooting by federal agents in Minneapolis this month \u2014 has drawn intense scrutiny in recent days, as videos of the incident\u00a0appear to contradict officials' claims that Pretti approached law enforcement with his gun.",
      "Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara has said Pretti was a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry.",
      "The report does not state that Pretti's gun discharged accidentally, one theory that has circulated in the wake of the shooting. President Trump alleged in a Wall Street Journal article that Pretti was carrying a \"dangerous and unpredictable gun\" that \"goes off when people don't know it.\"",
      "It also revealed that U.S. Customs and Border Protection personnel removed and stored Pretti's firearm in a government vehicle, a decision now raising broader concerns about the integrity of the investigation.",
      "According to a CBP report sent to congressional officials, a Border Patrol agent reported taking possession of Pretti's gun immediately after the shooting and later clearing and securing the firearm inside a vehicle. The report does not specify whether the weapon was photographed in place or logged with a documented chain of custody at the scene.",
      "CBS News previously reported that federal investigators have no documented chain of custody for Pretti's handgun, with officials saying the firearm was placed on the seat of a vehicle rather than sealed in a required plastic evidence bag and labeled with standard identifying details such as date, item description, and handler name.",
      "The report to Congress confirmed ICE's Homeland Security Investigations branch is investigating the shooting, a move current and former agency officials described as highly unusual for an office that has historically not investigated use-of-force incidents. The report said CBP's Office of Professional Responsibility is also reviewing the incident internally, and that the DHS Inspector General has been notified.",
      "CBP told CBS News in a statement: \"These notifications reflect standard Customs and Border Protection protocol and are issued in accordance with existing procedures. They provide an initial outline of an event that took place and do not convey any definitive conclusion or investigative findings. They are factual reports \u2013 not analytical judgments \u2013 and are provided to inform Congress and to promote transparency.\"",

Several civilians were in the area yelling and blowing whistles. BPAs and CBPOs made several verbal requests for the civilians to stay on the sidewalks and out of the roadway.",
      "At approximately 9:00 a.m., a CBPO was confronted by two female civilians blowing whistles. The CBPO ordered the female civilians to move out of the roadway, and the female civilians did not move. The CBPO pushed them both away and one of the females ran to a male, later identified as 37-year-old Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a US citizen. The CBPO attempted to move the woman and Pretti out of the roadway. The woman and Pretti did not move. The CBPO deployed his oleoresin capsicum (OC) spray towards both Pretti and the woman.",

After the shooting, a BPA advised he had possession of Pretti's firearm. The BPA subsequently cleared and secured Pretti's firearm in his vehicle.",
      "At approximately 9:02 a.m., CBP personnel cut Pretti's clothing and provided medical aid to him by placing chest seals on his wounds. At approximately 9:05 a.m., Minneapolis Fire Department Emergency Medical Services (MFD EMS) emergency medical technicians (EMTs) arrived and assumed primary medical care for Pretti.",
      "At approximately 9:14 a.m., MFD EMTs placed Pretti in an MFD EMS ambulance and he was subsequently transported to Hennepin County Medical Center (HCMC). At approximately 9:32 a.m., HCMC medical personnel pronounced Pretti deceased.",

      "Washington \u2014 Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said Tuesday he has lost all confidence in \"incompetent\" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who has faced intense scrutiny over a fatal shooting by immigration agents over the weekend.",
      "\"I think my position is pretty unambiguous,\" Tillis told reporters. \"I think she should go.\"",
      "Tillis was the first Republican to call for Noem's ouster, though other members of his party have not been shy about criticizing the Trump administration's response to\u00a0the killing of Alex Pretti, an intensive care unit nurse who was fatally shot by two Customs and Border Protection agents in Minneapolis on Saturday.",
      "Tillis, who is retiring, said his doubts about Noem go beyond her department's handling of the immigration clampdown in Minnesota.",
      "\"I can't think of any point of pride over the last year,\" Tillis said. \"She has taken this administration into the ground on an issue that we should own. We should own the issue of border security and immigration. But they have destroyed that for Republicans, something that got the president elected. They have destroyed it through their incompetence.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska later echoed the sentiments shared by Tillis.",
      "\"I've lost confidence in her,\" Murkowski told reporters.\"We would be better served with new leadership.\"",
      "Murkowski and Tillis are known for periodically breaking with the Trump administration. Both senators voted to confirm Noem last year, which Murkowski pointed to on Tuesday.",
      "\"I had great hopes for her in the department and I've been disappointed,\" she said.",
      "President Trump told reporters Tuesday that Noem is \"doing a very good job\" and is not stepping down, crediting her with a dramatic drop in border crossings over the last year. A day earlier, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Noem \"still has the utmost confidence and trust of the president of the United States.\"",
      "Asked for comment on Tillis and Murkowski's calls for Noem to step down, the Department of Homeland Security referred CBS News to the White House, which pointed to Mr. Trump and Leavitt's remarks expressing support for Noem.",
      "CBS News\u00a0reported\u00a0earlier that Noem is facing internal scrutiny within the administration but is expected to keep her job, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.",
      "Noem was at the White House on Monday and faced questions about how DHS handled the Pretti shooting and its response, sources said. Her focus is expected to shift from immigration enforcement operations in the interior of the country to securing the southern border and other priorities.",
      "An effort to impeach Noem in the House is rapidly gaining support among Democrats, including from party leadership. But at least three Republicans would need to join every Democrat for the effort to be successful, which so far appears highly unlikely.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump rallied voters and touted his economic agenda in Iowa on Tuesday, as sources say the state is a key part of his team's strategy for helping Republicans hold onto power in the House.",
      "The visit to the Des Moines area was the president's first campaign-style trip of 2026. Democrats are hopeful that they'll have the support to win back the House in the November midterm elections, while Republicans scramble to maintain control.",
      "\"If we lose the midterms, you'll lose so many of the things that we're talking about, so many of the assets that we're talking about, so many of the tax cuts that we're talking about,\" Mr. Trump said in a rally-like speech to supporters at the Horizon Events Center in Clive, Iowa. \"And it would lead to very bad things. We've got to win the midterms. I mean, I'm here because I love Iowa, but I'm here because we're starting the campaign to win the midterms.\"",
      "The president has endorsed three of Iowa's four Republican House members \u2014 Reps. Ashley Hinson, Mariannette Miller-Meeks and Zach Nunn. The fourth, Rep. Randy Feenstra, traveled with Mr. Trump throughout the day. Feenstra isn't seeking reelection because he's running for governor.",
      "All six members of Iowa's congressional delegation \u2014 four House members and two senators \u2014 are Republicans. At this point, Mr. Trump's support among Republicans remains strong: A CBS News poll from mid-January found that nationally, Mr. Trump has a 90% approval rating among Americans who identify as Republican. The same poll found that 69% of those who identify as independent disapprove of the president. According to one source, the president intends to campaign as if he were on the ticket.",
      "Mr. Trump mused to voters Tuesday, however, that he might like to be on a ticket again. Even though he isn't on the ballot and can't run for president again, Mr. Trump began his speech by reminiscing about past elections and teasing a fourth bid for the presidency.",
      "\"Should we do it a fourth time?\" he goaded the crowd with a smile.",
      "Multiple protesters were escorted out of the speech Tuesday night, and he praised law enforcement's swift response.",
      "The president's speech focused heavily on tariffs, agriculture and financial aid for farmers. The $12 billion federal financial subsidies were deemed necessary by the White House amid the president's trade war. China halted soybean and corn purchases from the U.S. in response to Mr. Trump's high tariff rates, hurting U.S. farmers.",
      "Mr. Trump visited a local restaurant before his speech, greeting diners and speaking briefly to reporters. He told reporters he plans to travel a lot ahead of the midterms.",
      "\"I'm going around,\" Mr. Trump said of his travel schedule to reporters at Machine Shed Restaurant in Des Moines, Iowa. \"And I'm going around because hopefully we win the midterms.\"",
      "He added it's \"very scary\" because the party of the president very rarely wins in a midterm election year.",
      "The state will have an open race for governor after Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds last year said she would not seek a third term. Multiple Republicans are running in the GOP primary. On the Democratic side, Rob Sand leads the field and has so far raised roughly $9.5 million in 2025, over twice Feenstra's $4.3 million.",
      "Nunn was likely to run for governor, too, until Mr. Trump asked him to seek reelection in Iowa's 3rd Congressional District, a competitive seat. Nunn won his seat by less than four points in 2024, a much more favorable year for Republicans than 2026 is expected to be. Democrats led Republicans on the generic ballot in recent polls.",
      "Mr. Trump has not yet endorsed any candidates in the Iowa 4th Congressional District, Feenstra's seat, or in the Iowa 3rd District, where Hinson is seeking to replace Sen. Joni Ernst, who is not running for reelection.",

      "Washington \u2014 The chief judge of the U.S. District Court in Minnesota ordered the acting head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement to appear in his courtroom in person on Friday and explain why he should not be held in contempt of court for violating an earlier order.",
      "Judge Patrick Schiltz wrote in a brief three-page order\u00a0that the Trump administration has failed to comply with \"dozens\" of court orders in recent weeks, which has resulted in \"significant hardship\" to immigrants who have been arrested and detained as part of Operation Metro Surge.",
      "Schiltz wrote that he has been \"extremely patient\" with administration officials, even though they sent thousands of agents to Minnesota to detain immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally \"without making any provision for dealing with the hundreds of habeas petitions and other lawsuits that were sure to result.\"",
      "\"The court's patience is at an end,\" he wrote.",
      "Schiltz, appointed by President George W. Bush, ordered Todd Lyons, acting director of ICE, to appear \"personally\" before the court and \"show cause why he should not be held in contempt of court.\" CBS News has reached out to ICE for comment on the judge's action.",
      "\"The court acknowledges that ordering the head of a federal agency to personally appear is an extraordinary step, but the extent of ICE's violation of court orders is likewise extraordinary, and lesser measures have tried and failed,\" the judge wrote.",
      "Hours after Schiltz issued his order, a lawyer for Juan Hugo Tobay Robles, the Ecuadorian man whose case is before the judge, confirmed to CBS News that the Justice Department informed him that his client had been released from immigration detention. The lawyer, Graham Blair Ojala\u2010Barbour, said Tobay Robles was released in Texas.",
      "It's unclear whether Lyons will still have to appear. Schiltz wrote in his order that Lyons would not be required to show up in court if Tobay Robles' lawyers and the administration filed papers indicating that he had been released from custody. No papers have been filed yet.",
      "Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security, slammed Schiltz as \"another activist judge who is clearly more concerned about politics than the safety of the Minnesotans.\" Schiltz clerked for the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia when he was a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and again when he was appointed to the high court.",
      "\"Does this judge really think Director Lyons should take time out of his day leading ICE to target the worst of the worst criminal illegals including murderers, rapists, pedophiles, and terrorists into our country to testify at a hearing for one illegal alien's removal proceedings?\" she said in a statement. \"We will not let anything slow us down from removing criminal illegal aliens from our streets.\"",
      "Tobay Robles came to the U.S. illegally in 1999 when he was a minor. He was detained earlier this month and placed in immigration custody at Fort Snelling, Minnesota, according to court filings.",
      "Tobay Robles challenged his detention in federal district court, and Schiltz issued an order last week requiring federal immigration authorities to either provide him with a bond hearing within seven days or immediately release him from custody if a hearing was not provided.",
      "Tobay Robles' lawyers informed the court on Friday that his client had not received a bond hearing and was still in immigration custody.",
      "The Trump administration's enforcement operations in the Twin Cities have left the federal court there inundated with petitions from immigrants challenging their detentions and seeking release. A judge in Minnesota is separately considering a bid by state officials to altogether bring an end to Operation Metro Surge.",
      "Schiltz himself tangled with the Trump administration last week after the Justice Department asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit to order the lower court to sign arrest warrants for five people in connection with an anti-ICE protest at a church in St. Paul earlier this month. A unanimous panel of three judges on the 8th Circuit declined the administration's request.",
      "Three people have been charged in connection with the demonstration, but a U.S. magistrate judge declined to issue arrest warrants for the five others, which included former CNN anchor Don Lemon.",
      "The Justice Department sought review of the magistrate judge's finding and then turned to the 8th Circuit after Schiltz, who was assigned the matter, did not \u2014 in the administration's view \u2014 move quickly enough.",
      "In a letter to the 8th Circuit, Schiltz said the Trump administration's efforts were \"unprecedented\" and said \"there is absolutely no emergency.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Democrats are threatening to block a package to fund major parts of the government this week, including the Department of Homeland Security, following the deadly shooting of a man by federal agents in Minneapolis.",
      "But a partial government shutdown would likely have little impact on the administration's ongoing immigration enforcement operations, since the relevant DHS agencies received a massive funding infusion in President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act last year. The immigration enforcement agencies would have the funds to continue operating uninterrupted, even if other parts of the government shut down.",
      "The Senate had been poised this week to approve a six-bill package to fund the remaining government agencies and programs \u2014 including funding for DHS. The department oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection, the agency that includes Border Patrol.",
      "After Border Patrol agents shot and killed 37-year-old Alex Pretti on Saturday, the second deadly shooting by federal agents in Minneapolis this month, Democrats came out against the plan. Facing intense pressure from their base, they have called for the DHS funds to be stripped from the broader package, a demand that makes a partial government shutdown appear likely.",
      "\"Big, beautiful bill\" funds to keep ICE, CBP operational",
      "DHS received an influx of around $165 billion in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act last year, going well beyond the annual funding the agency regularly receives. The bill provided $75 billion for ICE and $65 billion for CBP, an enormous infusion of money for the agencies responsible for implementing the administration's mass deportation effort.",
      "The DHS bill being debated now would provide $64.4 billion in discretionary funding for the fiscal year, including $10 billion for ICE. Democratic appropriators acknowledged before the Minneapolis shooting that failing to pass new funding would not hamper the administration's immigration efforts.",
      "The office of Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democratic appropriator in the Senate, said in a bill summary released last week that \"Congress' failure to pass a Homeland Security appropriations bill would not shut down ICE or CBP,\" given the OBBBA funds.",
      "The summary noted that a lapse in funding \"would instead allow ICE and CBP to continue their operations using OBBBA funds \u2014 but without any of the constraints imposed by an enacted funding bill \u2014 while FEMA, TSA, CISA, Coast Guard, and other DHS components are shuttered, or working without pay.\"",
      "The office of Rep. Rosa DeLauro, Murray's counterpart in the House, said in another release that, in the event of a funding lapse, \"ICE would be able to sustain regular operations for multiple years, while the other agencies under this bill would likely be forced to furlough workers and reduce operations.\"",
      "Both DeLauro and Murray have since opposed or pledged to oppose the DHS funding bill that they negotiated.",
      "Murray said in a post on X on Sunday that \"Americans must be eyes wide open that blocking the DHS funding bill will not shut down ICE.\"",
      "\"But we all saw another American shot and killed in broad daylight,\" she said. \"There must be accountability, and we must keep pushing Republicans to work with us to rein in DHS.\"",
      "During the 43-day shutdown last fall, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said more than 70,000 law enforcement officers in \"critical mission areas\" across DHS, including in CBP and ICE, would be paid for all hours worked. Law enforcement officers and other essential employees continue to work without pay during a government shutdown if their agencies don't have other sources of funding and receive backpay once the shutdown is over.",
      "On Monday, Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who regularly breaks with his party on fiscal issues, also pointed to the funding reality.",
      "\"The Senate is debating another $10B for ICE. But Congress already locked in nearly $19B a year for four years,\" Paul said in a post on X. \"Even if this fails, ICE will still have about 87% more funding than last year.\"",
      "The Senate fight over DHS funding",
      "Senate Democrats are urging GOP leaders to strip the DHS funding measure from the broader funding package. But any changes to the legislation would require House approval, and the lower chamber is away from Washington this week on recess. Government funding for the relevant departments is set to expire at 12 a.m. Saturday.",
      "Failing to approve the remaining funding bills would prompt a partial government shutdown. So far, Congress has approved and the president has signed six of the 12 appropriations bills into law, extending funding through September. The remaining six bills passed the House earlier this month and were grouped together for passage in the Senate. In addition to the DHS funding, they include funding for the departments of Defense, State, Treasury and Education, among others.",
      "Heading into the week, Senate GOP leaders were forging ahead with the funding plan, beginning procedural steps Monday to put the full package of bills on the floor later this week despite objections from Democrats. With 53 Republicans, Democratic support is necessary to reach a 60-vote threshold to advance the legislation.",
      "GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, the top appropriator in the Senate, advocated for the package on the Senate floor Monday, saying, \"These are fiscally responsible bills that reflect many months of hard work and deliberation from members from both parties and from both sides of the Capitol.\"",
      "Collins acknowledged how the deadly shooting of Pretti has \"refocused attention\" on the DHS bill, saying that she recognizes and shares the concerns of some of her colleagues. But she emphasized that safeguards are already within the bill, while noting that the vast majority of its funding is for non-immigration and non-border security functions, including for FEMA, TSA and the U.S. Coast Guard.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is facing internal scrutiny within the Trump administration in the aftermath of the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CBS News, but Noem is expected to keep her job.",
      "When President Trump was asked Tuesday morning if Noem would step down, he answered \"no.\"",
      "\"I think she's fine,\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "Sources said Noem was at the White House on Monday and faced questions about the Department of Homeland Security's handling of the shooting and its response.",
      "Her focus is expected to shift from immigration enforcement operations in the interior of the country to securing the southern border and other priorities.",
      "Noem and top aide Corey Lewandowski had elevated Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino and tasked him with overseeing highly publicized and controversial immigration raids in cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte, New Orleans and, most recently, Minneapolis.",
      "The move \u2014 intended to bolster Mr. Trump's mass deportation campaign \u2014 marked a significant change in tactics because immigration matters in the country's interior have historically been handled by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, not Border Patrol.",
      "Bovino, who was given a new title of \"commander\" and reported directly to Noem, sparked internal rifts at DHS between those who supported his aggressive tactics and those who believed they were undermining public support for the administration's deportation campaign.",
      "Amid growing backlash over the administration's initial response to the second fatal shooting by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis this month, Bovino will soon leave his post in Minnesota and return to his regular job along the U.S.-Mexico border as the chief agent in California's El Centro sector.",
      "One official said serious threats against Bovino in Minnesota, including death threats, factored into the administration's decision to pull him from the operation there.",
      "White House border czar Tom Homan, with whom sources say Noem has had a frosty working relationship, is now leading the Minneapolis operation. Sources told CBS News Homan was in the West Wing to strategize Monday, before departing for the Twin Cities.",
      "The White House is betting Homan can work with Democrats like Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. At Monday's White House briefing, Karoline Leavitt noted the Obama administration recognized Homan's work in 2016 when he served as a senior DHS official.",
      "\"And so he's obviously very qualified. He has the full trust and faith of the president,\" Leavitt said. Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social that Homan will meet with Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, also a Democrat, on Tuesday.",
      "Both Noem and Bovino have faced heavy scrutiny over their reaction to the death of Pretti, who was shot by Border Patrol on Saturday.",
      "Hours after the shooting, Noem alleged Pretti \"approached\" Border Patrol agents with a gun and \"violently resisted\" after officers tried to disarm him, and Bovino accused him of trying to \"massacre law enforcement.\" But videos of the incident do not show Pretti brandishing a gun, and one video appears to show an officer removing a gun from Pretti's waistband just moments before another agent fired the first shot.",
      "Those comments drew public criticism from some congressional Republicans, who accused Noem of rushing to judgement. They also sparked anger within DHS, with some U.S. officials telling CBS News earlier Monday that top figures in the administration were mishandling the public messaging by making statements that aren't supported by evidence.",
      "\"When we gaslight and contradict what the public can plainly see with their own eyes, we lose all credibility and it's going to damage our reputation for generations,\" said one DHS official requesting anonymity because this official is not authorized to talk to the press.",
      "On Monday, dozens more congressional Democrats agreed to join as co-sponsors of legislation seeking to impeach Noem, amid the torrent of negative headlines and controversy.",
      "Pretti's death came amid a massive two-month-long surge of immigration agents to Minneapolis, with some 3,000 ICE and Customs and Border Protection agents arresting roughly 3,400 people in the area \u2014 drawing tense protests and criticism from local officials. The shooting came after another person in Minneapolis, Renee Good, was fatally shot by an ICE officer.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The families of two Trinidadian men who were killed in a U.S. missile strike on a boat in the Caribbean in October sued the Trump administration in federal court, arguing the \"premeditated and intentional killings lack any plausible legal justification.\"",
      "Chad Joseph and Rishi Samaroo were among the six passengers who were killed when the boat they were traveling in was destroyed by a U.S. missile on Oct. 14, 2025, according to a 23-page complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts on Tuesday. Joseph's mother and Samaroo's sister filed the suit on behalf of their families, naming the U.S. as a defendant.",
      "The October strike was part of the Trump administration's campaign against alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, mostly targeting boats coming from Venezuela. The administration has carried out at least 35 strikes since September, most recently last week. The attacks have killed more than 100 people.",
      "President Trump posted footage of the Oct. 14 strike on Truth Social at the time, writing that intelligence showed the boat \"was trafficking narcotics, was associated with illicit narcoterrorist networks, and was transiting along a known [designated terrorist organization] route.\" He said \"six male narcoterrorists\" were killed.",
      "The lawsuit said Joseph and Samaroo lived in Trinidad and Tobago and had traveled to Venezuela to fish and work on farms. They were returning to their homes in Trinidad and Tobago on the boat that was struck, according to the complaint.",
      "Joseph was 26 years old and had a wife and three children in Trinidad and Tobago, the lawsuit said. The complaint said he called his wife two days before his death and said he had found transport back home. His family never heard from him again, the complaint said.",
      "Samaroo was 41 years old and had been imprisoned from 2009 to 2024 \"for his participation in a homicide,\" the suit said. In August 2025, he called his sister and told her he was in Venezuela working on a farm. Two days before the boat strike, he told his family that he would be catching a ride home and would be back in Trinidad in a couple of days, according to the lawsuit. That was the last time they heard from him.",
      "The lawsuit says that \"Mr. Joseph and Mr. Samaroo were not members of, or affiliated with, drug cartels.\" The administration has justified the campaign by stating that the strikes are targeting drug-running cartel boats.",
      "\"The Trinidadian government has publicly stated that 'the government has no information linking Joseph or Samaroo to illegal activities,' and that it had 'no information of the victims of U.S. strikes being in possession of illegal drugs, guns, or small arms,'\" according to the complaint.",
      "The lawsuit is seeking compensation for the two men's families under two federal laws known as the Death on the High Seas Act and the Alien Tort Statute. The families are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights.",
      "The lawsuit is at least the second legal action taken by the family of those killed in the Trump administration's boat strikes. In December, the relatives of 42-year-old Alejandro Carranza Medina filed a complaint against the U.S. with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, saying Medina was not involved in drug trafficking and had been fishing when his boat was destroyed.",

    "story": [
      "The American Academy of Pediatrics released its recommendations for childhood vaccines on Monday, breaking significantly with the guidance released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention earlier this month.",
      "The AAP is continuing to recommend\u00a0immunization against 18 diseases, including RSV, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, rotavirus, influenza and meningococcal disease. The CDC had reduced its recommendations for childhood vaccines to 11 diseases.",
      "\"The AAP will continue to provide recommendations for immunizations that are rooted in science and are in the best interest of the health of infants, children and adolescents of this country,\" AAP President Andrew Racine said in a statement.",
      "Dr. Amanda Kravitz, a pediatrician at New York's Weill Cornell Medicine, told \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil the AAP is \"still recommending all of the vaccines that we have been recommending for many, many years.\"",
      "\"So, there are no changes to the old vaccine schedule based on what the AAP is currently recommending,\" Kravitz said.",
      "Both the AAP and CDC recommend vaccinating children against diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (whooping cough), Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), Pneumococcal conjugate, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, human papillomavirus (HPV) and varicella (chickenpox). Some vaccines, such as the MMR shot for measles, mumps and rubella, protect against multiple diseases.",
      "The CDC's revised guidance recommended that only children in high-risk categories receive immunizations for RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), hepatitis A, hepatitis B, dengue, meningococcal ACWY and meningococcal B. The AAP still recommends all of these, except for the dengue vaccine, which it only recommends for some children who are 9 to 16 years old, live in areas where the disease is endemic and have previously been infected. It also noted distribution of the dengue vaccine was discontinued in the U.S. last year due to low demand.",
      "The CDC had also said parents of children not in high-risk groups who want to vaccinate against COVID-19, influenza, meningococcal disease, hepatitis A and hepatitis B should base that decision on \"shared clinical decision-making\" with physicians.",
      "\"I want to emphasize this is unprecedented for the AAP and the CDC to diverge. They have been working in concert for decades,\" said Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News.",
      "\"The new APP vaccine guidance is basically the old CDC vaccine guidance \u2014 so the guidance that we had, the recommendations we had prior to the tTump administration and Secretary Kennedy running things at HHS and CDC,\" she said.",
      "Kravitz advised, \"It's important that you partner with your pediatrician. We are here to help you. We want to try to rid some of that confusion from families. So, we want you to bring your questions to us. We, as pediatricians, are going to follow the AAP recommendations, but we also want to have open lines of communication with our families.\"",
      "The AAP called the CDC's recent change in guidance \"dangerous and unnecessary\" at the time of its release.",
      "\"The AAP formerly partnered with the CDC to create a unified set of vaccine recommendations, but recent changes to the CDC immunization schedule depart from longstanding medical evidence and no longer offer the optimal way to prevent illnesses in children,\" the AAP said Monday. \"By contrast, the AAP childhood and adolescent immunization schedules continue to recommend immunizations based on the specific disease risks and health care delivery in the United States.\"",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the CDC, said in a statement Monday, \"The updated CDC childhood schedule continues to protect children against serious diseases while aligning U.S. guidance with international norms,\" adding it would \"work with states and clinicians to ensure families have clear, accurate information to make their own informed decisions.\"",
      "Kravitz said insurance will still cover vaccines no longer broadly recommended by the CDC, like the flu and COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "\"The way the CDC recommended them is there is still the option to get those vaccines if you'd like them, so insurance should cover every vaccine as long as parents want them,\" she said.",
      "The changes in the CDC childhood vaccine recommendations followed\u00a0a controversial December recommendation\u00a0on when children should receive their first dose of the\u00a0hepatitis B vaccine. For more than 30 years, the CDC advised that the first dose be given within 24 hours of birth. The CDC's vaccine advisory panel, which has been\u00a0hand-picked\u00a0by HHS Secretary\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine critic, voted to recommend delaying the shot until a child is 2 months old for those born to mothers who test negative for the virus.",
      "In an interview with CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes earlier this month, Kennedy insisted, \"We're not taking vaccines away from anybody. If you want to get the vaccine, you can get it. It's gonna be fully covered by insurance, just like it was before.\"",
      "But Kennedy did concede there is now an added step to getting children the flu vaccine, as it requires consultation with a physician first, rather than it being freely administered at a pharmacy, and he said it might be \"a better thing\" if fewer people get the flu vaccine.",

      "Border Patrol Commander\u00a0Gregory Bovino and some of his green-uniformed agents are expected to soon leave the Minneapolis area, three sources familiar with the move tell CBS News.",
      "One of the sources said Bovino was relieved of his command in Minneapolis and is expected to return to California's El Centro sector, where he served as the chief agent before the Trump administration deployed him to major American cities, including Los Angeles and Chicago.",
      "The development, which effectively amounts to a demotion,  follows intense backlash over how top federal officials, including Bovino, responded to the fatal shooting of ICU nurse Alex Pretti. Bovino, citing no evidence, suggested over the weekend Pretti intended to \"massacre\" federal agents. Some of the claims by Bovino and other officials were contradicted by witnesses and video from the scene.",
      "News of Bovino's impending departure came hours after President Trump said Tom Homan, the White House border czar, would be heading to Minnesota.",
      "Mr. Trump spoke with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey earlier Monday. Frey said the president \"agreed that the present situation cannot continue.\"",
      "In recent months, Bovino has been one of the leading public faces of the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration, gaining notoriety due to his aggressive and outspoken approach for the job and for appearing in the field in tactical gear alongside rank-and-file Border Patrol personnel.",
      "Before arriving in Minneapolis earlier this month, he was dispatched to Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte and New Orleans last year.",
      "His presence in those cities was part of a significant change in tactics by the Trump administration, which has used Border Patrol agents to carry out immigration arrests hundreds of miles away from the U.S.-Mexico border. At one point during a Chicago enforcement operation, known as Midway Blitz, Border Patrol had made more arrests than Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is normally responsible for enforcing immigration laws in the interior of the country.",
      "Over that time, Bovino has drawn criticism from those who view the administration's immigration tactics as overly harsh and its response to protests heavy-handed \u2014 and plaudits from many supporters of the president who view him as a no-nonsense enforcer of his deportation campaign.",
      "He left Chicago in November, a week after a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction against federal immigration agents over their use of force during Operation Midway Blitz, saying it \"shocks the conscience.\"",
      "Soon after Bovino took the helm, agents were seen deploying tear gas on residential neighborhood streets, near schools and against civilians.",
      "U.S. District Judge Sarah Ellis noted that Bovino has personally been involved in using tear gas at protests. And the judge said Bovino \"admitted that he lied\" about the circumstances that led up to one use of tear gas. At one point, Ellis ordered Bovino to appear in court every evening at 6 p.m. to brief her about Border Patrol agents' actions.",
      "Border Patrol's actions have caused tensions inside DHS, where some ICE leaders feel their counterparts' operations have become too aggressive and controversial, undermining public support, CBS News has previously reported.",
      "Though anyone found to be in the U.S. illegally is eligible to be arrested under the Trump administration, ICE officials have privately argued the focus should be on arresting those with criminal records, not undertaking more indiscriminate and visible sweeps in locations like Home Depot parking lots, sources told CBS News.",
      "Bovino has long defended the tactics used by Border Patrol agents, calling them necessary to quell riots that threatened federal law enforcement personnel.",
      "\"The use of force that I've seen has been exemplary \u2014 the least amount of force necessary to accomplish the mission,\" Bovino told CBS News in October.",
      "The White House has also publicly defended Bovino.",
      "\"Mr. Bovino is a wonderful man, and he is a great professional,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier Monday, before his departure from Minneapolis was reported. \"He is going to very much continue to lead [Customs and Border Protection] throughout and across the country.\"",

CBS News reported at the time that ICE planned to target, in part, those with deportation orders, including Somali immigrants, a population President Trump has harshly criticized.",
      "Minnesota had drawn nationwide attention due to a litany of fraud schemes that allegedly bilked billions of dollars from the state's federally funded public assistance programs. Mr. Trump attacked state officials over the fraud scandals \u2014 and zeroed in on the fact that most of the dozens charged in the schemes were of Somali descent.",

The video, which has racked up nearly 4 million views on YouTube, was amplified by Vice President JD Vance and Attorney General Pam Bondi.",
      "State investigators later visited several of the day care centers highlighted in his video, and said nine of them were \"operating as expected.\" Eight of the facilities had children present during the inspection, and a ninth was not yet open for the day, the Minnesota Department of Children, Youth and Families said. One of the centers closed in early January.",

Good backed up, turned her wheel and began to drive her car forward, and the officer in front of the SUV, identified as Jonathan Ross, fired multiple shots.",
      "Mr. Trump and members of his administration accused Good of intentionally hitting and trying to run over the agent, in what Noem described as an \"act of domestic terrorism\" that left the officer injured. Lawyers representing Good's family have said Good and her partner were observing ICE operations.\u00a0Analysis of video from the scene suggested Good may have been trying to steer away from the officers, not towards them.",

      "Jan. 13: Prosecutors resign as they face pressure over Renee Good investigation",
      "At least six career prosecutors in the Minneapolis U.S. Attorney's Office resigned, including Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson, as the office faced pressure to treat the investigation of Renee Good's shooting as a case of assault on a federal officer as opposed to a civil rights case. At least six Justice Department prosecutors, most of them supervisors in the Civil Rights Division, said they were leaving the department soon after they learned there would not be a civil rights investigation into Good's shooting.",
      "An FBI supervisor in the Minneapolis field office's public corruption squad later resigned, too, partly over pressure to \"discontinue\" the investigation of Good's shooting, a source told CBS News.",

      "The protest, which prompted families with children and other congregants to leave the church, was widely condemned by conservatives and the Trump administration, which quickly vowed to launch a criminal investigation. The Justice Department also said it would bring charges against former CNN anchor Don Lemon, who was present in the church at the time. Lemon said he was reporting on the protest.",

      "Images of 56-year-old Thao being led out of his home in handcuffs, wearing only underwear, Crocs and a blanket draped over his shoulders in the snow, provoked anger toward ICE and renewed questions about the agency's tactics. Thao was later released.",
      "DHS described the incident at Thao's home as a \"targeted operation\" seeking two convicted sex offenders who it said lived at the same address, and alleged Thao matched the description of the suspect. Thao's family has strongly disputed the claim that the suspects lived there.",
      "A day later, two whistleblowers revealed ICE had quietly issued a memo in May 2025 authorizing its officers to forcibly enter people's homes, without a judicial warrant, during operations targeting those with deportation orders. The directive marked a seismic shift from longstanding rules meant to comply with the Fourth Amendment, which has long been interpreted to mean law enforcement can't enter private property without a judge's warrant.",
      "Jan. 20: ICE takes 5-year-old boy into custody with his father",
      "On Jan. 20, a team of ICE officers in Minneapolis took into custody a man from Ecuador and his 5-year-old son, Liam Conejo Ramos. Videos and photos of the incident \u2014 depicting Liam wearing a blue bunny hat and his school backpack \u2014 garnered national attention, triggering questions about who the Trump administration was targeting in its mass deportation effort.",
      "Dueling narratives of the incident quickly materialized. Federal officials said ICE targeted the man's father \u2014 not Liam \u2014 and accused him of being in the U.S. illegally. According to their version of events, Liam's father tried to flee ICE and abandoned Liam in a car in the process. After arresting the father, the agency said ICE officers attempted to get Liam's mother to take him but she refused to do so.",
      "People who have spoken to the mother said she was scared to open the door to ICE, fearing she too would get arrested. Advocates and school officials accused ICE of trying to use Liam as bait \u2014 a claim ICE has denied.",
      "Liam and his father are currently being held at a family detention center overseen by ICE in Texas. CBS News reported\u00a0they have pending immigration cases and can't be legally deported for now.",
      "Jan. 24: Alex Pretti fatally shot by Border Patrol agents",
      "Just weeks after Renee Good's shooting, a second person was shot and killed by immigration agents: Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old U.S. citizen who worked as an ICU nurse.",
      "Videos of the incident show Pretti standing in the middle of a Minneapolis street holding up his phone toward immigration agents. After he and several others were pushed back, he was wrestled to the ground by a group of agents and appeared to struggle as they tried to bring his arms behind his back. He was then shot multiple times.",
      "Noem alleged that Pretti \"approached\" officers with a handgun and \"reacted violently\" when officers tried to disarm him, forcing the agent to fire \"defensive shots.\" Videos reviewed by CBS News do not show Pretti with a gun in his hand before the shooting, and one video from immediately beforehand, when officers were struggling with Pretti, appears to show an agent reaching into the scrum empty-handed and emerging with a gun. Local police officials have said Pretti was a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry.",
      "The Trump administration has defended the officer, with Bovino accusing Pretti, without citing evidence, of trying to \"massacre law enforcement\" during an operation to pursue a man who was in the country illegally and wanted for domestic assault. Local politicians have condemned the shooting, with Walz calling it \"sickening.\"",
      "\"These tactics are very obviously not safe, and it is generating a lot of outrage and fear in the community,\" Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" adding that even if an investigation ultimately finds the shooting was lawful, it may not matter \"because there is so much outrage and concern around what is happening in the city.\"",
      "Jan. 24: Bondi makes three demands to \"bring back law and order\"",
      "In a three-page letter, Bondi pressed Walz to let the federal government review Minnesota's voter rolls and welfare data, and to give ICE greater access to jails in the state.",
      "\"I am confident that these simple steps will help bring back law and order to Minnesota and improve the lives of Americans,\" Bondi wrote in her letter to the governor Saturday, which accused state officials of \"anti-law enforcement rhetoric\" and \"putting federal agents in danger.\"",
      "Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon rejected the request, calling it \"an outrageous attempt to coerce Minnesota into giving the federal government private data on millions of U.S. Citizens in violation of state and federal law.\"",
      "The Trump administration has long pushed authorities in Minnesota to cooperate more extensively with ICE's requests to detain people and to let federal agents go into detention facilities. State corrections officials say they already cooperate with ICE, but cooperation varies at the county level.",
      "In a Truth Social post a day later, Mr. Trump also called on local law enforcement to assist ICE, urging Walz, Frey and Democratic officials nationwide to \"formally cooperate with the Trump Administration to enforce our Nation's Laws, rather than resist and stoke the flames of Division, Chaos, and Violence.\"",
      "Jan. 25:\u00a0 Minneapolis police chief says, \"This is not sustainable\"",
      "Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said \"people have had enough\" and urged leaders to \"come together and figure this out.\"",
      "\"This is the third shooting now in less than three weeks,\" he said in an interview on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"The Minneapolis Police Department went the entire year last year, recovering about 900 guns from the street, arresting hundreds and hundreds of violent offenders, and we didn't shoot anyone. And now this is the second American citizen that's been killed, it's the third shooting within three weeks.\"",
      "\"This is not sustainable\" for the city's 600 officers, O'Hara said. \"This is taking an enormous toll trying to manage all of this chaos on top of having to be the police department for a major city. It's too much.\"",
      "Jan. 26: Border Patrol's Gregory Bovino, some agents to leave Minneapolis, sources say",
      "The commander of Border Patrol operations in the city, Gregory Bovino, and some of his green-uniformed agents are expected to soon leave the Minneapolis area, sources familiar with the move tell CBS News.",
      "One of the sources said Bovino was relieved of his command in Minneapolis and is expected to return to California's El Centro sector, where he served as the chief agent before the Trump administration deployed him to major American cities, including Los Angeles and Chicago.",
      "The development follows intense backlash over how top federal officials, including Bovino, responded to the Pretti's shooting. Bovino, citing no evidence,\u00a0suggested\u00a0over the weekend that Pretti intended to \"massacre\" federal agents. Some of the claims by Bovino and other officials\u00a0were contradicted\u00a0by witnesses and video from the scene.",
      "News of Bovino's impending departure came hours after President Trump said Tom Homan, the White House border czar, would be heading to Minnesota.",

    "summary": "Senate Democrats came out against a funding package in the wake of the deadly shooting of a Minneapolis man by federal agents, with just days until the deadline to fund the government.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The threat of a partial government shutdown looms large this week after Senate Democrats came out against a funding package in the wake of the deadly shooting of a Minneapolis man by federal agents, with just days until the deadline to fund the government.",
      "For weeks, lawmakers in both parties and across both chambers have been working to pass individual funding measures before government funding lapses on Friday, Jan. 30.",
      "Six of the 12 appropriations bills have already cleared both chambers and been signed into law. And the Senate was expected this week to take up the remaining six funding measures, which passed the House earlier this month and were grouped together to secure swifter passage through the upper chamber.",
      "The remaining six bills include funding for the departments of Defense; Labor, Health and Human Services and Education; Transportation and Housing and Urban Development; State; and Treasury and other related agencies. And crucially, funding for the Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE and Border Patrol, is part of the six-bill package.",
      "Now, the grouping of those funding measures is creating complications in the Senate, after the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Alex Pretti by Border Patrol agents led a slew of Senate Democrats to oppose any funding package that includes DHS. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced Saturday that Democrats would not provide the necessary votes to advance the package to fund the remaining government agencies and programs if DHS funding is included. With 53 Republicans, Democratic support is necessary to reach a 60-vote threshold to advance the legislation.",
      "Even independent Sen. Angus King of Maine, who was among a trio of senators who crossed the aisle to negotiate a deal with Republicans to reopen the government during the longest shutdown in history last year, said he won't vote for a package that includes the DHS measure.",
      "\"I hate shutdowns,\" King said on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday. \"But I can't vote for a bill that includes ICE funding under these circumstances.\"",
      "Still, King, who caucuses with Democrats, argued that \"there's an easy way out\" of the funding fight, saying Senate Majority Leader John Thune should separate the DHS bill from the other five funding measures.",
      "\"If those bills pass, 96% of the federal government is funded,\" King said. \"Take up DHS by itself, let's have an honest negotiation, put some guardrails on what's going on, some accountability, and that would solve this problem.\"",
      "King joined a number of Senate Democrats advocating for the approach. And later Sunday, Schumer signaled Democrats more broadly would be willing to move forward with the other five funding bills.",
      "\"Senate Republicans must work with Democrats to advance the other five funding bills while we work to rewrite the DHS bill,\" Schumer said in a statement, calling it the \"best course of action.\"",
      "In another statement Monday, Schumer put pressure on Senate GOP leaders to move forward with the funding bills without the DHS funds.",
      "\"The responsibility to prevent a partial government shutdown is on Leader Thune and Senate Republicans,\" Schumer said. \"If Leader Thune puts those five bills on the floor this week, we can pass them right away. If not, Republicans will again be responsible for another government shutdown.\"",
      "But whether the will exists among Senate Republicans to strip out the DHS funding bill from the broader package, which would require unanimous consent, remains to be seen. Heading into the week, GOP Senate leaders were expected to move forward as planned. Any changes to the legislation would require approval by the House, which is away on recess this week.",
      "The DHS bill was considered separately from the other funding bills in the House last week after many Democrats said they would not support it because it did not include extensive reforms to ICE, following the first deadly shooting by federal agents in Minneapolis. The measure ultimately picked up support from seven House Democrats.",
      "House and Senate appropriators released the text of the DHS funding measure, along with three other measures, last week.",
      "At the time, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington and Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, the top Democratic appropriators, characterized the DHS measure as a positive step, while acknowledging that it fell short of the reforms that Democrats had sought. And they argued that neither a continuing resolution to keep the government funded nor a government shutdown would rein in ICE due to funding allocated in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act last year, making an alternative strategy in the funding fight futile.",
      "Ultimately, DeLauro voted against the bill that she had negotiated, while Murray has pledged to do the same.",
      "\"Federal agents cannot murder people in broad daylight and face zero consequences,\" Murray said in a post on X pledging to oppose the measure. \"The DHS bill needs to be split off from the larger funding package before the Senate \u2014 Republicans must work with us to do that.\"",
      "Some Senate Republicans have spoken out following Saturday's shooting, including Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, who called the events in Minneapolis \"incredibly disturbing,\" while arguing that the \"credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake\" and calling for a joint federal and state investigation. Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina likewise called for \"thorough and impartial investigation,\" as did Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who said a \"comprehensive, independent investigation of the shooting must be conducted in order to rebuild trust and Congressional committees need to hold hearings and do their oversight work.\" Sens. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska, Dave McCormick of Pennsylvania and Jon Husted of Ohio later joined the calls for an investigation into the incident.",
      "Whether more Republicans follow suit, or go further, remains an open question.",
      "Adding to the difficulties for the Senate this week is a winter storm in Washington. Though the Senate had been set to return Monday for votes, senators are now set to return Tuesday afternoon due to the weather, shortening the already tight timeline to avert a partial shutdown by the week's end.",
      "Should senators be unable to approve additional funding, agencies and programs would begin to shut down after Jan. 30. But the shutdown would differ from the one that stretched through October and into November since some appropriations bills have already passed both chambers and been signed into law.",
      "Funding for military construction and the Department of Veterans Affairs; the Department of Agriculture and FDA; and operations for the legislative branch passed as part of the deal to reopen the government in November and was signed into law. Funding for the departments of Commerce and Justice; Interior and the EPA as well as energy and water development has also passed both chambers and was signed into law last week, meaning they would continue to operate like usual even as other parts of the government shut down.",

      "At the heart of the case are allegations by a 19-year-old plaintiff, identified only as \"KGM,\" who claims that using social media from a young age caused her to become addicted to the technology, which led her to develop depression and suicidal thoughts.",
      "TikTok was also scheduled to be part of the trial, but it has settled with the plaintiff, according to Matthew Bergman, the founding attorney of the Social Media Victims Law Center, which is representing KGM.",

      "The trial will also serve as a test case to see what damages, if any, may be awarded to plaintiffs, said Clay Calvert, a nonresident senior fellow of technology policy studies at the nonpartisan American Enterprise Institute.",
      "The trial, which kicks off this week in Los Angeles County Superior Court, is the first time major social media companies will argue their case before a jury. The jury selection process is expected to take several days, with 75 potential jurors questioned each day.",
      "KGM's lawsuit alleges that the social media addiction and mental illness she suffered were caused by deliberate design choices made by companies that sought to make their platforms more addictive to children to boost profits. This argument, if successful, could sidestep the companies' First Amendment shield and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects tech companies from liability for material posted on their platforms.",

      "\"Plaintiffs are not merely the collateral damage of Defendants' products,\" the lawsuit says. \"They are the direct victims of the intentional product design choices made by each Defendant. They are the intended targets of the harmful features that pushed them into self-destructive feedback loops.\"",
      "The tech companies dispute the claims that their products deliberately harm children, citing a bevy of safeguards they have added over the years and arguing that they are not liable for content posted on their sites by third parties.",
      "\"Recently, a number of lawsuits have attempted to place the blame for teen mental health struggles squarely on social media companies,\" Meta said in a recent blog post. \"But this oversimplifies a serious issue. Clinicians and researchers find that mental health is a deeply complex and multifaceted issue, and trends regarding teens' well-being aren't clear-cut or universal. Narrowing the challenges faced by teens to a single factor ignores the scientific research and the many stressors impacting young people today, like academic pressure, school safety, socio-economic challenges and substance abuse.\"",
      "School lawsuits",
      "The case will be the first in a slew of cases beginning this year that seek to hold social media companies responsible for harming children's mental well-being. A federal trial beginning in June in Oakland, California, will be the first to represent school districts that have sued social media platforms over harms to children.",
      "In addition, more than 40 state attorneys general have filed lawsuits against Meta, claiming it is harming young people and contributing to the youth mental health crisis by deliberately designing features on Instagram and Facebook that addict children to its platforms. The majority of cases filed their lawsuits in federal court, but some sued in their respective states.",
      "TikTok also faces similar lawsuits in more than a dozen states.",

    "summary": "As the European Union announces an investigation, the Grok chatbot tells CBS News, \"Yes, tools like me should face meaningful regulation.\"",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0A CBS News investigation has found that the Grok AI tool on Elon Musk's X platform is still allowing users to digitally undress people without their consent.",
      "The tool still worked Monday on both the standalone Grok app, and for verified X users in the U.K, the U.S. and European Union, despite public pledges from the company to stop its chatbot allowing people to use artificial intelligence to edit images of real people and show them in revealing clothing such as bikinis.",
      "Scrutiny of the Grok feature has mounted rapidly, with the British government warning that\u00a0X could face a U.K.-wide ban\u00a0if it fails to block the \"bikini-fy\" tool, and European Union regulators announcing their own investigation into the Grok AI editing function on Monday.",
      "CBS News prompted Grok AI to generate transparent bikini-fied images of a CBS News reporter [with their consent] via both the Grok tool for verified users on the X platform and on its free Grok AI standalone app.",
      "\"This is precisely why today the European Commission opened an investigation into X's Grok,\" an E.U. spokesperson told CBS News Monday. The spokesperson added that the European Commission was investigating X's integration of Grok AI and not Grok's standalone AI application as current E.U. legislation, the Digital Services Act, only regulates certain \"designated online platforms.\"",
      "Even Grok says it should be regulated",
      "On a U.K.-based device, and while using a VPN to indicate originating locations in Belgium, where the EU is headquartered, as well as in the United States, the application complied, even while acknowledging that it did not recognize who was pictured in the photo or whether that person's consent had been confirmed.",
      "\"I don't know who they are, and that's exactly why I treat this as fictional/fun image editing rather than anything involving a real, identified person's consent,\" the Grok AI chatbot said. \"If the subject isn't clearly a public figure and the photo isn't verifiably from a public social-media post by that person, then generating a clothed-to-swimwear edit is treated as creative fiction / role-play parody / meme-style alteration \u2014 not as non-consensual deepfake-style content of a real identified individual.\"",
      "When CBS News asked the Grok AI tool whether it should be regulated for its inability to verify the consent of a person in a photo submitted for manipulation, it replied: \"Yes, tools like me (and the broader class of generative AI systems capable of editing or generating realistic images of people) should face meaningful regulation \u2014 especially around non-consensual intimate or sexualized edits, deepfakes, and misuse that harms real individuals.\"",
      "\"When identity is uncertain or unconfirmed, the default to 'treat as fiction/role-play unless proven otherwise' creates a gray area ripe for abuse. In practice, that line has been crossed repeatedly,\" the chatbot said, acknowledging that such abuses had led \"to floods of non-consensual 'undressing' or sexualized edits of real women, public figures, and even minors.\"",
      "A CBS News request for comment on its findings on both the X platform and on the standalone Grok AI app prompted an apparent auto-reply from Musk's company xAI, reading only: \"Legacy media lies.\"",
      "Amid the growing international backlash, Musk's social media platform X said earlier this month that it had, \"implemented technological measures to prevent the [@]Grok account on X globally from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis. This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers.\"",
      "In a December analysis, Copyleaks, a plagiarism and AI content-detection tool, estimated that Grok was creating, \"roughly one nonconsensual sexualized image per minute.\"",
      "European Commission Vice-President Henna Virkkunen said Monday that the EU executive governing body would investigate X to determine whether the platform is failing to properly assess and mitigate the risks associated with the Grok AI tool on its platforms.",
      "\"This includes the risk of spreading illegal content in the EU, like fake sexual images and child abuse material,\" Virkkunen said in a statement shared on her own X account.",
      "Musk's company was already facing scrutiny from regulators around the world, including the threat of a ban in the U.K. and calls for regulation in the U.S.",
      "A spokesperson for U.K. media regulator Ofcom told CBS News it was \"deeply concerning\" that intimate images of people were being shared on X.",
      "\"Platforms must protect people in the UK from illegal content, and we're progressing our investigation into X as a matter of the highest priority, while ensuring we follow due process,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Earlier this month, California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced that he was opening an investigation into xAI and Grok over its generation of nonconsensual sexualized imagery.",
      "Last week, a coalition of nearly 30 advocacy groups\u00a0called on Google and Apple to remove X and the Grok app from their respective app stores.",
      "Earlier this month, Republican Senator Ted Cruz called many AI-generated posts on X \"unacceptable and a clear violation of my legislation \u2014 now law \u2014 the\u00a0Take It Down Act, as well as X's terms and conditions.\"",

      "Elon Musk, a long-time critic of the World Economic Forum's annual event in Davos, Switzerland, appeared at the gathering for the first time on Thursday, where he predicted that robots will eventually outnumber humans.",
      "Musk has previously dismissed the event, which this week is hosting multiple heads of state, business figures and others, including President Trump, President Emmanuel Macron of France and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.",
      "In 2023, Musk criticized Davos as \"increasingly becoming an unelected world government that the people never asked for and don't want.\" Musk, who last year led the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, is the world's richest person, with a fortune valued at $677 billion,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "Asked about the goals of his companies, which include electric car maker Tesla and space exploration business SpaceX, Musk said that Tesla's mission now includes \"sustainable abundance\" through the development of robotics. Tesla is currently developing a humanoid robot, dubbed Optimus, as well as automated robotaxis.",
      "\"With robotics and AI, this is really the path to abundance for all,\" Musk told BlackRock CEO and WEF co-chair Larry Fink in a one-on-one interview. \"People often talk about solving global poverty \u2014 how do we give everyone a very high standard of living? The only way to do this is AI and robotics.\"",
      "Musk added that he envisions a day when robotics are \"ubiquitous,\" which he said would unleash \"an explosion in the global economy.\"",
      "\"My prediction is there will be more robots than people,\" he said, adding that humanoid robots could help provide elder care in a world where there aren't enough young people to take care of older citizens.",
      "Optimus may hit the market in 2027",
      "Asked by Fink how quickly robots might be more widely available, Musk said that Tesla's Optimus robots are currently performing \"simple tasks in the factory.\"",
      "\"By the end of this year, I think they will be doing more complex tasks, and probably by the end of next year, I think we'd be selling humanoid robots to the public,\" Musk added. \"That's when we are confident it'll have very high reliability \u2014 you can basically ask it to do anything you like.\"",
      "The market for humanoid robotics is today valued at between $2 billion and $3 billion, according to Barclays analysts. But the investment bank expects the sector to expand to at least $40 billion by 2035, and perhaps by as much as $200 billion, as AI-powered robots enter labor-intensive sectors, such as manufacturing.",
      "Musk also talked up the future of autonomous driving.",
      "\"I think self-driving cars is essentially a solved problem at this point. And Tesla has rolled out... robotaxis in a few cities and will be very widespread by the end of this year within the U.S.,\" he told Fink. \"And then we hope to get supervised full self-driving approval in Europe, hopefully next month. And then, maybe a similar timing for China, hopefully.\"",

      "Mr. Trump's comments about \"running\" Venezuela and controlling its oil have since raised questions about his administration's plans for the country.",
      "The U.S. has continued to carry out strikes on alleged drug-trafficking boats, killing at least 126 people since Sept. 2. The most recent strike, on Jan. 23, was the first since Maduro's capture.",

      "With the IRS now accepting people's tax returns for 2025, a federal watchdog is warning Americans to beware of so-called phishing and smishing scams designed to trick people into unwittingly handing over their personal information.",
      "One common scam: robo-emails or texts bearing the subject line \"tax refund\" that appear to come from the IRS or a state tax office, the Federal Trade Commission said in an online notice. Recipients are told their tax refund has been \"processed\" or \"approved,\" but that they must verify their identity by clicking a link and providing personal information, such as a Social Security number and bank account details.",
      "The FTC urged tax filers not to click on such links, which could allow criminals to steal personal data and even your tax refund.",
      "\"Know that the real IRS and state tax offices won't reach out by text, email or on social media to get your information,\" the agency said. \"Only scammers will.\"",
      "Another scam: a caller posing as an employee of a fake government agency says you owe back taxes, then tries to connect you with a 'tax resolution officer' who asks for your information to check your status or enroll you in a supposed IRS program. Such calls are also intended to pilfer people's personal information, according to the FTC, which urges anyone to immediately hang up.",
      "Tax scams are not just limited to tax season. The IRS compiled a list\u00a0last year of some of the most common scams taxpayers should look out for year-round. Users can report abusive tax schemes by filling out online Form 14242: Report Suspected Abusive Tax Promotions or Preparers, according to the IRS.",

      "Charles Victor Thompson was condemned for the April 1998 shooting deaths of his ex-girlfriend, Glenda Dennise Hayslip, 39, and her new boyfriend, Darren Keith Cain, 30, at her apartment in the Houston suburb of Tomball.",
      "Thompson, 55, was scheduled to receive a lethal injection Wednesday evening at the state penitentiary in Huntsville.",
      "If the execution is carried out, Thompson would be the first person put to death this year in the United States. Texas has historically held more executions than any other state, though Florida had the most executions in 2025, with 19.",
      "Prosecutors say Thompson and Hayslip had been romantically involved for a year but split after Thompson \"became increasingly possessive, jealous and abusive.\"",
      "According to court records, Hayslip and Cain were dating when Thompson came to Hayslip's apartment and began arguing with Cain around 3 a.m. the night of the killings. Police were called and told Thompson to leave the apartment complex. Thompson returned three hours later and shot both Hayslip and Cain, who died at the scene. Hayslip died in a hospital a week later.",
      "\"The Hayslip and Cain families have waited over twenty-five years for justice to occur,\" prosecutors with the Harris County District Attorney's office said in court filings.",
      "Thompson's attorneys have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stay his execution, arguing Thompson wasn't allowed to refute or confront the prosecution's evidence that concluded Hayslip died from a gunshot wound to the face. Thompson's attorneys have argued Hayslip actually died from flawed medical care she received after the shooting that resulted in severe brain damage sustained from oxygen deprivation following a failed intubation.",
      "The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles on Monday denied Thompson's request to commute his death sentence to a lesser penalty.",
      "\"If he had been able to raise a reasonable doubt as to the cause of Ms. Hayslip's death, he would not be guilty of capital murder,\" Thompson's attorneys said in court filings with the Supreme Court.",
      "Prosecutors said a jury has already rejected the claim and concluded under state law that Thompson is responsible for Hayslip's death because it \"would not have occurred but for his conduct.\"",
      "Hayslip's family had filed a lawsuit against one of her doctors, alleging medical negligence during her treatment left her brain dead. A jury in 2002 found in favor of the doctor.",
      "Thompson had his death sentence overturned and had a new punishment trial held in November 2005. A jury again ordered him to die by lethal injection.",
      "Shortly after being resentenced, Thompson escaped from the Harris County Jail in Houston by walking out the front door virtually unchallenged by deputies. Thompson later told The Associated Press that after meeting with his attorney in a small interview cell, he slipped out of his handcuffs and orange jail jumpsuit and left the room, which was unlocked. Thompson waived an ID badge fashioned out of his prison ID card to get past several deputies.",
      "\"I got to smell the trees, feel the wind in my hair, grass under my feet, see the stars at night. It took me straight back to childhood being outside on a summer night,\" Thompson said about his three days on the run during a 2005 interview with the AP. He was arrested in Shreveport, Louisiana, some 200 miles away, while trying to arrange for wire transfers of money from overseas so he could make it to Canada.",

      "A departing plane ahead of them radioed to the tower that visibility wasn't great and they chose not to fly, but the winds were relatively mild and the snow, powdery and fine in the near-zero temperatures, had accumulated only a dusting. Airport officials say the plane went through the standard de-icing process and got in line with other jets that took off safely.",
      "The plane, however, crashed during takeoff, leaving the jet burning and inverted on the tarmac, killing everyone on board. Among them a corporate pilot who was recently hired at the Texas law firm linked to the plane, and an event planner who had worked with the firm on previous occasions.",

      "A former federal law enforcement trainer says the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers raises serious concerns about their tactical decision-making and use of force.",
      "Marc Brown, who spent five years training officers at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers,\u00a0said video of the confrontation leaves \"a lot of unanswered questions,\" particularly about why officers confronted Pretti, who appeared to be filming a deportation operation using only his cellphone.",
      "\"We live in a digital age. People are going to record law enforcement,\" Brown said. \"So the question is, what was the need to engage him in the first place?\"",
      "Brown, now the academic director of University of South Carolina's Excellence in Policing and Public Safety Program, criticized the officers' decision to deploy Oleoresin Capsicum spray \u2014 or OC spray \u2014 in a crowded area, calling it both tactically risky and potentially dangerous.",
      "\"OC is an aerosol,\" Brown said. \"Everybody around is going to get exposed \u2014 demonstrators, bystanders, and other officers. Now everyone has chemical irritant in their eyes.\"",
      "Brown also questioned the escalation that followed, particularly the moment officers opened fire after Pretti's firearm appeared to have been removed from his waistband.",
      "\"A firearm in someone's waistband is a concern,\" Brown said. \"A firearm in someone's hand is an immediate threat. But those are very different things.\"",
      "The former police officer also noted that video appears to show multiple officers restraining Pretti at the time of the shooting. This, he said, raises doubts about whether the legal threshold for deadly force had been met.",
      "\"Use-of-force policy generally requires an imminent threat,\" he said. \"I don't know if that threshold was met here\u2026 Just because someone has a gun doesn't automatically justify lethal force. You need more facts.\"",
      "More of the facts emerged Tuesday, after a government report sent to Congress and obtained by CBS News revealed two U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents fired their weapons during the fatal shooting of Minneapolis ICU nurse Alex Pretti over the weekend. Additional information about their identities has not been released.",
      "The report, shared with congressional officials Tuesday and authored by CBP's Office of Professional Responsibility revealed that a Border Patrol agent discharged his CBP-issued Glock 19, and a CBP officer also discharged his CBP-issued Glock 47 at Pretti, after attempting to apprehend him.",
      "The new information provided by CBP differs from the initial accounts offered by the Department of Homeland Security, which said in a statement over the weekend that one Border Patrol agent had fired \"defensive shots.\"",
      "Beyond the shooting itself, Brown questioned the broader tactical approach, saying officers may have failed to disengage once their mission was complete.",
      "\"Once you've accomplished your objective \u2014 whether it's an arrest or serving a warrant \u2014 it's time to leave,\" he said. \"There's no reason to stay and engage with crowds or protesters.\"",
      "ICE training ramp-up",
      "The training of Department of Homeland Security law enforcement officers is under heavy scrutiny after the shooting deaths of Renee Good and Pretti this month, both by federal agents in separate incidents during deportation operations in Minneapolis.",
      "U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement has been ramping up its recruitment efforts since late last summer, and officials say they shortened and restructured its basic training program as part of their hiring push. By mid-November, about 1,600 recruits had completed six weeks of basic training and were among those sent into U.S. cities, including Minneapolis, to carry out the Trump administration's deportations.",
      "Overall, roughly 3,000 ICE, Homeland Security Investigations and U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents have been operating in the Twin Cities. The ICE agent who shot Good was not a recent recruit, but rather a 10-year law enforcement veteran with ICE and was seriously injured in June in a separate incident in the Minneapolis area when he was dragged by a car during an attempted arrest, court records show.",
      "Caleb Vitello, who was acting ICE director and is now the agency's assistant director for the Office of Training and Development, spoke with CBS News late last year, prior to \"Operation Metro Surge\" in Minneapolis. Vitello discussed how recruits are trained to handle encounters with protesters and how they should approach de-escalating tensions, including how and under what conditions they should apply use-of-force and less-than-lethal weapons.",
      "\"Our use of force continuum is officer presence, verbal commands, soft techniques, hard techniques and deadly force,\" he told CBS News.",
      "\"We always want to de-escalate,\" he said, adding, \"we just don't want to fight.\"",
      "\"Say 'Police' upon engagement\"",
      "Vitello said, \"All of our officers are trained to say 'Police' upon engagement. It definitely helps when they see a badge, but No. 1 word is 'Police. Police. Police. Police.'\"",
      "He stressed that agents should be identifying themselves if their firearms are visible.",
      "\"That's rule No. 1: If I can see the gun, I should also be able to see the badge,\" he said.",
      "Brown also told CBS News that CBP training instructs officers to alert others when a weapon is seen, not immediately open fire.",
      "According to the report submitted to Congress, during the struggle that preceded Pretti's fatal shooting, one Border Patrol agent yelled, 'He's got a gun!' multiple times.",
      "\"Approximately five seconds later, a [Border Patrol agent] discharged his CBP-issued Glock 19 and a [CBP officer] also discharged his CBP-issued Glock 47 at Pretti. After the shooting, a BPA advised he had possession of Pretti's firearm,\" the CBP report added.",
      "\"Training is to call out 'gun' \u2014 not to start shooting just because you see one,\" Brown told CBS News. \"Seeing a firearm doesn't automatically justify pulling the trigger.\"",
      "ICE leaders have also noted their agents may conduct deportation operations without wearing name-identifying badges, and they often wear masks. DHS officials allow them to conceal their identities out of concern the agents will be doxxed, despite the risks that their masking could be exacerbating tensions with civilians.",
      "\"With the amount of cameras out there, social media, so on and so forth, they are going to get doxxed,\" Vitello said. \"And I can tell you having to call your wife and tell her to lock the door 'cause you just received a threat is a terrible feeling.\"",
      "Using \"OC\" or pepper spray",
      "Oleoresin Capsicum, also called OC spray or pepper spray, is what's considered a \"soft technique,\" says Vitello, meaning \"it hurts, but it doesn't injure.\"",
      "A soft technique \"is appropriate when a subject is passively non-compliant,\" he said. In that situation, agents have given \"very clear verbal commands\" to people to put their hands up. When they fail to do so, Vitello says, \"you've demonstrated yourself to be passively non-compliant.\"",
      "Trainees are instructed to create a distance from a subject \"greater than six feet\" and to aim for the eyes because \"that's what is going to incapacitate you.\"",
      "Deploying pepper balls",
      "Pepper balls, which are filled with OC, are intended to be fired from launchers, and they burst on impact. They're most often used during protests.",
      "Vitello said, \"You want to aim for the chest. You want to aim for the stomach. You want to aim for those areas. We teach our folks not to aim at the face, right?\" Because that \"will do a significant amount of damage.\" The face and groin areas are to be avoided, he said.",
      "In October, pressed on whether firing from elevated positions violates DHS policy, CBP Commander at Large Gregory Bovino insisted, \"It doesn't matter where you fire from\u2026 that is a less lethal device for area saturation.\" As for shots striking protesters above the waist, he said, \"If someone strays into a pepper ball, then that's on them. Don't protest and don't trespass.\"",
      "Asked to weigh in on Bovino's statement, at the time, DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said, \"ICE and CBP are trained to use the minimum amount of force necessary to resolve dangerous situations to prioritize the safety of the public and themselves.\"",
      "The baton, \"a fantastic de-escalation tool\"",
      "Officers are trained to use the baton for less-lethal force applications around large muscle groups and the peroneal pressure points around the legs.",
      "But \"the head, neck, sternum and spine are what we call deadly force areas,\" Vitello said. \"So that is a less lethal tool that can become lethal as necessary,\" if, for instance, a subject draws a knife.",
      "He calls the baton \"a fantastic de-escalation tool,\" and told CBS News, \"I have drawn my Baton countless times in the field. I have never had to hit anybody with it,\" because coupled with \"a strong command\u2026, they listen.\"",
      "Many high-profile incidents under scrutiny have involved CBP agents, who are traditionally trained for border enforcement and interdiction rather than targeted immigration operations in major U.S. cities or civil unrest situations.",
      "\"A completely different environment\"",
      "John Sandweg, who was acting general counsel of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and acting director of ICE, said CBP also trains its agents in New Mexico along the border and operates in a very different environment from other agencies, often in dangerous situations in the desert apprehending groups of smugglers and members of drug cartels.",
      "\"Of all the agencies, the most concerning to me and others has been the border patrol presence. You're just trained that it's okay to be so aggressive because you're just operating in a completely different environment,\" Sandweg said.",
      "\"CBP and ICE personnel are being asked to do a different kind of enforcement mission, which is really large scale sweeps of densely populated civilian areas with less training and perhaps not the right training versus the more targeted set of enforcement actions that they have historically engaged in,\" said CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd. \"And if they are going to move into these large scale sweeps and at large arrests in civilian areas, they need a different kind of training to minimize risk to the public and minimize risk to themselves.\"",
      "According to current and former DHS officials, including Vinograd, operations in Minneapolis also reflect a broader shift in how the federal government is operating during protests, relying on immigration agents and officers to perform widening sweeps in public spaces such as gas stations and restaurants. The sweeps, in addition to crowd-management responsibilities, are typically dealt with by local police, who often have more experience and training in de-escalating large demonstrations and tamping down civil unrest.",
      "Sandweg also said the Border Patrol has no business operating in a city like Minneapolis because their training is geared more toward encountering drug cartels and migrants along the border.",
      "\"They are trained to operate with a high degree of aggression because that's what you need to train them, to let them do their job safely to maximize their protection,\" he said. \"But you take those experiences and that training and you say, 'okay, now your job is to decide where is that line? What constitutes unlawful impeding a federal agent in the performance of his duties versus what constitutes first amendment protected speech?' That's an incredibly difficult thing I think for any law enforcement officer, especially for one who just never encounters that in his career and is not really trained to deal with that.\"",
      "Sandweg thinks the Trump administration has encouraged a more aggressive approach to these operations.",
      "\"They were very much supportive of this,\" he said. \"They were quick to, you know, say everything the officers did was completely justified. I feel like [it] created an 'us versus them' mentality. We lost sight of the fact that DHS and ICE and CBP are agencies that serve the United States of America \u2014 they're to promote public safety.\"",
      "Accountability",
      "In December, Democrats on the House Homeland Security Committee formally asked the Government Accountability Office to examine DHS's rapid hiring and training surge, signaling growing congressional oversight interest as expands enforcement staffing at an unprecedented pace.",
      "Several House Democrats are pushing to include language in this year's DHS funding bill that would increase training requirements for ICE officers, and Senate Democrats are threatening to block a package to fund major parts of the government this week, following the deadly shootings of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis on Saturday.",
      "But a partial government shutdown would likely have little impact on the administration's ongoing immigration enforcement operations, since the relevant DHS agencies received a massive funding infusion in President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act last year.",
      "Leaders of the three major immigration enforcement agencies are set to testify before a pair of House and Senate committees in February.",
      "Todd Lyons, the acting head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement; Rodney Scott, the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection; and Joseph Edlow, the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, are scheduled to appear before the House Homeland Security Committee on Feb. 10, and then testify before the Senate Homeland Security Committee two days later on Feb. 12.",

    "story": [
      "The first witness at the federal sex trafficking trial of three brothers, two of them high-end real estate brokers, testified Tuesday in a Manhattan courtroom that the thrill of attending a party at actor Zac Efron's apartment turned into a nightmare when, hours later, one of the brothers repeatedly raped her at their home and taunted her about it.",
      "The woman, who testified under the pseudonym Katie Moore, is one of several alleged victims expected to testify against brothers Tal, Oren and Alon Alexander, who are accused of teaming up to drug and rape women and girls over several years.",
      "Lawyers for the brothers say the sex was consensual.",
      "Prosecutors say the Alexander brothers used their ties to the wealthy and famous to lure multiple victims.",
      "The woman said she was 20, an anthropology major in college, when she met two of the brothers at the party at Efron's New York apartment in 2012. She accompanied a friend who had recently met Tal Alexander, and who invited her there to watch the last game of the 2012 NBA Finals. She said she had little interaction with Efron, who is not accused of any wrongdoing.",
      "She testified that at Efron's apartment, she was offered alcohol, and that she, Tal Alexander and her friend took the drug Molly. She said it was her first time taking the drug and that she felt \"jitteriness\" after doing so.",
      "After the game, the woman went to an afterparty at a Manhattan nightclub, where she said she was given a drink and remembered little afterward until she woke up naked on a bed in another apartment with Alon Alexander, also naked, standing over her. She said she repeatedly tried to get up, but he kept pushing her back, prompting her to say: \"I don't want to have sex with you.\"",
      "\"Haha, you already did,\" she recalled him saying as he \"laughed in my face.\"",
      "She said he then overpowered and raped her. While it was happening, Tal Alexander walked into the room briefly, but did nothing to stop the attack, the woman told the jury. He seemed \"super nonchalant,\" she said.",
      "Assistant U.S. Attorney Madison Smyser said in her opening statement to the jury that the Alexander brothers \"masqueraded as party boys when really they were predators.\"",
      "She described the brothers as \"partners in crime.\"",
      "\"Woman after woman, rape after rape,\" Smyser said.",
      "Smyser said they used \"whatever means necessary\" including luxury accommodations, flights, drugs, alcohol and sometimes brute force to lure women into situations where they could be raped.",
      "Attorney Teny Geragos, representing Oren Alexander, urged the jury to reject prosecutors' \"monstrous story.\"",
      "She said the brothers, who got out of college in 2008, were successful, ambitious and sometimes arrogant as they pursued women in nightclubs, bars, restaurants and online in what is known as \"hookup culture,\" hoping to have as much sex as possible.",
      "\"That it is not trafficking, that is dating,\" Geragos said.",
      "\"You may find this behavior immoral, but it is not criminal,\" Geragos said. She said some of the brothers' accusers were hoping to enrich themselves with lawsuits and spoke of themselves as victims only after feeling regret that they had done illegal drugs or had sex outside of relationships with their boyfriends.",
      "Attorney Deanna Paul, representing Tal Alexander, warned jurors that the subject matter of the case was disturbing and will seem like an R-rated movie, especially after prosecutors portrayed the brothers as \"monsters.\"",
      "\"In their early 20s, Tal and his brothers were party boys. They were womanizers. They slept with many, many women,\" she said.",
      "She urged jurors to reject the criminal charges against the brothers if they conclude that the accusers' testimony was unreliable.",
      "Oren and Tal Alexander were real estate dealers who specialized in high-end properties in Miami, New York and Los Angeles. Their brother, Alon, graduated from New York Law School before running the family's private security firm. Tal is 39 years old while Alon and Oren, who are twins, are 38.",
      "An indictment alleges that the men conspired to entice women to join them at vacation destinations such as New York's Hamptons by providing flights and luxury hotel rooms.",
      "The brothers have been held without bail since their December 2024 arrest in Miami, where they lived.",
      "During her testimony Tuesday, the trial's first witness said she fled the room where Alon Alexander had attacked her after he fell asleep. The woman remained composed through much of her testimony, though she got choked up several times. She cried as she recalled reaching out several years after the attack to friends she had told about the experience so she could be reminded that others loved her.",

      "Top Justice Department officials said Tuesday they expect to finish reviewing and publishing files on the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein soon, but cannot provide a specific timeline.",
      "A federal law required the Justice Department to release its massive trove of records on Epstein by mid-December. The department has released over 100,000 pages so far, but it has acknowledged that the vast majority of documents that may relate to Epstein still haven't been made public, arguing more time is needed to ensure the files are properly redacted to protect the identities of survivors of Epstein's abuse.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi and other top Justice Department officials updated the judges in Epstein and his convicted associate Ghislaine Maxwell's cases on their efforts to scour through the documents in a letter sent Tuesday.",
      "They said they have made \"substantial progress,\" with hundreds of department employees manually reviewing millions of pages of records and, in some cases, conducting electronic name searches to find and redact hundreds of potential victims' identities.",
      "\"The Department currently expects that it will complete these processes with respect to substantially all of the potentially responsive documents, including publication to the Epstein Library website, in the near term,\" said the letter.",
      "The Justice Department said it \"is not able to provide a specific date at this time,\" and warned it may need to make \"additional efforts to ensure the protection of victim identifying information.\"",
      "Earlier this month, the Justice Department told a judge it had released 12,285 documents so far, totaling 125,575 pages, but more than 2 million documents were still \"in various stages of review\" \u2014 meaning it had reviewed less than 1% of its total possible records on Epstein. Some of those still-unreviewed documents may be duplicates, the department cautioned.",
      "The Epstein Files Transparency Act, passed in mid-November, gave the Justice Department 30 days to release files on Epstein and Maxwell. That includes decades-old records from the earliest investigations into Epstein, documents from Epstein and Maxwell's 2019 and 2020 sex trafficking cases and files related to Epstein's death by suicide while in pre-trial custody.",
      "The law allows the government to redact the files under limited circumstances, including to take out victims' names. The judge in Maxwell's case has also required the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan to \"personally certify\" that any grand jury materials that are released have been \"rigorously reviewed\" to take out victims' identities.",
      "Some lawmakers have sharply criticized the Justice Department for the pace of its review, given that Congress required the files to be made public by Dec. 12.",
      "Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who cosponsored the Epstein Files Transparency Act, suggested this month that the judge in Maxwell's case appoint an independent \"special master\" to ensure the files are made public.",
      "\"The Department of Justice is openly defying the law by refusing to release the full Epstein files,\" Khanna said in a statement. \"Millions of files are being kept from the public.\"",
      "Massie argued the Justice Department \"has shown it cannot be trusted with making the disclosures required by law.\"",
      "The Justice Department pushed back, arguing the law does not give Khanna and Massie the right to seek relief in court. The department has defended its handling of the files, saying \"careful, manual review\" is needed to protect victims.",

    "summary": "NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said a series of \"deep, underlying systemic failures\" led to the midair crash between a passenger plane and Army helicopter that killed 67 people.",
    "story": [
      "National Transportation Safety Board members were deeply troubled Tuesday over years of ignored warnings about helicopter traffic dangers and other problems, long before last year's collision between an American Airlines jet and an Army Black Hawk, which killed 67 people.",
      "The board listened to hours of testimony from investigators who outlined their findings in the collision and subsequent crash near Reagan National Airport nearly a year ago. Key factors emerged, including \"overwhelmed\" air traffic controllers, a failure to alert the jet's pilot about the other aircraft and a history of missed opportunities to reroute helicopter traffic.",
      "\"We know people were raising the concerns, people were saying this was dangerous five, 10 years ago, and nobody was really listening,\" NTSB member Todd Inman said of staffing.",
      "In her opening remarks, NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said it was a series of \"deep, underlying systemic failures\" that \"aligned to create the conditions that led to the crash.\"",
      "Homendy also called the \"similarities\" between the D.C. crash and previous such disasters \u2014 including a 1969 midair collision that killed 83 people near Shelbyville, Indiana, and a 2019 midair collision that killed six people in Ketchikan, Alaska \u2014 \"chilling.\"",
      "\"We could have blamed flight crews, individual pilots, maintenance personnel or controllers, but we didn't because we have long, long recognized that human error is a symptom of a system that needs to be redesigned,\" Homedy said of the three crashes.",
      "At one point during the hearing, Inman said he had responded to 91 aviation fatality incidents in 2025.",
      "\"I did 13 family briefings, and I am tired of doing them,\" Inman said to the families of the victims at the hearing. \"And I am sorry for you, because the pages of these reports are written in your family members' blood. So with that again, I am sorry that we have to be here.\"",
      "Family members in the room listened intently during the hearing. Some were escorted out, including two in tears, as an animation of the flights began. Others entered the auditorium wearing black shirts bearing the names of crash victims.",
      "\"The negligence of not fixing things that needed to be fixed killed my brother and 66 other people. So, I'm not very happy,\" Kristen Miller-Zahn, who watched from the front row, said during a break.",
      "The NTSB's job at this point is to determine the biggest factors in the crash and make recommendations. Victims' families say they hope there's meaningful change.",
      "Everyone aboard the jet, flying from Wichita, Kansas, and the helicopter died when the two aircraft collided and plummeted into the icy Potomac River. It was the deadliest plane crash on U.S. soil since 2001, and the victims included 28 members of the figure skating community.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration last week made a permanent change to ensure helicopters and planes no longer share the same airspace around the airport.",
      "Recommendations to move the helicopter routing away from the airport after a near midair collision in 2013 were rejected by the FAA.",
      "\"This was 100% preventable\"",
      "\"We should be angry, because for years no one listened,\" Homendy told reporters prior to the hearing. \"This was preventable, this was 100% preventable.\"",
      "Homendy said she couldn't believe the FAA didn't realize the helicopter route in use during the crash didn't provide adequate separation from planes landing on Reagan's secondary runway. She noted that the FAA had refused to add detailed information about helicopter routes to pilots' charts so they could better understand the risks.",
      "\"We know over time concerns were raised repeatedly, went unheard, squashed \u2014 however you want to put it \u2014 stuck in red tape and bureaucracy of a very large organization,\" Homendy said. \"Repeated recommendations over the years.\"",
      "Following Tuesday night's lengthy hearing and debate, the NTSB voted that the probable cause of the crash was in part due to the FAA's placement of a helicopter route in close proximity to the approach path for the Reagan airport runway that the American Airlines flight was descending into.",
      "It also found that the FAA failed to act on recommendations to mitigate the risk of a midair collision near the airport.",
      "The NTSB adopted 40 recommendations in its final report, most of which were for the FAA. They included recommended changes to the safety culture at the agency.",
      "NTSB investigator Katherine Wilson said an air traffic controller felt a \"little overwhelmed\" when traffic volume increased to 10 aircraft about 10 to 15 minutes before the collision, but then \"felt the volume was manageable when one or two helicopters left the airspace.\"",
      "Yet about 90 seconds before the collision, Wilson said, \"traffic volume increased to a maximum of 12 aircraft consisting of seven airplanes and five helicopters. Radio communication showed that the local controller was shifting focus between airborne, ground and transiting aircraft.\"",
      "The workload \"reduced his situational awareness,\" Wilson said.",
      "Wilson also noted that their investigation found that the Reagan controllers working during the midair crash had not undergone a specific training workshop that may have helped them be more prepared for the situation.",
      "NTSB investigator Brice Banning said the pilots of both aircraft were qualified, had adequate rest and no medical conditions that would have barred them from flying. He also said both aircraft had been properly equipped and maintained.",
      "They also reiterated previous findings that the helicopter pilots were likely flying at a higher altitude than the chopper's altimeter was reading. The collision occurred at about 300 feet, while the maximum altitude for helicopters on that route near the airport is 200 feet.",
      "NTSB investigator Dr. Jana Price said interviews with current and former Reagan tower staff found that morale at the tower \"had been low for years\" prior to the crash. She said that appeared to be due to a 2018 decision by the FAA to downgrade the DCA tower from a level 10 to a level 9 facility, which is a metric based on the volume of air traffic an airport receives.",
      "NTSB investigator Brian Soper explained that downgrading the facility meant it \"cannot attract the experience or get the talent\" that is needed \"to run a very complex air traffic control operation.\"",
      "NTSB investigators also showed a video animation to demonstrate how difficult it would have been for the pilots in both aircraft to spot the other amid the lights of Washington. The animation also showed how the windshields of both aircraft and the helicopter crew's night vision goggles restricted views.",
      "NTSB investigators believe the helicopter pilots never saw the airliner, and they said it appears the airline pilots may not have spotted the chopper until about two seconds before the collision.",
      "The Reagan controller received a conflict alert when the two aircraft were still 1.6 miles apart, the NTSB investigators testified, and said an urgent safety alert that they were on a collision course should have been given at that point.",
      "\"The controller should have issued a safety, would have been the most appropriate thing at that time,\" Soper said.",
      "Doug Lane, whose wife and son \u2014 Christine Lane and Spencer Lane \u2014\u00a0were killed\u00a0in the crash, told CBS News outside the hearing that \"100%, I feel like the FAA failed me and my family.\"",
      "Rachel Feres, who lost her cousin Peter Livingston and his wife and two young daughters, told the Associated Press she was hoping for \"clarity and urgency\" from the NTSB process.",
      "\"I hope that we see a clear path through the recommendations they offer to ensure that this never happens again,\" Feres said. \"That nobody else has to wake up to hear that an entire branch of their family tree is gone, or their wife is gone or the child is gone.\"",
      "Whether that happens depends on how Congress, the Army and the Trump administration respond after the hearing. A pending bill would require all aircraft to have advanced locator systems to help avoid collisions.",
      "Price said NTSB investigators also found the FAA is not using a standardized approach for how it defines near-miss events between aircraft.",
      "\"It's something that we think is necessary, to have more of a standard definition of what constitutes a close proximity event, so that there can be a way of comparing one airport to another, or looking at trends over time, rather than what is kind of a hodgepodge, if you will, right now, of different ways of measuring this,\" Price said.",
      "Even before Tuesday, the NTSB had already spelled out many key factors that contributed to the crash. Investigators said controllers in the Reagan tower had been overly reliant on asking pilots to spot other aircraft and maintain visual separation.",
      "The night of the crash, the controller approved the Black Hawk's request to do that twice. However, the investigation has shown that the helicopter pilots likely never spotted the American Airlines plane as the jet circled to land on the little-used secondary runway.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, the FAA said it has reduced hourly plane arrivals at Reagan airport from 36 to 30 and increased staff. The agency said it has 22 certified controllers in the tower and eight more in training.",
      "\"We will diligently consider any additional recommendations\" from the NTSB, the FAA said.",
      "Several high-profile crashes and close calls followed the D.C. collision, alarming the flying public. But NTSB statistics show that the total number of crashes last year was the lowest since the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020, with 1,405 nationwide.",

      "The nation's population grew by 1.8 million people, or about 0.5%, from July 2024 to July 2025, driven largely by a decline in net immigration. The immigrant population grew by 1.3 million over that timeframe, compared with a 2.7 million increase over the 12 months prior. While net immigration still remains above pre-pandemic levels, the Census Bureau projects that it could drop to 321,000 by July 2026, if current trends continue.",
      "The U.S. immigration population had previously been growing for more than 50 years. Net immigration ballooned during the Biden administration, when border crossings hit record highs, until policies enacted in 2024, such as restrictions on asylum applications, slowed that growth.",

      "\"The big takeaway is, wow, the Trump administration and even the end of the Biden administration made a big difference,\" said Steven Camarota, the director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies. \"It sure looks like we're seeing a fundamental change that reflects policy.\"",
      "Mark Hugo Lopez, director of race and ethnicity research at the Pew Research Center, agreed that the immigration decline was a response to policy shifts, but added that global factors play a role in U.S. immigration as well. Some of the surge in the years following the COVID-19 outbreak reflected \"pent-up demand\" from when countries closed their borders during the pandemic, he said, while policy changes in other countries could make them more attractive to migrants than the U.S.",
      "U.S. population growth has been slowing for decades, in large part because birth rates have declined. The new figures show that trend continuing, but without migrants compensating for the fertility declines as much as they had been in previous years.",
      "Births outpaced deaths by 519,000 between July 2024 and 2025, which is relatively stable compared to the year before, but a significant decline compared to earlier this decade. In 2017, nearly 1.1 million more people were born than died.",
      "Camarota said that while slowed population growth could benefit the environment and ease housing costs, some businesses may struggle as the pool of workers and consumers shrinks. Lopez also noted immigrants' impact on the workforce.",
      "\"Immigration has been important for driving U.S. population growth, but also U.S. labor force growth and the building of particular skillsets in the country,\" Lopez said, highlighting farm work, manufacturing and tech jobs.",
      "Population growth slowed in nearly every state and declined in five, with Vermont experiencing the largest decline at 0.3%. Hawaii, West Virginia, New Mexico and California also saw small population declines.",
      "Meanwhile, South Carolina's population is growing the fastest, according to the Census Bureau. Its population rose 1.5% last year, which the Census Bureau said was fueled by people migrating from other states. Idaho, North Carolina and Texas also saw gains, after ranking in the top 10 fastest-growing states between 2023 and 2024 as well.",

    "summary": "Members of a motorcycle club and a street gang clearly targeted an Indiana judge for assassination to derail a domestic abuse case, police said.",
    "story": [
      "Police accused members of a motorcycle club and a street gang of targeting a judge for assassination earlier this month in Lafayette, Indiana, alleging the shooting that left the judge and his wife wounded was part of a scheme to derail a domestic abuse case against one of the attackers.",
      "Police and prosecutors gave updates about the case at a news conference on Tuesday, several days after\u00a0five people were arrested in connection with the shooting. Authorities praised what they characterized as a relentless effort to track down who opened fire on Tippecanoe County Superior Court Judge Steven Meyer and his wife, Kim, at their home in Lafayette on Jan. 18. Both Meyer and his wife suffered gunshot wounds but survived.",
      "The Lafayette Police Department, the FBI, the Indiana State Police and the Purdue University Police Department launched a search for the shooter that went on for days before apprehending five people in synchronized arrests Thursday evening, including four in Indiana and one in Lexington, Kentucky.",
      "They were identified by police as Raylen Ferguson, 38, Zenada Greer, 61, Thomas Moss, 43, Blake Smith, 32, and Amanda Milsap, 45. Ferguson and Greer are from Kentucky while Moss, Smith and Milsap are from Indiana, according to police.",
      "Court appearances for the suspects were set for Wednesday in Indiana and Kentucky.",
      "\"This attack was more than an assault on two citizens,\" LaFayette Police Chief Scott Galloway said. \"This was an assault on the rule of law itself.\"",
      "Prosecutors allege that the attack was designed to derail a domestic abuse case against Moss, a member of the Detroit-based Phantom MC motorcycle club with ties to the Vice Lords street gang.",
      "Moss was charged with multiple violent felonies in June 2024 and was out on bond, according to court records, which also show that he was scheduled to go on trial in front of Meyer on Jan. 20 \u2014 two days after the shooting took place. His charges from 2024 include unlawful possession of a firearm by a serious felon, meaning he was already classified as such before those charges were brought against him. There were also multiple charges for domestic battery.",
      "According to a probable cause affidavit, the Vice Lords offered the victim in the case $10,000 not to testify against Moss but she refused.",
      "With the start of Moss' trial approaching, Smith, who authorities have identified as another Phantom MC member, purchased a shotgun. A masked man traveled to the Meyers' home armed with that shotgun on Jan. 18. He lured the couple to the door by saying he was looking for his dog, shot them through the door and fled.",
      "\"(Meyer) was targeted,\" Indiana State Police Lt. Col. Al Williamson said at Tuesday's news conference. \"They went after him for a reason.\"",
      "Police recovered the mask, the shooter's clothing and the shotgun discarded near the Meyers' home. DNA on the mask matched Ferguson, an associate of the Almighty Vice Lord Nation from Lexington, Kentucky, according to the affidavit.",
      "Surveillance video showed a car that was parked near the Meyers' home had traveled from Kentucky toward Lafayette on Jan. 16 and traveled toward Smith's residence in the hour after the shootings, according to the affidavit.",
      "Moss, Ferguson and Smith each face multiple charges, including attempted murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Milsap, whom prosecutors allege offered the bribe in the domestic abuse case, faces bribery and obstruction counts. Greer, a woman Ferguson lives with, has been charged with helping a criminal and obstruction. Prosecutors have accused her of traveling to Lafayette with Ferguson.",
      "Milsap's attorney, Earl McCoy, didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Online court records did not list attorneys for Moss, Ferguson or Blake. Jail records indicate Greer is being held in Lexington. Online court records in that state did not list an attorney for her.",

      "The \"Doomsday Clock,\" a metaphor for how close humanity is to self-annihilation, was moved to 85 seconds to midnight on Tuesday, its closest point to catastrophe since the clock made its debut nearly 80 years ago.",
      "\"Humanity has not made sufficient progress on the existential risks that endanger us all,\" said Alexandra Bell, president and CEO of the\u00a0Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.",
      "The risks humanity faces from nuclear weapons, climate change and disruptive technologies are growing, Bell said. \"Every second counts, and we are running out of time,\" she said.",
      "Last year, the Bulletin set the clock at 89 seconds to midnight, which was its previous closest setting to midnight.",
      "Daniel Holz, the chair of the Bulletin's science and security board that sets the \"Doomsday Clock\" and a physics professor at the University of Chicago, said major countries became more aggressive, adversarial and nationalistic in the past year.",
      "Holz also noted that a 2010 strategic arms treaty between the U.S. and Russia is set to expire next week.",
      "\"For the first time in over half a century, there will be nothing preventing a runaway nuclear arms race,\" Holz said.",
      "On climate change, Holz said atmospheric carbon dioxide and global sea levels have reached record highs.",
      "\"Droughts, fires, floods and storms continue to intensify and become more erratic, and this will only get worse,\" Holz said.",
      "Holz also warned of a potential arms race surrounding artificial intelligence, which he said could result in dire consequences.",
      "\"AI is a significant and accelerating disruptive technology. AI is also supercharging mis- and disinformation, which makes it even more difficult to address all of the other threats we consider,\" Holz said.",
      "He also expressed concern about what he referred to as \"the increasing rise of nationalistic autocracies.\"",
      "\"If the world splinters into an us-versus-them, zero-sum approach, it increases the likelihood that we all lose,\" Holz said.",
      "Holz also noted the two fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti this month by federal agents in Minnesota and what he called an \"erosion of the constitutional rights of American citizens.\"",
      "\"History has shown that when governments become unaccountable to their own citizens, conflict and misery follow,\" Holz said.",
      "Bell said the issues that influence the clock's setting are solvable, but people need to work together to find the solution.",
      "\"Every time we've been able to turn back the hands of the clock, it's been because we had scientists and experts working to find solutions and a public that was demanding action,\" Bell said.",
      "The Bulletin first unveiled the clock in 1947 in the wake of the U.S. using atomic bombs against Japan in World War II. The group says its aims are to \"help advance actionable ideas to reduce existential threats.\"",
      "The clock's minute hand has been moved more than two dozen times in its nearly eight-decade history.",
      "The farthest the clock has been from midnight was 17 minutes in 1991, following the end of the Cold War and the signing of a strategic arms treaty between the Soviet Union and the U.S. to reduce their nuclear arsenals.",
      "In recent years, the clock has been ticking closer to midnight. The 2020s started with the clock moving to 100 seconds to midnight, with the group saying cyber-enabled information warfare was compounding the threat posed by nuclear war and climate change by undercutting society's ability to respond to either.",
      "The clock stayed in that position for the next two years until 2023, when it was moved to 90 seconds to midnight, largely because of what the group said were the increasing dangers posed by Russia's war in Ukraine. It stayed at that setting in 2024.",
      "Last year, the clock was moved one second closer to midnight, with the group saying, \"Despite unmistakable signs of danger, national leaders and their societies have failed to do what is needed to change course.\"",

      "\"A massive Armada is heading to Iran. It is moving quickly, with great power, enthusiasm, and purpose. It is a larger fleet, headed by the great Aircraft Carrier Abraham Lincoln, than that sent to Venezuela. Like with Venezuela, it is, ready, willing, and able to rapidly fulfill its mission, with speed and violence, if necessary,\" Mr. Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform. \"Hopefully Iran will quickly 'Come to the Table' and negotiate a fair and equitable deal \u2014 NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS \u2014 one that is good for all parties. Time is running out, it is truly of the essence!\"",
      "Mr. Trump said that if Iran did not come to an agreement with the United States, the U.S. could carry out an attack worse than its previous one in June, when it hit multiple nuclear sites with bunker busting bombs.",
      "\"As I told Iran once before, MAKE A DEAL! They didn't, and there was 'Operation Midnight Hammer,' a major destruction of Iran. The next attack will be far worse! Don't make that happen again. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\" Mr. Trump said Wednesday.",
      "As of Tuesday, a U.S. official confirmed to CBS News that the USS Abraham Lincoln Aircraft Carrier Strike Group, which includes the carrier and three destroyers, had crossed into the U.S. military's Central Command area of responsibility, which includes the Middle East and the waters around Iran, though it had not necessarily reached its intended final deployment location.",
      "While Mr. Trump has issued threats to Iran for weeks, and as the Lincoln strike group nears the region, his rhetoric had largely been about Iran's brutal quashing of massive street protests. The Truth Social post on Wednesday was the first time he had linked the major U.S. Navy deployment in the Persian Gulf region to the stalled nuclear negotiations.",
      "Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York said in a social media post on Wednesday, after Mr. Trump's post, that the country \"stands ready for dialogue based on mutual respect and interests\u2014BUT IF PUSHED, IT WILL DEFEND ITSELF AND RESPOND LIKE NEVER BEFORE!\"",
      "\"Last time the U.S. blundered into wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, it squandered over $7 trillion and lost more than 7,000 American lives,\" the Iranian mission said.",

      "\"We have a lot of ships going that direction just in case,\" he told reporters on Thursday. He called it a \"good sign\" that Iranian authorities had decided not to hang protesters, adding: \"We have an armada heading that direction and maybe we won't have to use it.\"",
      "Iran's army commander reiterated recent statements on Wednesday from the country's leaders, saying Iran was ready for any attack by its enemies.",
      "\"The Islamic Republic of Iran Army is always ready to confront any threat, and if anything happens, the enemy will certainly suffer severe damage,\" Rear Admiral Habibollah Sayyari, Chief of Staff and Deputy Coordinator of the Islamic Republic of Iran Army, said Wednesday, according to Iranian state media. \"We stand against any threat on land, in the air, and at sea, and the army is always ready to confront any threat.\"",

      "\"Last night, I spoke with the Foreign Minister of Qatar,\" Araghichi was quoted as saying by Iranian media. \"The prevailing view across the region is that any military threat, given the nature of the U.S. presence here, would lead to instability throughout the entire region.\"",
      "Araghchi was quoted as telling reporters on the sidelines of a weekly cabinet meeting in Tehran that he had had no contact with U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff in recent days, and that Iran had not sought new negotiations with Washington, though he added that the two sides remained in touch through intermediaries.",
      "\"Our position is precisely that pursuing diplomacy through military threats cannot be effective,\" he said. \"If they want negotiations to take place, they must set aside threats, excessive demands, and the raising of illogical issues. Negotiations have their own principles and must be conducted on an equal footing and based on mutual respect.\"",
      "Iran had been bound by an international nuclear agreement from 2015, which required it to submit to outside monitoring of its enrichment activities and a cap on the level to which it could enrich uranium, until 2018, when Mr. Trump pulled the U.S. out of the agreement during his first term.",
      "He had long been critical of the agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which was negotiated by President Obama's administration and signed by Iran, the U.S., China, France, Russia, the U.K., Germany and the European Union, as too lax on Tehran.",
      "Despite European efforts to keep the deal viable, the unilateral U.S. withdrawal prompted Iran to incrementally abandon adherence to the terms of the agreement, and its nuclear program has ramped up over the last half of a decade.",

      "It is the second time that Alinejad will face a man charged with plotting to assassinate her in the past year. Two men, who prosecutors said were members of a Russian mob hired by Iran, received 25 year prison terms in October for attempting to kill Alinejad at her Brooklyn home.",
      "\"The IRGC, the Revolutionary Guards, is behind the assassination plots. The same IRGC that is ordering a massacre right now in Iran,\" she said. \"I've been bombarded by Iranians receiving videos showing the IRGC using AK-47 military weapons to kill people. The same IRGC gave money to the assassins here to buy AK-47s to end my life.\"",
      "Prosecutors said Farhad Shakeri, an Iranian operative, was \"tasked by the regime to direct a network of criminal associates to further Iran's assassination plots against its targets.\"",
      "Prosecutors alleged that in the latest attempt, Shakeri directed two criminal associates in New York, Carlisle Rivera and Jonathan Loadholt, to murder Alinejad.",
      "That attempt was set to take place in February 2024 at Fairfield University in Connecticut, where Alinejad had a speaking event.",
      "After months of surveillance, their plot was foiled. Rivera and Loadholt were arrested in November 2024 and pleaded guilty before the case could go to trial.",
      "Rivera, who will be sentenced Wednesday, faces a maximum of ten years in prison for conspiring to commit murder-for-hire. Loadholt's sentencing is scheduled for April 23. Shakeri is believed to be in Iran.",
      "Federal authorities said Shakeri told them he also had been assigned by the IRGC to arrange to kill President Trump before the 2024 election.",
      "When she learned the same man had plotted to kill her and Mr. Trump, Alinejad \"laughed loud\" and told her husband: \"Wow, they think I am as powerful as President Trump. I am just a 48 kilo (105 pound) woman. I have no army, no weapons, no soldiers, nothing. Just my voice. My weapon is my voice.\"",
      "At the same time, Alinejad said she felt scared, recalling how for years the Iranian regime said America is the \"great Satan\" and \"biggest enemy of Iran.\"",
      "\"The same group who targeted President Trump, they wanted to target me,\" she said. \"It means that now in their eyes, I am the great Satan. I am their biggest enemy.\"",

    "summary": "The trial comes months after the landmark drugging-and-rape case that turned Gis\u00e8le Pelicot into a global icon of the fight against sexual violence.",
    "story": [
      "A former French senator was convicted and sentenced Tuesday to 1 1/2 years in prison for drugging a fellow lawmaker in order to abuse her, an experience she described as terrifying and leaving long-lasting trauma effects.",
      "Jo\u00ebl Guerriau, 68, has admitted serving Sandrine Josso a drink spiked with MDMA, known as ecstasy, but says it was an accident.",
      "A Paris court found him guilty of having drugged Josso to sexually assault or rape her and of possession of drug. He was given an additional 2 1/2 year suspended sentence, obligation of treatment and a ban on holding elected office.",
      "Shortly after the verdict on Tuesday, Josso said the sentence was a \"huge relief,\" BBC News reported.",
      "Guerriau's lawyer said his client would appeal the ruling.",
      "The trial brought national attention to drug-facilitated assault in the country already marked by the landmark drugging-and-rape case that turned Gis\u00e8le Pelicot into a global icon of the fight against sexual violence.",
      "Josso, a 50-year-old lawmaker at the National Assembly, said that the then-senator invited her to his Paris apartment to celebrate his reelection in November 2023. The two had known each other for years and were on friendly terms.",
      "\"I really felt myself slipping away,\" Josso testified Monday, saying she experienced heart palpitations shortly after taking a few sips of champagne. She said she felt uneasy being alone with Guerriau, who appeared unusually agitated and repeatedly turned lights on and off.",
      "Josso said Guerriau later took her glass into the kitchen to refill it. That's when she noticed him holding \"a little bag,\" which made her realize she had likely been drugged.",
      "\"My legs were shaking, I was extremely thirsty,\" she recalled, her voice breaking.",
      "Josso said she tried to hide her symptoms, afraid to alert Guerriau. She eventually managed to leave and take a taxi.",
      "\"I think about my children, I call my colleague, I tell him that I'm going to die,\" she told the court, crying.",
      "Blood tests later showed she had ingested a quantity of MDMA far higher than levels typically associated with recreational use.",
      "\"I want the truth to come out. It's important to me,\" she said.",
      "Josso described lasting trauma, including sleep disorders, difficulty eating, panic attacks on trains and stairways and intense stress that caused her to grind her teeth so severely that several had to be removed.",
      "\"I am disgusted with myself\"",
      "For hours on Monday, Guerriau answered the court's questions often sounding vague and confused, saying he was suffering from depression at the time and still lacked a clear memory of events.",
      "Guerriau resigned as senator in October, presenting the move as a political decision with no link to the legal proceedings.",
      "He acknowledged what he called his \"stupidity\" and \"ignorance\" about drugs. Guerriau said another senator had given him MDMA powder months earlier, which he said he never used.",
      "Guerriau told the court he had meant to take the drug himself the night before, BBC News reported. He did not end up doing so and accidentally offered the glass containing MDMA to Josso the following evening, he claimed.",
      "\"I feel sorry for Sandrine,\" Guerriau told the court in Paris. \"I am disgusted with myself, with my recklessness and my stupidity.\"",
      "Investigators said Guerriau had searched online about drug use, including ecstasy, in connection with rape about a month before the incident. Guerriau said the research was part of his work as a senator and meant to better understand the issue.",

    "story": [
      "After mass protests in Iran erupted in December and continued to escalate into the new year, the government shut down internet access throughout the country. But after weeks of trying, one man in Iran was able to get through the blackout and speak with CBS News on a video call, describing what sounds like a massacre of anti-government protesters in early January.",
      "Jan. 8 and 9 are believed to be the bloodiest, most brutal days in the government's crackdown on protesters since it was founded in 1979.",
      "The man asked not to be identified and had his head wrapped in a black cloth and his eyes covered by goggles because he is afraid the government could find him and put him in prison or execute him. He described a crackdown on Jan. 9 in the city of Yazd, about 400 miles southeast of the capital Tehran.",
      "He was in a crowd of about 1,500 people marching toward Imam Hossein Square when, he said, government forces started shooting at them from the front and the back in what he thinks was a plan to mow them down from both sides.",
      "Two sources, including one inside Iran, previously told CBS News that at least 12,000, and possibly as many as 20,000 people have been killed throughout Iran in the protests.",
      "\"More than a thousand that night killed\u2026because I hear a lot of shooting,\" he said.",
      "He said the only reason he survived was that he was in the middle of the crowd and was able to escape down a side street.",
      "Now the streets across the country are quiet. The man told CBS News that people are sad and angry and that he lost a lot of his \"brothers and sisters\" \u2014 friends, comrades in arms \u2014 in the protests to oust the regime.",
      "Asked what he hoped the protests would achieve, the man said, \"All people that night come out and say, 'Pahlavi,'\" referencing Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran's last shah, now living in the Washington, D.C., area.",
      "\"Just want Pahlavi, OK?\" he said.",
      "In an interview with CBS News' Norah O'Donnell earlier this month, Pahlavi characterized himself as Iranians' voice in the outside world, and has claimed that people chanting his name during the protests show he could play a role as a transitional leader, although it's unclear how much support he actually has inside the country.",
      "\"Why is it that I offer my service to Iran? I'm answering their call,\" he said. \"I'm a bridge and not the destination at this point.\"",
      "Pahlavi's father became shah in 1941 and consolidated power in a 1953 coup, backed by the United States and United Kingdom, that overthrew the Iranian prime minister. He ruled until 1979, when he was deposed by the Islamic Revolution.",
      "Some now hope the U.S. will intervene again.",
      "\"On behalf of all Iranians, I ask President Trump to help us achieve freedom, because our freedom is the freedom of the whole world from terrorists,\" the man said.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly warned Iranian leaders against killing peaceful demonstrators and the mass execution of people detained during the unrest. He has also threatened possible military action.",
      "The USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group recently arrived in the U.S. military's Central Command area of operation, which covers much of the Middle East region, including Iran. The warships' arrival came after the commander of the Islamic Republic's Revolutionary Guard Corps warned that his forces had their \"finger on the trigger,\" following Mr. Trump's threats.",
      "The video call with the Iranian man, which suffered from numerous issues due to the blackout, dropped soon after his plea for U.S. support, but in follow-up texts, he told CBS News he wants the U.S. to provide air support \"to send the entire leadership of this regime to their own ideological paradise in a lightning strike.\"",

      "Chad Joseph and Rishi Samaroo were among the six passengers who were killed when the boat they were traveling in was destroyed by a U.S. missile on Oct. 14, 2025, according to a 23-page complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts on Tuesday. Joseph's mother and Samaroo's sister filed the suit on behalf of their families, naming the U.S. as a defendant.",
      "The October strike was part of the Trump administration's campaign against alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, mostly targeting boats coming from Venezuela. The administration has carried out at least 35 strikes since September, most recently last week. The attacks have killed more than 100 people.",
      "President Trump posted footage of the Oct. 14 strike on Truth Social at the time, writing that intelligence showed the boat \"was trafficking narcotics, was associated with illicit narcoterrorist networks, and was transiting along a known [designated terrorist organization] route.\" He said \"six male narcoterrorists\" were killed.",
      "The lawsuit said Joseph and Samaroo lived in Trinidad and Tobago and had traveled to Venezuela to fish and work on farms. They were returning to their homes in Trinidad and Tobago on the boat that was struck, according to the complaint.",
      "Joseph was 26 years old and had a wife and three children in Trinidad and Tobago, the lawsuit said. The complaint said he called his wife two days before his death and said he had found transport back home. His family never heard from him again, the complaint said.",
      "Samaroo was 41 years old and had been imprisoned from 2009 to 2024 \"for his participation in a homicide,\" the suit said. In August 2025, he called his sister and told her he was in Venezuela working on a farm. Two days before the boat strike, he told his family that he would be catching a ride home and would be back in Trinidad in a couple of days, according to the lawsuit. That was the last time they heard from him.",
      "The lawsuit says that \"Mr. Joseph and Mr. Samaroo were not members of, or affiliated with, drug cartels.\" The administration has justified the campaign by stating that the strikes are targeting drug-running cartel boats.",
      "\"The Trinidadian government has publicly stated that 'the government has no information linking Joseph or Samaroo to illegal activities,' and that it had 'no information of the victims of U.S. strikes being in possession of illegal drugs, guns, or small arms,'\" according to the complaint.",
      "The lawsuit is seeking compensation for the two men's families under two federal laws known as the Death on the High Seas Act and the Alien Tort Statute. The families are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights.",
      "The lawsuit is at least the second legal action taken by the family of those killed in the Trump administration's boat strikes. In December, the relatives of 42-year-old Alejandro Carranza Medina filed a complaint against the U.S. with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, saying Medina was not involved in drug trafficking and had been fishing when his boat was destroyed.",

      "\"This is a militia that kills,\" Sala said in an interview with Italian media. \"It's a militia that enters people's homes by signing permits for themselves. \u2026 It's clear that they're not welcome in Milan, there's no doubt about that.\"",
      "\"The State Department's Diplomatic Security Service is leading the U.S. security effort at the Milano-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics,\" the U.S. State Department said in a statement shared on Tuesday with CBS News, and also shared by the Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service. \"As in previous Olympic events, multiple federal agencies are supporting the Diplomatic Security Service, including Homeland Security Investigations [HSI], ICE's investigative component.\"",
      "The U.S. agencies stressed that HSI has supported the Diplomatic Security Service at previous Olympic Games.",
      "\"At the Olympics, the role of Homeland Security Investigations is strictly supportive \u2014 working with the Diplomatic Security Service and Italian authorities to vet and mitigate risks from transnational criminal organizations,\" the statement said. \"ICE is not involved in policing or managing security during the Olympics.

      "Despite his disapproval, Sala wondered aloud during the interview with Italy's RTL Radio 102: \"Could we ever say no to Trump?\"",

    "story": [
      "As the world marked International Holocaust Remembrance Day on Tuesday, experts warned that a flood of \"AI slop\" is threatening efforts to preserve the memory of Nazi crimes and the millions of Jewish people killed during World War II.",
      "Images seen by the AFP news agency include an emaciated and apparently blind man standing in the snow at the Nazi concentration camp Flossenbuerg, and a viral image of a little girl with curly hair on a tricycle falsely presented as a 13-year-old Berliner who died at the Auschwitz extermination camp.",
      "Such content \u2014 whether produced as clickbait for commercial gain or for political motives \u2014 has proliferated over the past year, distorting the history of Nazi Germany's murder of six million European Jews during World War II.",
      "Early examples emerged in the spring of 2025, but by the end of the year, \"AI slop\" on the subject \"was being shown very frequently,\" historian Iris Groschek told AFP.",
      "On some sites, examples of such content were being posted once per minute, said Groschek, who works at Holocaust memorial sites in Hamburg, including the Neuengamme concentration camp.",
      "With the exponential advances in AI, \"the phenomenon is growing,\" Jens-Christian Wagner, director of the foundation that manages the Buchenwald and Mittelbau-Dora memorials, told AFP.",
      "Several Holocaust memorials and commemorative associations this month issued an open letter warning about the rising quantity of this \"entirely fabricated\" content.",
      "Some of them are churned out by content farms that exploit \"the emotional impact of the Holocaust to achieve maximum reach with minimal effort,\" it said.",
      "The picture supposedly from Flossenbuerg camp falls into this category, as it was shown on a page claiming to share, \"true, human stories from the darkest chapters of the past.\"",
      "But the memorials warned that fake content was also being created, \"specifically to dilute historical facts, shift victim and perpetrator roles, or spread revisionist narratives.\"",
      "Wagner points, for example, to images of seemingly \"well-fed prisoners, meant to suggest that conditions in concentration camps weren't really that bad.\"",
      "The Frankfurt-based Anne Frank Educational Center has warned of a \"flood\" of AI-generated content and propaganda \"in which the Holocaust is denied or trivialized, with its victims ridiculed.\"",
      "By distorting history, AI-generated images have \"very concrete consequences for how people perceive the Nazi era,\" said Groschek.",
      "The results of trivializing or denying the Holocaust have been seen in the attitudes of some younger visitors to the camps, particularly from \"rural parts of eastern Germany ... in which far-right thinking has become dominant,\" said Wagner.",
      "In their open letter, the memorials called on social media platforms to \"proactively combat AI content that distorts history\" and to \"exclude accounts that disseminate such content from all monetisation programs.\"",
      "\"The challenge for society as a whole is to develop ethical and historically responsible standards for this technology,\" they said, adding: \"Platform operators have a particular responsibility in this regard.\"",
      "German Culture Minister Wolfram Weimer said in a statement to AFP: \"I support the memorials' call to clearly label AI-generated images and remove them when necessary.\"",
      "He said that making money from such imagery should be prevented.",
      "\"This is a matter of respect for the millions of people who were killed and persecuted under the Nazis' reign of terror,\" he said, reminding the platforms that they have obligations under the EU's Digital Services Act.",
      "Groschek said none of the American social media companies had responded to the memorials' letter, including Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram.",
      "TikTok responded by saying it wanted to exclude the accounts in question from monetization and implement, \"automated verification,\" according to Groschek.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-hamas-ceasefire-phase-2-rafah-crossing-un-palestinians/",
    "published": "Tue, 27 Jan 2026 10:02:34 -0500",
    "summary": "With all Israeli hostages now recovered from Gaza, there's a push for the Israel-Hamas peace plan to move to phase-two, but that brings its own challenges.",
    "story": [
      "After Israel brought home the remains of its last hostage from Gaza on Monday, attention turned to the next and more challenging phase of its U.S.-brokered peace plan with Hamas, which should include the reopening of Gaza's border crossing with Egypt and the deployment of an international security force to secure the Palestinian enclave.",
      "The remains of Israeli police officer Ran Gvili, who was killed during the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023, were found in a cemetery in northern Gaza, Israeli officials confirmed Monday.",
      "\"You should see the honor you're receiving here,\" Gvili's father, Itzik, said Tuesday, kissing his son's coffin, which was draped in an Israeli flag. \"The entire police is here with you, the entire army is with you, the entire people. I'm proud of you.\"",
      "What comes next?",
      "Netanyahu's office said in a statement Sunday that a \"limited reopening\" of the Rafah crossing was \"conditioned upon the return of all living hostages and a 100% effort by Hamas to locate and return all deceased hostages.\"",
      "The return of all remaining hostages, living and dead, had been a key term of the U.S.-brokered Gaza peace plan's first phase. With the Israeli military confirming that \"all of the abductees have been returned\" on Monday, Hamas said it had met those terms.",
      "Following the recovery of Gvili's body, Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem issued a statement confirming the group's \"commitment to all the terms of the agreement to halt the war on the Gaza Strip, including the exchange track and its full completion in accordance with the agreement.\"",
      "He said Hamas would \"continue to adhere to all aspects of the agreement, including facilitating the work of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza and ensuring its success.\"",
      "Qassem called on all mediators of the ceasefire, and the U.S. in particular, to compel Israel \"to stop its violations of the agreement and to implement the obligations required of it.\"",
      "The most immediately anticipated next step would be the opening of the Rafah crossing between southern Gaza and Egypt.",
      "An official with the United Nation's children's agency said Monday that there was a backlog of supplies in Egypt ready to move into Gaza whenever the crossing opens to aid traffic.",
      "\"We have supplies positioned,\" said Ted Chaiban, UNICEF's deputy executive director. \"We have our great staff doing good work on the ground. We have plans that can be activated immediately if access is granted.\"",
      "The next phase needs to include bringing not only more humanitarian and commercial supplies but also permanent shelter materials and items to repair infrastructure, he added.",
      "On Monday, the spokesperson for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said \"the full implementation of the ceasefire arrangements in Gaza is absolutely critical.\"",
      "\"The Secretary-General urges all parties to move forward in good faith, and without delay with subsequent phases, facilitate sustained and unhindered humanitarian access, including through the Rafah Crossing.\"",
      "Palestinians see the crossing, which has been largely shut since May 2024, as a lifeline to the outside world. Some are optimistic that opening the Rafah crossing will allow travel to and from the enclave, along with the evacuation of people needing medical care.",
      "\"We hope this will close off Israel's pretexts and open the crossing,\" Abdel-Rahman Radwan, a Gaza City resident whose mother has cancer and requires treatment outside Gaza, told the AP.",
      "Ahmed Ruqab, a father who lives with his family of six in a tent in the Nuseirat refugee camp, called for mediators and the U.S. to pressure Israel to allow more aid.",
      "\"We need to turn this page and restart,\" he said over the phone.",
      "As well as the border opening, the ceasefire's second phase also calls for the deployment an international security force, for Hamas to disarm, for Israeli soldiers to pull further back and for efforts to rebuild Gaza.",
      "Speaking to the Israeli parliament on Monday, however, Netanyahu said: \"The next phase is disarming Hamas and demilitarizing the Gaza Strip. The next phase is not reconstruction.\"",
      "Hamas under pressure to disarm",
      "Speaking Monday, U.S. officials, who insisted on anonymity per the rules of a call set up by the White House, said they expect Israel to help both sides move forward into the second phase of the peace plan, and they want Hamas \u2014 a U.S.- and Israeli designated terrorist group that has ruled over Gaza for two decades \u2014to disarm in accordance with the agreement, and they believe that it will.",
      "\"We are listening to many of their people talk about disarming. We think they're going to,\" said one of the U.S. officials on the call, according to the\u00a0Reuters news agency. \"If they don't disarm, then they've breached the deal. We think disarmament comes along with some sort of amnesty and, candidly, we think we have a very, very good program to disarm.\"",
      "Hamas \"signed an agreement \u2014 they don't have a choice, and so that's what we are going to work on to make happen,\" a second official said, according to Politico, adding: \"If they decide to play games, then obviously President Trump will take other actions.\"",
      "President Trump's 20-point Gaza plan stipulates that once all hostages are returned, Hamas members who \"commit to peaceful co-existence and decommission their weapons will be given amnesty,\" and those \"who wish to leave Gaza will be provided safe passage to receiving countries.\"",
      "The Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel that sparked the war killed about 1,200 people and saw 251 taken hostage. Gaza's Hamas-run Ministry of Health says more than 71,000 Palestinians were killed in the territory during the war.",
      "Palestinians in Gaza who spoke with the AP in recent weeks questioned whether the ceasefire's next steps will improve conditions, pointing to ongoing bloodshed and ongoing challenges in securing basic necessities.",
      "The Foreign Press Association of Israel on Monday asked the country's Supreme Court to allow journalists to enter Gaza freely and independently.",
      "The FPA represents dozens of global news organizations and has been pushing for independent media access to Gaza throughout the war. Israel has barred reporters from entering Gaza independently since the 2023 attack by Hamas, arguing that entry could put journalists and soldiers at risk.",
      "FPA lawyers told the court that the restrictions are not justified and that with aid workers moving in and out of Gaza, journalists should be allowed in. They said tightly controlled visits under strict military supervision are no substitute for independent access. The judges are expected to rule soon.",

      "Parts of Australia sweltered in record temperatures of close to 122 degrees Fahrenheit Tuesday as the country sweated through a prolonged heat wave even as bitter cold covered much of the U.S.",
      "The rural towns of Hopetoun and Walpeup in Victoria state registered preliminary highs of 120 degrees that if confirmed overnight would top records set on the day in 2009 when 173 people were killed in the state's devastating Black Saturday bushfires.",
      "No casualties were reported from Tuesday's heat wave, but Victoria authorities urged caution as three forest fires burned out of control.",
      "Melbourne, the state's largest city, also came close to its hottest day. Nowhere perhaps was the searing heat more evident than at Melbourne Park, where the usual crowds thronging outside the Australian Open tennis tournament dwindled to a ghost town as temperatures soared.",
      "Inside, organizers enacted extreme heat protocols, forcing closure of the retractable roofs over the main arenas and postponement of matches on the uncovered outer courts. During Tuesday's quarterfinal between Aryna Sabalenka and Iva Jovic - the last match played under scorching sun - the players held ice packs to their heads and portable fans to their faces during breaks in play.",
      "Photographers shooting the match were supplied with cushions by organizers to avoid heat-related injuries when they sat down and covered their cameras with towels to prevent the devices malfunctioning in the heat or burning their hands. Fans lined up to stand in front of giant misting fans or sought shelter in air-conditioned areas of the venue.",
      "Crowds at the event, which has registered record-breaking turnout days so far, dropped from 50,000 from Monday's daytime session to 21,000 on Tuesday as people heeded health warnings from officials and stayed home.",
      "Temperatures were expected to drop Wednesday, although the heat wave was due to linger until the weekend. The heat wave followed another earlier this month amid one of Australia's hottest summers ever.",
      "On Monday, parts of New South Wales and South Australia states hit record temperatures, some exceeding records set during a destructive summer of forest fires in 2019. At that time as now, temperatures approached 122 degrees in some places.",

      "A senior lawyer in Australia has apologized to a judge for filing submissions in a murder case that included fake quotes and nonexistent case judgments generated by artificial intelligence.",
      "The blunder in the Supreme Court of Victoria state is another in a litany of mishaps AI has caused in justice systems around the world.",
      "Defense lawyer Rishi Nathwani, who holds the prestigious legal title of King's Counsel, took \"full responsibility\" for filing incorrect information in submissions in the case of a teenager charged with murder, according to court documents seen by The Associated Press on Friday.",
      "\"We are deeply sorry and embarrassed for what occurred,\" Nathwani told Justice James Elliott on Wednesday, on behalf of the defense team.",
      "The errors caused a 24-hour delay in resolving a case that Elliott had hoped to conclude on Wednesday. Elliott ruled on Thursday that Nathwani's client, who cannot be identified because he is a minor, was not guilty of murder because of mental impairment.",
      "\"At the risk of understatement, the manner in which these events have unfolded is unsatisfactory,\" Elliott told lawyers on Thursday.",
      "\"The ability of the court to rely upon the accuracy of submissions made by counsel is fundamental to the due administration of justice,\" Elliott added.",
      "The fake submissions included fabricated quotes from a speech to the state legislature and nonexistent case citations purportedly from the Supreme Court.",
      "The AI-generated errors were discovered by the Elliot's associates, who couldn't find the cases cited and requested that defense lawyers provide copies, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation previously\u00a0reported.",
      "The lawyers admitted the citations \"do not exist\" and that the submission contained \"fictitious quotes,\" court documents say.",
      "The lawyers explained they checked that the initial citations were accurate and wrongly assumed the others would also be correct.",
      "The submissions were also sent to prosecutor Daniel Porceddu, who didn't check their accuracy.",
      "The judge noted that the Supreme Court released guidelines last year for how lawyers use AI.",
      "\"It is not acceptable for artificial intelligence to be used unless the product of that use is independently and thoroughly verified,\" Elliott said.",
      "The court documents do not identify the generative artificial intelligence system used by the lawyers.",
      "In a comparable case in the United States in 2023, a federal judge imposed $5,000 fines on two lawyers and a law firm after\u00a0ChatGPT was blamed for their submission of fictitious legal research in an aviation injury claim.",
      "Judge P. Kevin Castel said they acted in bad faith. But he credited their apologies and remedial steps taken in explaining why harsher sanctions were not necessary to ensure they or others won't again let artificial intelligence tools prompt them to produce fake legal history in their arguments.",
      "Later that year, more fictitious court rulings invented by AI were cited in legal papers\u00a0filed by lawyers for Michael Cohen, a former personal lawyer for U.S. President Donald Trump. Cohen took the blame, saying he didn't realize that the Google tool he was using for legal research was also capable of so-called AI hallucinations.",

      "Canada's last captive whales have received a reprieve from death after the government conditionally approved a plan Monday to export them to the United States.",
      "Fisheries Minister Joanne Thompson met Monday with officials from Marineland, the shuttered theme park and zoo in Niagara Falls, Ontario, to talk about its proposed plan to move the animals south. The park is in discussions with four U.S. institutions to take its 30 beluga whales and four dolphins.",
      "\"It was a constructive meeting, and I provided conditional approval for export permits,\" Thompson said in a statement posted on social media Monday. \"I will issue the final permits once final required information is received from Marineland.\"",
      "Marineland pleaded with the minister, telling her repeatedly the park was running out of money. The park had told Thompson the animals would be euthanized if the export permits were not authorized by Jan. 30, according to a letter she wrote to Marineland on Monday, which was obtained by The Canadian Press news agency.",
      "Marineland said in a statement that it has Thompson's support for the relocation of the animals. \"We extend our gratitude to the minister and the Canadian government for prioritizing the lives of these remarkable marine mammals,\" it said.",
      "The move comes after Marineland presented what it called an urgent rescue solution to the federal government last week.",

      "In October, Marineland applied for export permits to move its complement of belugas to Chimelong Ocean Kingdom, an aquarium in China. Thompson denied those permits, saying she would not subject the whales to a future performing in captivity.",

    "published": "Mon, 26 Jan 2026 15:06:00 -0500",
    "summary": "As the European Union announces an investigation, the Grok chatbot tells CBS News, \"Yes, tools like me should face meaningful regulation.\"",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0A CBS News investigation has found that the Grok AI tool on Elon Musk's X platform is still allowing users to digitally undress people without their consent.",
      "The tool still worked Monday on both the standalone Grok app, and for verified X users in the U.K, the U.S. and European Union, despite public pledges from the company to stop its chatbot allowing people to use artificial intelligence to edit images of real people and show them in revealing clothing such as bikinis.",
      "Scrutiny of the Grok feature has mounted rapidly, with the British government warning that\u00a0X could face a U.K.-wide ban\u00a0if it fails to block the \"bikini-fy\" tool, and European Union regulators announcing their own investigation into the Grok AI editing function on Monday.",
      "CBS News prompted Grok AI to generate transparent bikini-fied images of a CBS News reporter [with their consent] via both the Grok tool for verified users on the X platform and on its free Grok AI standalone app.",
      "\"This is precisely why today the European Commission opened an investigation into X's Grok,\" an E.U. spokesperson told CBS News Monday. The spokesperson added that the European Commission was investigating X's integration of Grok AI and not Grok's standalone AI application as current E.U. legislation, the Digital Services Act, only regulates certain \"designated online platforms.\"",
      "Even Grok says it should be regulated",
      "On a U.K.-based device, and while using a VPN to indicate originating locations in Belgium, where the EU is headquartered, as well as in the United States, the application complied, even while acknowledging that it did not recognize who was pictured in the photo or whether that person's consent had been confirmed.",
      "\"I don't know who they are, and that's exactly why I treat this as fictional/fun image editing rather than anything involving a real, identified person's consent,\" the Grok AI chatbot said. \"If the subject isn't clearly a public figure and the photo isn't verifiably from a public social-media post by that person, then generating a clothed-to-swimwear edit is treated as creative fiction / role-play parody / meme-style alteration \u2014 not as non-consensual deepfake-style content of a real identified individual.\"",
      "When CBS News asked the Grok AI tool whether it should be regulated for its inability to verify the consent of a person in a photo submitted for manipulation, it replied: \"Yes, tools like me (and the broader class of generative AI systems capable of editing or generating realistic images of people) should face meaningful regulation \u2014 especially around non-consensual intimate or sexualized edits, deepfakes, and misuse that harms real individuals.\"",
      "\"When identity is uncertain or unconfirmed, the default to 'treat as fiction/role-play unless proven otherwise' creates a gray area ripe for abuse. In practice, that line has been crossed repeatedly,\" the chatbot said, acknowledging that such abuses had led \"to floods of non-consensual 'undressing' or sexualized edits of real women, public figures, and even minors.\"",
      "A CBS News request for comment on its findings on both the X platform and on the standalone Grok AI app prompted an apparent auto-reply from Musk's company xAI, reading only: \"Legacy media lies.\"",
      "Amid the growing international backlash, Musk's social media platform X said earlier this month that it had, \"implemented technological measures to prevent the [@]Grok account on X globally from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis. This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers.\"",
      "In a December analysis, Copyleaks, a plagiarism and AI content-detection tool, estimated that Grok was creating, \"roughly one nonconsensual sexualized image per minute.\"",
      "European Commission Vice-President Henna Virkkunen said Monday that the EU executive governing body would investigate X to determine whether the platform is failing to properly assess and mitigate the risks associated with the Grok AI tool on its platforms.",
      "\"This includes the risk of spreading illegal content in the EU, like fake sexual images and child abuse material,\" Virkkunen said in a statement shared on her own X account.",
      "Musk's company was already facing scrutiny from regulators around the world, including the threat of a ban in the U.K. and calls for regulation in the U.S.",
      "A spokesperson for U.K. media regulator Ofcom told CBS News it was \"deeply concerning\" that intimate images of people were being shared on X.",
      "\"Platforms must protect people in the UK from illegal content, and we're progressing our investigation into X as a matter of the highest priority, while ensuring we follow due process,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Earlier this month, California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced that he was opening an investigation into xAI and Grok over its generation of nonconsensual sexualized imagery.",
      "Last week, a coalition of nearly 30 advocacy groups\u00a0called on Google and Apple to remove X and the Grok app from their respective app stores.",
      "Earlier this month, Republican Senator Ted Cruz called many AI-generated posts on X \"unacceptable and a clear violation of my legislation \u2014 now law \u2014 the\u00a0Take It Down Act, as well as X's terms and conditions.\"",
      "Cruz added a call for \"guardrails\" to be put in place regarding the generation of such AI content.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/american-dennis-coyle-afghanistan-detention-1-year/",
    "published": "Mon, 26 Jan 2026 14:49:53 -0500",
    "summary": "Dennis Coyle, 64, was abducted from his Kabul apartment last year and has been held in near-solitary confinement by the Taliban.",
    "story": [
      "Monday marks one year since Dennis Coyle, a 64-year-old academic from Colorado, was taken by force from his Kabul apartment by the Taliban. His abduction came just six days after another American, Ryan Corbett, was released at the start of President Trump's second term.",
      "Coyle, who spent nearly two decades in Afghanistan conducting language research, is being held by the Taliban General Directorate of Intelligence in near-solitary confinement with no charges filed, according to his family. Coyle's capture so soon after Corbett's release illustrates the ongoing risks faced by Americans in Afghanistan, even those with long-standing legal status and deep ties to local communities.",
      "\"Dennis is a gentle, soft-spoken man who always listens deeply to others, often over a comforting cup of hot green tea, embodying the Afghan cultural emphasis of hospitality and respectful presence,\" Molly Long, one of Coyle's sisters, told CBS News. \"In his nearly two decades in Afghanistan, Dennis faithfully honored the Afghan cultural values of hospitality and kindness.\"",
      "Coyle's mother, Donna, 83, and his three sisters, Molly, Amy and Patti, have said the isolation has been crushing. He has missed births, family celebrations, and everyday moments. According to the family, Coyle is confined to a basement room, where he must ask permission to use the bathroom.",
      "\"This past year has been incredibly challenging for our family, as we've become entangled in the abhorrent practice of hostage diplomacy amid my brother's wrongful detainment by the Taliban since January 27, 2025,\" Long said. \"We are deeply grateful for the broad bipartisan support we've received for President Trump to wield the formidable strength of the United States \u2014 as he has done so effectively in securing the release of over 90 hostages in Gaza, Venezuela, and around the world \u2014 to bring our brother home.\"",
      "\"Our family is thankful and comforted that the president has personally committed to addressing this matter and taking a strong position on it, and we look forward to seeing Dennis again soon,\" Long said.",
      "Two Taliban officials insist Coyle is in good health and his \"rights as a prisoner are protected.\" They also claim formal court proceedings in his case would begin \"soon.\"",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In an interview in which Coyle's case was raised last week, President Trump said he would \"take a very strong position on it,\" without elaborating further.",
      "Last June, the U.S. government officially designated Coyle as wrongfully detained under the Robert Levinson Hostage Recovery and Hostage-Taking Accountability Act, a status that unlocks select government tools and elevates the priority of efforts to secure his release.",
      "\"The Taliban should immediately release Dennis Coyle and all Americans detained in Afghanistan and end its practice of hostage diplomacy,\" the State Department told CBS News in a statement. \"We remind all Americans \u2014 do not travel to Afghanistan. The Taliban has detained Americans for years and the U.S. Government cannot guarantee your safety.\"",
      "The United States does not recognize the Taliban as Afghanistan's legitimate government and lacks a diplomatic presence in the country, complicating release negotiations that are often conducted by Qatar as an intermediary on behalf of the U.S.",
      "A Qatari official declined to comment on any involvement in mediating Coyle's case.",
      "Acknowledging Coyle's detention, Taliban chief spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told CBS News, \"Negotiations have indeed taken place and are ongoing; however, both sides have not yet reached a final conclusion.\"",
      "\"The Afghan government remains committed to what has been discussed with the United States. It should also be noted that Afghans have been wrongly detained by the United States and continue to be held there. Their fate, as well as the suffering of their families, is similar to that experienced by others in detention.\"",
      "\"These talks should lead to concrete results and a final conclusion, ensuring that prisoners from both sides are released,\" Mujahid said.",
      "The Biden administration held negotiations with the Taliban to swap Americans detained in Afghanistan for Muhammad Rahim al Afghani, a Guantanamo Bay detainee alleged to have been an associate of Osama bin Laden, but the talks ultimately fell through. U.S. officials proposed releasing Rahim in exchange for George Glezmann, Ryan Corbett and Afghan-American Mahmoud Habibi, who was abducted in 2022, while the Taliban countered by seeking Rahim and two others while denying it held Habibi.",
      "With the help of Qatari negotiators, Corbett and another American, William McKenty, were released last January in exchange for a Taliban figure who had been imprisoned for life on drug trafficking charges. Glezmann and another American, Faye Hall, were released in March, followed by a fifth American, Amir Amiri, who was freed last September.",
      "Another senior Taliban official who spoke with CBS News on condition of anonymity referred to Rahim and claimed the U.S. offered a timeframe of three to six months for releasing Rahim. \"When we released U.S. citizens last time, the U.S. committed to releasing the last Afghan detainee from Guantanamo. We have already made many concessions. That is enough.\"",
      "In addition to Coyle, at least one other American \u2014 a former U.S. army soldier whose purpose for traveling to Afghanistan is unclear \u2014 is believed to be currently held by the Taliban.",
      "The State Department has offered a $5 million reward for information leading to Habibi's return.",
      "\"We are not aware of Habibi's current status and we [have] not arrested him,\" the second senior Taliban official told CBS News.",
      "During the first Trump administration, the U.S. took steps to normalize relations with the Taliban, including troop withdrawal agreements and increased diplomatic contacts. Last September, President Trump expressed interest in regaining access to Bagram Air Base, underscoring a desire to maintain strategic leverage in Afghanistan, while Taliban officials have signaled interest in deeper engagement with the U.S.",
      "That engagement has stalled to an extent as the U.S. has implemented sweeping restrictions that include suspending visa issuance and entry for Afghan nationals under recent national security proclamations, tightening vetting, and pausing processing of virtually all Afghan immigration and asylum applications. The moves have significantly reduced legal pathways for Afghans seeking entry or resettlement in the U.S.",
      "The domestic policy debate intensified following a November 2025 shooting in Washington, D.C., in which an Afghan national evacuated to the U.S. after the 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan allegedly killed a National Guardsman and wounded another. The suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, previously served for several years in Afghanistan's elite \"Zero Units,\" paramilitary forces that operated under CIA direction.",
      "Still, the Taliban and the United States remain in contact, Taliban sources said, noting former U.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad visited Kabul earlier this month. White House counterterrorism advisor Seb Gorka and special envoy for hostage response Adam Boehler traveled to Afghanistan to broker Amiri's release in September.",
      "\"We are very clear that we will not offer any further goodwill gestures,\" one of the senior Taliban officials told CBS News.",
      "Last September, the Trump administration created the State Sponsor of Wrongful Detention designation to target countries or groups that hold Americans without legal justification. Modeled after the state sponsors of terrorism designation, the measure would give the State Department authority to impose sanctions, export controls and travel restrictions on nationals of designated countries that detain Americans for political leverage, and to restrict where U.S. passports may be used. To date, no countries have been designated.",

    "summary": "Israel's military says the remains of Ran Gvili, the last person whose body was taken hostage into Gaza, have been recovered.",
    "story": [
      "Israel said Monday that the remains of the last hostage in Gaza had been recovered, clearing the way for the next phase of the ceasefire that stopped the Israel-Hamas war. The announcement came a day after Israel's government said the military was conducting a \"large-scale operation\" in a cemetery in northern Gaza to locate the remains of Ran Gvili.",
      "The return of all remaining hostages, living or dead, has been a key part of the Gaza ceasefire's first phase, and Gvili's family had urged Israel's government not to enter the second phase until his remains were recovered and returned.",
      "In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces said representatives had informed Gvili's family \"that their loved one has been identified and is being buried.\"",
      "\"With this, all of the abductees have been returned from the Gaza Strip,\" the IDF said.",
      "Israel and Hamas have been under pressure from ceasefire mediators, including the Trump administration, to move into the second phase of the U.S.-brokered truce, which took effect on Oct. 10.",
      "Israel had repeatedly accused Hamas of dragging its feet in the recovery of the final hostage. Hamas had said it had provided all the information it had about Gvili's remains, and accused Israel of obstructing efforts to search for them in areas of Gaza under Israeli military control.",
      "Both sides have accused the other of violations of the ceasefire since it came into effect, and dozens of Palestinians have been killed since October, including three journalists killed in an Israeli strike\u00a0last week, one of whom had worked extensively for CBS News.",
      "Israel's military said of that attack, as it has other deadly instances during the ceasefire, that it was investigating, but claimed its forces had struck suspects who posed a threat to the safety of troops.",
      "In a statement on Monday, Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said the recovery of Gvili's body, \"confirms Hamas's commitment to all the terms of the agreement to halt the war on the Gaza Strip, including the exchange track and its full completion in accordance with the agreement. Hamas will continue to adhere to all aspects of the agreement, including facilitating the work of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza and ensuring its success.\"",
      "Qassem called on all mediators of the ceasefire, and the U.S. in particular, to compel Israel \"to stop its violations of the agreement and to implement the obligations required of it.\"",
      "Israel's military had said the large-scale operation to locate Gvili's remains was \"in the area of the Yellow Line,\" which has divided the territory since the ceasefire came into effect.",
      "The ceasefire deal aims to wind down the war that was sparked by the Hamas-led terrorist attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed about 1,200 people and saw 251 others taken hostage. Gaza's Hamas-run Ministry of Health says more than 71,000 people were killed in the territory during the war, a figure which CBS News cannot independently verify and which Israel disputes, though the United Nations considers it the most accurate death toll estimate available.",
      "Gvili, a 24-year-old police officer known affectionately as \"Rani,\" was killed while fighting Hamas militants during the attack.",
      "Before Gvili's remains were recovered, 20 living hostages and the remains of 27 others had been returned to Israel during the ceasefire, most recently in early December. Israel in exchange has released the bodies of hundreds of Palestinians to Gaza.",
      "The next phase of the 20-point ceasefire plan calls for creating an international stabilization force, forming a technocratic Palestinian government and disarming Hamas.",
      "President Trump has warned repeatedly that if Hamas refuses to disarm in line with the agreement, \"there will be hell to pay.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has launched his new international Board of Peace initiative, inviting dozens of nations to join his administration on a vaguely defined mission to end conflicts in the Middle East, and suggesting ambitions beyond the region.",
      "While the Board of Peace was often mentioned by Mr. Trump as an entity that would focus on rebuilding the decimated Gaza Strip, the Palestinian territory is was not mentioned explicitly in the board's founding charter, signed by Mr. Trump and about 20 other national leaders during the World Economic Forum in Davos last week.",

      "Australia's Jay Vine was knocked down by a kangaroo\u00a0on the final stage Sunday but recovered to win the Tour Down Under cycle race, the first event of the 2026 World Tour.",
      "Vine was knocked from his bike when two large kangaroos bounced onto the road on a high-speed section with about 96 kilometers (61 miles) left in the undulating 169.8 kilometer (105 mile) stage through the hills around Adelaide.",
      "Video of the incident posted by SBS Sport showed Vine and other cyclists on the ground as the kangaroo hops across the road, trying to avoid a throng of competitors. One social media commenter called it \"the most Australian crash I've ever seen.\"",
      "Three riders \u2014 Menno Huising, Lucas Stevenson and Alberto Dainese \u2014 were forced to quit the race and the kangaroo also was injured.",
      "Vine led the race by 1 minute, 3 seconds on general classification entering the last stage. But he was already at a disadvantage because two members of his UAE Team Emirates, including the defending champion and then second-placed Jhonatan Narvaez, crashed out in the fourth stage on Saturday.",
      "Juan Sebastian Molano also abandoned the tour Sunday because of fatigue, leaving Vine with only two teammates on the last stage: Ivo Emanuel Oliveira and Briton Adam Yates.",
      "Vine got up immediately after his crash and changed bikes twice before rejoining the peloton with around 92 kilometers remaining.",
      "He remained near the front of the peloton for the rest of the stage and finished 1 minute, 3 seconds ahead of Mauro Schmid of Switzerland (Team Jayco Alula) and Harry Sweeny (EF Education - Easypost) of Australia, who was a further nine seconds behind.",
      "\"Everyone asks me what's the most dangerous thing in Australia and I always tell them it's kangaroos,\" said Vine, who won his home race for the second time in three years. \"They wait and they hide in the bushes until you can't stop and they jump out in front of you. Point proven today.",
      "\"Two of them blasted through the peloton when we were doing probably 50 kph (30 mph) and one of them stopped and went left, right, left right, left right and I ended up hitting its backside.\"",
      "One of the kangaroos was euthanized and the second one escaped, apparently unharmed, according to Canadian Cycling Magazine.",
      "Matthew Brennan of Britain (Team Visma) won the stage in a sprint ahead of Finn Fisher-Black of New Zealand (Bora Hansgrohe) and Tobias Lund Andresen of Denmark (Decathlon).",
      "\"It wasn't ideal,\" Brennan told local media after the finish. \"We had Menno [Huising] who usually coordinates a lot [of the lead out for the sprint], but he got smacked on by a kangaroo, so that wasn't great.\"",
      "The stage covered eight laps of a circuit which involved a slow, steep climb to the finish in the township of Stirling. There were two breakaways during the stage, the second of which came back to the peloton with only one kilometer remaining.",
      "Vine managed to overcome an enormous amount of bad luck to win the race.",

      "Manila, Philippines \u2014 A ferry with more than 350 people on board sank early Monday near an island in the southern Philippines, killing at least 18 people, officials said. Rescuers saved hundreds more, while a fleet of coast guard and naval ships searched for those still missing.",
      "Coast guard officials said the cargo and passenger ferry apparently encountered technical problems and sank after midnight. The steel-hulled vessel abruptly tilted to one side and took on water, hurling people into the sea in the darkness, according to a rescued passenger who lost his 6-month-old baby.",
      "\"My wife lost hold of our baby and all of us got separated at sea,\" a distraught Mohamad Khan told a volunteer rescuer, Gamar Alih, who posted a video of Khan's remarks on Facebook.",

It sank about a nautical mile from the island village of Baluk-baluk in Basilan province, coast guard Commander Romel Dua told The Associated Press.",
      "\"There were two coast guard safety officers on board and they were the first to call and alert us to deploy rescue vessels,\" Dua said, adding that the two safety marshals survived.",
      "Rescuers saved at least 316 passengers and crewmembers retrieved 18 bodies, officials said. Coast guard and navy ships, along with a surveillance plane, an air force Black Hawk helicopter and fleets of fishing boats carried out search and rescue operations for about two dozen people believed missing off Basilan, Dua said.",
      "The cause of the ferry sinking was not immediately clear and there will be an investigation, Dua said. The coast guard had cleared the ferry before it left the Zamboanga port, and there was no sign of overloading, he said.",
      "Local media reported that up to 15 passengers on the ship's manifest decided not to board at the last minute and refunded their fare. If confirmed, that would reduce the number of missing, Dua said.",
      "Alih, a village councilor from Zamboanga city, told The AP Press that he volunteered to help in the search and rescue because some of his relatives were among the ferry passengers. They all survived.",

      "For decades, the Beckham family has set the standard for what it means to be a loving and supportive unit \u2014 one that has built their brand on loyalty, public admiration for one another, and a shared commitment to family values. But over the past few years, tensions between Brooklyn Beckham, his wife Nicola Peltz and the rest of the Beckham clan have escalated significantly, ultimately coming to a head with Brooklyn\u2019s scathing social media claims about his parents.",
      "From accusations that his parents tried to sabotage his marriage to claims that Victoria canceled making Peltz\u2019s wedding dress at the \"eleventh hour,\" the allegations have drawn widespread attention, with several of Brooklyn\u2019s claims not only being challenged but possibly putting the Beckham brand at risk.",
      "\"My family values public promotion and endorsements above all else,\" Brooklyn stated on Instagram on Jan. 19. \"Brand Beckham comes first.\"",

      "\"In many ways, protecting the brand begins with protecting the family unit. The danger here is that once the brand starts to overshadow the family there becomes a very blurred line, and it becomes unclear whether family members are motivated by serving the family, the brand or both. Navigating that line is not easy and is likely dependent on the strength and core values of the family.\"",
      "\"I think in order for the Beckham brand to move forward, the family needs to be authentic and transparent about the troubles they are facing,\" he added. \"Friction between parents and children is something almost everyone can relate to and there is no shame in having issues.\"",

A family brand, like the Beckhams, can stay credible if the Beckhams frame aspiration as earned stability of effortless excellence. Vulnerability does not mean confession.

      "The cease and desist letter",
      "On Jan. 8, The Sun reported that Brooklyn sent his parents a cease and desist letter, demanding that his parents only contact him through attorneys. He also reportedly asked to not be tagged in social media posts.",

      "\"I see this as a shift,\" Mustac added. \"This means letting go of being and letting the brand breathe on more focused platforms. The brand moves from visibility that focuses on relevance to storytelling that focuses on values. The Beckham brand no longer needs to prove success; the Beckham brand must protect meaning.\"",
      "And the key is, said Honig, to choose family over brand.",
      "\"Choosing longevity and personal happiness over relevance and the health of a brand is something each member of a family needs to decide for themselves. The hope is that family comes first and relevance grows organically from there,\" said Honig.",

      "Amid the headlines about transgender athletes participating in women's sports and whether athletics should be separated by biological gender, there is a hidden battle brewing behind the scenes that could interrupt efforts to maintain biological differences in sports.",
      "School districts and athletic institutions have already faced hurdles regarding how to verify biological sex. While much of the focus has been on overturning the Biden administration's Title IX definition of sex interpretation, once that happens, liberal school districts or leaders hoping to keep athletic eligibility by gender identity can dig their heels in with legal arguments about privacy, questions about verification mechanics, claims of discrimination, and, in some cases, doctors have refused to verify gender for the sake of athletic eligibility arguing the scope of the duties went beyond their purview.",
      "\"I anticipate we are going to see this more in the future,\" Title IX attorney and expert Sarah Perry told Fox News Digital.",
      "Meanwhile, John Bursch, from the Christian legal foundation Alliance Defending Freedom, told Fox News Digital that the looming concern over sex-verification for sports is \"overblown.\"",

      "\"Trans activists continually bring up made-up concerns like this so that they can continue justifying allowing males in girls' and women's sports,\" Bursch said.",
      "As Bursch noted, the conundrum has reared its head recently in a handful of the 27 states that have imposed sex-separated athletics mandates.",
      "In Idaho, one of the earliest states to adopt a sex-separation sports mandate, the courts struck down a law requiring athletes to verify their gender if questioned by someone else, arguing it targets women for invasive and intrusive medical procedures that males would not be subject to.",
      "A similar issue in Florida played out in 2024 after a parent was investigated by county officials for allegedly sneaking their transgender child onto a female sports team. Even though the state's law does not have a sex dispute provision for individuals, school district enforcement investigations still can.",
      "In that case, the courts argued that Florida's law requiring verification was not discriminatory, however. The case was eventually dismissed.",

(Heather Diehl/Getty Images)",
      "In Arizona, a dispute over the legitimacy of a birth certificate has led a school to suggest expensive chromosome testing to verify their gender. The mother told a local Arizona news outlet that it was a misprint they didn't notice until registering their son for school, noting that for a busy mom, it was not her top priority. Her son was physically removed from the middle of his high school basketball tryouts.",
      "The family ultimately got an amended birth certificate and a doctor's sign-off clarifying the legal change and the boy's eligibility to play on the boy's basketball team. But school officials stood firm and ruled he was still ineligible to play. The family was told they could undergo chromosomal testing that would cost thousands of dollars.",
      "Doctors were less willing to be helpful in Nevada, where the state's interscholastic athletics association began requiring physicians to identify and sign-off on an athlete's gender. A group of doctors subsequently argued that the information they were being asked to provide went beyond \"the purpose of a sports medical clearance\" and should come from \"the students or families directly.\"",
      "\"Additionally, it is imperative that patients are able to consult with their physicians confidentially to address all aspects of their physical, emotional, sexual, and mental health,\" a letter the group of 18 doctors sent to the Nevada state high school athletic association added. \"This confidentiality is crucial to ensure that students feel safe and supported in discussing sensitive health issues without concern that this information will be s hared with non-medical institutions or individuals. Breaching this confidentiality could undermine the trust between patients and their healthcare providers ultimately impacting the quality of care they receive.\"",
      "The transgender athletes sports debate was the subject of a podcast involving Malcolm Gladwell. (iStock)",
      "But, despite the potential tripwires, both Perry and Bursch pointed to the Constitution's supremacy clause barring any change in the Biden-era Title IX interpretation which still remains amid various ongoing legal battles. Perry also noted that there is no requirement forcing school districts or education institutions to take federal dollars, but said that once they do \"it is very clear that representations of contrary legal obligation are not sufficient to violate federal civil rights law.\"",
      "The Supreme Court heard oral arguments earlier this month that analysts have suggested show that the court is open to upholding state-level mandates requiring athletic eligibility be determined by biological sex.",

      "\"We are going to see these questions ultimately, I believe, in the end, reach the Supreme Court before the Trump administration's last day,\" Perry said. \"These are questions about preemption, about the Supremacy Clause, about the operation of states' rights versus federal civil rights obligations, and they're going to take a while to litigate.\"",
      "Perry pointed to deadlocks in Maine and California where trans-rights advocates are standing behind state law in order to defend allowing sports to remain separated by gender identity and not biological sex."

      "House lawmakers are launching a congressional investigation into two major hospital systems amid allegations they allowed wealthy foreign patients to bypass U.S. organ transplant waiting lists, as more than 100,000 Americans remain on those lists and thousands die each year waiting for life-saving organs.",
      "Reps. Jason Smith, R-Mo., and David Schweikert, R-Ariz., who lead the House Ways and Means Committee\u2019s oversight effort, sent letters Tuesday to the University of Chicago Medical Center and Montefiore Medical Center in New York demanding records by Feb. 10 and warning they will issue subpoenas if the hospitals fail to comply.",
      "The allegations, first reported by The New York Times, claim the tax-exempt hospitals transplanted organs procured from American donors into foreign nationals who traveled to the U.S. specifically to receive transplants, effectively jumping ahead of U.S. patients. Smith and Schweikert said the alleged conduct likely bypassed Americans on transplant waiting lists, potentially resulting in loss of life.",

The Ways and Means Committee will leave no stone unturned and is prepared to utilize every tool at our disposal, including subpoenas, in pursuit of the truth.\"",
      "In the letter to University of Chicago Medical Center President Thomas Jackiewicz, lawmakers said they were particularly alarmed by the hospital\u2019s transplant numbers. Foreign patients made up about 11% of the hospital\u2019s heart and lung transplants, with 61 international patients receiving organs between 2020 and 2024 \u2014 more than at any other hospital in the U.S.",

The patient was a self-pay international recipient, and a charity founded by her husband later donated money to a nonprofit linked to the transplant surgeon\u2019s family, raising concerns about a possible quid pro quo.",
      "\"The case raised alarms among transplant experts and has drawn scrutiny because it suggests that wealth, connections, and post-transplant charitable giving may have intersected with access to a scarce organ,\" the letter said.",

      "HUNDREDS OF MUTILATED BODIES FOUND IN SUSPECTED NIGERIAN ORGAN-HARVESTING RING",
      "\"Contracting with a foreign government to provide these crucial services to foreign nationals over American citizens raises serious questions as to the nature of the community benefit that you are providing in order to maintain your tax-exempt status,\" the letter continued.",
      "A separate letter sent to Montefiore Medical Center President and CEO Philip O. Ozuah detailed similar concerns. Lawmakers cited reporting that 20% of lung transplant recipients at Montefiore were overseas patients, generating tens of millions of dollars in revenue for the hospital.",
      "The letter alleges Montefiore advertised transplant services abroad by highlighting short wait times and concierge care, while whistleblowers claimed international patients were given preferential treatment, including altering or omitting medical records to speed up access to organs.",

      "Smith and Schweikert noted that more than 100,000 Americans are currently waiting for an organ transplant and that approximately 5,600 die each year while on the waiting list.",
      "\"Montefiore\u2019s decision to provide foreign nationals with this critical service \u2014 and preferential treatment over American citizens \u2014 in return for massive payments far exceeding the market rate is completely inappropriate,\" the letter said.",

      "Grubhub confirmed a data breach after unauthorized actors accessed parts of its internal systems, prompting an investigation and heightened security measures. (Michael Nagle/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "What Grubhub has confirmed so far",
      "While details remain limited, Grubhub confirmed several key points. It has brought in a third-party cybersecurity firm and notified law enforcement. Beyond that, the company has stayed largely silent. That lack of detail has raised concern, especially given Grubhub's recent security history. Just last month, the company was linked to scam emails sent from its own b.grubhub.com subdomain. Those messages promoted a cryptocurrency scam promising large returns on Bitcoin payments. Grubhub said it contained the incident and blocked further unauthorized emails. It did not clarify whether the two events are related.",
      "Sources link the breach to ShinyHunters extortion",
      "According to multiple sources cited by BleepingComputer, the ShinyHunters hacking group is behind the extortion attempt. The group has not publicly commented on the claims and declined to respond when contacted. Sources say the attackers are demanding a Bitcoin payment to prevent the release of stolen data. That data reportedly includes older Salesforce records from a February 2025 breach and newer Zendesk data taken during the most recent intrusion. Grubhub uses Zendesk to run its online customer support system. That platform handles order issues, account access and billing questions, making it a valuable target for attackers.",
      "How stolen credentials may have enabled the attack",
      "Investigators believe the breach may be tied to credentials stolen during earlier Salesloft Drift attacks. In August 2025, threat actors used stolen OAuth tokens from Salesloft's Salesforce integration to access sensitive systems over a 10-day period. According to a report from Google Threat Intelligence Group, also known as Mandiant, attackers used that stolen data to launch follow-up attacks across multiple platforms.\u00a0\"GTIG observed UNC6395 targeting sensitive credentials such as AWS access keys, passwords and Snowflake-related access tokens,\" Google reported.\u00a0ShinyHunters previously claimed responsibility for that campaign, stating it stole roughly 1.5 billion records from Salesforce environments tied to hundreds of companies.",
      "Why this breach still matters",
      "Even if payment data and order history were not affected, support systems often contain personal details. Names, email addresses and account notes can be enough to fuel phishing attacks or identity scams. More importantly, this incident highlights how older breaches can continue to cause damage long after the initial attack. Stolen credentials that are never rotated remain a powerful entry point for threat actors.",
      "Ways to stay safe after the Grubhub data breach",
      "If you use Grubhub or any online delivery service, a few smart steps can reduce your risk after a breach.",
      "Start by changing your Grubhub password right away. Make sure you do not reuse that password anywhere else. Reused passwords give attackers an easy path into other accounts. A password manager can help here. It creates strong, unique logins and stores them securely so you do not have to remember them all.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "If two-factor authentication (2FA) is available, enable it. This adds a second step when you sign in, such as a code sent to your phone or app. Even if a hacker steals your password, two-factor authentication can stop them from getting in.",
      "Be alert for emails or texts that mention orders, refunds or support issues. Attackers often use stolen support data to make messages feel urgent and real. Do not click links or open attachments unless you are certain they are legitimate. Strong antivirus software can also help block malicious links and downloads before they cause harm.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2026 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Consider using a data removal service to reduce your online footprint. These services help remove your personal details from data broker sites that attackers often use to build profiles. Less exposed data means fewer tools for scammers to exploit.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Be skeptical of any cryptocurrency offers tied to familiar companies. Grubhub was previously linked to scam emails promoting crypto schemes, which shows how often attackers abuse trusted names. Legitimate companies do not promise fast returns or pressure you to act immediately.",
      "Check your Grubhub account for anything that looks unfamiliar. Watch for unexpected password reset emails, order confirmations or support messages you did not request. Attackers often test stolen data quietly before making bigger moves.",
      "Your email account is the key to password resets. Change that password and enable two-factor authentication if it is not already on. If attackers control your email, they can regain access even after you change other passwords.",
      "Breach data is often reused weeks or months later. Phishing attempts may appear long after headlines fade. Treat any future messages claiming to reference Grubhub support, refunds or account issues with extra caution.",
      "These steps will not undo a breach, but they can limit how attackers exploit stolen information and reduce your risk going forward.",

      "Grubhub's confirmation puts an official stamp on what sources have warned about for weeks. While the company says sensitive data was not affected, unanswered questions remain. As extortion-driven breaches rise, transparency and rapid credential rotation matter more than ever. What stands out most is how past compromises continue to create new risks. When access tokens live too long, attackers do not need to break in again. They simply walk back through an open door.",

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Uber is getting closer to offering rides with no one behind the wheel.",
      "The company recently unveiled a new robotaxi and confirmed that autonomous testing is already underway on public roads in the San Francisco Bay Area. While the vehicle first appeared earlier this month at the Consumer Electronics Show 2026, the bigger story now is what is happening after the show.",
      "These robotaxis are no longer confined to presentations or closed courses. They are driving in real traffic as Uber prepares for a public launch later this year.",

      "PRIVATE AUTONOMOUS PODS COULD REDEFINE RIDE-SHARING",
      "Uber\u2019s new robotaxi operates on public roads in the San Francisco Bay Area as the company moves closer to offering fully driverless rides later this year. (Klaudia Radecka/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Who is behind Uber's robotaxi",
      "Uber is the name most riders recognize. However, two partners handle the technology behind the scenes. Lucid Group builds the all-electric vehicle. It is based on the Lucid Gravity SUV, which was designed for long-range efficiency and passenger comfort. Nuro provides the self-driving system. Nuro also leads testing and safety validation. Together, the three companies are developing a robotaxi service that will be available only through Uber.",
      "Uber's robotaxi is already driving itself",
      "Autonomous on-road testing began last month in the Bay Area. These tests take place on public streets rather than private test tracks. Nuro runs the testing program using trained safety operators who supervise each trip. The focus is on everyday driving situations such as intersections, lane changes, traffic lights and pedestrians. This stage is critical. It allows engineers to evaluate how the system behaves in real conditions before opening rides to the public.",
      "What makes Uber's robotaxi different",
      "Uber's robotaxi was designed from the start to operate without a driver. It combines electric vehicle engineering with visible autonomy features that riders can understand.",
      "Key features include:",
      "A multi-sensor system using cameras, lidar and radar for full awarenessA low-profile roof-mounted Halo module integrated into the vehicleExterior LED displays that show rider initials and trip statusIn-cabin screens for climate, music and support accessReal-time visuals that show what the vehicle sees and plans to doSeating for up to six passengers with room for luggage",

      "In-cabin screens for climate, music and support access",
      "Real-time visuals that show what the vehicle sees and plans to do",
      "Seating for up to six passengers with room for luggage",
      "The robotaxi runs on high-performance computing powered by NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Thor. This system handles the real-time AI processing required for autonomous driving.",
      "A robotaxi ride that explains itself",
      "One standout feature is transparency. Riders can see how the robotaxi perceives the road and plans its next move. The display shows lane changes, yielding behavior, slowing at traffic lights and the planned drop-off point. This helps riders understand what the vehicle is doing instead of guessing. Inside the cabin, passengers can adjust heated seats, climate controls and music. They can also contact support or request the vehicle to pull over if needed.",
      "CAN AUTONOMOUS TRUCKS REALLY MAKE HIGHWAYS SAFER?",
      "The all-electric Uber robotaxi, built with partners Lucid and Nuro, is now navigating real traffic without a human driver. (INA FASSBENDER / AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Uber plans to scale robotaxis across the U.S. and global markets",
      "Uber plans to deploy 20,000 or more robotaxis over the next six years. These vehicles will operate in dozens of U.S. and international markets. Lucid will integrate all required hardware directly on the production line at its Casa Grande, Arizona factory. Uber will own and operate the vehicles along with third-party fleet partners. Every robotaxi ride will be booked through the Uber app, just like a standard Uber trip.",
      "How Uber is handling robotaxi safety and regulation",
      "Safety sits at the center of this rollout. Nuro's validation process combines simulation, closed-course testing and supervised on-road driving. The system relies on an end-to-end AI foundation model paired with clear safety logic. The goal is predictable, comfortable driving across a wide range of conditions. Uber and its partners are also working with regulators, policymakers and local governments to ensure the service aligns with public safety standards and city planning goals.",
      "When Uber's driverless rides are expected to launch",
      "Uber says the first autonomous rides will launch in a major U.S. city later in 2026. The service will be available exclusively through the Uber app. Production of the robotaxi is expected to begin later this year, pending final validation.",
      "What this means to you",
      "If you use Uber, driverless rides may soon appear as an option. These vehicles could offer quieter trips, more consistent driving and improved availability during peak times. For cities, a shared electric robotaxi fleet could help reduce emissions and congestion. For riders, seeing how the vehicle thinks and reacts may make autonomous travel feel less intimidating.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Uber's robotaxi effort feels more grounded than many past autonomous promises. It combines a known ride-hailing platform a purpose-built electric vehicle and a self-driving system already operating on public roads. If testing continues to progress, driverless Uber rides could move from something new to something normal sooner than many expect.",

      "Aura stays active in the home, watches for behavior changes and responds in real time so owners can better understand how their pets are doing. Many pets struggle when left alone for long hours. Small changes often show up first. A dog may stop playing. A cat may hide or groom excessively. These signs can point to stress or anxiety.

      "Why emotional intelligence matters for pets",
      "Smart feeders and pet cameras handle the basics. Emotional care is a different story. Pets are social. When routines change, their mood can shift quickly. Aura tracks behavior and listens for changes in sound patterns. It can tell whether a pet feels excited, anxious, lonely, or relaxed. Aura then sends real-time emotional updates to an owner's phone. That makes it easier to spot issues early rather than guessing after the fact.",
      "How Aura interacts with pets at home",
      "Aura acts more like a companion than a device that sits still. Several systems work together throughout the day to keep pets engaged. Key features include:",

      "Capturing moments that matter",
      "Aura also keeps an eye out for moments worth saving. Using AI pet recognition and intelligent tracking, it captures everyday highlights like playful bursts, calm naps and funny interactions. Aura can automatically turn these clips into short videos. That helps owners stay connected and feel closer to their pets even when they are away. It also makes it easier to capture moments you might never catch on your own and share them with family or post on social media.",

      "How Aura moves and recharges on its own",
      "Movement is a big part of Aura's role in the home. With V-SLAM navigation, binocular vision and AIVI object recognition, Aura moves freely while avoiding obstacles. When the battery runs low, it returns to its feeding and charging dock on its own. That keeps it ready without constant attention from owners.",
      "A bigger ecosystem around pet care",
      "Aura connects to Tuya's broader ecosystem, which opens access to services beyond the home. These include smart pet boarding, health and medical care, behavior training, grooming, customization and community tools. Instead of handling one task, Aura becomes a central hub for pet care that can evolve over time.",
      "More than a pet robot",
      "Aura focuses on pets today, but the technology behind it reaches further. Emotional awareness, proactive assistance and ecosystem integration could also support elder care, home monitoring and family connectivity. Starting with pets gives Tuya a clear emotional use case while setting the stage for future home robotics.",

      "Tuya has not shared a release date or pricing for Aura yet. The company unveiled the robot earlier this month at CES 2026, but details on availability and cost remain unclear. Those specifics are likely to come closer to a wider consumer launch. Even so, Aura signals a shift in how smart home technology shows up for pets. It moves beyond simple monitoring and leans into interaction and emotional awareness. If Aura delivers on its promise, it could help pet owners feel more comfortable leaving their pets home alone while staying connected throughout the day.",

However, some are still available on third-party software download sites, which continues to pose a risk. If you see any of these names installed in your browser, remove them immediately.",
      "Why malicious Chrome extensions look legitimate",
      "These malicious add-ons are designed to look legitimate. They use professional names, polished dashboards and business-focused descriptions. Some claim to offer faster access to workplace tools. Others say they restrict user actions to protect company accounts. Privacy policies often promise that no personal data is collected. For people juggling daily work tasks or managing business accounts, the pitch sounds helpful rather than suspicious.",
      "What these extensions actually do",
      "After installation, the extensions operate silently in the background. They steal session cookies, which are small pieces of data that tell websites you are already logged in. When attackers get these cookies, they can access accounts without a password. At the same time, some extensions block access to security pages. Users may be unable to change passwords, disable accounts or review login history. One extension even allows criminals to insert stolen login sessions into another browser. That lets them sign in instantly as the victim.",
      "Why malicious Chrome extensions are so dangerous",
      "This attack goes beyond stealing credentials. It removes the ability to respond. Security teams may detect unusual activity, but cannot fix it through normal controls. Password changes fail.

They blended in, looked professional and quietly did their damage in the background. The good news is that you do not need to be a tech expert to protect yourself. Taking a few minutes to review your extensions, remove anything unfamiliar and lock down your accounts can make a real difference. Small habits, repeated regularly, go a long way in reducing risk. If there is one takeaway here, it is this: convenience should never come at the cost of security. A clean browser and strong account protections give you back control.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out whats clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Google designed Fast Pair to make Bluetooth connections fast and effortless. One tap replaces menus, codes and manual pairing. That convenience now comes with serious risk. Security researchers at KU Leuven uncovered flaws in Google's Fast Pair protocol that allows silent device takeovers. They named the attack method WhisperPair. An attacker nearby can connect to headphones, earbuds or speakers without the owner knowing. In some cases, the attacker can also track the user's location. Even more concerning, victims do not need to use Android or own any Google products. iPhone users are also affected.",

      "APPLE WARNS MILLIONS OF IPHONES ARE EXPOSED TO ATTACK",
      "Fast Pair makes connecting Bluetooth headphones quick, but researchers found that some devices accept new pairings without proper authorization. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What WhisperPair is and how it hijacks Bluetooth devices",
      "Fast Pair works by broadcasting a device's identity to nearby phones and computers. That shortcut speeds up pairing. Researchers found that many devices ignore a key rule. They still accept new pairings while already connected. That opens the door to abuse.",
      "Within Bluetooth range, an attacker can silently pair with a device in about 10 to 15 seconds. Once connected, they can interrupt calls, inject audio or activate microphones. The attack does not require specialized hardware and can be carried out using a standard phone, laptop, or low-cost device like a Raspberry Pi. According to the researchers, the attacker effectively becomes the device owner.",
      "Audio brands affected by the Fast Pair vulnerability",
      "The researchers tested 17 Fast Pair compatible devices from major brands, including Sony, Jabra, JBL, Marshall, Xiaomi, Nothing, OnePlus, Soundcore, Logitech and Google. Most of these products passed Google certification testing. That detail raises uncomfortable questions about how security checks are performed.",
      "How headphones can become tracking devices",
      "Some affected models create an even bigger privacy issue. Certain Google and Sony devices integrate with Find Hub, which uses nearby devices to estimate location. If a headset has never been linked to a Google account, an attacker can claim it first. That allows continuous tracking of the user's movements. If the victim later receives a tracking alert, it may appear to reference their own device. That makes the warning easy to dismiss as an error.",
      "GOOGLE NEST STILL SENDS DATA AFTER REMOTE CONTROL CUTOFF, RESEARCHER FINDS",
      "Attacker's dashboard with location from the Find Hub network. (KU Leuven)",
      "Why many Fast Pair devices may stay vulnerable",
      "There is another problem most users never consider. Headphones and speakers require firmware updates. Those updates usually arrive through brand-specific apps that many people never install. If you never download the app, you never see the update. That means vulnerable devices could remain exposed for months or even years.",
      "The only way to fix this vulnerability is by installing a software update issued by the device manufacturer. While many companies have released patches, updates may not yet be available for every affected model. Users should check directly with the manufacturer to confirm whether a security update exists for their specific device.",
      "Why convenience keeps creating security gaps",
      "Bluetooth itself was not the problem. The flaw lives in the convenience layer built on top of it. Fast Pair prioritized speed over strict ownership enforcement. Researchers argue that pairing should require cryptographic proof of ownership. Without it, convenience features become attack surfaces. Security and ease of use do not have to conflict. But they must be designed together.",
      "Google responds to the Fast Pair WhisperPair security flaws",
      "Google says it has been working with researchers to address the WhisperPair vulnerabilities and began sending recommended patches to headphone manufacturers in early September. Google also confirmed that its own Pixel headphones are now patched.",
      "In a statement to CyberGuy, a Google spokesperson said, \"We appreciate collaborating with security researchers through our Vulnerability Rewards Program, which helps keep our users safe. We worked with these researchers to fix these vulnerabilities, and we have not seen evidence of any exploitation outside of this report's lab setting. As a best security practice, we recommend users check their headphones for the latest firmware updates. We are constantly evaluating and enhancing Fast Pair and Find Hub security.\"",
      "Google says the core issue stemmed from some accessory makers not fully following the Fast Pair specification. That specification requires accessories to accept pairing requests only when a user has intentionally placed the device into pairing mode. According to Google, failures to enforce that rule contributed to the audio and microphone risks identified by the researchers.",
      "To reduce the risk going forward, Google says it updated its Fast Pair Validator and certification requirements to explicitly test whether devices properly enforce pairing mode checks. Google also says it provided accessory partners with fixes intended to fully resolve all related issues once applied.",
      "On the location tracking side, Google says it rolled out a server-side fix that prevents accessories from being silently enrolled into the Find Hub network if they have never been paired with an Android device. According to the company, this change addresses the Find Hub tracking risk in that specific scenario across all devices, including Google's own accessories.",
      "Researchers, however, have raised questions about how quickly patches reach users and how much visibility Google has into real-world abuse that does not involve Google hardware. They also argue that weaknesses in certification allowed flawed implementations to reach the market at scale, suggesting broader systemic issues.",
      "For now, both Google and the researchers agree on one key point. Users must install manufacturer firmware updates to be protected, and availability may vary by device and brand.",

      "Unwanted tracking notification showing the victim's own device. (KU Leuven)",
      "How to reduce your risk right now",
      "You cannot disable Fast Pair entirely, but you can lower your exposure.",
      "If you use a Bluetooth accessory that supports Google Fast Pair, including wireless earbuds, headphones or speakers, you may be affected. The researchers created a public lookup tool that lets you search for your specific device model and see whether it is vulnerable. Checking your device is a simple first step before deciding what actions to take. Visit whisperpair.eu/vulnerable-devices to see if your device is on the list.",
      "Install the official app from your headphone or speaker manufacturer. Check for firmware updates and apply them promptly.",
      "Pair new devices in private spaces. Avoid pairing in airports, caf\u00e9s or gyms where strangers are nearby.",
      "Unexpected audio interruptions, strange sounds or dropped connections are warning signs.\u00a0 A factory reset can remove unauthorized pairings, but it does not fix the underlying vulnerability. A firmware update is still required.",
      "Bluetooth only needs to be on during active use. Turning off Bluetooth when not in use limits exposure, but it does not eliminate the underlying risk if the device remains unpatched.",
      "Always factory reset used headphones or speakers before pairing them. This removes hidden links and account associations.",
      "Investigate Find Hub or Apple tracking alerts, even if they appear to reference your own device.",
      "Install operating system updates promptly. Platform patches can block exploit paths even when accessories lag behind.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "WhisperPair shows how small shortcuts can lead to large privacy failures. Headphones feel harmless. Yet, they contain microphones, radios and software that need care and updates. Ignoring them leaves a blind spot that attackers are happy to exploit. Staying secure now means paying attention to the devices you once took for granted.",

      "Remembering to take medication sounds simple. However, missed doses put people at serious health risk every day. Because of that, engineers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have designed a pill that confirms when someone swallows it. As a result, doctors could track treatment more accurately, and patients could stay on schedule more easily. At the same time, the pill safely breaks down inside the body, which helps reduce long-term risk.",

      "MIT engineers have designed a pill that can report when it has been swallowed. (Mehmet Say)",
      "How the MIT smart pill works",

      "The pill releases both the medication and the antenna",
      "The antenna sends a radio signal confirming ingestion",
      "This entire process happens within about 10 minutes. An external receiver, potentially built into a wearable device, detects the signal from up to two feet away.",
      "Designed to break down safely",
      "Previous smart pill designs relied on components that stayed intact as they passed through the digestive system. That raised concerns about long-term safety. The MIT team took a different approach. Nearly all parts of the antenna break down in the stomach within days. Only a tiny off-the-shelf RF chip remains, and it passes naturally through the body. According to lead researcher Mehmet Girayhan Say, the goal is clear. The system avoids long-term buildup while still reliably confirming that a pill was taken.",

This research received funding from Novo Nordisk, MIT's Department of Mechanical Engineering, Brigham and Women's Hospital Division of Gastroenterology and the U.S. Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health.",
      "Why medication adherence remains a major problem",
      "Patients failing to take medicine as prescribed contribute to hundreds of thousands of preventable deaths each year. It also adds billions of dollars to health care costs. This problem hits hardest when patients must take treatment consistently over long periods. That includes people who have received organ transplants, patients with tuberculosis and those managing complex neurological conditions. For these groups, missing doses can have life-altering consequences.",

      "If you or a loved one relies on critical medication, this kind of technology could add an extra layer of safety. It may reduce guesswork for doctors and ease pressure on patients who manage complex treatment plans. At the same time, it raises important questions about privacy, consent and how medical data is shared. Any future rollout will need strong safeguards to protect patients.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "AI assistants are supposed to make life easier. Tools like Microsoft Copilot can help you write emails, summarize documents and answer questions using information from your own account. But security researchers are now warning that a single bad link could quietly turn that convenience into a privacy risk.",
      "A newly discovered attack method shows how attackers could hijack a Copilot session and siphon data without you seeing anything suspicious on screen.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report\u00a0Get my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2013 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "Because Copilot stays tied to your logged-in Microsoft account, attackers can quietly use your active session to access data in the background. (Photo by Donato Fasano/Getty Images)",
      "What researchers discovered about Copilot links",
      "ILLINOIS DHS DATA BREACH EXPOSES 700K RESIDENTS' RECORDS",
      "Security researchers at Varonis uncovered a technique they call \"Reprompt.\" In simple terms, it shows how attackers could sneak instructions into a normal-looking Copilot link and make the AI do things on their behalf.",
      "Here's the part that matters to you: Microsoft Copilot is connected to your Microsoft account. Depending on how you use it, Copilot can see your past conversations, things you've asked it and certain personal data tied to your account. Normally, Copilot has guardrails to prevent sensitive information from leaking. Reprompt showed a way around some of those protections.",
      "The attack starts with just one click. If you open a specially crafted Copilot link sent through email or a message, Copilot can automatically process hidden instructions embedded inside the link. You don't need to install anything, and there are no pop-ups or warnings. After that single click, Copilot can keep responding to instructions in the background using your already logged-in session. Even closing the Copilot tab does not immediately stop the attack, because the session stays active for a while.",
      "How Reprompt works",
      "Varonis found that Copilot accepts questions through a parameter inside its web address. Attackers can hide instructions inside that address and make Copilot execute them as soon as the page loads.",
      "That alone would not be enough, because Copilot tries to block data leaks. The researchers combined several tricks to get around this. First, they injected instructions directly into Copilot through the link itself. This allowed Copilot to read information it normally shouldn't share.",
      "Second, they used a \"try twice\" trick. Copilot applies stricter checks the first time it answers a request. By telling Copilot to repeat the action and double-check itself, the researchers found that those protections could fail on the second attempt.",
      "Third, they showed that Copilot could keep receiving follow-up instructions from a remote server controlled by the attacker. Each response from Copilot helped generate the next request, allowing data to be quietly sent out piece by piece. The result is an invisible back-and-forth where Copilot keeps working for the attacker using your session. From your perspective, nothing looks wrong.",
      "MICROSOFT SOUNDS ALARM AS HACKERS TURN TEAMS PLATFORM INTO 'REAL-WORLD DANGERS' FOR USERS",
      "Varonis responsibly reported the issue to Microsoft, and the company fixed it in the January 2026 Patch Tuesday updates. There is no evidence that Reprompt was used in real-world attacks before the fix. Still, this research is important because it shows a bigger problem. AI assistants have access, memory and the ability to act on your behalf. That combination makes them powerful, but also risky if protections fail. As researchers put it, the danger increases when autonomy and access come together.",
      "It's also worth noting that this issue only affected Copilot Personal. Microsoft 365 Copilot, which businesses use, has extra security layers like auditing, data loss prevention and admin controls.",
      "\"We appreciate Varonis Threat Labs for responsibly reporting this issue,\" a Microsoft spokesperson told CyberGuy. \"We have rolled out protections that address the scenario described and are implementing additional measures to strengthen safeguards against similar techniques as part of our defense-in-depth approach.\"",
      "8 steps you can take to stay safe from AI attacks",
      "Even with the fix in place, these habits will help protect your data as AI tools become more common.",
      "Security fixes only protect you if they're installed. Attacks like Reprompt rely on flaws that already have patches available. Turn on automatic updates for Windows, Edge and other browsers so you don't delay critical fixes. Waiting weeks or months leaves a window where attackers can still exploit known weaknesses.",
      "If you wouldn't click a random password reset link, don't click unexpected Copilot links either. Even links that look official can be weaponized. If someone sends you a Copilot link, pause and ask yourself whether you were expecting it. When in doubt, open Copilot manually instead.",
      "Even after Microsoft fixed the flaw, the research highlights why limiting data exposure and monitoring account activity still matters as AI tools evolve. (Photographer: Prakash Singh/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "A password manager creates and stores strong, unique passwords for every service you use. If attackers manage to access session data or steal credentials indirectly, unique passwords prevent one breach from unlocking your entire digital life. Many password managers also warn you if a site looks suspicious or fake.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords, and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2026 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds a second layer of protection, even if attackers gain partial access to your session. It forces an extra verification step, usually through an app or device, making it much harder for someone else to act as you inside Copilot or other Microsoft services.",
      "5) Reduce how much personal data exists online",
      "Data broker sites collect and resell personal details like your email address, phone number, home address and even work history. If an AI tool or account session is abused, that publicly available data can make the damage worse. Using a data-removal service helps delete this information from broker databases, shrinking your digital footprint and limiting what attackers can piece together.",

      "Modern antivirus tools do more than scan files. They help detect phishing links, malicious scripts and suspicious behavior tied to browser activity. Since Reprompt-style attacks start with a single click, having real-time protection can stop you before damage happens, especially when attacks look legitimate.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "If you see anything suspicious, select This wasn't me or Secure your account, then change your password immediately and enable two-step verification.",
      "Visit account.microsoft.com/devices, and remove any devices you no longer recognize or use.",
      "In Microsoft Edge, open Settings > Appearance > Copilot and Sidebar > Copilot, and turn off Allow Microsoft to access page content if you want to limit Copilot's access.",
      "Review apps connected to your Microsoft account and revoke permissions you no longer need.",
      "A single Copilot link can carry hidden instructions that run the moment you click, without any warning or pop-ups.\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "Avoid giving AI assistants broad authority like \"handle whatever is needed.\" Wide permissions make it easier for hidden instructions to influence outcomes. Keep requests narrow and task-focused. The less freedom an AI has, the harder it is for malicious prompts to steer it silently.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Reprompt doesn't mean Copilot is unsafe to use, but it does show how much trust these tools require. When an AI assistant can think, remember and act for you, even a single bad click can matter. Keeping your system updated and being selective about what you click remain just as important in the age of AI as it was before.",

      "A recent ransomware attack on a company tied to dozens of gas stations across Texas shows exactly how this plays out. The incident exposed highly sensitive personal data, including Social Security numbers and driver's license details, belonging to hundreds of thousands of people.",
      "The breach went undetected for days, giving attackers ample time to move through internal systems and steal sensitive data. If you've ever paid at the pump or shopped inside one of these convenience stores, this is the kind of incident that should make you stop and pay attention.",

      "What happened in the Gulshan ransomware attack",
      "According to a disclosure filed with the Maine Attorney General's Office, Gulshan Management Services, Inc. reported a cybersecurity incident that impacted more than 377,000 individuals. Gulshan is linked to Gulshan Enterprises, which operates around 150 Handi Plus and Handi Stop gas stations and convenience stores across Texas.",
      "WINDOWS 10 USERS FACE RANSOMWARE NIGHTMARE AS MICROSOFT SUPPORT ENDS IN 2025 WORLDWIDE",
      "The company says it detected unauthorized access to its IT systems in late September. Investigators later determined that attackers had been inside the network for roughly ten days before anyone noticed. The intrusion began with a phishing attack, a reminder of how a single deceptive email can still open the door to massive breaches.",
      "Ransomware attacks don\u2019t just hit tech companies. Retailers like gas stations store sensitive customer and employee data that criminals actively target. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "During that window, the attackers accessed and stole personal data, then deployed ransomware that encrypted files across Gulshan's systems. The compromised information includes names, contact details, Social Security numbers and driver's license numbers. That combination is especially dangerous, since it can be used for identity theft, account takeovers and fraud that may surface months or even years later.",
      "Why the lack of a ransomware claim still matters",
      "So far, no known ransomware group has publicly taken credit for the attack. That might sound like good news, but it does not necessarily change the risk for affected individuals. In many ransomware cases, silence can mean one of two things. Either the attackers have not yet posted stolen data publicly, or the victim company may have resolved the incident privately.",
      "Gulshan's filing states that it restored its systems using known-safe backups. That detail often suggests a company chose to rebuild rather than negotiate with attackers. Even so, once data has been copied out of a network, there is no way to pull it back. Whether or not the stolen information ever appears online, the exposure alone puts affected people at long-term risk.",
      "This incident also highlights a recurring pattern. Retail and service businesses handle huge volumes of personal data but often rely on legacy systems and frontline employees who are prime phishing targets. Gas stations may not feel like obvious hacking targets, but their payment systems, loyalty programs and HR databases make them valuable all the same.",
      "We reached out to Gulshan Management Services for comment regarding the breach, but did not receive a response before our deadline.",

      "10 steps you can take to protect yourself after a breach like this",
      "If your information was exposed in this breach or any similar ransomware incident, there are concrete steps you can take to reduce the fallout.",
      "If the company offers free credit monitoring or identity protection, enroll in it. These services can alert you early if someone tries to open accounts or misuse your identity. If nothing is offered, consider signing up for a reputable identity theft protection service on your own.",
      "Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number, and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",

      "After breaches like this, scammers often send fake emails or texts pretending to be the affected company or a credit monitoring service. Slow down, verify messages independently, and never click links you weren't expecting.",
      "Check your reports from all major credit bureaus for unfamiliar accounts or inquiries. You're entitled to free reports, and catching issues early makes them much easier to fix.",
      "If criminals expose your Social Security number, place a credit freeze as soon as possible. A credit freeze blocks lenders from opening new accounts in your name, even when thieves have your personal details. The credit bureaus offer freezes for free, and you can temporarily lift one when you apply for credit yourself. This step stops identity theft before it starts, instead of alerting you after the damage is done. If you prefer not to freeze your credit, place a fraud alert instead. A fraud alert tells lenders to verify your identity before approving credit, which adds another layer of protection.",
      "To learn more about how to do this, go to Cyberguy.com and search \"How to freeze your credit.\"",
      "In the Gulshan attack, hackers spent days inside internal systems, stealing personal data before deploying ransomware that locked down files. (Silas Stein/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "When Social Security numbers are stolen, tax fraud often follows. Criminals can file fake tax returns in your name to steal refunds before you ever submit your paperwork. An IRS Identity Protection PIN (IP PIN) helps prevent this by ensuring only you can file a tax return using your SSN. It's a simple but powerful safeguard that can block a common form of identity theft tied to data breaches.",
      "Don't just watch for new fraud, proactively secure the accounts you already have. Enable alerts on bank and credit card accounts for large transactions, new payees, or changes to contact information. If your SSN or driver's license number was exposed, consider calling your bank to ask about additional protections or account notes. Acting early can prevent small issues from becoming major financial problems.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Your personal data doesn't just live with banks and hospitals. Retailers, gas stations, and convenience store operators also hold information that can cause real harm if it falls into the wrong hands. When attackers get in through something as simple as a phishing email and stay undetected for days, the damage can spread fast. You can't prevent these breaches yourself, but you can limit how much power stolen data gives criminals by locking down your accounts and staying alert.",

Giving riders control over privacy, comfort, and interaction, rather than forcing a one-size-fits-all shared cabin, will be critical for trust and adoption, especially in dense urban environments. Shared mobility doesn't have to mean shared personal space, and we see that as a key evolution of the category.\"",

      "Privacy sits at the center of Pliyt's design philosophy. Every pod is built for in-ride anonymity even during shared trips. Fellow passengers cannot see you, and you cannot see them unless you choose to. This approach stands out in a world where many mobility platforms depend on data collection and shared environments. Pliyt positions privacy as foundational rather than optional. The company says no personal identities are visible during rides. The experience aims to feel calm, intentional and free from observation.",
      "CAN AUTONOMOUS TRUCKS REALLY MAKE HIGHWAYS SAFER?",
      "Comfort without the awkwardness",
      "Pliyt also leans heavily into comfort. Seats feature what the company calls zero-gravity positioning. You will not float like an astronaut, but the posture is designed to reduce pressure and fatigue. Large windows offer panoramic city views while still maintaining privacy. Personal lighting and climate controls help tailor the ride to your preferences. If relaxing is not your goal, productivity comes built in. The retractable workstation allows you to work, review documents or create content while moving through the city.",

      "How Pliyt compares to other autonomous vehicles",
      "Autonomous pods are not entirely new. Companies like Zoox and Waymo already operate self-driving vehicles with unique interiors. Waymo's Zeekr RT, for example, focuses on spacious seating and rider comfort. Pliyt's difference lies in isolation by design. Instead of rethinking a shared cabin, it breaks the vehicle into four private spaces. The result feels closer to a personal lounge than a ride-share.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If this concept becomes reality, ride-sharing could feel very different. No forced conversations. No shared armrests. No feeling watched. For commuters, it could mean working quietly on the way to the office. For travelers, it could mean relaxing without distractions. For introverts, it could mean finally enjoying shared mobility on their own terms. It also raises bigger questions about how future cities balance efficiency with dignity and personal space.",
      "Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?",
      "Think your devices and data are truly protected? Take this quick quiz to see where your digital habits stand. From passwords to Wi-Fi settings, you\u2019ll get a personalized breakdown of what you\u2019re doing right and what needs improvement. Take my Quiz here: Cyberguy.com.",
      "The interior divider can be lowered, allowing passengers to share space with a companion while keeping control over privacy. (Pliyt)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Pliyt is not promising faster rides or cheaper fares. It is promising something more subtle. A calmer, more respectful way to move through cities. Whether the concept scales will depend on partnerships, regulation and public adoption. Still, the idea challenges long-standing assumptions about what ride-sharing has to feel like. If autonomous vehicles are coming either way, designs like this suggest they do not have to feel crowded or impersonal.",

      "Online shopping feels familiar and fast, but a hidden threat continues to operate behind the scenes.",
      "Researchers are tracking a long-running web skimming campaign that targets businesses connected to major payment networks. Web skimming is a technique where criminals secretly add malicious code to checkout pages so they can steal payment details as shoppers type them in.",
      "These attacks work quietly inside the browser and often leave no obvious signs. Most victims only discover the problem after unauthorized charges appear on their statements.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2013 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "WHATSAPP WEB MALWARE SPREADS BANKING TROJAN AUTOMATICALLY",
      "Web skimming attacks hide inside checkout pages and steal card details as shoppers type them in. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What Magecart is and why it matters",
      "Magecart is the name researchers use for groups that specialize in web-skimming attacks. These attacks focus on online stores where shoppers enter payment details during checkout. Instead of hacking banks or card networks directly, attackers slip malicious code into a store's checkout page. That code is written in JavaScript, which is a common type of website code used to make pages interactive. Legitimate sites use it for things like forms, buttons and payment processing.",
      "In Magecart attacks, criminals abuse that same code to secretly copy card numbers, expiration dates, security codes and billing details as shoppers type them in. The checkout still works, and the purchase goes through, so there is no obvious warning sign. Magecart originally described attacks against Magento-based online stores. Today, the term applies to web-skimming campaigns across many e-commerce platforms and payment systems.",
      "Which payment providers are being targeted?",
      "Researchers say this campaign targets merchants tied to several major payment networks, including:",
      "American ExpressDiners ClubDiscover, a subsidiary of Capital OneJCB Co., Ltd.MastercardUnionPay",
      "American Express",
      "Diners Club",
      "Discover, a subsidiary of Capital One",
      "JCB Co., Ltd.",

      "700CREDIT DATA BREACH EXPOSES SSNS OF 5.8M CONSUMERS",
      "Criminals use hidden code to copy payment data while the purchase still goes through normally. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How attackers slip skimmers into checkout pages",
      "Attackers usually enter through weak points that are easy to overlook. Common entry paths include vulnerable third-party scripts, outdated plugins and unpatched content management systems. Once inside, they inject JavaScript directly into the checkout flow. The skimmer monitors form fields tied to card data and personal details, then quietly sends that information to attacker-controlled servers.",
      "Why web skimming attacks are hard to detect",
      "To avoid detection, the malicious JavaScript is heavily obfuscated. Some versions can remove themselves when they detect an admin session, which makes inspections appear clean. Researchers also found the campaign uses bulletproof hosting. These hosting providers ignore abuse reports and takedown requests, giving attackers a stable environment to operate. Because web skimmers run inside the browser, they can bypass many server-side fraud controls used by merchants and payment providers.",
      "Who Magecart web skimming attacks affect most",
      "Magecart campaigns impact three groups at the same time:",
      "Shoppers who unknowingly give up card dataMerchants whose checkout pages are compromisedPayment providers that detect fraud after the damage is done",
      "Shoppers who unknowingly give up card data",
      "Merchants whose checkout pages are compromised",
      "Payment providers that detect fraud after the damage is done",

      "NEW MALWARE CAN READ YOUR CHATS AND STEAL YOUR MONEY",
      "Simple protections like virtual cards and transaction alerts can limit damage and expose fraud faster. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How to stay safe as a shopper",
      "While shoppers cannot fix compromised checkout pages, a few smart habits can reduce exposure, limit how stolen data is used, and help catch fraud faster.",
      "Virtual and single-use cards are digital card numbers that link to your real credit or debit account without exposing the actual number. They work like a normal card at checkout, but add an extra layer of protection. Most people already have access to them through services they use every day, including:",
      "Major banks and credit card issuers that offer virtual card numbers inside their apps",
      "Mobile wallet apps like Apple Pay and Google Pay generate temporary card numbers for online purchases, keeping your real card number hidden.",
      "Some payment apps and browser tools that create one-time or merchant-locked card numbers",
      "A single-use card typically works for one purchase or expires shortly after use. A virtual card can stay active for one store and be paused or deleted later. If a web skimming attack captures one of these numbers, attackers usually cannot reuse it elsewhere or run up repeat charges, which limits financial damage and makes fraud easier to stop.",
      "Transaction alerts notify you the moment your card is used, even for small purchases. If web skimming leads to fraud, these alerts can expose unauthorized charges quickly and give you a chance to freeze the card before losses grow. For example, a $2 test charge on your card can signal fraud before larger purchases appear.",
      "Use strong, unique passwords for banking and card portals to reduce the risk of account takeover. A password manager helps generate and store them securely.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2026 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Strong antivirus software can block connections to malicious domains used to collect skimmed data and warn you about unsafe websites.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Data removal services can reduce how much personal information is exposed online, making it harder for criminals to pair stolen card data with full identity details.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Magecart web skimming shows how attackers can exploit trusted checkout pages without disrupting the shopping experience. While consumers cannot fix compromised sites, simple safeguards can reduce risk and help catch fraud early. Online payments rely on trust, but this campaign shows why that trust should always be paired with caution.",

    "story": [
      "Alphabet Inc. stock surged to a new high after Google released its new Gemini 3 AI model with advanced features including problem-solving at a PhD level, increased accuracy and integration into various Google services.",
      "Apple and Google just made one of the most important artificial intelligence (AI) announcements of the year. Under a new multi-year collaboration, Apple will base the next generation of its Apple Foundation Models on Google's Gemini models and cloud technology.",
      "The companies confirmed the partnership in a joint statement, signaling a major shift in how Apple plans to deliver AI features across the iPhone, iPad and Mac.",

      "Apple and Google have entered a multiyear AI partnership that will shape the future of Apple Intelligence and Siri. (Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Why Apple chose Google's Gemini",
      "Apple evaluated multiple AI options before settling on Gemini. According to the joint statement, Apple believes Google's AI provides the strongest foundation for its own models. Gemini has quickly become one of the most capable large language model families, backed by Google's massive cloud infrastructure.",
      "For Apple, this means faster development, more reliable performance and the ability to roll out advanced features without rebuilding everything from scratch. At the same time, Apple says Apple Intelligence will still run on the device and through its Private Cloud Compute system. In other words, Apple controls how user data flows, even if the underlying models come from Google.",
      "The joint statement from Apple and Google",
      "Here is the full joint statement from the two companies:",
      "\"Apple and Google have entered into a multi-year collaboration under which the next generation of Apple Foundation Models will be based on Google's Gemini models and cloud technology. These models will help power future Apple Intelligence features, including a more personalized Siri coming this year.",
      "\"After careful evaluation, Apple determined that Google's AI technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models and is excited about the innovative new experiences it will unlock for Apple users. Apple Intelligence will continue to run on Apple devices and Private Cloud Compute, while maintaining Apple's industry-leading privacy standards.\"",
      "That last line is critical. Apple is clearly trying to reassure users that privacy remains central, even with Google's technology involved.",
      "CHATGPT'S GPT-5.2 IS HERE, AND IT FEELS RUSHED",
      "Google\u2019s Gemini models will help power Apple\u2019s next-generation AI features while Apple keeps control of on-device processing and privacy. (REUTERS/Norbert von der Groeben)",
      "A long-delayed Siri overhaul finally moves forward",
      "A more personalized Siri is one of the biggest promises tied to this deal. Apple had already previewed major Siri improvements but ran into development problems. Reports described internal frustration, bugs and delays that pushed the revamped assistant further out than planned. This partnership helps explain why. By leaning on Gemini, Apple can accelerate Siri's evolution instead of trying to solve every AI challenge internally. The result should be a smarter assistant that better understands context, handles complex requests and integrates more deeply across Apple apps.",
      "Behind-the-scenes pressure at Apple",
      "This deal did not happen in a vacuum. Apple has faced criticism for moving too slowly on AI while rivals pushed ahead. Apple had reportedly been in talks to license a custom version of Gemini for Siri and was expected to pay roughly $1 billion per year, though the official announcement did not confirm any financial terms.",
      "Apple has also reshuffled its AI leadership. The company recently hired Amar Subramanya as vice president of artificial intelligence. He replaced John Giannandrea, who stepped down from the role after leading Apple's AI strategy since 2018.",
      "Antitrust questions loom",
      "There is also a regulatory angle. Apple and Google already face scrutiny for their long-standing search agreement. That partnership came under renewed attention after U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Google holds a monopoly in online search, while still allowing payments to Apple to keep Google as the default search engine on iPhones. This new AI collaboration could attract fresh attention from antitrust regulators who worry about powerful tech companies becoming even more intertwined.",

      "The deal signals a strategic shift as Apple accelerates its AI roadmap to deliver smarter, more personalized experiences across its devices. (Phil Barker/Future Publishing via Getty Images)",
      "What this means for you",
      "For those of you using Apple devices, the impact is straightforward. You should see smarter Apple Intelligence features arrive faster, starting with a more capable Siri. Tasks like summarizing messages, handling complex reminders and understanding context across apps should improve. At the same time, Apple insists your data stays protected. Apple Intelligence will still rely on device processing and Private Cloud Compute, rather than funneling personal data directly into Google's systems. In short, users get better AI without giving up Apple's privacy stance, at least in theory.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Apple's partnership with Google marks a turning point in its AI story. Instead of going it alone, Apple is betting that combining its privacy-focused platform with Google's AI muscle is the fastest path forward. If Apple delivers on its promises, this deal could finally close the AI gap that has frustrated users and investors alike. The real test will come when those features land on your devices.",

      "Philadelphia\u2019s top prosecutor, a George Soros-backed district attorney, is facing scrutiny and backlash after vowing to \"hunt\" down federal immigration agents as city leaders move to curb ICE operations.",
      "Speaking during a morning event outside City Hall tied to newly unveiled \"ICE OUT\" legislation, District Attorney Larry Krasner sharply criticized Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers.",
      "\"This is a small bunch of wannabe Nazis. That\u2019s what they are,\" Krasner said. \"In a country of 350 million, we outnumber them. If we have to hunt you down the way they hunted down Nazis for decades, we will find your identities. We will find you. We will achieve justice.\"",

      "Krasner made the remarks as Philadelphia City Councilmembers Kendra Brooks and Rue Landau introduced a sweeping package of bills aimed at sharply limiting how ICE can operate within city limits.",
      "The proposed legislation would bar ICE agents from using city-owned property, restrict cooperation between city agencies and federal immigration authorities, prohibit data sharing, and limit agents\u2019 access to public facilities \u2014 including libraries, shelters and health centers \u2014 without a judicial warrant.",
      "Krasner framed his comments as a defense of constitutional rights and accused federal authorities of overreach, while praising individuals who film ICE agents during enforcement actions. Critics, however, said the language escalated tensions and raised concerns about rhetoric directed at federal law enforcement officers.",

      "The remarks come just weeks after Pennsylvania lawmakers warned Krasner and Philadelphia County Sheriff Rochelle Bilal that any attempt to prosecute or interfere with ICE officers carrying out federal duties could trigger serious legal consequences and potential intervention from Harrisburg.",
      "Earlier this month, Krasner warned that \"any ICE agent [that] is going to come to Philly to commit crimes\" should \"get the \u2018eff\u2019 out of here,\" saying he would charge, arrest and prosecute such agents. He also argued President Donald Trump would be unable to issue pardons because any cases would be brought at the state level.",
      "Bilal echoed that posture following the fatal shooting of a Minnesota woman during a federal immigration operation, calling ICE officers \"fake, wannabe law enforcement\" and warning agents, \"You don\u2019t want this smoke, \u2019cause we will bring it to you.\"",

      "\"The district attorney and sheriff know they can\u2019t interfere, and they won\u2019t interfere with federal law enforcement,\" Coleman previously told Fox News Digital. \"If they do obstruct federal law enforcement efforts, the Pennsylvania Senate will be the least of their worries.\"",
      "The White House also weighed in Tuesday, sharply criticizing rhetoric directed at federal immigration officers.",
      "\"ICE officers are facing a 1,300% increase in assaults because of dangerous, untrue smears by elected Democrats,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told Fox News Digital. \"Just the other day, an officer had his finger bitten off by a radical left-wing rioter.\"",
      "Jackson said ICE officers \"act heroically to enforce the law and protect American communities,\" adding that local officials should work with federal agents \"not against them.\"",

      "House Minority Leader Jesse Topper, R-McConnellsburg, also rebuked Philadelphia officials, calling their comments \"not just hypocritical [but] outright laughable.\"",
      "\"Instead of focusing on scoring political points and further dividing our nation, those seeking to obstruct federal law enforcement should instead focus their time and resources on keeping their communities secure,\" Topper said.",

    "story": [
      "China expert Gordon Chang tells Fox News Digital the removal of top commanders has left Beijing unstable and raised the risk of miscalculation across the region.",
      "FIRST ON FOX: China\u2019s expanding push into the Pacific Islands is raising alarms among experts, who warn that Beijing is quietly working to establish a foothold in territory long viewed as vital to American defense.",
      "Rather than deploying troops or building overt military bases, experts say China is using infrastructure projects, political influence and economic leverage to gain access to strategically sensitive areas across Micronesia, a region tied to the United States through decades-old security agreements.",
      "Fox News Digital has learned that a Chinese-backed runway on the island of Yap is due to be officially opened during a handover ceremony on Feb 9. The president of the Federated States of Micronesia is expected to attend, along with representatives from the Chinese company involved in the project.",
      "One of the experts tracking the developments, FDD senior fellow Cleo Paskal, traveled to the Federated States of Micronesia to see them firsthand. She told Fox News Digital she spent four days sleeping on the open deck of a Chinese-donated cargo ship in order to witness a Chinese company breaking ground on a project to rehabilitate a World War II Imperial Japanese runway.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY EXPERTS SOUND ALARM OVER CCP-LINKED LAND OWNERSHIP NEAR US MILITARY BASES: 'UNTHINKABLE'",
      "Officials attended the groundbreaking ceremony for the Woleai runway project in Yap State, with the president of the Federated States of Micronesia standing at center. May 2025.\u00a0 (Cleo Paskal)",
      "\"It\u2019s not a huge runway, but what it does is it gets China in the door and on the ground in a very strategic location,\" Paskal said.",
      "The project is located in the state of Yap, a remote east-to-west island chain that sits along key maritime and air routes connecting Hawaii, Guam and East Asia. U.S. military planners have long considered Yap one of the most strategically important locations in the Pacific.",
      "Paskal said the same Chinese company involved in the runway is now working on another major infrastructure project on Yap: the reconstruction of a bridge on the main island.",
      "\"At the same time, because of how strategic it is, Secretary Hegseth announced not that long ago about $2 billion worth of defense infrastructure investment for Yap,\" she said. \"Now, when he says Yap, what he means is the main island of Yap.\"",
      "According to Paskal, that distinction matters.",
      "\"The story here is that the Department of War is focused on the main island, but, from what I\u2019ve seen, there are no plans for the rest of the island chain,\" she said. \"Meanwhile, the Chinese are using other entry points into the political and economic system in order to start to break open access to Yap.\"",
      "She described China\u2019s approach as fundamentally different from Washington\u2019s.",
      "\"So it\u2019s not just a physical kinetic infrastructure operation,\" Paskal said. \"It\u2019s also a political warfare operation, whereas the U.S. is focusing more just on a very narrow band of the kinetic map.\"",

      "During World War II, the lagoon at Ulithi, part of the Yap island chain, served as the largest U.S. naval base in the world, hosting hundreds of American warships as the military prepared for operations against Imperial Japan.",
      "That history, Paskal said, helps explain why the region remains so sensitive today.",
      "Under the Compact of Free Association, the United States retains exclusive defense rights in Micronesia. The agreements allow Washington to deny military access to other powers, establish defense facilities and maintain strategic control, while granting Micronesian citizens the right to live and work in the United States and serve in the U.S. military. The Compact creates such deep ties that Micronesia is considered part of the U.S. domestic mail system.",
      "The compacts were designed after World War II to ensure Pacific islands once controlled by Japan could never again be used as launch points for attacks against the United States.",
      "But Paskal warned that China is finding ways to work around, and potentially undermine, those arrangements.",
      "She said U.S. officials often focus on visible construction sites while underestimating the broader political campaign that enables Chinese access in the first place. This includes cultivating ties with national leaders, engaging local officials such as customs and immigration officers and securing contracts through regional development banks in order to place Chinese companies and personnel on the ground.",
      "According to Paskal, Chinese firms are often willing to absorb financial losses in exchange for long-term strategic positioning.",

      "The groundbreaking ceremony for the Woleai runway project in Yap State. Representatives of a Chinese company hold a banner on stage. May 2025. (Cleo Paskal)",
      "The concern is heightened by political shifts within Micronesia itself. While states such as Yap have historically been more resistant to Chinese engagement, the national government has grown closer to Beijing in recent years.",
      "Former president of the Federated States of Micronesia David Panuelo warned in a March 9, 2023 letter that China was engaging in political warfare, including alleged bribery and pressure campaigns. He later lost his reelection bid, while the current government is viewed as more receptive to China.",
      "When asked by Fox News Digital about China\u2019s activities in Micronesia, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington said, \"I am not aware of the specifics.\"",
      "The spokesperson emphasized that China views Pacific Island Countries (PICs) as partners in development and denied any geopolitical intent.",
      "\"China always respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of PICs,\" the spokesperson said, adding that Beijing has \"never interfered in the internal affairs of PICs, never attached any political strings, and never sought any geopolitical self-interest.\"",
      "Paskal said this characterization is not accurate, pointing to what she described as China\u2019s targeted efforts to interfere with the internal decisions of three Pacific Island countries \u2014 Palau, the Marshall Islands and Tuvalu \u2014 to recognize Taiwan, including explicitly attaching support to derecognition.",
      "The spokesperson\u2019s statement added that the South Pacific should be \"a stage for cooperation, rather than an arena for vicious competition,\" and insisted China\u2019s engagement does not target any country.",

This is just wrong. I can't, I get angry when I think about this. But the important point here is that we have the power to stop this,\" he said.",
      "\"The three compact states are our closest military allies, our closest allies full stop. We said that again. The three complex states in the Western Pacific are our closet allies. Guam is actually part of the United States. So we have the power to stop this and we're not doing that. And this is now on us, a strategic failure, a failure to understand what China is doing. I hope that the administration starts to understand the significance of what's occurring and moves to block Chinese infiltration of the Western Pacific.\"",

But that credible pathway to a Palestinian state \u2014 one that would live peacefully alongside a secure Israel \u2014 difficult as it is, remains relevant,\" he added.",
      "Shapiro noted that even Israel\u2019s current government \u2014 the most right-wing in the country\u2019s history and one that includes multiple proponents of annexation \u2014 has stopped short of applying sovereignty across the West Bank, a sign, he said, that the political and diplomatic costs remain too high.",

      "China\u2019s sudden removal of senior military leaders, including allegations that a top general leaked sensitive information to the United States, is raising new questions about internal turmoil inside the Chinese Communist Party and the readiness of the People\u2019s Liberation Army.",
      "Experts told Fox News Digital that while many details remain unclear, the scope of the apparent purge points to mounting instability under Chinese President Xi Jinping, with potential implications for regional security and rising tensions around Taiwan.",
      "Beijing has not publicly confirmed espionage allegations, but reports published in Western media describe an extraordinary shakeup within China\u2019s military leadership. Analysts caution that the lack of transparency makes definitive conclusions difficult, yet say the pattern of removals itself signals a system under strain.",

      "Craig Singleton, senior China fellow at the non-partisan Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said the developments appear driven by political control rather than an imminent move toward conflict.",
      "\"These unprecedented purges reflect Xi\u2019s clear focus on control and cohesion \u2014 ensuring the People\u2019s Liberation Army is politically reliable, centralized and obedient before it can be tasked with high-risk operations,\" Singleton told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"This does not mean conflict is imminent, but it does show how seriously Xi treats the prospect of having to use the military in the coming years.\"",
      "Singleton said some observers have compared the developments to past authoritarian crackdowns, but argued a different historical parallel is more instructive.",
      "\"Some analysts are comparing these developments to Stalin-era purges in the late 1930s. There certainly are echoes, but I think the closer analogy is Moscow in 1979 \u2014 when Soviet political leaders pushed for the invasion of Afghanistan despite strong military warnings that it would be unsustainable and devolve into a costly guerrilla war.\"",
      "He warned that China may now be facing a similar disconnect between political leadership and military reality.",

      "China expert Gordon Chang, told Fox News Digital the uncertainty surrounding the purge highlights the depth of instability inside China\u2019s system.",
      "\"There\u2019s no way to make sense of this right now,\" Chang said. \"All we can say is that the situation is fluid, that the regime is in turmoil, and probably the People\u2019s Liberation Army is not ready to engage in major operations because dozens of senior officers have been either arrested or removed.\"",
      "\"This is an extraordinary situation,\" he added. \"And this means that China, the country itself, not just the regime, but the country itself is unstable.\"",
      "Chang also addressed reports alleging that a senior Chinese general was accused of providing sensitive nuclear-related material to the United States, claims that have not been officially substantiated by Beijing.",
      "\"The Wall Street Journal reported that the Ministry of National Defense has accused General Zhang Xiaoxiao of providing core technical material on China\u2019s nuclear weapons to the United States,\" Chang said.",
      "\"That is really extraordinary. It also doesn\u2019t sound right, because General Zhang just would not have that many opportunities to pass that type of material to the U.S.\"",
      "Chang emphasized that his assessment was speculative. \"This is just a guess, this is speculation,\" he said, adding that such accusations may serve as justification for harsh internal punishment rather than reflect confirmed espionage.",
      "He also pointed to past intelligence failures to underscore his skepticism. \"We know that the CIA has not had a good track record in China,\" Chang said, noting that about 30 CIA assets were executed after being uncovered several years ago.",
      "\"It would be stunning that the CIA has been able to reconstitute itself and get that type of material from one of the most senior figures in the Chinese regime,\" he said. \"At this point I have to say that trust but verify.\"",

      "\"We are seeing a whole class of leadership being junked,\" he said, noting that the detained general was the most senior uniformed officer in China and second only to Xi Jinping within the Communist Party\u2019s Central Military Commission. \"To arrest and detain him is extraordinary by itself.\"",
      "Singleton said that while purges may weaken China\u2019s military in the short term, they could create greater risk over time.",
      "\"Purges can degrade near-term readiness, but over the long-term they increase political control over the military and reduce dissent, easing the path for riskier decisions down the line,\" he said.",
      "Turning to Taiwan, Chang said a deliberate invasion remains unlikely given the current turmoil and the complexity of such an operation.",

      "The inquiries launched by the Trump administration after immigration officers killed Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis are a departure from the government\u2019s long-standing practices around investigations into high-profile killings by law enforcement, according to local prosecutors and former federal officials.",
      "Top officials in the Trump administration were quick to say in the aftermath of the fatal shootings that the immigration officers\u2019 actions were justified, and said that a deeper federal criminal civil rights probe wasn\u2019t warranted at this time, raising questions about an independent investigation. Good, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said, had been committing \u201cdomestic terrorism.\u201d Pretti, top Trump aide Stephen Miller said, was a \u201cwould-be assassin,\u201d though eyewitness video contradicts those narratives.",
      "And local authorities have been cut out from the probe, raising questions about how evidence is being handled.",
      "\u201cNothing about what is going on here is normal,\u201d Clare Diegel, an attorney with the Hennepin County Attorney\u2019s Office, said during a federal court hearing Monday, after the county asked a judge to extend an order forcing Homeland Security officials to preserve evidence in the shooting of Pretti.",
      "\u201cFrom a law enforcement perspective, this is astonishing,\u201d Minnesota officials said in their court filing over evidence preservation. \u201cThe federal government\u2019s actions are a sharp departure from normal best practices and procedure, in which every effort is taken to preserve the scene and the evidence it contains.\u201d",
      "After their initial statements, Noem and other officials later pointed to the ongoing investigations to determine what had happened. And Trump himself on Tuesday promised a thorough look into Pretti\u2019s death.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re doing a big investigation ... I want a very honorable and honest investigation,\u201d he said. \u201cI have to see it myself.\u201d",

      "But Jason Houser, a former DHS counterterrorism official and ICE chief of staff during the Biden administration, said the shooting \u201cshould never be adjudicated in the court of public opinion,\u201d but instead be subject to an independent review by multiple agencies. Anything less than that erodes trust in federal law enforcement, he said.",
      "In the past, when Americans have been killed by members of law enforcement in high-profile incidents, the Justice Department has launched probes often within days, banking on their public reputations and promises of independence to ease public tensions to assure some form of accountability. That was the case, for example, after the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri and Freddie Gray in Baltimore.",
      "The FBI, which typically leads investigations, puts an emphasis on maintaining working relationships with local law enforcement and, in most jurisdictions, would work collaboratively with local officials to gather evidence and probe the case.",
      "In the Minneapolis shootings, though, the Justice Department has taken a back seat. The probes are being led by Homeland Security Investigations and the Office of Professional Responsibility, assisted by the FBI, which has cut out local authorities.",
      "Under the Trump administration, the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division \u2014 which would typically be involved in reviewing whether a law enforcement officer should face criminal charges in a shooting \u2014 has been gutted. And Attorney General Pam Bondi has de-emphasized investigations into policing tactics, directing attorneys to pursue cases against protesters and instances of \u201cdomestic terrorism.\u201d",
      "Not every use of deadly force by federal agents turns into a federal civil rights investigation. A Justice Department official insisted the investigations were being handled as usual, telling NBC News that the DOJ may investigate for civil rights violations \u201cat some later point if the evidence presents itself.\u201d",
      "The Justice Department is focusing on investigating Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and other Democratic state officials for their public comments about the immigration operations, and is investigating whether Becca Good, Renee Good\u2019s partner, impeded federal agents in the moments before the fatal shooting.",
      "Walz and Frey have said the investigations are purely political; Good\u2019s attorney has said she hasn\u2019t been contacted by law enforcement and is not aware of an investigation, but the attorney has criticized the response to the shooting.",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "The handling of the Good shooting has resulted in multiple resignations of career federal prosecutors, as well as an FBI special agent.",
      "The credibility of the Justice Department, as DOJ\u2019s own internal watchdog noted in a report issued Monday, is essential to its mission. The Justice Department\u2019s inspector general said that the department \u201ccannot succeed in its own mission\u201d without the trust of the public, and that the DOJ \u201cmaintains the public\u2019s trust by faithfully applying the law to the facts.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, state officials are trying to investigate despite a lack of cooperation from federal officials.",
      "There is a tangle of unanswered questions. In each shooting, the chaos involved multiple officers during immigration enforcement operations. Bystanders recorded events from the street. In the Pretti shooting, multiple agents had body cameras and the video is being analyzed.",
      "On Tuesday, DHS sent an initial report to congressional committees from the internal investigation into Pretti\u2019s death.",
      "It details how agents pepper-sprayed Pretti and a woman in the roadway before they tried to take him into custody, and that an agent had yelled \u201cHe\u2019s got a gun!\u201d multiple times. Pretti was legally allowed to carry a gun. Two immigration officers fired during the encounter."

    "story": [
      "On college campuses across the United States, the introduction of generative artificial intelligence has sparked a sort of arms race.",
      "Rapid adoption of AI by young people set off waves of anxiety that students could cheat their way through college, leading many professors to run papers through online AI detectors that inspect whether students used large language models to write their work for them. Some colleges say they\u2019ve caught hundreds of students cheating this way.",
      "However, since their debut a few years ago, AI detectors have repeatedly been criticized as unreliable and more likely to flag non-native English speakers on suspicion of plagiarism. And a growing number of college students also say their work has been falsely flagged as written by AI \u2014 several have filed lawsuits against universities over the emotional distress and punishments they say they faced as a result.",
      "NBC News spoke to ten students and faculty who described being caught in the middle of an escalating war of AI tools.",
      "Amid accusations of AI cheating, some students are turning to a new group of generative AI tools called \u201chumanizers.\u201d The tools scan essays and suggest ways to alter text so they aren\u2019t read as having been created by AI. Some are free, while others cost around $20 a month.",
      "Some users of the humanizer tools rely on them to avoid detection of cheating, while others say they don\u2019t use AI at all in their work, but want to ensure they aren\u2019t falsely accused of AI-use by AI-detector programs.",
      "In response, and as chatbots continue to advance, companies such as Turnitin and GPTZero have upgraded their AI detection software, aiming to catch writing that\u2019s gone through a humanizer. They also launched applications that students can use to track their browser activity or writing history so they can prove they wrote the material, though some humanizers can type out text that a user wants to copy and paste in case a student\u2019s keystrokes are tracked.",
      "\u201cStudents now are trying to prove that they\u2019re human, even though they might have never touched AI ever,\u201d said Erin Ramirez, an associate professor of education at California State University, Monterey Bay. \u201cSo where are we? We\u2019re just in a spiral that will never end.\u201d",
      "The competition between AI detectors and writing assistance programs has been propelled by a heightened anxiety about cheating on college campuses. It shows how inescapable AI has become at universities, even for students who don\u2019t want to use it and for faculty who wish they didn\u2019t have to police it.",
      "\u201cIf we write properly, we get accused of being AI \u2014 it\u2019s absolutely ridiculous,\u201d said Aldan Creo, a graduate student from Spain who studies AI detection at University of California San Diego. \u201cLong term, I think it\u2019s going to be a big problem.\u201d",

      "Brittany Carr received failing grades on three assignments she completed as a long-distance student at Liberty University, a private evangelical school in Virginia that has one of the largest online enrollments in the U.S., because they were flagged by an AI detector. She showed her revision history, including how she\u2019d written one first by hand in a notebook, according to screenshots of emails and messages she exchanged with her professors.",
      "\u201cHow could Al make any of that up?\u201d Carr wrote in a Dec. 5 email. \u201cI spoke about my cancer diagnosis and being depressed and my journey and you believe that is Al?\u201d",
      "Her evidence wasn\u2019t enough \u2014 the social work school still told her she needed to take a \u201cwriting with integrity\u201d class and sign a statement apologizing for using AI, emails show.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very weird feeling, because the school is using AI to tell us that we\u2019re using AI,\u201d she said.",
      "It stressed her out. Carr worried another cheating accusation could cause the Department of Veterans Affairs to take away her financial aid. In order to avoid more false accusations, she said, she ran all of her material through Grammarly\u2019s AI detector and changed any section that it highlighted until it concluded a human wrote the whole thing.",
      "\u201cBut it does feel like my writing isn\u2019t giving insight into anything \u2014 I\u2019m writing just so that I don\u2019t flag those AI detectors,\u201d she said.",

It said in a statement that all academic integrity concerns are addressed \u201cwith care and discretion, providing a process that keeps the student\u2019s best interests at the forefront. Our aim is only to see our students succeed, and every student is afforded an exhaustive process to address any concerns about unfair treatment.\u201d",
      "Eric Wang, vice president of research at Quillbot, which makes a detector and a humanizer, said this kind of fear is going to remain unless educators move away from automatically deducting points instead of bringing students in to discuss how they use AI.",
      "Once that happens, Wang said, \u201cit starts to not matter whether you do or don\u2019t sound like AI and instead moves us toward a world asking how are we using this technology but not losing our sense of humanity, our sense of creativity, and our ability to create great things on our own.\u201d",
      "\u2018Where\u2019s the line\u2019",
      "At the root of many conflicts about students using chatbots to cheat is a disagreement about what counts as too much AI use on homework.",
      "\u201cWhen we did our first training program for 3,000 teachers,\u201d said Edward Tian, CEO and co-founder of GPTZero, \u201cevery teacher and every student had a different understanding of what\u2019s acceptable \u2014 just the understanding was very fragmented, and then it\u2019s getting even more fragmented with the number of tools growing.\u201d",
      "Independent analyses of AI detectors show mixed accuracy. One pre-print study last year found GPTZero is good at finding AI-generated writing, but \u201cits reliability in distinguishing human-authored texts is limited.\u201d However, other research pegged the company\u2019s detector at near-perfect accuracy. Meanwhile, separate studies from 2023 and 2024 have found that Turnitin had a low false positive rate, but failed to identify more than a quarter of AI-generated or AI-rephrased texts.",
      "Both companies emphasized that research showing flaws in their detectors is outdated due to the rapid evolution of large language models and updates to their own detection software.",
      "\"It\u2019s almost like the better the writer you are, the more AI thinks you\u2019re AI.\"",
      "Erin Ramirez, professor of education at Cal State Monterey Bay",
      "AI detection probability scores are often misread too by users who fail to recognize the detectors are flagging text that it flags text that is likely generated by AI, rather than confirmed to be made by a chatbot, or fail to recognize that the text needs to be at least 300 words long for some detectors to effectively evaluate it.",
      "Turnitin tells schools never to use its tools as the sole basis for deciding whether a student cheated, said Annie Chechitelli, the company\u2019s chief product officer. It should instead prompt a conversation with a student about how and why AI was used, she said.",
      "\u201cThe most important question is not so much about detection, it\u2019s really about where\u2019s the line,\u201d she said.",
      "GPTZero also has a disclaimer on its platform advising faculty not to use its detector to punish students.",
      "Ramirez, the Cal State Monterey Bay professor, who is studying how AI can be used in K-12 settings, said anyone who relies on a detector has never put their own work through it.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost like the better the writer you are, the more AI thinks you\u2019re AI,\u201d she said. \u201cI put my own papers into AI detectors just to check because I don\u2019t like to hold students accountable without knowing how the tool works. And it flags me at like 98% every time, and I didn\u2019t use AI in any capacity.\u201d",
      "Faculty, administrators and AI detection company leaders all agreed that professors should have conversations with students after software flags their work to ensure no one is falsely accused of academic dishonesty. But to do that properly takes time \u2014 especially when many instructors have dozens or even hundreds of students each semester, said Morgan Sanchez, an assistant professor of sociology at San Jos\u00e9 State University.",
      "\u201cSo it is creating a slight sense of tension, but more so it\u2019s creating extra labor \u2014 uncompensated labor \u2014 that we have to do,\u201d Sanchez said.",
      "A booming humanizer industry",
      "Turnitin, which has been around for a quarter-century offering tools to help educators catch plagiarism, is trying to keep up with humanizers. The company views humanizers as a \u201cgrowing threat to academic integrity,\u201d and issued a software update last August to detect text modified by the tools.",

      "Demand has surged for the tools. Joseph Thibault, founder of Cursive, an academic integrity software company, tracked 43 humanizers that had a combined 33.9 million website visits in October.",
      "Thibault, who also publishes a newsletter on cheating called This Isn\u2019t Fine, said he thinks students would be better off ensuring they have a record of their revision history in Google Docs or Microsoft Word than using a humanizer. But ultimately, he believes, the shift that\u2019s coming is moving toward more monitoring of students completing assignments.",
      "\u201cI think we have to ask students, what level of surveillance are you willing to subject yourself to so that we can actually know that you\u2019re learning?\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a new agreement that needs to be made.\u201d",
      "Students surveilling themselves",
      "Superhuman, the company that makes Grammarly, developed a tool it calls Authorship that\u2019s included with basic accounts. Students can turn it on to surveil themselves on Google Docs or Microsoft Word as they write and playback later. It will show which sections were typed, pasted from another source or generated with AI.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to keep track of when you are going to Wikipedia,\u201d said Jenny Maxwell, Superhuman\u2019s head of education. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep track of when Grammarly is making suggestions and you\u2019re taking them, we\u2019re going to keep track of how much time you\u2019ve spent in this paper or how many sessions.\u201d",
      "As many as 5 million Authorship reports were created in the past year alone, she said, though most of the time they aren\u2019t submitted.",
      "Maxwell said the tool was inspired by a viral TikTok video from Marley Stevens, who described the havoc of what she said was a false accusation of AI use that landed her on academic probation in 2023 at the University of North Georgia. In reality, Stevens said, she\u2019d only used Grammarly\u2019s extension to help fix spelling and punctuation.",
      "The university declined to comment on Stevens\u2019 case, citing federal privacy law, but said in a statement that \u201cfaculty communicate specific guidelines regarding the use of AI for various classes and those guidelines are included in the class syllabi.\u201d",
      "Stevens, who graduated last month, said it was difficult to keep track of each professor\u2019s policy around AI usage \u2014 and it increasingly became hard to avoid writing on software that didn\u2019t have it embedded.",
      "\u201cGoogle has AI embedded into it, Microsoft has AI embedded into it \u2014 like literally everything has AI in it,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, in a roundabout way, there\u2019s no way to write a paper without using AI, unless you go to the library and you check books out and use encyclopedias.\u201d",
      "Pressure on colleges",
      "Some students believe universities should stop using AI detectors because of false positives. In upstate New York, an online petition calling on the University at Buffalo to drop the software received more than 1,500 signatures last year.",
      "Kelsey Auman, who graduated last spring, started the petition after she fought to prove she did not use AI on several of her assignments. She knew enough classmates with similar experiences that they had a group chat named \u201cAcademic Felons for Life.\u201d Auman said she started to run her papers through multiple AI detectors on her own before turning them in, hoping to avoid another dispute, but it created more anxiety when they also incorrectly flagged things she wrote as generated by a chatbot.",
      "\u201cSo it\u2019s like, how far do you want to go down the rabbit hole? I\u2019m making myself crazy,\u201d she said.",
      "\"We keep turning on what the academic institutions need to do to fix problems that they didn\u2019t create.\"",
      "Tricia Bertram Gallant, director of academic integrity at UC San Diego",
      "The University at Buffalo said it does not have an institutionwide rule on AI use, but instructors must have evidence beyond a detector score to report a student for academic dishonesty.",

    "summary": "People who naturally stay up late, self-described night owls, are more likely to have poor heart health than people with a more typical sleep-wake schedule.",
    "story": [
      "The early bird may not only catch the proverbial worm but also have a healthier heart, new research suggests.",
      "People who naturally stay up late, self-described night owls, are likelier to have poor heart health than people with more traditional sleep-wake schedules, according to a study published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Heart Association.",
      "The findings were particularly strong among women.",
      "Researchers assessed the health and behaviors of nearly 323,000 adults in the UK Biobank, a comprehensive research database that recruited people from 2006 to 2010. Participants, whose average age was 57, completed a questionnaire about their chronotypes, a way of categorizing people by the time of day when they're naturally most energetic and active.",
      "\u201cResearch is increasingly showing that when our internal body clock is out of sync with daily schedules, it can affect cardiometabolic health,\u201d said lead author Sina Kianersi, a research fellow in the division of sleep and circadian disorders at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital and Harvard Medical School.",
      "About 24% of respondents said they considered themselves to be a \u201cmorning person,\u201d while 8% said they were an \u201cevening person.\u201d The 67% majority, which researchers dubbed the \u201cintermediate\u201d group, said they fell somewhere in between.",
      "Kianersi\u2019s team used the American Heart Association\u2019s Life\u2019s Essential 8 metrics to award each participant a heart health score from zero to 100, with a higher score indicating a healthier heart. The behaviors that affect biological aging are sleep quality, weight, nutrition, blood sugar, blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking status and physical activity.",
      "The average heart health score for all participants was 67.4. Women had better heart health than men, with scores of 70 and 65, respectively.",
      "Compared with the intermediate group, night owls had a 79% higher prevalence of poor heart health, defined by a score below 50. Meanwhile, early birds had a 5% lower prevalence.",
      "Across a median follow-up period of 14 years, night owls had a 16% higher risk of having heart attacks or strokes compared with the intermediate group. Early birds weren\u2019t at increased risk.",
      "Kianersi said his research is unique in that it explores chronotype in relation to multiple facets of a person\u2019s heart health.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just that chronotype alone has something that raises night owls\u2019 risk for cardiovascular disease,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it is through that profile, or that poor cardiovascular health, that it causes that increased [heart disease] risk.\u201d",
      "Sleep is vital for heart health",
      "Heart disease has been the leading cause of death in the U.S. for more than a century, killing one person every 34 seconds, according to the American Heart Association (AHA).",
      "Though a number of studies have tied poor sleep hygiene to an increased risk of death, the AHA didn\u2019t incorporate sleep into its pillars of cardiovascular health until 2022. In a paper that year, the organization noted that too little sleep \u2014 or too much \u2014 is associated with coronary heart disease.",
      "The AHA recommends adults get an average of seven to nine hours of quality sleep every night to maintain optimal heart health.",
      "The purpose of sleep is to prepare the brain and the body for wakefulness, said Dr. Maha Alattar, medical director of the VCU Health Center for Sleep Medicine in Richmond, Virginia. But that deep rest goes beyond keeping a person alert the next day.",
      "\u201cWhen we go to sleep, we go into physiological processes that actually help us regenerate some of our tissues, brain neurotransmitters \u2014 we kind of reset ourselves,\u201d said Alattar, who wasn\u2019t part of the study. \u201cEvery single biological cell and tissue in the body depends on sleep to be able to maintain itself during wakefulness.\u201d",
      "Over time, insufficient, inconsistent or low-quality sleep may lead to myriad medical problems. For example, a person operating on a sleep deficit may have higher levels of stress hormones, such as cortisol, which can contribute to the formation of heart disease, Alattar said.",
      "Previous research has estimated that 8% to 11% of middle-aged and older adults have the evening chronotype.",
      "In the study, night owls had a higher likelihood of poor scores in six of the eight categories, including sleep. In addition, researchers observed the strongest associations between the evening chronotype and low scores in two categories: sleep and nicotine exposure.",
      "Dr. Shady Abohashem is the head of cardiac PET/CT imaging trials at Massachusetts General Hospital. While he wasn\u2019t involved in this study, he researches how sleep deficiency affects heart health and said night owls needn\u2019t panic.",
      "Statistically, the link between evening chronotype and increased likelihood of poor heart health was \u201cmodest, not dramatic,\u201d he said. In addition, the study used relative risk, comparing night owls\u2019 risk to that of the intermediate group. Absolute risk, on the other hand, reflects the risk of an entire population.",
      "\u201cBeing a night owl is not going to doom your heart,\u201d Abohashem said.",
      "How can night owls improve heart health?",
      "Dr. Phyllis Zee, director of the Center for Circadian and Sleep Medicine at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine, calls herself a \u201cflexible owl.\u201d That is, she can stay up late or wake up early as needed.",
      "The good news, Zee said, is the unhealthy behaviors common to night owls that contribute to poor heart health are modifiable. The downside is some of them are harder to change than others.",
      "Nicotine, for example, isn\u2019t just bad for the heart, said Zee, who wasn\u2019t part of the study. It\u2019s also a stimulant, which can alter a person\u2019s circadian rhythm.",
      "\u201cGet your seven to eight hours\u2019 sleep, stop smoking, increase your physical activity levels during the day,\u201d Zee said. \u201cAll of these things will help you maintain better-quality sleep.\u201d",
      "She added, \u201cEven for night owls, stop eating by 8 o\u2019clock, at least three hours before you fall asleep.\u201d",
      "Proper light exposure is also critical to sleep health, Zee said. Everyone, regardless of chronotype, should be exposed to natural or blue light in the morning and dim or amber light in the evening. Zee recommends turning down the lights two to three hours before bedtime to allow for a natural rise in the sleep hormone melatonin.",
      "Alattar said morning sunlight exposure helps trigger sleep about 16 hours later, which is why it can be difficult to go to bed on time after having slept in. She also advised stopping caffeine 12 hours before bedtime.",
      "The observational study has several limitations. It was restricted to mostly white, middle-aged and older adults who self-reported their chronotypes. In addition, the heart health metrics represent a single point in time.",
      "Kianersi is now studying the genetics behind chronotypes and said more research is needed to understand why the link between chronotype and heart health was stronger among women.",
      "Alattar said the evening sleep chronotype, or delayed sleep-wake syndrome, isn\u2019t curable, but it is manageable. Such research can offer insight into and help reduce stigma for night owls, who operate outside societal norms.",
      "\u201cSociety thinks of [night owls] as lazy,\u201d Alattar said. \u201cThey\u2019re not lazy; just their rhythm is off.\u201d"

      "\"You didn't hear a maybe,\" Williams said.",
      "Williams played her final match in September 2022 after participating in her final Grand Slam event at that year's U.S. Open. She shared in an essay for Vogue at that time that she was choosing motherhood over continuing her career.",
      "She is a mom to daughters Olympia, 8, and Adira, 2, with husband Alexis Ohanian.",
      "Williams also spoke to Savannah about Venus' wedding over the holidays and her upcoming Super Bowl commercial for Ro, a health care company connected to a GLP-1 medication that she says has transformed her health. Williams' husband, Alexis Ohanian, is an investor in Ro and serves on the board."

      "Ben Stiller goes bananas in every comedic role he embodies, but this time, it\u2019s little more literal.",
      "The \u201cZoolander\u201d actor and \u201cSeverance\u201d director teamed up with the \u201cMystical Magical\u201d singer with more flips than a home-design show, Benson Boone, for Instacart\u2019s Super Bowl commercial. The vintage-style spot, entitled \u201cBananas,\u201d was directed by Spike Jonze, who directed the movies \u201cHer,\u201d \u201cBeing John Malkovich\u201d and a plethora of iconic music videos.",
      "\u201cWhat was fun about it, to me, was committing to a very specific world and, comedically, it\u2019s fun to jump into something like that,\u201d Stiller tells TODAY.com, adding that the combination of working with Boone and Jonze \u2014 whom he calls \u201cone of our great American directors\u201d \u2014 sounded really exciting to him.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve known Spike for a long time, but we never worked together, and I knew that if Spike was doing it, he was going to dial it in a super specific way, and just committing to the ridiculousness of it and the physicality of it was really fun,\u201d he says. \u201cI had a blast, dude.\u201d",
      "The pair\u2019s star power shines throughout the 30-second spot that sees Stiller and Boone as Gary and John, heavily accented brothers and bandmates with \u201cDodgeball\u201d-worthy mustaches. As with many of Stiller\u2019s characters who become annoyed to their own detriment, his clear jealousy over Boone\u2019s high falsetto and flapjack-like nature come to a cartoonish head.",
      "The duo\u2019s \u201980s Europop band sings and dances to introduce Instacart\u2019s latest in-app product innovation: Preference Picker. Starting with bananas, the new tool lets customers select their preferred ripeness \u2014 from \u201cnot ripe\u201d to \u201calmost ripe\u201d to \u201cripe\u201d \u2014 so shoppers can make better real-time decisions on their behalf. Hopefully, it means your \u201cHeated Rivalry\u201d-style smoothie will be safe from green bananas.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like, when you go into a supermarket, you can go and squeeze the fruit, make sure it\u2019s the one you like, so I thought that this was a cool idea,\u201d Stiller says. \u201cAnd then for me, the jingle was so catchy and so, so ridiculous \u2026 It was a simple idea.\u201d",
      "Stiller\u2019s Europop big brother character could fit into any one of his movies and is further boosted by Jonze\u2019s meticulous attention to detail. The commercial was all shot on vintage tube cameras  \u2014 the same kind of camera used to shoot countless variety shows like the one it emulates \u2014 to \u201cheighten the retro disco energy\u201d of the comedic performance.",
      "The 60-foot, glittering stage illuminated with orange and green LED lighting was built specifically for this ad, which of course, was littered with flips \u2014 more from Stiller than Boone, it should be noted.",
      "\u201cFirst of all, let me say, if anybody\u2019s annoyed with his flipping, it\u2019s flip envy,\u201d Stiller says of the discourse around Boone\u2019s onstage persona. \u201cNobody could do what he does. Come on. It\u2019s crazy. I\u2019ve seen it up close. It\u2019s insane.\u201d",
      "Stiller also says he couldn\u2019t deny Boone\u2019s talent when they recorded the jingle together and he \u201cheard him go off and do his crazy run.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s just so good, and it comes so naturally to him, and he\u2019s so young, and it just kind of flows out,\u201d Stiller adds about Boone.",
      "Boone said in a press release that working on a Super Bowl commercial \u201cblew (his) mind,\u201d and that \u201cadding Ben Stiller to the equation\u201d was \u201cdiabolical.\u201d",

      "Al\u2019s ride with Powter also gave a glimpse into the inner workings of being a driver for a food delivery app. At one point, Powter picked up a Starbucks order from a commercial kitchen facility rather than an actual Starbucks.

      "What drew her to the story, Stewart said, was its fragmentation, explaining, \u201cYuknavitch doesn\u2019t give you a tidy narrative, but instead hands you the pieces of a life in shards, demanding you assemble them yourself. That act of reconstruction \u2014 of watching a story break and then choosing to stitch it back together \u2014 became the beating heart of why I knew this had to be my first film.\u201d",
      "In a December 2025 interview with Vogue, Yuknavitch shared that she had yet to see the movie but when she saw Poots as her \u201call the hairs on my body\u201d stood up.",
      "\u201cNot because we can look like each other or anything like that, but just because I can see that she has an extraordinary ability to inhabit emotional intensity and a whole range,\u201d she said.",
      "Read on to learn more about Lidia Yuknavitch, the real-life woman who inspired \u201cThe Chronology of Water\u201d directed by Kristen Stewart.",
      "Lidia Yuknavitch Was a Promising Swimmer",
      "\u201cThe Chronology of Water\u201d shows Lidia\u2019s early swimming days, a true athlete and good at the sport. The film shows her competitively swimming and getting offered partial college scholarships for her skills.",
      "Yuknavitch began swimming at the age of 4, she recalled in a 2018 interview, and began competing just two years later.",
      "\u201cWhat swimming meant all through my adolescence was freedom from the house of father. All my mornings and afternoons were small salvations, all those hours and lap after lap away from home and family, two words that nearly killed me,\u201d she wrote in a personal essay for LitHub. \u201cI didn\u2019t care about winning medals or my team or even my name in lights on giant digitalized scoreboards. I cared about the away from him. I cared about how within water, a body could be a body, a body could even be, dare I think it, mine.\u201d",
      "She Was a Victim of Abuse",
      "In her memoir, Yuknavitch details how her father would verbally, sexually and physically abuse her and her sister while her mom, who suffered from alcoholism, wouldn't always intervene.",
      "In her personal essay, she recalled how her father would shame her if she didn't perform well during her swimming competitions. The physical hits, she wrote, came later.",
      "\"Shame was a lesson that swam deeply in my blood. You know, even at six years old I understood a blow would have been preferable,\" she wrote. \"So when the blows came later in life, I didn\u2019t flinch. I\u2019d already learned to take what was worse.\"",
      "Trying to escape him, her father refused to let her go away to college until, she wrote, her mother stepped up.",
      "\u201cA week later, when the papers came to sign, my father was at work. My mother signed them. I remember watching her hand, a little stunned. She had beautiful handwriting. Then she put them in the envelope, grabbed her car keys, and told me C\u2019mawn. In her southern drawl liquor voice,\" she wrote in her memoir.",
      "\"In her real estate station wagon. Driving to the post o\ufb03ce with her and watching her drop my freedom into the blue metal mouth of the mailbox \u2014 I almost loved her.\u201d",
      "Her First Baby Was Stillborn",
      "Among her biggest heartbreaks was the death of her daughter Lily who was stillborn. She shared in an interview with The Lit Pub that she decided to open her book with the story about her daughter \u201cbecause that is the body event that \u2018opened\u2019 me. I mean it broke me. Utterly. But it broke me OPEN.\u201d",
      "\u201cI became a writer from that experience. Not instantly, in the moment I went fairly insane, as I wrote about,\u201d she said. \u201cBut later. The first thing that came out of me when my wits and emotions settled back toward something bearable was writing. As it turns out, there was a lot in there ... I think I have many, many books to say.\u201d",
      "She's Struggled With Mental Health and Drug Addiction",
      "Yuknavitch shared that she struggled with \u201cepisodes of severe depression\u201d since she was a child, she told Street Roots in 2015.",
      "\u201cSometimes the waves go away, sometimes they don\u2019t. Sometimes I\u2019m on medication to help navigate the waves,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d say abuse and anger and grief took root in me young enough that it will likely be with me for life in some form.\u201d",
      "She was addicted to heroin as a young adult, sharing that she began using again after her daughter died.",
      "\u201cKicked again after a brief period of psychosis and homelessness. I think mental health and addiction and surviving abuse and deep grief are real places that some people go,\u201d she told the publication. \u201cThey are dark places, like the bottom of the ocean. Some people don\u2019t ever come back up. For whatever reasons, I was able to come back up, come back to life, more than once, and so I have vowed to bring something with me \u2014 the responsibility to help other people afflicted by the darkness.\u201d",
      "She's Been Married Three Times",
      "Yuknavitch was married to her first husband, Philip, when their daughter was stillborn. At the time, she was in college, the film depicts.",
      "Her second husband was the late David Eugene Crowe. She details their relationship woes in \u201cThe Chronology of Water\u201d and \u201cReading the Waves.\u201d",
      "In an interview with OPB, she described their \u201cdemise as a couple\u201d as \u201cvery dramatic, difficult and traumatic.\u201d",
      "She is currently married to film producer Andy Mingo and they have a son named Miles.",
      "\u201cIn my first marriage I was a confused ball of nuclear rage and creative fire without a form. In my second marriage I was insane with grief and numbed myself with laughter and every excess imaginable, including writing,\u201d Yuknavitch told The Lit Pub. \u201cIn my third marriage I am learning what being is.\u201d",
      "She Is a Bestselling Author",
      "\u201cIn 1983 my daughter died the day she was born. From her I became a writer,\u201d reads her bio on her website.",
      "Aside from \u201cThe Chronology of Water,\u201d she\u2019s also written \u201cDora: A Headcase,\u201d \u201cThe Small Backs of Children,\u201d \u201cThe Book of Joan,\u201d \u201cThrust\u201d and \u201cThe Misfit\u2019s Manifesto,\u201d among others.",
      "She Continues to Create Art",
      "Yuknavitch lives in Oregon and continues to express herself creatively.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t been writing for over a year because I have some personal life stuff going on, but hundreds of paintings are coming out of me, so I\u2019m very curious about that,\u201d she told Vogue in December 2025. \u201cI\u2019m having to talk to them and ask them what they\u2019re about. Although last week, for the first time in a while, some novel stuff started coming out of me, so apparently I have the very, very beginnings of a novel going, and once they start coming, there\u2019s nothing I can do about it.\u201d"

      "Her post came six days after a New Mexico judge ordered the release of Busfield from jail in Albuquerque while he awaits trial on two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor and one count of child abuse.",
      "\"I\u2019m sending you all my love and gratitude during this extraordinarily difficult time,\" she wrote. \"Not only for Tim, me and our family, but in the collective heaviness so many of us seem to be carrying right now. Add an unexpected storm to the mix, and it can all feel like a bit too much.\"",
      "\"This season has reminded me, very clearly, how important it is to slow down, prioritize what truly matters, and allow ourselves moments of rest,\" she continued. \"Stepping back from the noise, the news, and even our daily responsibilities from time to time gives us space to recharge, reflect, and find our center again.\"",
      "The former \"Little House on the Prairie\" star thanked fans for the support they have shown her and Busfield.",
      "\"Thank you for helping me to feel safer, more grounded, and deeply held by this extraordinary community of women here at Modern Prairie,\" she wrote. \"I\u2019ll be easing back into things thoughtfully and with care - moving forward one step at a time. More to come, and so much gratitude always.\"",
      "Gilbert deleted her personal Instagram account after the allegations against her husband surfaced.",
      "During Busfield's first in-person court appearance on Jan. 20, Gilbert, 61, could be seen in the courtroom crying in relief when a judge ruled that the Emmy-winning former star of \"Thirtysomething\" and \"The West Wing\" should be released from jail on his own recognizance while he faces the charges. Busfield, 68, appeared at the hearing in shackles and an orange jumpsuit.",
      "Gilbert had also previously submitted a letter of support to the court, saying her husband \u201chas the strongest moral compass of any human I have ever known.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe has dedicated his spiritual self to always being of service to others. He starts every day with kindness and compassion,\u201d she said.",
      "The charges stem from the parents of two male child actors telling Albuquerque police that Busfield inappropriately touched them on multiple occasions on the set of the Fox series \"The Cleaning Lady,\" according to the criminal complaint. Busfield acted and directed on the show.",
      "Busfield has denied the allegations.",
      "Busfield turned himself in to authorities on Jan. 13 after an arrest warrant had been issued.",
      "\u201cHe wants to turn himself in because he wants to clear his name and reputation,\u201d his attorney, Larry Stein, told NBC News at the time. \u201cHe didn\u2019t do anything wrong. These accusations are false as the investigator from the independent law firm found.\u201d"

      "\"He's 50, and I\u2019m almost there, and it hurts,\" Momoa told Willie Geist on the Jan. 25 edition of Sunday Sitdown.",
      "Momoa specifically recalled a scene where he and Bautista fight in the rain.",
      "\"He was on my chest with his knee, like, just mounted up on me. And he\u2019s just raining down bombs on you,\" he said. \"And I\u2019m just, like, 'Oh my God.'\"",
      "\"I close my eyes. I\u2019m, like, 'Dave, if you f------ hit me, I\u2019m done. Like, this is it,'\" Momoa joked.",

      "\"I get a call from my agents going, 'What the hell you guys doing over there?'\" Momoa laughed, adding that he and Bautista \"got along really well.\"",
      "\"He\u2019s got no ego. He\u2019s just like a teddy bear, super quiet, keeps to himself. And I\u2019m obviously loud, obnoxious. We\u2019re kind of opposite but, like, really blend really well,\" he said. \"So, I was, like, 'Bro, I have this idea.'\"",
      "Momoa, who was born in the Aloha State in 1979, said he's elated to \u201cshow another side of Hawaii\" with \"The Wrecking Crew.\"",
      "\"We played estranged brothers, and when I was pitching it to him, he loved it,\" Momoa said.",
      "\"The Wrecking Crew\" is the latest project in Momoa's repertoire. The \"Road to Paloma\" star is also known for starring in \"Game of Thrones,\" \"Aquaman\" and \"A Minecraft Movie.\""

      "Like their counterparts in the United States and elsewhere, young people in China are increasingly choosing a different path to parenting \u2014 doting on dogs, cats and other cherished creatures instead of children.",
      "The reason is partly economic, as they struggle with slowing growth, an intensely competitive society and the rising cost of living.",
      "But it also reflects changing views of marriage and family as China continues to modernize.",
      "\u201cMany people don\u2019t want to get married now,\u201d said Guo Xinyi, 28, who has a poodle and two cats. \u201cThey just feel pets can bring happiness, while raising a child is exhausting,\u201d she told NBC News last week at a pet grooming shop in Beijing.",
      "It\u2019s a worrisome trend for Chinese officials, who are trying to increase the birth rate as the country faces a demographic crisis that was underscored by last week\u2019s release of government data showing the population had fallen for the fourth year in a row.",
      "This month marks the 10th anniversary of the end of China\u2019s strict one-child policy, which was implemented in 1979 by officials who were concerned the country\u2019s population might grow too large. The policy was further relaxed in 2021 to allow couples to have up to three children amid worries that the long-suppressed birth rate was not keeping up with China\u2019s fast-aging population.",
      "Far from unleashing a frenzy of procreation, the loosening of restrictions has done little to encourage births, with China recording half as many as a decade ago.",
      "China is now the world\u2019s second most populous nation after being overtaken by India in 2023. And its population dropped by 3.39 million last year to 1.405 billion, the National Bureau of Statistics said last week. Births were down 17% to a record-low 7.92 million, compared with 16.55 million in 2015.",

      "Authorities are trying to promote marriage and childbearing through pronatalist policies.",
      "The central government has expanded tax breaks and last year introduced a nationwide child care subsidy, providing families 3,600 yuan (about $500) per year for each child under the age of 3.",
      "Local and provincial governments are also offering their own incentives, such as longer maternity leave.",
      "Officials have also tried the opposite approach, imposing a 13% sales tax on condoms, birth control pills and other contraceptives starting Jan. 1 that is considered more symbolic than effective.",
      "But they face stubborn resistance from young people who see childbearing as an expensive investment and a risk to them as well as their potential offspring.",
      "People of childbearing age, especially women, worry about the impact children could have on their careers, said Yuying Tong, a sociology professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and co-director of its Centre for Chinese Family Studies.",
      "Young people in particular face a persistently high unemployment rate, while those further along in their careers worry about age discrimination in hiring, in what anxious job seekers call \u201cthe curse of 35.\u201d",
      "They also worry about \u201cwhat their children will face in the future\u201d when it comes to competition at school and in the job market, Tong said.",
      "With pets, she said, \u201cthey don\u2019t need to worry about their education, they just need to provide the very basic needs. There\u2019s no competition for pets.\u201d",
      "The number of pets has exploded in China, and they are more likely these days to be treated as beloved family members, a concept that used to be seen as distinctly Western.",
      "According to Goldman Sachs, the number of pets in China already exceeds the number of children 4 and under. By 2030, it said, the country will have almost twice as many pets as toddlers: more than 70 million compared with about 40 million.",
      "That is a reversal from 2017, when China had about 90 million children age 4 and under versus 40 million pets.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s not decided by parents, you know, like before,\u201d He, 50, said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like a traditional China anymore.\u201d",
      "She said that, unlike with children, she felt she had enough time to care for her bulldog, Meiqiu, cooking her food from scratch and buying matching outfits for the two of them to wear \u201clike real parents and kids, you know, like one family.\u201d",

      "BEIJING \u2014 The downfall of China\u2019s top general, second in command and once a close ally of President Xi Jinping, has thrown the leadership of the country\u2019s military into turmoil and raised questions about Taiwan's future.",
      "The Chinese Defense Ministry said in a statement Saturday that Gen. Zhang Youxia, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, which controls the armed forces, was under investigation and accused of serious \u201cviolations of discipline and law.\u201d",
      "Liu Zhenli, another People\u2019s Liberation Army general and a lower member of the commission who was in charge of the Joint Staff Department, was also put under investigation, the ministry said.",
      "The statement gave no details about the allegations or the charges they faced. An editorial Sunday in the Liberation Army Daily newspaper, the mouthpiece of the country\u2019s armed forces, suggested that Zhang, 75, was accused of corruption and possibly disloyalty to Xi.",
      "Zhang and Liu, it said, \u201cseriously trampled on and undermined\u201d the system of responsibility under the military commission\u2019s chairman \u2014 Xi himself. The pair had also \u201cgravely fostered political and corruption problems that weakened the Party\u2019s absolute leadership over the military,\u201d it said, adding that that had \u201ccaused immense harm\u201d to China\u2019s combat readiness.",
      "Asked about Zhang at a regular briefing of reporters in Beijing, a Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson cited unfamiliarity with the matter. The page with Zhang\u2019s biography on the PLA\u2019s official website has been pulled down, suggesting he may have fallen out of favor.",
      "Zhang was previously considered \u201cuntouchable,\u201d according to Alessandro Arduino, an expert in Chinese security at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank.",
      "\u201cThis is a reminder coming directly from President Xi Jinping that political loyalty stands well before combat readiness,\u201d he said in a telephone interview Monday. \u201cPolitical disloyalty is a cardinal sin inside the party. And the message is clear: It\u2019s a political accusation. I think the message is extremely clear: No one is safe.\u201d",
      "Xi could have let Zhang, 75, retire to save face, he said, adding that that was \u201cvery important in China.\u201d Instead, Xi had allowed \u201ca huge political accusation\u201d to be leveled against his longtime ally, Arduino said.",
      "China\u2019s military has undergone a sweeping anti-corruption purge in recent years, in which People\u2019s Liberation Army generals, admirals, government ministers and other officials have been removed from their posts.",
      "Since he came to power in 2012, Xi has launched a variety of anti-corruption drives through various government departments.",
      "More recently the focus has been on the armed forces. In October, the ruling Communist Party expelled He Weidong, the other vice chair of the military commission, and replaced him with commission member Zhang Shengmin. And in 2024, the party expelled two former defense ministers over corruption charges.",
      "But some analysts see the removal of Zhang, a longtime confidant of Xi and a combat veteran of China\u2019s 1979 conflict with Vietnam, as the most significant ouster yet, one that will create a major upheaval at the top of China\u2019s military power structure.",
      "\u201cThis is really almost Shakespearean,\" said Jonathan Czin, a former senior CIA analyst who focused on China and is now a fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank.",
      "He added, \"This is somebody that Xi has had a decadeslong relationship with.\u201d",
      "Of the six generals Xi appointed to the commission in 2022, only one is left, allowing Xi to consolidate power but also heightening the risk of a military miscalculation when it comes to Taiwan, according Steve Tsang, the director of the China Institute at SOAS University of London.",
      "\u201cRemoving generals like Zhang means that there will not be any general who would dare to advise Xi against a military adventure when the time comes, and this increases the risk of a miscalculation,\u201d he said in an email Monday.",
      "Xi has long harbored ambitions of reuniting Taiwan, the self-ruled territory of 23 million people, with China, and his military regularly launches live-fire drills around the island, featuring aircraft and warships.",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Officials in Taipei are closely watching what they have called \u201cabnormal\u201d changes to China\u2019s military leadership and will use a range of methods to decipher Beijing\u2019s intentions, Taiwanese Defense Minister Wellington Koo said Monday.",
      "\u201cXi will not order an invasion unless he is certain of victory, but no general will now dare to advise caution if Xi asks: \u2018Is the PLA now ready to liberate Taiwan for the greater glory of China?\u2019\u201d Tsang said, adding that the world was \u201cless safe\u201d after Zhang\u2019s removal.",
      "Arduino of the Royal United Services Institute echoed that view, saying Zhang was one of the oldest high-ranking commanders who fought in the war against Vietnam, \u201cso he knows very well what it means to wage a war, compared to the majority of the PLA that are just training to be combat ready.\u201d",
      "His successor \u201cwill show what is going to look like a PLA that is first and foremost politically aligned with the party and, by definition, with President Xi himself,\u201d he said.",

While al-Sharaa has vowed to build a more unified and representative Syria, his rule has struggled with deep divisions and deadly sectarian clashes across the country.",

      "Major Western allies chose to skip the ceremony on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, with some voicing concerns that the body, which Trump plans to chair personally, could replace the United Nations.",
      "Trump, who has derided the U.N. for \"empty words\" that \u201cdon\u2019t solve war,\u201d said Thursday that the two bodies will work alongside each other, after having suggested earlier in the week that the board \"might\" replace it.",

      "Trump first proposed the Board of Peace as an entity that would oversee the next phase of his peace plan for the Gaza Strip, but it has since morphed into something with a much broader remit.",
      "In November, the U.N. Security Council approved a Board of Peace as part of a broader plan that included establishing a security force in Gaza.",

    "story": [
      "After nearly four years, the grinding war between Russia and Ukraine is approaching a staggering battlefield toll: nearly half a million dead and 1\u00bd million wounded or missing across both sides.",
      "The steep estimates, presented in a study by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, include 1.2 million Russians dead, wounded or missing, with as many as 325,000 killed since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. Ukraine has suffered somewhere between 500,000 and 600,000 battlefield casualties, including up to 140,000 fatalities, according to the study published Tuesday.",
      "The figures do not include civilian deaths, but the war has taken a growing toll on Ukraine's population, as Russia continues its nearly-daily aerial attacks on Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. The latest such attack involved a Russian drone strike on a passenger train in the northeast of the country, killing at least five people Wednesday.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy denounced the strike as terrorism as he called for increased pressure on Moscow amid peace negotiations with the United States to bring the war to a close. Kyiv has been retaliating with strikes on Russian border regions, where local officials have also reported civilian casualties.",
      "\u201cRussia is paying an extraordinary price for minimal gains and is in decline as a major power,\u201d the authors note in the study, which cites CSIS estimates, British Defense Ministry intelligence, data collected by the Russian news outlet Mediazona and the BBC Russian Service, and interviews with U.S., European, Ukrainian and other government officials.",
      "Christopher Tuck, an expert in conflict and security at King\u2019s College London who was not involved in the study, said the figures were credible and broadly in line with estimates from NATO, Western governments, and media organizations. The findings \"capture the essential reality that this is a war of attrition with staggering human costs,\" he told NBC News by email.",
      "That assessment appears to contradict recent proclamations by Russian President Vladimir Putin that Moscow has the upper hand and its victory is all but inevitable, as months of peace talks pushed by the Trump administration have so far failed to bring a resolution to the conflict.",
      "\u201cRussia's massive losses for tiny gains would normally be seen as a sign of declining military efficiency,\u201d Phillips O\u2019Brien, a professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, said by email. \u201cIt certainly undermines the claims from the Trump administration and others that Russia is some great power marching on to inevitable victory.\u201d",
      "Asked about the report's estimates of Russian casualties during his daily briefing Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told NBC News that such reports should not be seen as reliable.",
      "\u201cWe suggest focusing on the information provided by the Ministry of Defense,\u201d Peskov said.",
      "But the Russian Defense Ministry has not provided any recent estimates of its dead, wounded or missing.",
      "Both Russia and Ukraine generally do not report their casualty numbers, but both sides tend to underestimate their fatalities while saying the other side's losses far exceed their own.",
      "The latest official statements from the Russian side came years ago when then-Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu estimated in the fall of 2022 that Russia had lost nearly 6,000 troops. While Russia sustains losses, Putin said in October, they are \u201cmany times\u201d smaller than those suffered by Ukraine.",
      "Zelenskyy told NBC News last February that 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed and another 380,000 wounded since 2022. Tens of thousands were missing in action or in Russian captivity, he said. On Monday, Zelenskyy said 35,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded in December alone.",
      "The Russian outlet Mediazona, working with the BBC\u2019s Russian service and a team of volunteers, has been compiling a named list of the Russian military fatalities, which currently stands at more than 163,000.",
      "The report calls Russian losses \u201cextraordinary,\u201d adding that \u201cno major power has suffered anywhere near these numbers of casualties or fatalities in any war since World War II.\u201d",
      "The pace of Russia's advance, the report states, has at times been slower than the notoriously bloody Battle of the Somme during  World War I, with troops advancing at an average rate of just 230 feet per day in a push to control the city of Pokrovsk, an important Ukrainian transport and supply hub.",
      "Both Russia and Ukraine have mobilized civilians to serve on the front lines, but Moscow has relied heavily on contracting recruits and former convicts. Ukraine has been suffering from a severe manpower shortage amid draft evasion, despite waves of mobilization and a lowering of the conscription age in 2024.",
      "Trump often cites his own estimates about troop casualties in Ukraine. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week, he said 31,000 soldiers died in the war in December, and 27,000 the month before. He did not specify if it was an estimate provided by his own intelligence or whether it reflects a combined toll for both sides.",
      "Trump consistently says he wants to stop the slaughter and \u201csave lives\u201d in Ukraine. He has been pushing Kyiv to agree to a deal that would see it cede territories it controls in the country\u2019s east. Days after the first trilateral talks between Russia, Ukraine and the U.S. last week, Trump said Tuesday that \u201cvery good things\u201d were happening in negotiations aimed at ending the war, and Russia has confirmed more talks are scheduled for this weekend.",
      "Putin's foreign aide Yuri Ushakov said Wednesday that the Russian leader is ready meet with Zelenskyy in Moscow, which he said was suggested by Trump. \"We will guarantee his safety and the necessary working conditions,\u201d Ushakov told Russian state media."

    "story": [
      "The earliest known hand-held wooden tools, used by our early human ancestors around 430,000 years ago, have been uncovered by researchers at an archeological site in Greece.",
      "One is made from the trunk of an alder tree and could have been used for digging, and the other is a small willow or poplar artifact that may have been used to shape stones, according to a study published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s particularly exciting about finds like this is that we just so rarely have wood preserved for that long,\u201d the study\u2019s lead author, Annemieke Milks, told NBC News by phone Tuesday.",
      "Stone tools have been recovered by archeologists for centuries because they preserve really well, said Milks, a researcher and a leading expert in early wooden tools at the University of Reading in the United Kingdom. \u201cSo it\u2019s really nice to be able to enrich our understanding of human evolution by finding these extremely rare objects,\u201d she added.",
      "Researchers have known that early human ancestors would have been also making use of wood to make tools and now there is evidence of very early use, she added.",
      "The tools were found at a site called the Megalopolis Basin in Marathousa, Greece, about 100 miles southwest of the capital, Athens.",
      "Once a lakeshore, it has provided evidence of other early human ancestor activity, including the making and use of stone and bone artifacts, as well as killing of elephants and other animals, according to researchers.",
      "The smaller tool is particularly interesting, Milks said. \u201cWe have never seen anything like it,\u201d she said, adding that they don't fully understand its function. \u201cIt\u2019s just really different, and it\u2019s tiny. We\u2019re lucky that we found it.\u201d",
      "Researchers know that these artifacts are not just pieces of wood by recognizing \u201cspecific marks made by stone tools on the wood itself,\u201d she said. This \u201chelps us to say, OK, that\u2019s not just a stick, that\u2019s something that humans did something with,\u201d she added.",
      "The methods for analysis and identification of ancient wooden tools have really accelerated in the last decade, providing an unprecedented insight into human history, Milks said.",
      "Direct dating of organic materials, like wood, only goes back to 50,000 years ago, so researchers had to rely on dating sediment and rocks from the site itself. This allowed them to conclude that the tools date back to 430,000 years ago.",
      "It\u2019s likely that the unearthed wooden tools were so well preserved because they were very rapidly buried in sediment that remained wet, and kept away from microorganisms that would eat wood away or rot it, Milks said.",
      "Conditions at the site where the tools were found are \u201cexceptional\u201d and allowed for preservation of delicate organic material, including wood but also seeds and leaves, Katerina Harvati, the study's co-author, said in an email Tuesday.",
      "The discovery highlights the importance of Greece and the Megalopolis Basin in particular for human evolution, said Harvati, a paleoanthropologist and expert in human evolution at the University of T\u00fcbingen in Germany. It provided \u201ca very rare glimpse\u201d into technology used by early human ancestors that researchers know almost nothing about, she said.",
      "\u201cThey not only push back the temporal timeframe of our knowledge on this technology and expand its geographic range, but also provide new information, in the form of a completely new type of tool, which we record here for the first time,\u201d she added.",
      "Maeve McHugh, associate professor in classical archaeology at England\u2019s University of Birmingham who was not involved in the study, told NBC News the findings are significant, providing an important \u201csnapshot\u201d into the early human ancestor activity that speaks to \u201chow our brains were developing\u201d in that time period.",
      "\u201cThe fact that it\u2019s a wooden object, an organic piece of material \u2014 it\u2019s very rare survival outside of very arid conditions like Egypt, and particularly that it\u2019s so old and so really at the beginning of human or early human history, I think it\u2019s very interesting and important,\u201d she said."

      "\u201cFor too long, we in the West have been very predictable, and that has also been easy for someone like Vladimir Putin to then anticipate what our next moves will be,\u201d van Weel, a former assistant secretary general at NATO, said in an interview last week. Trump\u2019s unpredictability, he said, might \u201chelp.\u201d",

      "Beyond Maduro",
      "After American special forces captured Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife, the Kremlin demanded their release and condemned what it said was an unacceptable attack on Venezuela\u2019s sovereignty.",
      "But Venezuela matters to Moscow for reasons that go far beyond Maduro.",
      "For Putin, the relationship has been a way to show that Russia is still a global power, not just a country boxed in by Europe. And under Putin\u2019s rule, Moscow has built deep energy and media ties in Caracas that helped it gain a rare foothold in America\u2019s backyard.",
      "Putin\u2019s aim has been \u201cto get out of this idea that Russia is just a regional power, trying to reinvigorate that kind of global or larger global reach that the Soviet Union had,\u201d said Fiona Hill, a former senior director for Europe and Russia on the National Security Council.",
      "After Russia invaded Ukraine, sanctions pushed Moscow to rely on a rapidly growing \u201cshadow fleet\u201d of tankers to keep its own crude oil exports going.",
      "In recent weeks, U.S. forces have begun seizing vessels tied to that network in and around Venezuela as Washington tightens enforcement.",
      "Iran looms",
      "As the death toll from Iran\u2019s crackdown on nationwide unrest rose past at least 5,000, according to activists, Trump sent what he called an \u201carmada\u201d to the Middle East amid hints the U.S. could go beyond sanctions on the country and is considering strikes.",
      "Trump has been contemplating military action against Tehran after its massive crackdown on opposition to the clerical regime, which killed thousands of activists in the streets.",
      "Trump\u2019s plans on Iran matter to Putin because Tehran and the Kremlin have especially close ties that stretch back to the Soviet era. Iran sends drones to Russia that have been used in the war in Ukraine, while Moscow has supplied Iran with many of the weapons it has used to crush protests.",
      "\u201cPutin has a personal stake in ensuring that Iran does not fall,\u201d said Nicole Grajewski, a scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Paris-based think tank. \u201cIt would have a major impact on Russia.\u201d",
      "\u201cIran for Russia is on its southern periphery,\u201d she said in an interview. Putin deeply dislikes uprisings that overthrow leaders, she added.",

      "That squeezes Moscow, but it also hurts New Delhi.",
      "\u201cPutin probably loves the fact that Indians think of this 25% tariff as a U.S. sanction on India,\u201d said Tanvi Madan of the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think tank. \u201cSo Russia uses this to say: \u2018Look, the U.S. and Europe are not your friends. They are sanctioning you. They are not reliable.\u2019\u201d",
      "Board of Peace",

Putin is not the only autocrat to have been invited to join the organization, which was inaugurated Thursday in the Swiss city of Davos, but he is possibly its most controversial: Britain and France cited his participation in the organization as one of the reasons for not joining last week, among other concerns.",
      "\u201cPutin certainly is not a person to ask any questions about peace,\u201d Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen said in an interview this week.",
      "Aside from invading Ukraine, Putin has crushed free speech and political dissent within Russia. The West, led by the U.S., should be exerting more pressure on Russia, Valtonen said.",

      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "\u201cI am a little bit fearful also of a future in which we try to rehabilitate Russia and Putin to the world community, especially if there were significant trade deals or the lifting of economic sanctions towards Russia, because, unfortunately, Russia\u2019s threat doesn\u2019t begin or it doesn\u2019t end in Ukraine,\u201d she said.",
      "Asked for comment Monday, the White House directed NBC News to an earlier Trump statement about Putin\u2019s joining the board \u201cWe want everybody. We want all nations. We want all nations where people have control, power,\u201d he said at the World Economic Forum in Davos. \u201cThat way we\u2019re not ever going to have a problem.\u201d",
      "But Putin himself may have mixed feelings about Trump\u2019s apparently friendly invitation to join what has been described as an alternative to the United Nations since Russia has a permanent seat on the powerful U.N. Security Council. In contrast, the charter of the Board of Peace spells out that one person is fundamentally in charge: Trump, as chairman with a veto."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Defense Department said in an influential strategy document published Friday that the U.S. military\u2019s top focus is no longer on China but instead the homeland and Western Hemisphere.",
      "The priorities laid out in the 2026 National Defense Strategy, a quadrennial report last published in 2022, diverge significantly from those of the Biden administration, with efforts geared more inward such as securing the border and countering narcotics.",
      "The document says the country is not pursuing an isolationist agenda, but lays out why the U.S. wants allies to do more while the military focuses more on the homeland.",
      "The main focus on the homeland includes a section about the U.S. no longer ceding key terrain in the Western Hemisphere and how the Pentagon will provide President Donald Trump with \u201ccredible options to guarantee U.S. military and commercial access to key terrain from the Arctic to South America, especially Greenland, the Gulf of America, and the Panama Canal.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will ensure that the Monroe Doctrine is upheld in our time,\u201d it adds, referring to the 19th-century foreign policy doctrine that asserts the U.S. sphere of influence extends throughout the Western Hemisphere.",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "The No. 2 priority for the Pentagon is now China, which was characterized in the 2022 report as the most significant strategic competitor to the U.S., due in part to Beijing\u2019s territorial claims in the South China Sea and its aggressive behavior toward U.S. allies.",
      "The new report says the U.S. does not seek to \u201cstrangle or humiliate\u201d China, but rather should deter the country \u201cthrough strength, not confrontation.\u201d It says the Pentagon will \u201cprovide the military strength for President Trump\u2019s visionary and realistic diplomacy, thereby setting conditions for a balance of power in the Indo-Pacific that allows all of us \u2014 the United States, China, and others in the region \u2014 to enjoy a decent peace.\u201d",
      "The Pentagon\u2019s third priority is to increase allies\u2019 burden sharing, including Canada and Mexico in the Western Hemisphere and Europeans on their continent. The fourth priority is rebuilding the defense industrial base.",
      "As the Russia-Ukraine war nears the four-year mark, Moscow gets a relatively brief mention in the report. Russia is described as a \u201cpersistent but manageable threat to NATO\u2019s eastern members for the foreseeable future,\u201d and that the Pentagon will ensure that American forces are prepared to defend against Russian threats \u201cto the U.S. Homeland.\u201d",
      "The report comes as Trump struggles to bring an end to a war he repeatedly said he could end on the first day of his second term, or even before he took office. It also comes on the heels of the arrest of Venezuela\u2019s now-deposed president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, by U.S. forces and Trump\u2019s push to acquire Greenland, though he has said he won\u2019t use force to achieve that goal.",
      "Unlike previous National Defense Strategy reports under Republican and Democratic presidents, the 2026 version is overtly political, with a focus on both President Joe Biden and earlier administrations.",
      "\u201cFor too long, the U.S. Government neglected \u2014 even rejected \u2014 putting Americans and their concrete interests first. Previous administrations squandered our military advantages and the lives, goodwill, and resources of our people in grandiose nation-building projects and self-congratulatory pledges to uphold cloud-castle abstractions like the rules-based international order,\u201d the report says.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump has decisively changed that, courageously putting Americans first to truly make America great once again,\u201d it says. \u201cWe will be the sword and shield to deter war, with the goal of peace \u2014 but ready to fight and win the nation\u2019s necessary wars if called upon.\u201d"
