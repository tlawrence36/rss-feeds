      "Archaeologists at the Colosseum Archaeological Park explained that Roman emperors would use the passage to enter the arena unseen and protected, leading them directly to their reserved honor box overlooking the games.",
      "The passage was named after Emperor Commodus, who lived between 180 and 192 A.D., when it was initially discovered in the 1810s. Commodus was known to be passionate about gladiators\u2019 games and history relates that while he was passing through the tunnel, someone attempted to assassinate him, but was unsuccessful.",

These artistic elements provided a fitting prelude to the brutal entertainments that awaited beyond, they noted.",
      "The corridor is shaped as an \u2019S\u2019 and continues outside the Colosseum arena, but its final destination remains uncertain.",

      "It\u2019s not so often that the font of a movie\u2019s opening credits is, itself, a provocation.",
      "But in Luca Guadagnino \u2019s muddled but darkly absorbing \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d the white Windsor Light Condensed lettering against a black background, with cast in alphabetical order and soft jazz playing, is immediately recognizable as the style of a Woody Allen movie opening.",
      "In the juggling act to follow in \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d where Guadagnino will playfully twirl a twisting narrative of alleged sexual assault, cancel culture, privilege in academia and Gen Z victimization, the credits are not so much an opening salvo than they are an introductory wink.",
      "Like many an Allen film, \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d is set among a well-educated, self-involved class. It takes place around Yale University. But unlike Allen\u2019s anxious, existential, chattering characters, Guadagnino\u2019s cocktail party collection of professors and students is a more scheming and unpleasant lot.",
      "That includes a philosophy professor, Alma Imhoff (Julia Roberts), on the precipice of tenure, her friend and department colleague, Hank Gibson (Andrew Garfield), and Imhoff\u2019s star pupil, a Ph.D. student named Maggie Resnick (Ayo Edebiri), who after a party at Alma\u2019s house accuses Hank of sexual assault.",
      "Guadagnino\u2019s film, shot by Malik Hassan Sayeed, is somberly and flatly lit and rife with reflections. Under these drab surfaces, the central characters of \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d \u2014 an ensemble of singularly charming actors who here have drained away much of their natural charisma \u2014 go at each other on everything from Foucault to feminism in a psychological battle set across a #MeToo minefield.",
      "That, at least, is the promise of \u201cAfter the Hunt.\u201d But Guadagnino\u2019s dour and languid film, scripted by Nora Garrett, only fitfully coheres as the conversation piece it aspires to be. Its plot turns can be rash or implausible, and the movie increasingly feels like ideas and set pieces strung tenuously together.",
      "Yet I also enjoyed the prickliness of \u201cAfter the Hunt.\u201d Though there\u2019s a strong anti-woke vein to it, Guadagnino\u2019s film is more about how seemingly quite different generations have much more in common than they might appear. The cultural debates depicted in the movie are often so colored by moralistic superiority, but that\u2019s not the case here. Everyone is kind of rotten in \u201cAfter the Hunt.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s especially unusual for Roberts, whose Alma is far more complicated a character than she normally tackles. Alma is esteemed, fiercely intelligent, ambitious and hard to read. Her husband, a psychiatrist named Frederik (a fabulous Michael Stuhlbarg as combustible cocktail of cuckold and cook) worships her, but her affection is less evident.",

      "\u201cWhen did offending someone become a cardinal sin?\u201d Hank asks at the party that opens the movie.",
      "A sign of what Guadagnino might be up to comes not long after, after Maggie has alleged the assault. Alma goes to meet a distraught Hank at a local restaurant. While they hash out what\u2019s true and what\u2019s fiction in Maggie\u2019s account, it\u2019s hard not to notice the mirrors that surround Hank.",
      "The real mirror of \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d is Alma and Maggie. Edebiri is here a kind of stand-in for Gen Z, and her case expands to include a wider range of issues of inclusivity and othering. As things spiral and Maggie\u2019s case leads to increasing intensity on campus and in Alma\u2019s personal life, Alma shifts from Maggie\u2019s mentor to something more like a foe. But Alma\u2019s own past begins to play a role in the fallout, adding a new frame to \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d that casts Alma and Maggie\u2019s plights in a different light.",
      "Is this a good time? Not especially, though Garfield is great in a rage. Glib insertions don\u2019t help. In one scene, when Alma meets a fellow faculty member (Chlo\u00eb Sevigny) in a bar, a Smiths song plays and she seems surprised a Morrissey tune isn\u2019t outlawed.",
      "I'm not sure \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d has too much more to say than that shrug-of-the-shoulders scene. But \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d deserves credit not so much more wading into these hot-button topics, but for trying to find its own way through them. It's not a #MeToo procedural but more like a tragedy. When \u201coptics over substance\u201d governs all, as one character laments, no one lives happily ever after.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny's music catalog has seen a jump in streams since his 2026 Super Bowl halftime performance was announced.",
      "According to Luminate, an industry data and analytics company, Latin music is primarily consumed via streaming. They found that Bad Bunny saw a 26% increase in on-demand streams in the United States following the Sept. 28 announcement, soaring from 173 million nine days before the announcement to 218.5 million streams in the eight days that followed.",
      "The singer born Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio recently said concerns about the mass deportation of Latinos played into his decision to bypass the mainland U.S. during his residency. He performs in Spanish and will do so at the Super Bowl, further proving that connecting with a U.S. and international audience does not require singing in English.",
      "Since the NFL, Apple Music and Roc Nation announced Bad Bunny will lead the halftime festivities from Levi\u2019s Stadium on Feb. 8 in Santa Clara, California, the selection has provoked conversation.",
      "For his fans, Bad Bunny's booking at the Super Bowl is viewed as a landmark moment for Latino culture.

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Tenor Rolando Villaz\u00f3n was singing the title role in Massenet's \u201cWerther\u201d in 2006 at Nice, France, when he started thinking about how he would direct the opera.",
      "\u201cI said, \u2018oh, this last act is very difficult. He shot himself and keeps singing for 40 minutes.' And so, what would I do?\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd I started inventing, creating for fun a staging.\u201d",
      "Nearly two decades later, Villaz\u00f3n is making his Metropolitan Opera directing debut in Bellini's \u201cLa Sonnambula,\u201d which opened Monday night with a standout cast of Nadine Sierra, Xabier Anduaga and Alexander Vinogradov.",
      "\u201cHe is very sensitive to singers,\u201d Sierra said. \u201cMaybe some directors, because they\u2019re not singers or they were never singers, it\u2019s hard for them to really relate to the psychological struggle that some singers, we deal with on stage. We want to make our characters as believable as humanly possible through the actions that we show, but sometimes it\u2019s hard to do that because you also have to sing high notes.\u201d",
      "Villaz\u00f3n grew up in Mexico City, won Pl\u00e1cido Domingo\u2019s Operalia competition in 1999 and made his European debut that year in Massenet\u2019s \u201cManon\u201d at Genoa, Italy. He debuted at the Met in Verdi\u2019s \u201cLa Traviata\u201d in 2003 and gained wide renown when he sang Alfredo with Anna Netrebko\u2019s Violetta in Willy Decker\u2019s austere staging at the 2005 Salzburg Festival.",
      "Vocal problems developed in 2007, causing Villaz\u00f3n to cancel his schedule, and he had surgery in 2009 to remove a cyst from his vocal cords. He developed performance anxiety around 2015 and had another operation in 2018 to relieve acid reflux.",
      "\u201cTwo things coincided when I stopped singing for a year in 2009 \u2014 and that was I wrote my first novel and I prepared my staging, but both didn\u2019t happen because I was resting,\u201d he said. \u201cWould I have finished my novel? I don\u2019t know. But stage direction for sure that would have happened.\u201d",
      "When Villaz\u00f3n conceived his \u201cWerther\u201d staging, he shared it with Alain Lanceron, then head of the tenor's record label, Virgin Classics. Richard Jones, a director Villaz\u00f3n had worked with, helped him find a theater. After being turned down in Berlin, Villaz\u00f3n won over Serge Dorny, then general director in Lyon and now head of the Bavarian State Op\u00e9ra.",
      "Villaz\u00f3n's \u201cWerther\u201d debuted in 2011, and he directed Donizetti\u2019s \u201cL\u2019Elisir d\u2019Amore\u201d the following year at Baden-Baden, Germany, while also singing Nemorino.",
      "He has gone on to direct Verdi\u2019s \u201cLa Traviata,\u201d Donizetti\u2019s \u201cDon Pasquale,\u201d Strauss\u2019s \u201cDie Fledermaus,\u201d Rameau\u2019s \u201cPlat\u00e9e,\u201d Bellini\u2019s \u201cI Puritani\u201d and Rossini\u2019s \u201cIl Barbiere di Siviglia,\u201d and has upcoming productions of Mozart\u2019s \u201c Die Zauberfl\u00f6te\u201d and Rossini\u2019s \u201cL\u2019Italiana in Algeri.\u201d",

      "Filmmaker Derek Cianfrance goes to extreme lengths to make immersive environments for his actors",
      "TORONTO -- TORONTO (AP) \u2014 The lengths writer-director Derek Cianfrance goes to create immersive environments for his actors has grown into a kind of legend. After making the much-improvised doomed romance of \u201cBlue Valentine\u201d (2010), Michelle Williams said she would have to remind herself that she was never, actually, married to Ryan Gosling.",
      "Cianfrance\u2019s last feature, 2016\u2019s \u201cThe Light Between the Oceans,\u201d was shot almost entirely at a remote New Zealand lighthouse. The making of that film did lead together its stars, Michael Fassbender and Alicia Vikander. So did Cianfrance\u2019s \u201cThe Place Beyond the Pines,\u201d with Gosling and Eva Mendes. Method filmmaking can produce real-life results.",
      "But Cianfrance\u2019s ways are for a purpose. He wants his actors, as much as possible, to live in a movie. For his latest film, \u201cRoofman,\u201d starring Channing Tatum and Kirsten Dunst, that approach was especially important because the story was so far-fetched.",
      "\u201cI wanted to immerse the entire cast in this story because it\u2019s a crazy story,\u201d Cianfrance said in an interview. \u201cJeff\u2019s actions are kind of unbelievable. I felt like just for me, to have my suspension of disbelief, I needed to be down there. I think that\u2019s why I do a lot of this immersion because I need to believe it. I need to believe it\u2019s actually happening.\u201d",
      "In \u201cRoofman,\u201d which Paramount Pictures releases Friday in theaters, Tatum plays Jeffrey Manchester, a U.S. Army veteran who found civilian life difficult. In 1998, he began robbing McDonald\u2019s by sawing through roofs. He\u2019s believed to have robbed more than 40 stores. Both his novel entry point, and his reported cordial manner with employees, made the \u201cRoofman\u201d an intriguing figure on the local TV news.",
      "In 2000, Manchester was caught in North Carolina and was later sentenced to 45 years in prison. But in 2004, he escaped and, to elude the authorities, hid out in a Charlotte Toys \u201cR\u201d Us. He clandestinely lived there for months, eating what was on the shelves, and, most audaciously, trying to live a seemingly normal life outside the store. He attended a local church and dated a woman named Leigh Wainscott (played by Dunst).",
      "Mostly, the events of \u201cRoofman\u201d happened as they\u2019re portrayed. But how do you make a stranger-than-fiction tale believable? For the filmmakers of \u201cRoofman,\u201d it meant going to some extreme lengths to give real-life authenticity to a made-for-Hollywood story. At a time when major studios seldom release star-led original films at all, let alone fiercely realistic ones shot on location, \u201cRoofman\u201d \u2014 a modest sized production cobbled together with an assortment of companies, including Miramax, FilmNation and Limelight \u2014 effectively tunneled its way to the big screen.",
      "\u201cI had many producers tell me: Why don\u2019t you shoot this in South Africa? You\u2019ll have double the amount of days,\u201d Cianfrance says, referencing the appeal of tax credits. \u201cI said, \u2018Well, because the people aren\u2019t there, and the ghosts of this story aren\u2019t there.\u2019\u201d",
      "Cianfrance wanted to shoot in the Toys \u201cR\u201d Us where Manchester hid out, but he couldn\u2019t. The toy chain went bankrupt in 2017, and the one where Manchester camped out in is now a mega church. So, he turned an abandoned Toys \u201cR\u201d Us in Pineville, North Carolina, into a nearly fully operational one. The production redid the electricity, added plumbing, installed new fluorescent lighting and stocked 40,000 square feet of shelves with truckloads of period-appropriate toys.",
      "\u201cThat was my \u2018Fitzcarraldo,\u2019 bringing the steam ship over the mountain, building that Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us,\u201d Cianfrance says, chuckling.",
      "That gave Tatum, whom Cianfrance had initially sought for \u201cBlue Valentine,\u201d a box store sandbox in which to play. The biggest gift Cianfrance could give to Tatum, he felt, was \u201cto unleash him in a toy store.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was 360, all around,\u201d says Tatum, speaking alongside Dunst. \u201cIt\u2019s not like this is a giant budget movie. It involved, like: \u2018There\u2019s not even enough toys from this era in the world to fill this place.\u2019 And Derek kept going. \u2018I promised Chan that he would have a fully working store where he could do whatever he wanted.\u2019 He put it on me!\u201d",
      "Dunst was particularly drawn to Cianfrance\u2019s process. \u201cThe kind of acting that Derek likes,\u201d Dunst says, \u201cis the kind of acting that I like: when it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s acting.\u201d",

      "Yet much of the most extensive work to give \u201cRoofman\u201d veracity was below the surface. Manchester is currently serving out his sentence at Central Prison in Raleigh, North Carolina. He can only make outgoing calls, but Cianfrance estimates that he spoke to him more than a hundred times. That gave Cianfrance an understanding of Manchester\u2019s motives and mistakes and turned \u201cRoofman\u201d into a comic but tender examination of misguided materialism.",
      "\u201cJeff wrote a crazy movie for himself, and he lived it,\u201d Cianfrance says. \u201cWhat made me ultimately understand what the movie was that Jeff \u2014 he was just trying to figure out how to be a dad. He was doing it all for family.\u201d",

Manchester, among other things, expressed his approval of the movie poster, featuring Tatum with a stuffed bear on his shoulders, a floaty around his waist and a gun in his right hand. Tatum says they bonded talking about their children and their hopes for the future. Manchester is scheduled to be released in 2036.",
      "\u201cI got more than I could possibly convey. I just found myself being held almost by him, taken care of,\u201d Tatum says. \u201cI didn\u2019t grow up bad.

Jeff did tell me, \u2018I got greedy.\u2019\u201d",
      "As he prepped the movie, Cianfrance interviewed everyone he could who was associated with Manchester\u2019s escape. Usually, he gave them parts. Wainscott plays a crossing guard in the film.

      "Julia Roberts, Andrew Garfield and Ayo Edebiri did not expect some of the discourse around \u201cAfter the Hunt.\u201d",
      "VENICE, Italy -- VENICE, Italy (AP) \u2014 Andrew Garfield would like everyone to know about his gesticulating. Not in his performance as a Yale philosophy professor accused of sexual misconduct in \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d but while discussing an actor\u2019s responsibility to comment on the work they\u2019re putting out in the world.",
      "It\u2019s a blue-sky day outside the luxurious Hotel Cipriani and Garfield is seated alongside his co-stars Julia Roberts and Ayo Edebiri discussing a film that has, for better or worse, become the topic of some spirited debates. Just a few days prior at the Venice Film Festival, journalists at a press conference asked Roberts and filmmaker Luca Guadagnino if the film undermines the feminist movement.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the actor\u2019s responsibility at all to express anything in public. Ever,\u201d Garfield said, using his hands for extra emphasis. \u201cPlease, tell them about the gesticulation.\u201d",
      "Roberts chimed in: \u201cThe hair as well.\u201d (It was bouncing).",
      "With \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d in theaters Friday, Guadagnino and his actors knew they were making something thorny, something challenging, about messy, imperfect people whose lives, and lies, are upended with the accusation. They were ready to own the decision to use a typeface in the opening credits made famous by Woody Allen. But they had not anticipated the anti-feminist question, which was perhaps less a question than an accusation.",
      "\u201cThis question was so tone deaf to the movie itself,\u201d Guadagnino said. \u201cLike, you\u2019ve mistaken the subject with the object.\u201d",
      "The film is an ensemble piece about a few characters in and around Yale whose heady philosophical chats about agency and power become less theoretical under the glare of sticky real life dramas. Roberts plays Alma, a revered professor up for tenure alongside her colleague and flirty drinking buddy Hank (Garfield). Edebiri is a student named Maggie, a child of billionaires who everyone says is brilliant and who is a little obsessed with Alma.",
      "After a boozy party at Alma\u2019s, Maggie comes to Alma first to tell her that Hank crossed the line. Hank denies anything happened and claims that Maggie is retaliating because he accused her of plagiarizing her thesis. No one knows quite who to believe. Alma, too, is harboring her own secrets. And everything in their world unravels in spectacularly melodramatic fashion.",
      "The screenplay comes from Nora Garrett, who was working as a data analyst at Meta before her script caught the attention of Guadagnino and Roberts, in quick succession.",
      "\u201cThe story really started with the character of Alma,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cI was really interested in this idea of a woman who had a lie or something that she was deeply ashamed of at the core of her being.\u201d",
      "But Alma's controlled compartmentalization of her past starts to unspool with Maggie's accusation. The part allows Roberts to do some of her best work in years.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m saying something that might sound obvious, but she\u2019s one of the greatest stars and one of the great actresses,\u201d Guadagnino said. \u201cThe symbol, the beauty of the symbol, and at the same time the truth of the performance. She\u2019s so three-dimensional.\u201d",
      "Roberts was particularly fascinated by Alma\u2019s relationship with her husband, Frederik, a shrink played by Guadagnino regular Michael Stuhlbarg, whose unexpected choices had her in awe.",
      "\u201cI did catch myself watching him a couple of times instead of being in the scene and I was just like, \u2018Wow, that\u2019s so (expletive) good,\u2019\u201d Roberts said. \u201cAnd then I think, \u2018Oh, I have a line.\u2019\u201d",

Garfield, who Guadagnino has been trying to work with for almost 20 years, had to do one of his most emotional scenes on his first day.

      "\u201cI was really struggling to transition,\u201d Garfield said. \u201cI wanted to make sure I came in as full and hot as possible.

      "\u201cI thought a lot about films that have been able to resist the pressure of time and to become some insightful classics,\u201d Guadagnino said.",
      "Perhaps the most inscrutable of the bunch is Maggie. Even Edebiri said she had some trouble wrapping her head around her motivations and actions.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s a tricky girl,\u201d Edebiri said. \u201cA word Luca kept using a lot in conversations was displacement. Maggie\u2019s such a displaced person psychologically, but also as a transracial adoptee, and occupying this space full of these professors who are performing.\u201d",
      "But the point for all are the questions, not the answers, and \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d is not a film that wraps anything up in a tidy morality. Those conversations are for the audience to have.",
      "\u201cThere are very few filmmakers who are alive for whom the priority is radical, vulnerable, unbridled self-expression and exploration and curiosity rather than something didactic,\u201d Garfield said. \u201cThe conversation is the thing, I think, that\u2019s the most we can ever dream of, that people will be confronted by their own response. The film hopefully is a mirror for every person watching, and then they can compare reflections with each other.\"",

      "Taylor Swift's new film, \u201cThe Official Release Party of a Show Girl,\u201d has topped the weekend box office with $33 million in North America",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 This weekend\u2019s box office belonged to two undeniable draws: Taylor Swift and Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson.",
      "It might have looked like a heavyweight matchup, but Swift\u2019s devoted fanbase once again proved unstoppable with her film \u201cThe Official Release Party of a Show Girl,\u201d which debuted at No. 1 with $33 million in North America, according to Sunday estimates from Comscore. The AMC Theatres release -- announced only two weeks ago with minimal promotion -- served as a companion piece to Swift\u2019s 12th studio album, packaging music videos, behind-the-scenes footage and profanity-free lyric visuals into an 89-minute experience.",
      "The film played at all 540 AMC theaters in the U.S. for three days, ending after Sunday. AMC aired the show in Mexico, Canada and across Europe.",
      "\u201cFor Taylor Swift to harness the power of the movie theater to build her brand, create excitement among her fans, and create a communal experience outside of her touring, outside of her live performances, is really a stroke of genius,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cTo be able to add another $33 million to the box office bottom line is much welcomed by theater owners who were looking for content for their big screens.\u201d",
      "It comes nearly two years after her \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d concert film opened to $96 million, with Swift extending her streak of box office dominance.",
      "Meanwhile, Johnson saw a more modest showing. His A24 drama \u201cThe Smashing Machine,\u201d co-starring Emily Blunt, opened in third place with a mere $6 million, trailing Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d which earned $11.1 million and has now accumulated $107 million globally.",
      "Despite strong reviews and a 15-minute standing ovation at the Venice Film Festival -- where Johnson drew praise for portraying MMA legend Mark Kerr \u2014 the film marked one of the lowest openings as a lead.",
      "\u201cWhen major movie stars branch out into more indie roles, like Tom Cruise in \u201dMagnolia,\" they're trying to redefine their career,\" Dergarabedian said. \u201cThey can straddle both universes, so Dwayne Johnson and all the acclaim he\u2019s getting. That prestige factor. That\u2019s the currency. He knows box office. He studies this and he's a business person.

The legislation requires the state\u2019s Department of Public Health to adopt rules by mid-2028 defining \u201cultraprocessed foods of concern\u201d and \u201crestricted school foods.\u201d",
      "Schools have to start phasing out those foods by July 2029, and districts will be barred from selling them for breakfast or lunch by July 2035. Vendors will be banned from providing the \u201cfoods of concern\u201d to schools by 2032.",
      "Newsom, flanked by first partner Jennifer Siebel Newsom and state lawmakers, signed the measure at a middle school in Los Angeles.",

      "Legislatures across the country have introduced more than 100 bills in recent months seeking to ban or require labeling of chemicals that make up many ultraprocessed foods, including artificial dyes and controversial additives.",
      "Americans get more than half their calories from ultraprocessed foods, which have been linked to a host of health problems, including obesity, diabetes and heart disease. However, studies haven\u2019t been able to prove that the foods directly cause those chronic health problems.",
      "Defining ultraprocessed foods has been tricky. The most common definition is based on the four-tier Nova system developed by Brazilian researchers that classifies foods according to the amount of processing they undergo.",

      "But some highly processed foods \u2013\u2014 think tofu, certain types of whole-grain bread and infant formula \u2013 can be healthful. And it\u2019s not clear whether it\u2019s the processing of the foods or the combination of nutrients such as sugar, fat and salt that leads to poor health outcomes.",
      "U.S. health officials recently launched an effort to come up with a federal definition of ultraprocessed foods, saying there are concerns over whether current definitions \u201caccurately capture\u201d the range of foods that may affect health.",

      "It\u2019s a conservation headache for the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), which is tasked with keeping people who share space with wildlife safe, while protecting the wildlife as well \u2014 especially endangered species. KWS estimates that \u201cjust over 2,000\u201d lions remain in Kenya.",

With those areas fast turning into residential and industrial developments, Kenya\u2019s State Department for Wildlife announced a nearly $5 billion plan to create a migratory corridor between Nairobi and conservancies to the south.

The second looked as if she was going to pass behind the car, but was distracted by the glint of a seatbelt buckle, which my daughter was absentmindedly playing with. The lioness stopped, turned to stare, then wandered up to us. Stretching her head up towards my child, she sniffed the buckle before taking it between her teeth. My daughter sat stiff, perhaps ten inches from the lioness\u2019s head, which suddenly seemed impossibly huge.",

      "\u201cI reached for the maize flour and saw Simon\u2019s head. It was separated from his body. I reached for the head and saw a hand, then a leg inside a gumboot,\u201d Daniel remembers. Horrified, he called me. As we started on the grisly task of trying to find Simon\u2019s remains, we were pushed back by a warning growl. It was a male lion, still guarding the kill.",
      "At this point, Simon had been missing for 2 1/2 days. No one knows whether the lion that was with him by the time we found him was responsible for his death. Lions who kill humans \u2013 the notorious man-eaters \u2013 are shot to avoid recurrence, and KWS claim to have shot the lioness that killed Peace Mwende the night of that attack.",
      "Although human-wildlife conflict has existed for as long as humans have, predator attacks are likely to rise as space for Kenya\u2019s lions shrinks and their hunting opportunities diminish. This can only spell doom for Nairobi\u2019s world-famous national park, which some already want to see turned into housing developments.",
      "I mourn Simon like the friends and colleagues who died on assignment in Sierra Leone and Afghanistan. Every lion sighting also still fills me with joy and wonder, in spite of the horrors of that day in 2019. I hope solutions can be found to keep both people and lion populations safe, and that this remarkable wilderness that makes Nairobi such a unique capital city survives for the joy and wonder of many others.",

He is set to die by lethal injection nearly a year to the day after a group of Texas lawmakers, who say he is innocent, secured an extraordinary last-minute court reprieve as Roberson waited outside the death chamber in Huntsville.",
      "Roberson said he was placing his hopes for another execution stay in the hands of his lawyers, his supporters and God.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to stress out and stuff because I know God has it, you know. He\u2019s in control. No matter what, God\u2019s in control, you know, and he does have the last say, you know,\u201d Roberson, 58, told The Associated Press last week as he sat behind a glass partition in the visiting area of the Polunsky Unit in Livingston, where Texas' male death row inmates are housed.",
      "During an hourlong interview, Roberson said he thinks about his daughter every day and what kind of life she would have today.",
      "Prosecutors at Roberson\u2019s 2003 trial argued he hit his daughter and violently shook her, causing severe head trauma and that she died from injuries related to shaken baby syndrome. Roberson\u2019s lawyers and some medical experts say his daughter died not from abuse but from complications related to pneumonia. They say his conviction was based on flawed and now outdated scientific evidence.",
      "The diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome refers to a serious brain injury caused when a child\u2019s head is hurt through shaking or some other violent impact, like being slammed against a wall or thrown on the floor.",
      "Roberson\u2019s attorneys have argued his undiagnosed autism helped convict him as authorities and medical personnel felt he didn\u2019t act like a concerned parent because his flat affect was seen as a sign of guilt.",
      "Last year, Roberson was on the verge of being put to death when a flurry of last-minute legal maneuvering on the night of his scheduled execution, including an unprecedented intervention by a bipartisan group of Texas lawmakers, stayed his lethal injection. In July, a judge set the new execution date, Roberson's third.",
      "During his interview with the AP, Roberson often would not keep eye contact and would repeat words or phrases \u2014 behaviors that experts say are associated with autism.",
      "\u201cThey assumed (guilt) because of the way I was acting, you know. And I didn\u2019t know I was autistic, you know, until years and years later, you know,\u201d said Roberson, who wasn\u2019t diagnosed with autism until 2018.",
      "Roberson\u2019s supporters and his legal team are again holding rallies and asking state and federal appeals courts and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to halt his execution. His supporters include both liberal and ultraconservative lawmakers, Texas GOP megadonor and conservative activist Doug Deason, bestselling author John Grisham and Brian Wharton, the former police detective who helped put together the case against him.",
      "\u201cThe whole world is watching. Texas, do not kill this innocent man,\u201d Wharton said during a rally Saturday outside the Texas Capitol building in Austin.",
      "The office of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, as well as some medical experts and other family members of Nikki, maintain the girl died because of child abuse and that Roberson had a history of hitting his daughter.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time coming. \u2026 In my opinion he did it, 100%,\u201d Matthew Bowman, Nikki's half brother, told reporters in July. Bowman declined to speak with the AP.",
      "Abbott's office did not immediately reply to emails seeking comment. Abbott has the power to grant a one-time 30-day reprieve.",

      "Shaken baby syndrome has come under scrutiny in recent years as some lawyers and medical experts have argued the diagnosis has wrongly sent people to prison. Prosecutors and medical societies say it remains valid.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s no longer a mystery what happened to Nikki. It was not shaking. It was her chronic, serious health conditions,\" Gretchen Sween, one of Roberson\u2019s lawyers, said at Saturday\u2019s rally. \"A crime didn\u2019t occur.\u201d",
      "But in a Sept. 26 op-ed in The Dallas Morning News, three pediatricians, including two with the Yale School of Medicine, said they reviewed the case and \u201care convinced that Nikki was a victim of child abuse.\u201d",
      "Roberson was arrested after he took Nikki to a hospital when she became unresponsive following a fall off their bed. He said he had never heard of shaken baby syndrome.",
      "\u201cIt was bad enough losing my little girl. And then when they accused me of it, I couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Roberson said.",

      "Yet one of the jurors who convicted Roberson, Terre Compton, told lawmakers last year that, \u201ceverything that was presented to us was all about shaken baby syndrome. That is what our decision was based on.\u201d",
      "Grisham, who is writing a book about the case, said Roberson's trial \u201cwas grossly unfair\u201d because his autism contributed to people believing he was guilty and his defense lawyers told jurors it was a case of shaken baby syndrome.",
      "Roberson said he remains optimistic he will one day get a chance to prove his innocence with a new trial.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not scared to die, but I\u2019m not ready to die, you know. I would like to believe God has more for me to do and stuff, you know,\u201d Roberson said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Democrats believe health care is an issue that resonates with a majority of Americans as they demand an extension of subsidies in exchange for their votes to reopen the shuttered U.S. government. But it is also one of the most intractable issues in Congress \u2014 and a real compromise amid the government shutdown will not likely be easy, or quick.",
      "There are some Republicans in Congress who want to extend the higher subsidies, which were first put in place in 2021 amid the COVID-19 pandemic, as millions of people who receive their insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces are set to receive notices that their premiums will increase at the beginning of the year. But many GOP lawmakers are strongly opposed to any extension \u2014 and see the debate as a new opportunity to cut back on the program altogether.",
      "\u201cIf Republicans govern by poll and fail to grab this moment, they will own it,\u201d wrote Texas Rep. Chip Roy, a Republican, in a letter published in the The Wall Street Journal over the weekend. He encouraged senators not to go \u201cwobbly\u201d on the issue.",
      "\u201cThe jig is up, the pandemic is over and my colleagues shouldn\u2019t blink in any other direction,\u201d Roy wrote.",

But while they have been able to chip away at it, they have not been able to substantially alter it as a record 24 million people are now signed up for insurance coverage through the ACA, in large part because billions of dollars in subsidies have made the plans more affordable for many people.",
      "Now, some of them see the Democrats\u2019 fight as their chance to revisit the issue \u2014 putting Republican congressional leaders and President Donald Trump in a complicated position as the government shutdown enters its seventh day and hundreds of thousands of federal workers are going unpaid.",
      "\u201cI am happy to work with Democrats on their Failed Healthcare Policies, or anything else, but first they must allow our Government to reopen,\u201d Trump wrote on social media Monday night, walking back earlier comments saying there were ongoing negotiations with Democrats.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has repeatedly indicated that Republicans are open to extending the subsidies, with reforms, if Democrats would reopen the government.

Kaley Chiles, with support from President Donald Trump's Republican administration, argues the law violates her freedom of speech by barring her from offering voluntary, faith-based therapy for kids.",

      "The arguments come months after the Supreme Court's conservative majority found states can ban transition-related health care for transgender youths, a setback for LGBTQ rights. The justices are also expected to hear a case about sports participation by transgender players this term.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has adopted recommendations by a new group of vaccine advisers, and stopped recommending COVID-19 shots for anyone \u2014 leaving the choice up to patients.",
      "The government health agency on Monday announced it has adopted recommendations made last month by advisers picked by U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Before this year, U.S. health officials \u2014 following recommendations by infectious disease experts \u2014 recommended annual COVID-19 boosters for all Americans ages 6 months and older. The idea was to update protection against the coronavirus as it continues to evolve.",
      "As the COVID-19 pandemic waned, experts increasingly discussed the possibility of focusing vaccination efforts on people 65 and older \u2014 who are among those most at risk for death and hospitalization.",
      "But Kennedy, who has questioned the safety of COVID-19 vaccines, abruptly announced in May that COVID-19 vaccines were no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women. He also dismissed the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and replaced them with a handpicked group.",
      "The new group voted last month to say all Americans should make their own decisions. But the CDC also says vaccine decisions, especially for seniors, should involve checking with a doctor, nurse or pharmacist.",
      "The recommendation was endorsed by Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services Jim O'Neill, who is serving as the CDC\u2019s acting director. O\u2019Neill signed off on it last week, but HHS officials announced it Monday.",
      "The panel also urged the CDC to adopt stronger language around claims of vaccine risks, despite pushback from outside medical groups who said the shots had a proven safety record from the billions of doses administered worldwide.",
      "In a statement Monday, O\u2019Neill celebrated the change, saying past guidance \"deterred health care providers from talking about the risks and benefits of vaccination.\u201d",
      "\u201cInformed consent is back,\u201d O'Neill said in a statement some doctors objected to.",
      "Doctors routinely discuss vaccines with patients and parents, and share printed information about the risks and benefits of each shot, said Dr. Jesse Hackell, a retired New York physician who has coauthored several American Academy of Pediatrics policy statements on vaccinations.",

      "There is a single shot that contains all four, but it carries a higher risk of fevers and fever-related seizures. Since 2009, the CDC had said it prefers separate shots for initial doses of those vaccines and 85% of toddlers already get the chickenpox vaccine separately.",

      "Experts say a food aid program that helps 6 million low-income mothers and young children will run out of federal money unless the government shutdown ends within two weeks",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A food aid program that helps more than 6 million low-income mothers and young children will run out of federal money within two weeks unless the government shutdown ends, forcing states to use their own money to keep it afloat or risk it shutting down, experts say.",
      "The $8 billion Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, also known as WIC, provides vouchers to buy infant formula as well as fresh fruits and vegetables, low-fat milk and other healthy staples that are often out of financial reach for low-income households.",
      "The shutdown, which began Wednesday, coincided with the beginning of a new fiscal year, meaning programs like WIC, which rely on annual infusions from the federal government, are nearly out of money. Currently, the program is being kept afloat by an $150 million contingency fund, but experts say it could run dry quickly.",
      "After that, states could step in to pay for the program and seek reimbursement when a budget finally passes, but not all states say they can afford to do so.",
      "\u201cWe feel good about one to two weeks,\u201d said Ali Hard, policy director for the National WIC Association. \u201cAfter that, we are very worried.\u201d",
      "Taylor Moyer, a mother of three who recently separated from her husband, has been receiving WIC since her first son was born nine years ago. She said the program allowed her to feed her children nutritious food that tends to be pricier than calorie-dense, processed options. It also provided guidance when she struggled to breastfeed and counseled her on how to handle her son's picky eating stage.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been times where I have sat back in my house and really wondered how I was going to feed my family,\u201d said Moyer, who works at the LGBT Life Center in Virginia Beach, Virginia. \u201cAnd I went to the store with my WIC card ... I get rice, I got avocados, I got eggs, and I made a balanced meal that was actually good.\u201d",
      "The shutdown came as Democrats and Republicans failed to pass a new spending plan. Democratic lawmakers want to extend tax credits that make health care cheaper for millions of Americans, and they want to reverse deep cuts to Medicaid that were passed earlier this year. They refused to sign on to any spending plan that did not include those provisions.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, blamed Democrats for the shutdown and called them hypocritical because failing to fund the federal government endangers so many health programs.",
      "The WIC program, which has long had bipartisan support, aids those who are pregnant, mothers and children under age 5. Research has tied it to lower infant mortality, healthier birth weights, higher immunization rates and better academic outcomes for children who participate. Nearly half of those who are eligible don't enroll, often because they believe they don't qualify or they can't reach a WIC office.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers want to cut WIC, which is targeted for elimination in Project 2025, the influential policy blueprint authored by the man who's now President Donald Trump\u2019s budget chief. Trump\u2019s budget request and the spending plan backed by House Republicans would not fully fund the program. They also want to cut funding for families to buy fresh fruits and vegetables.",
      "In the event of an extended shutdown, several states have sought to reassure WIC recipients that they will continue to receive benefits. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat, said the state will pick up the tab if federal funding runs out.",

      "Couples should never go to bed angry, right",
      "It\u2019s late at night, and you have been stewing all day about something your partner did to annoy you. The time to resolve it is now because, as everyone knows, you should never go to bed angry, right?",
      "Though it\u2019s conventional wisdom, many relationship experts say sticking to such a rule is counterproductive. It may even harm the relationship.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s completely wrong,\u201d said Samantha Whiten, a clinical psychologist in Maryland. \u201cAll it does is make sure that people are fighting when they\u2019re tired.\u201d",
      "Instead, couples can learn habits that help them get rest while boosting the relationship long term.",
      "It\u2019s understandable to want to discuss a problem before letting it fester, Whiten said, but it\u2019s unrealistic to expect conflicts to be wrapped up quickly and lovingly before drifting off to sleep.",
      "\u201cThat sounds nice,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s like a fairy tale, though.\u201d",
      "Some sources attribute the origin of the phrase to the New Testament book of Ephesians. Translations vary, but it\u2019s some version of: \u201cBe angry but do not sin; do not let the sun set on your anger.\u201d",
      "The trouble is, couples shouldn\u2019t fight when they are \u201cemotionally dysregulated,\u201d Whiten said. She referred to the acronym HALT, a common reminder in therapy that people should avoid serious discussions when hungry, angry, lonely or tired. Many people also drink alcohol at night, which doesn\u2019t help create a calm environment.",
      "\u201cThey are more likely to say and do things impulsively that they may regret,\u201d she said.",
      "Discussing problems at night might seem easiest because it's when your partner is most available, said Sabrina Romanoff, a clinical psychologist in New York City.",
      "But it\u2019s better to acknowledge that something needs to be discussed, take a pause, and set a time to come back to it, she said. That could mean having lunch or coffee together the next day, or any time you\u2019re not rushing out the door.",
      "The key is to follow through.",
      "\u201cIt speaks to a skill, to trust that your partner is really going to return to this thing that\u2019s really important to you,\u201d Romanoff said, adding that most couples have to practice that.",

      "Whiten said many couples in her practice have at least one person who feels they won\u2019t be able to sleep until they resolve a fight. That\u2019s often a sign of anxiety and a discomfort with uncertainty.",
      "\u201cPeople need to individually learn how they can regulate themselves and tell themselves it\u2019s OK,\u201d she said. \u201cThe idea of being able to self-soothe is really key.\u201d",
      "The reverse \u2014 avoidance \u2014 is no better. Many people might need space to process an argument, but they\u2019re obliged to come back later to their partner to address the topic.",
      "The goal is that both people feel secure enough to acknowledge the disagreement, remember their relationship is more important than one argument, and agree to talk about it later, Whiten said. \u201cWhen people can learn to do that, it\u2019s really transformative.\u201d",
      "Romanoff suggested that couples establish regular check-ins. They don\u2019t have to talk about the worst problems in their lives at a given point, but they should make a habit of small gestures of communication.",
      "Even regularly asking how your partner\u2019s day went creates a kind of scaffolding of emotional safety, she said. It creates the space to address problems.",
      "When there is an issue, use \u201cI\u201d statements, be clear about what you need, and try to create a plan for how the other person can deliver, she said. A request posed at an appropriate time will often be better received.",

      "A nonprofit group in Miami is helping reduce the strain on emergency rooms by providing homeless people with health care where they live",
      "MIAMI -- MIAMI (AP) \u2014 Jonas Richards became homeless several years ago after losing his job as a truck driver. Despite suffering from high blood pressure and diabetes, seeing a doctor hasn't been a major priority since then.",
      "\u201cWhen you're homeless, it's not easy,\u201d Richards said. \u201cYou find yourself hustling, trying to keep a little money in your pocket, trying to find something to eat.\u201d",
      "But Richards recently had his first visit with doctors from Miami Street Medicine while sitting on a curb outside a homeless shelter.",
      "\u201cYou get everything done right here very fast,\u201d Richards said. \u201cIt was a big help.\u201d",
      "Miami Street Medicine is a nonprofit organization providing free mobile health care services to homeless people. It\u2019s part of a larger group, Dade County Street Response, which also includes a free clinic called Doctors Within Borders, a disaster relief team and a mental health crisis line.",
      "Miami Street Medicine teams of paid staff and medical school student volunteers aren\u2019t just bandaging cuts and handing out aspirin. They\u2019re performing intake on patients with tablet computers and offer follow-up visits for chronic conditions. They're working with specialists like dermatologists, neurologists and cardiologists.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re out there to meet the needs of our patients,\u201d founder Dr. Dan Bergholz said. \u201cAnd if that\u2019s a cough drop, we\u2019ve got you. We are happy to help you with that cough drop. But really the mission is so much greater. It\u2019s showing that we care, and we\u2019re there for them. So when that cough becomes pneumonia, they\u2019ll let us listen to their lungs and maybe trust us to take them to the hospital.\u201d",
      "Bergholz began laying groundwork for Miami Street Medicine about seven years ago. He said he had started doing charity outreach with homeless people as an undergraduate, but it seemed like more could be done.",
      "\u201cIt just felt like we weren\u2019t quite moving the needle for folks,\u201d Bergholz said.",
      "After learning more about the growing trend of street medicine and being accepted to the University of Miami\u2019s medical school, Bergholz began working with other students to set up a program.",
      "\u201cI moved down to Miami early and just started hitting the streets and chatting with people,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could call it a needs assessment.\u201d",
      "Just as Miami Street Medicine was taking off, the COVID-19 pandemic hit and forced the group to adjust. Bergholz connected with Dade County Street Response to provide health care to more underserved areas.",

      "\u201cA sort of bigger vision emerged to fill the gaps in the local social safety net,\u201d Bergholz said.",
      "One challenge is the transient nature of homeless people, which makes it difficult to provide continual care. Dr. Armen Henderson, founder of Dade County Street Response, said the problem is compounded by laws that target homeless people.",
      "\u201cThe criminalization of homelessness has significantly impacted our patients\u2019 ability to be in one place to get services,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cFor the street medicine team, they know they meet us in one place. But if the majority of those patients are now ending up in jail, now the people are trying to figure out what places are police not harassing them.\u201d",
      "Another challenge is fighting the common sentiment that providing services actually increases homelessness, Henderson said.",
      "\u201cThe only thing that ends homelessness is easy access to housing,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that encourages people to be unsheltered. No one wants to be unsheltered. So by offering services like this, we\u2019re actually trying to ease people\u2019s suffering. When people come in here, they want to get off the street. They want to figure out a plan.\u201d",
      "Members of Miami Street Medicine have noticed more people losing their homes in recent years as prices increase and wages remain stagnant. Dr. Inaki Bent, who oversees street medicine teams, said he\u2019s also seen an increase in undocumented migrants on the streets as the state and federal governments have expanded immigration enforcement this year.",
      "\u201cI see patients here who are no longer working,\u201d Bent said. \u201cThey\u2019re no longer working because the fields and the construction sites have become targets. And they would prefer not to be employed or not to expose themselves to that risk.\u201d",
      "In addition to the individual benefit to patients, providing medical treatment on the street and at the group's clinic prevents treatable conditions from becoming emergencies that ultimately strain the entire health care system. For example, Bent had a patient who had previously been treated for seizures at an emergency room and received a prescription, but couldn't afford it. The patient would have eventually ended up back in the ER, but Miami Street Medicine paid for his medicine.",
      "\u201cSo we\u2019re able to fill that void and hopefully prevent a couple more admissions,\u201d Bent said. \u201cBut we're also able to do a human service for him, for our fellow man, to provide him with the necessary health care so he can begin his path toward a productive life.\u201d",

      "Amir Khan Muttaqi, who is among multiple Afghan Taliban leaders under U.N. sanctions that include travel bans and asset freezes, arrived in New Delhi on Thursday after the U.N. Security Council Committee granted a temporary travel exemption to him. The visit comes after Muttaqi\u2019s participation Tuesday at an international meeting on Afghanistan in Russia that included representatives from China, India, Pakistan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.",

India\u2019s special envoy to Afghanistan visited Kabul in April to discuss political and trade relations.",

      "The visit comes while Afghanistan\u2019s ties with Pakistan are strained, especially over refugee deportations and border tensions, and India\u2019s engagement is seen as a strategic counterbalance to Pakistan\u2019s influence. India also aims to limit Chinese dominance in Afghanistan through infrastructure and diplomatic presence.",

In July, Russia became the first country to recognize the Taliban\u2019s government after removing the group from its list of outlawed organizations.",

      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 Pope Leo XIV urged labor union leaders from Chicago on Thursday to advocate for immigrants and welcome minorities into their ranks, weighing in as the Trump administration crackdown on immigrants intensifies in the pontiff's hometown.",
      "\u201cWhile recognizing that appropriate policies are necessary to keep communities safe, I encourage you to continue to advocate for society to respect the human dignity of the most vulnerable,\u201d Leo said.",
      "The audience was scheduled before the deployment of National Guard troops to protect federal property in the Chicago area, including a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building that has been the site of occasional clashes between protesters and federal agents.",
      "Chicago Cardinal Blase Cupich, who accompanied the labor leaders, said that Leo was well aware of the situation on the ground. In an interview with The Associated Press, Cupich said that Leo has made clear, including in recent comments, that migrants and the poor must be treated in ways that respect their human dignity.",
      "\u201cI really didn\u2019t have to tell him much at all, because he seemed to have a handle on what was going on,\u201d Cupich told the AP afterward.",
      "He said that Leo had urged U.S. bishops in particular to \u201cspeak with one voice\u201d on the issue. Cupich said he expected the November meeting of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops would make immigration a top agenda item.",
      "\u201cThis has to be front and center right now. This is the issue of the day. And we can\u2019t dance around it,\u201d Cupich said.",
      "Catholic leaders in the U.S. have denounced the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown, which has split up families and incited fears that people could be rounded up and deported any time. The administration has defended the crackdown as safeguarding public safety and national security.",

      "Cupich said he was heartened by Leo's remarks last week, in which the pope defended the cardinal's decision to honor Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin for his work helping immigrants. The plans drew objection from some conservative U.S. bishops given the powerful Democratic senator\u2019s support for abortion rights, and he ultimately declined the award.",
      "It was the second meeting in as many days that history's first American pope has heard firsthand from a U.S. bishop on the front lines of the migration crackdown. On Wednesday, El Paso bishop Mark Seitz brought Leo letters from desperate immigrant families.",
      "Cupich was in Rome for Vatican meetings and to also accompany a group of Chicago schoolchildren who got a special greeting from Leo during his Wednesday general audience. The kids had staged their own \u201cmock conclave\u201d in school this past spring and footage of their deliberations went viral online as the real conclave unfolded in Rome. They arrived at the audience Wednesday dressed as cardinals, Swiss Guards and the pope himself.",

      "VATICAN CITY -- VATICAN CITY (AP) \u2014 Pope Leo XIV criticized how the wealthy live in a \u201cbubble of comfort and luxury\u201d while poor people suffer on the margins, confirming in his first teaching document that he is in perfect lockstep with his predecessor Pope Francis on matters of social and economic injustice.",
      "The Vatican on Thursday released the document, entitled \u201cI have loved you,\u201d which Francis had begun to write in his final months but never finished. Leo, who was elected in May, credited Francis with the text, cited him repeatedly, but said he had made the document his own and signed it.",
      "The 100-page document traces the history of Christianity\u2019s constant concern for poor people, from Biblical citations and the teaching of church fathers to the preaching of recent popes about caring for migrants, prisoners and victims of human trafficking.",
      "Leo credits especially women\u2019s religious orders with carrying out God\u2019s mandate to care for the sick, feed the poor and welcome the stranger, and also praised lay-led popular movements advocating for land, housing and work for the society\u2019s most disadvantaged.",
      "The conclusion Leo draws is that the Catholic Church\u2019s \u201cpreferential option for the poor\u201d has existed from the start, is non-negotiable and is the very essence of what it means to be Christian. He calls for a renewed commitment to fixing the structural causes of poverty, while providing unquestioning charity to those who need it.",
      "\u201cWhen the church kneels beside a leper, a malnourished child or an anonymous dying person, she fulfills her deepest vocation: to love the Lord where he is most disfigured,\u201d Leo writes.",
      "Leo cites Francis frequently, including in some of the Argentine pope\u2019s most-quoted talking points about the global \u201ceconomy that kills\u201d and criticism of trickle down economics. Francis made those points from the very start of his pontificate in 2013, saying he wanted a \u201cchurch that is poor and for the poor.\u201d",
      "\u201cGod has a special place in his heart for those who are discriminated against and oppressed, and he asks us, his church, to make a decisive and radical choice in favor of the weakest,\u201d Leo writes.",
      "Echoing Francis, Leo rails against the \u201cillusion of happiness\u201d derived from accumulating wealth. \u201cThus, in a world where the poor are increasingly numerous, we paradoxically see the growth of a wealthy elite, living in a bubble of comfort and luxury, almost in another world compared to ordinary people.\u201d",
      "Francis\u2019 frequent criticism of capitalism angered many conservative and wealthy Catholics, especially in the United States, who accused the Argentine Jesuit of being a Marxist.",
      "In a recent interview, Leo said such misdirected criticism cannot be leveled against him. \u201cThe fact that I am American means, among other things, people can\u2019t say, like they did about Francis, \u2018he doesn\u2019t understand the United States, he just doesn\u2019t see what\u2019s going on,\u2019\u201d Leo told Crux, a Catholic site.",
      "As a result, Leo\u2019s embrace of Francis\u2019 teaching on poverty and the church\u2019s obligation to care for the weakest is a significant reaffirmation, especially in Leo\u2019s first teaching document.",

      "Francis\u2019 spirit was very much infused in the document and in its official presentation on Thursday.",
      "In addition to Czerny, the news conference featured a rare appearance by Cardinal Konrad Krajewski, the Polish prelate whom Francis entrusted with carrying out his personal acts of charity over the course of his pontificate. Under Krajewski's quiet eye, the Vatican installed showers for homeless people off St. Peter\u2019s Square, provided COVID-19 vaccines for 6,000 migrants and people without access to Italy's health service, sent ambulances with medicine to Ukraine and hosted weekly luncheons for the hungry.",
      "Krajewski said the document was proof that such gestures of charity toward the needy come straight from the Bible, recalling that Jesus didn't work 9-5 in an office, but rather went out and looked for people who needed him.",
      "Krajewski regaled reporters with anecdotes of his behind-the-scenes dealings with Francis, who would jokingly reprimand him if his bank account had too much money in it because it meant he hadn't spent enough on poor people.",
      "Leo signed the text on Oct. 4, the feast of St. Francis of Assisi, the 13th-century mendicant friar who renounced his wealth to live poor among the poor. The date was not coincidental.",

      "\u201cThe fact that some dismiss or ridicule charitable works, as if they were an obsession on the part of a few and not the burning heart of the church\u2019s mission, convinces me of the need to go back and reread the Gospel, lest we risk replacing it with the wisdom of this world,\u201d Leo writes.",

      "French President Emmanuel Macron is set to appoint a new prime minister on Friday to break a political deadlock",
      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 After a week of intense political turmoil, French President Emmanuel Macron is set to appoint a new prime minister Friday in his latest bid to break the political deadlock that has gripped the country for more than a year, as France struggles with mounting economic challenges and ballooning debt.",
      "The appointment is widely seen as the president\u2019s last chance to revive his second term, which runs until 2027. With no majority in the National Assembly to push through his agenda, Macron faces increasingly fierce criticism, even from within his own camp, and has little room to maneuver.",
      "Outgoing Prime Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu abruptly resigned Monday, only hours after unveiling a new Cabinet. The shock resignation prompted calls for Macron to step down or dissolve parliament again. But they remained unanswered, with the president instead announcing on Wednesday that he would name a successor within 48 hours.",
      "Over the past year, Macron\u2019s successive minority governments have collapsed in quick succession, leaving the European Union\u2019s second-largest economy mired in political paralysis as France is faced with a debt crisis. At the end of the first quarter of 2025, France\u2019s public debt stood at 3.346 trillion euros ($3.9 trillion), or 114% of gross domestic product.",
      "France\u2019s poverty rate also reached 15.4% in 2023, its highest level since records began in 1996, according to the latest data available from the national statistics institute.",
      "The economic and political struggles are worrying financial markets, ratings agencies and the European Commission, which has been pushing France to comply with EU rules limiting debt.",

      "Macron may turn to a figure from the left, which managed to form a coalition in the 2024 legislative elections, or opt for a technocratic government to sidestep partisan deadlock.",
      "In any case, the new prime minister will have to seek compromises to avoid an immediate vote of no confidence and may even be forced to abandon the pension reform that gradually raises the retirement age from 62 to 64. Macron fought fiercely for the deeply unpopular measure, which was enacted into law in 2023 despite mass protests.",
      "Lecornu argued that Macron\u2019s centrist bloc, its allies, and parts of the opposition could still rally to form a working majority. \u201cThere\u2019s a majority that can govern,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel that a path is still possible. It is difficult.\u201d",
      "The stalemate stems from Macron\u2019s shock decision in June 2024 to dissolve the National Assembly. The snap elections produced a hung parliament, with no bloc able to command a majority in the 577-seat chamber. The gridlock has unnerved investors, infuriated voters, and stalled efforts to curb France\u2019s spiraling deficit and public debt.",
      "Without stable support, Macron\u2019s governments have stumbled from one crisis to the next, collapsing as they sought backing for unpopular spending cuts. Lecornu\u2019s resignation, just 14 hours after announcing his Cabinet, underscored the fragility of the president\u2019s coalition amid deep political and personal rivalries.",

      "He\u2019s the country\u2019s highest authority, but Mohammed VI rarely addresses the public and often leaves it to ministers or members of the royal family to represent Morocco internationally. Decades ago dubbed Morocco\u2019s \u201cKing of the Poor,\u201d he now faces a public expressing disillusionment with slow progress and widening economic divides.",
      "Since Sept. 27, protesters have filled the streets of more than a dozen Moroccan cities, denouncing the billions being poured into preparations for the 2030 FIFA World Cup.",
      "Angered by underfunded schools and hospitals, the \u201cGen Z 212\u201d movement has drawn a direct line between new stadiums and neglected public services, mobilizing a nationwide movement unlike any seen since the Arab Spring in 2011. Named for Morocco\u2019s +212 dialing code, the group has organized on platforms like TikTok and Discord, mirroring similar youth-led protests in Nepal.",
      "\u201cThe people want the king to intervene,\u201d protesters have chanted.",
      "Mohammed VI\u2019s address is expected to revisit themes he has touched on both during past moments of turmoil and in an address earlier this year, when he said he wouldn\u2019t accept a \u201ctwo-speed country\u201d full of inequality.",
      "\u201cRegardless of the infrastructure built, and the level of economic development achieved, I would be satisfied only if our accomplishments contribute, in a tangible manner, to improving the living conditions of citizens from all social classes, and in all areas and regions,\u201d he said in a July speech in Tetouan, the coastal town where he spends much of the summer.",
      "The speech will come more than a week after protesters sent a letter of demands sent directly to the palace, thrusting the king into the spotlight and upending the careful distance he usually maintains from public debate. It called for the dismissal of Prime Minister Aziz Akhannouch and his government, the release of political detainees, and the creation of a forum to hold corrupt politicians accountable.",
      "\u201cWe, the youth of Morocco, are requesting your majesty to intervene for a profound and just reform that restores rights and punishes the corrupt,\u201d the group wrote in the letter.",

Departing from Gen Z 212\u2019s demands, it said tensions could ease only by addressing \u201cthe deep and structural causes of the anger shaking our country,\u201d not merely by dismissing the prime minister, who it noted holds only symbolic authority and isn\u2019t \u201cthe true source of executive power in Morocco.\u201d",

      "Senate Republicans have voted to roll back restrictions on mining and drilling in federal land in three Western states",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Congressional Republicans have voted to roll back restrictions on mining, drilling and other development in three Western states, advancing President Donald Trump's ambitions to expand energy production from public lands.",
      "Senators voted 50-46 Thursday to repeal a land management plan for a large swath of Alaska that was adopted in the final weeks of Democratic President Joe Biden\u2019s administration. Lawmakers voted to roll back similar plans for land in Montana and North Dakota earlier this week.",
      "The timing of Biden's actions made the plans vulnerable to the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to terminate rules that are finalized near the end of a president\u2019s term. The resolutions require a simple majority in each chamber and take effect upon the president's signature.",
      "The House approved the repeals last month in votes largely along party lines. Trump is expected to sign the measures, which will boost a proposed 211-mile road through an Alaska wilderness to allow mining of copper, cobalt, gold and other minerals.",
      "Trump ordered approval of the Ambler Road project earlier this week, saying it will unlock access to copper, cobalt and other critical minerals that the United States needs to compete with China on artificial intelligence and other resource development. Copper is used in the production of cars, electronics and even renewable energy technologies such as wind turbines.",
      "The road was approved in Trump\u2019s first term, but was later blocked by Biden after an analysis determined the project would threaten caribou and other wildlife and harm Alaska Native tribes that rely on hunting and fishing.",
      "The Biden-era restrictions also included a block on new mining leases in the nation's most productive coal-producing region, the Powder River Basin in Montana and Wyoming. On Monday, the Trump administration held the biggest coal sale in that area in more than a decade, drawing a single bid of $186,000 for 167.5 million tons of coal, or about a tenth of a penny per ton.",
      "Trump has largely cast aside Biden's goal to reduce climate-warming emissions from the burning of coal and other fossil fuels extracted from federal land. Instead, he and congressional Republicans have moved to open more taxpayer-owned land to fossil fuel development, hoping to create more jobs and revenue. The Republican administration also has pushed to develop critical minerals, including copper, cobalt, gold and zinc.",
      "A decision on whether to accept the recent bid from the Navajo Transitional Energy Co. is pending, and the lease cannot be issued until the Montana land plan is altered. The dirt-cheap value reflects dampened industry interest in coal despite Trump's efforts. Many utilities have switched to cheaper natural gas or renewables such as wind and solar power.",
      "Administration officials expressed disappointment that they did not receive \u201cstronger participation\u201d in the Montana sale. In a statement, Interior Department spokesperson Aubrie Spady blamed a \u201cdecades long war on coal\u201d by Biden and former Democratic President Barack Obama.",
      "Republican Sen. Tim Sheehy of Montana said the repeal of the land-management plan in his state was \u201cputting an end to disastrous Biden-era regulations that put our resource economy on life support.\u201d",

      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bipartisan bill Thursday that aims to prevent the state's home insurer of last resort from running out of money following a natural disaster.",
      "The FAIR Plan is an insurance pool that provides policies to people who can\u2019t get private insurance because their properties are deemed too risky to insure. The number of homeowners forced onto the FAIR Plan has skyrocketed. With high premiums and basic coverage, the plan is designed as a temporary option until homeowners can find permanent coverage.",
      "But more Californians are relying on it than ever as increasingly devastating and destructive fires spark across the state, including in densely populated areas. There were nearly 600,000 home policies on the FAIR Plan as of June. Leaders of the plan last year warned state lawmakers that it could go insolvent after a major wildfire or disaster.",
      "That reality came true earlier this year after wildfires swept through Los Angeles and destroyed more than 17,000 structures. The plan faced a loss of roughly $4 billion and needed a $1 billion bailout from private insurers to pay out claims. Half of that cost is expected to be passed onto all policyholders.",
      "The law Newsom signed allows the FAIR Plan to request state-backed loans and bonds and spread out claims payments over multiple years after a disaster. Insurance companies were previously required to pay the full bailout within 30 days. Supporters of the new law said it will prevent the need for future bailouts that raise rates for everyone.",
      "\u201cThe kinds of climate-fueled firestorms like we saw in January will only continue to worsen over time. That\u2019s why we\u2019re taking action now to continue strengthening California\u2019s insurance market to be more resilient in the face of the climate crisis,\" Newsom said in a statement.",

      "Newsom also signed another bill to expand the FAIR Plan board, which currently consists of nine voting insurers and four nonvoting members appointed by the governor. The new law adds two representatives from the Legislature to serve as non-voting members on the board.",
      "Supporters, including the state\u2019s top insurance regulator, said the law adds a new layer of oversight and transparency. Opponents said it wouldn't make a difference because the new members don't have any voting power.",
      "California is undergoing a yearslong effort to stabilize its insurance market after several major insurance companies either paused or restricted new business in the state in 2023, which pushed hundreds of thousands of homeowners onto the FAIR Plan. Wildfires are becoming more common and destructive in California because of climate change, and insurers say that is making it difficult to truly price the risk on properties.",
      "Of the top 20 most destructive wildfires in state history, 15 have occurred since 2015, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.",
      "The state now gives insurers more latitude to raise premiums in exchange for issuing more policies in high-risk areas. That includes regulations allowing insurers to consider climate change when setting their prices and allowing them pass on the costs of reinsurance to California consumers.",

      "In 2013, mired in debt, Detroit filed for bankruptcy",
      "DETROIT -- DETROIT (AP) \u2014 Before the arrival of sprawling suburban malls featuring amusement park rides and stores peddling anything from jeans to jelly beans, there was Hudson's in downtown Detroit.",
      "The towering department store mirrored the growth and opulence of the auto-manufacturing town, but its fortunes \u2014 like the city\u2019s \u2014 soured with population shifts and economic downturns.",
      "In 1998, more than a century after J.L. Hudson's Co. opened shop, the 25-story building was demolished, leaving \u2014 literally and figuratively \u2014 a deep hole as a reminder of what Detroit used to be.",
      "Until this year.",
      "Standing on the Woodward Avenue site are a gleaming 45-story tower and a 12-story office building. The new 1.5 million-square-foot (140,000-square-meter) Hudson's Detroit development also contains retail space and will feature high-end condos. General Motors Corp. is relocating its headquarters there and a five-star hotel is slated to open in 2027.",
      "\u201cPeople are saying this isn\u2019t your father\u2019s or grandfather\u2019s Detroit anymore,\" said Dan Gilbert, whose property management company Bedrock developed the $1.5 billion construction. \u201cYou don\u2019t even have to look at the numbers. You can just feel it walking around \u2014 you\u2019re going to feel a different Detroit.\u201d",
      "The old Hudson's building commanded attention and demanded respect, according to Jeremy Dimick, director of collections at the Detroit Historical Society. The new one is just as impressive. Its tower rises 685 feet (210 meters) over downtown Detroit.",
      "Its arrival is the latest chapter in the city's recovery.",
      "Mired in debt, Detroit once struggled to pay its bills and keep the streetlights on. It filed for bankruptcy in 2013, when its credit rating was at junk bond status.",
      "The city emerged from bankruptcy in 2014, built up a general fund balance of more than $1 billion, and has since recorded 10 consecutive years of budget surpluses. Moody\u2019s Investment Services gave Detroit its 11th consecutive credit rating upgrade this year and named the Hudson's development in its report.",
      "\u201cYou feel the energy when you\u2019re walking downtown,\u201d said Gilbert, whose company, Bedrock, owns more than 100 properties in downtown Detroit. \u201cThere\u2019s been just significant change.\"",
      "Launched in Detroit in 1881, the J.L. Hudson store initially specialized in clothing for men and boys. After occupying various downtown spaces, it set up shop at the Woodward Avenue site a decade later and expanded its wares, according to the Detroit Historical Society.",
      "The building grew over the years. About a dozen of its eventual 25 stories were used as retail space in what was considered the world's tallest department store for more than half a century.",
      "Dimick called it a Detroit institution.",
      "\u201cThat was the reason to go downtown,\u201d he said. \"It had been around so long that it became this multigenerational experience of shopping. \u2018I went there with my parents and I\u2019m going to take my children.'\"",
      "The grand department store offered fine linen, tableware and kitchen appliances. Factory workers could find overalls there. But most of all, Hudson's provided holiday magic.",
      "Bedecked in color, sounds and excitement, it was the center of downtown festivities. Thousands of shoppers entered the store every day, moving from department to department on escalators and in elevators. The longest line was of children waiting to sit on Santa's lap and whisper wishes of gifts.",

      "\u201cIt will feel like back in the day,\u201d he said.",
      "It was a grand and exciting time to be a Detroiter until \u2014 like many big manufacturing hubs \u2014 the city began to change. New freeways were built. Middle- and upper-class families left the city for new suburban homes with big yards.",
      "In the mid-1950s, Northland Center \u2014 then the largest mall in the U.S. \u2014 opened just north of Detroit, providing more options for suburban shoppers.",

      "The old Hudson\u2019s building downsized and eventually closed in 1983. It was imploded into a hulking mound of rubble, stone, steel and dust on Oct. 24, 1998.",

      "Gilbert, 63, says it will take decades to get a return on his Hudson's investment, but that isn't the point of the development.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re doing this for ourselves,\" the fourth-generation Detroiter said, \"but we\u2019re also doing it for the city.\u201d",

It was to transport crude from the oil sand fields of western Canada to Steele City, Nebraska.",
      "Trump previously revived the long-delayed project during his first term after it had stalled under the Obama administration. It would have moved up to 830,000 barrels (35 million gallons) of crude daily, connecting in Nebraska to other pipelines that feed oil refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast.",

      "The federal government shutdown has entered its second week, and already shortages of air traffic controllers have strained operations and disrupted flights at some U.S. airports.",
      "Reagan National Airport became the latest this week to report delays because of staffing issues on Wednesday. But earlier in the week there were also problems at airports in Chicago, Newark, Denver and Nashville, and the tower even had to shut down for several hours in Burbank, California.",
      "Experts, as well as union leaders representing air traffic controllers and security screeners, warn that the impact could grow significantly worse if the shutdown continues and employees start to miss paychecks.",
      "Here is what to know about your rights as a passenger and what you can do if delays and cancellations start piling up:",
      "It is better to be stuck at home or in a hotel than to be stranded in an airport terminal, so use the airline\u2019s app or flight websites to make sure that your flight is still on before heading to the airport. This FAA site can be checked to see if there are widespread delays at your airport.",
      "Kyle Potter, executive editor of Thrifty Traveler, suggests also closely monitoring the news if you have upcoming travel plans.",
      "\u201cA deal, in theory, could come through Congress any day now, and that could put all of this doubt lingering over air travel to an end pretty quickly,\u201d Potter said.",
      "If you are already at the airport, it is time to find another flight. Get in line to speak to a customer service representative, and call or go online to connect to the airline\u2019s reservations staff. It also helps to reach out on X, the site formerly known as Twitter, because airlines might respond quickly there.",
      "Airlines will rebook you on a later flight for no additional charge. The good news right now is that this is not a peak travel time, so travelers stand a better chance of finding seats. But the busy holiday season is right around the corner, and at those peak times, passengers might have to wait days for a seat on a new flight.",
      "If these problems do become more widespread, you might consider whether it makes sense to travel by train, car or bus instead. But there is really no way to predict when and where a staff shortage might happen, and the ongoing shortage of controllers is so critical that even a small number of absences can cause problems.",
      "Potter said the shutdown is different from when a single airline is having problems and travelers can just pick another carrier. This is creating problems for entire airports at once.",
      "\u201cAs these problems expand and spread the longer the shutdown drags on, it\u2019s unlikely that there will be one airline running on time if the rest of the them are failing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to affect the entire system over time.\u201d",
      "You can, but airlines aren\u2019t required to put you on another carrier\u2019s flight. Some airlines, including the biggest ones except Southwest and the discount airlines, say they can put you on a partner airline. But even then it is often hit or miss.",

      "The Biden administration had proposed a rule that would have changed that and required airlines to pay passengers for delays and cancellations in more circumstances, with compensation proposed between about $200 and as high as $775. But the Trump administration scrapped that last month, and the airlines praised him for doing so.",
      "Each airline is different. The U.S. Department of Transportation has a site that lets consumers see the commitments that each carrier makes for refunds and covering other expenses when flights are canceled or significantly delayed.",
      "Travel insurance might help if you bought a policy when you booked or used a travel credit card that offers that product, but Potter said you shouldn\u2019t assume you will be covered even if you have insurance. Check the fine print to see if you are covered in situations like this when a shortage of workers causes flight disruptions.",

      "The foundation selects fellows over the course of years, considering a vast range of recommendations, largely from their peers.",
      "\u201cEach class doesn\u2019t have a theme and we\u2019re not creating a cohort around a certain idea,\" said Marlies Carruth, director of the MacArthur Fellows program. \"But I think this year, we see empathy and deep engagement with community figures prominently in this class.\"",
      "Through different methodologies, many of the fellows \u201cboldly and unflinchingly\u201d reflect what they see and hear from deep engagement with their communities, she said.",
      "Because fellows don't apply or participate in anyway in their selection, the award often comes as a shock and sometimes coincides with difficult moments. Nabarun Dasgupta, an epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina, had just left a team meeting where he shared that a longtime collaborator in harm reduction work had died when he saw multiple missed calls from a Chicago number, which then called again. It was the MacArthur Foundation.",
      "They were awarding him the fellowship in recognition of his work, which includes helping to start a testing program for street drugs to identify unregulated substances and helping to overcome a shortage of naloxone, which reverses an opioid overdose.",
      "To make sense of the intense moment that mixed deep loss and recognition, Dasgupta wrote the following in a journal.",
      "\u201cWe are surrounded by death every day. Sometimes, you have to give yourself a pep talk to get out of bed. Other mornings, the universe yells in your ear and tells you to keep going because what we\u2019re doing is working.\u201d",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press, he added, \u201cI feel like this couldn\u2019t have been any clearer of a signal that the work has to go on.\u201d",
      "Other fellows were contacted by the foundation through email asking to speak with them about potential projects. Tonika Lewis Johnson, a Chicago-based artist, planned to take the call in the car. The foundation representatives tried to get her to pull over before breaking the news, but she declined.",
      "\u201cThey were definitely worried about my safety,\u201d she said laughing, and she did then stop driving.",

His research has uncovered many new findings about what drives weather patterns in the tropics, which may eventually help improve forecasting in those regions.",
      "Adames said usually one of his classes would be ending right when the foundation would publish the new class of fellows, so he was planning to end the lecture early to come back to his office. He said he\u2019s having trouble fathoming what it will be like.",

      "Of all the ugly moments so far \u2014 bad play, blowout losses, home fans fleeing early for the exits \u2014 the most telling moment of Bill Belichick's first season at North Carolina came during an open week.",
      "It took the form of a pair of terse statements from Belichick and athletic director Bubba Cunningham posted on social media late Wednesday, reaffirming the marriage between the six-time Super Bowl winner from the NFL's New England Patriots and the school desperately seeking to elevate its football program beyond decades of also-ran status.",
      "\u201cI'm fully committed to UNC Football and the program we're building here,\u201d Belichick said.",
      "The fact it came at all, though \u2014 following a day of speculation and reports of behind-the-scenes troubles in the program \u2014 said more about how the first few weeks of Belichick's first college season have gone.",
      "The confident messaging about building the \u201c33rd\u201d NFL team with a pro-style approach at a college program has given way to school leaders and the Tar Heels' general manager pleading for patience from fans and donors jarred by the team's lack of competitiveness. And now the school has suspended an assistant coach for violating rules tied to improper benefits.",
      "It all comes amid elevated financial investments into the program, none more significant than spending at least $10 million annually to hire the 73-year-old Belichick as a first-time college coach.",
      "\u201cIt's not the kind of thing we judge after four games or even after one season,\u201d Chancellor Lee Roberts told reporters after a meeting of university trustees two weeks ago. \u201cThese things take time.\u201d",
      "The Tar Heels (2-3) have managed a total of four touchdowns in three losses to power-conference opponents, each coming by at least 25 points. One of their two wins came against a Championship Subdivision opponent in Richmond.",
      "In games against fellow Bowl Subdivision opponents, UNC ranks last among all 67 power-conference teams in scoring offense (13.3), total offense (253.0 yards) and third-down conversion rate (26.5%). The Tar Heels also rank amid the bottom dozen in scoring defense (30.8), total defense (416.8 yards) and third-down conversion defense (43.4%), according to Sportradar.",
      "UNC opened Belichick's tenure on Labor Day with a national TV spotlight, only to see TCU roll to a 48-14 win that had UNC fans largely gone from Kenan Stadium by the end of the third quarter.",
      "Last week, it happened again, this time by halftime, as Clemson took a 28-3 lead in the first quarter of a game that ended in a largely empty Kenan Stadium.",
      "\u201cWe're just going to keep working every day and every week,\u201d Belichick said afterward. \u201cAnd let the guys get better. And the guys that get better will keep playing. And the guys that don't, maybe there's other people that can compete and move ahead of them for playing time. But we're just going to keep grinding. I'm not going to evaluate where things are or aren't. Just take it week by week.\u201d",
      "The Tar Heels next visit California on Oct. 17 in their first cross-country league trip since the Atlantic Coast Conference's expansion last year.",
      "The school has also dealing with issues away from the games.",
      "The school announced Thursday evening that cornerbacks coach Armond Hawkins has been suspended. A timetable for that suspension is unclear, and UNC said in its statement that Hawkins would remain on leave while the school \u201cfurther investigates other potential actions detrimental\u201d to the team and school.",
      "Additionally, a person with knowledge of the situation said a planned TV show from streaming service Hulu on Belichick's first UNC team is no longer in development.

(AP) \u2014 Although LeBron James still has not participated in a full practice since the Los Angeles Lakers' training camp started more than a week ago, coach JJ Redick is being pragmatic about the effect of the 40-year-old superstar's absence on the team.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s on his own timeline,\u201d Redick said.",
      "James began camp for his unprecedented 23rd NBA season last week with a lower-body nerve injury that kept him off the court. The Lakers held their sixth full practice of camp Thursday without the top scorer in NBA history, who also missed both of their first two preseason games while he works to get back into competitive condition.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got to play the cards you\u2019re dealt,\u201d Redick said. \u201cThat\u2019s a shame, but that\u2019s just the reality. ... No one has got any time with LeBron. That\u2019s not just (new center Deandre Ayton), but everybody. (James) hasn\u2019t been on the court with the team, but that\u2019s just the reality.\u201d",
      "Redick and the rest of the Lakers expressed excitement last week about the chance to have their first full training camp together with James and Luka Doncic, who scarcely ever got to practice with his new team after joining Los Angeles in the middle of last season.",
      "Instead, the Lakers are installing their offense and building court chemistry during this camp largely without James on the court. They're also getting limited time so far with Doncic, who is making a deliberate return to full speed after his participation in EuroBasket during a busy summer.",
      "Neither superstar played in the Lakers' first two preseason games. They return to the court Sunday at home against Golden State.",
      "Doncic participated in some full practices last week, including scrimmages, but Ayton said Wednesday that he would love to get more practice time with the Lakers' two biggest stars.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019ve just been waiting on,\u201d Ayton said. \u201cJust got to prepare. JJ and the coaching staff probably have something where they can put stuff together for all of us to really grow chemistry.\u201d",

      "Michael Irvin is bringing his legendary energy to the Miami Hurricanes' sidelines",
      "CORAL GABLES, Fla. -- CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Michael Irvin is soaked in sweat on the Miami sideline. He's high-fiving players and coaches. He's chest-bumping anyone in his general vicinity. He's celebrating touchdowns, big plays, big hits, then waves to the Hurricane fans and tells them to get louder.",
      "This wasn't a scene from 1987.",
      "This all happened last weekend. And every other Hurricanes game day this season, too.",
      "The 59-year-old Irvin \u2014 a national champion with the Hurricanes, a Super Bowl champion with the Dallas Cowboys and a Pro Football Hall of Famer \u2014 doesn't need a seat at Miami games. He's not sitting. He's perhaps the most famous cheerleader in college football right now, in almost constant motion on the sidelines, reveling in the success of the second-ranked Hurricanes and their 5-0 start.",
      "Irvin says he's been doing this for one reason: If Hurricane alums are asking players to be fully committed, then those alums have to show how committed they are as well.",
      "\u201cFor years \u2014 for years \u2014 we\u2019ve come back to Miami and all season we talk to the young men about how important it is to give your all, like we gave our all, to the university,\" Irvin said. \u201cWe talk about the great brotherhood. These young men today, they hear talk all the time. They hear everybody talking. You have to put substance behind the words to get any meaning towards these kids and who they are and what they are.\u201d",
      "Irvin proudly says he's never changed teams. He went to the national football power St. Thomas Aquinas High School in Fort Lauderdale, then attended Miami, then spent the entirety of his NFL career with the Cowboys. \u201cAnd I won a championship on every level,\u201d Irvin quickly points out.",
      "He has ties with Miami coach Mario Cristobal that go back longer than perhaps anyone else associated with the university. Irvin was one of the hosts of Cristobal's recruiting visit nearly 40 years ago. When Cristobal came back to Miami to take over as head coach, Irvin was one of the alums who loudly expressed how good a choice that was.",
      "Cristobal called Irvin to invite him to games. And Irvin has always answered those calls.",
      "\u201cI think the best part of the way Mike brings his energy is the fact that he makes it very clear he\u2019s very grateful for the University of Miami and for his time as a Miami Hurricane,\" Cristobal said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s a feeling that needs to be expressed by any and all of us that ever played here \u2014 because a lot of us came in here not knowing our head from our feet.\u201d",
      "This is not a new commitment from Irvin. He's a 'Cane for life. He was at Madison Square Garden and went viral for his cheering from the stands when Miami's basketball team played Stanford for the NIT title in 2015. He's been more visible on the football sideline in recent seasons, getting tons of attention for getting on his hands and knees during Miami\u2019s wild 25-point comeback to beat Cal 39-38 last year.",
      "This year, he's done it all while wearing a \u201cGreentree Made Me\u201d shirt, a nod to the name of Miami's practice field.",

      "\u201cCoach called me this off-season and his message for when I spoke to the team was that we've got to talk about the work. Talk about work,\" Irvin said. \u201cThat's got to be the message. I love seeing (freshman wide receiver) Malachi Toney talk about, \u2018It\u2019s about the work.\u2019 In this day and age, you can create a dynasty if you've got this new talent understanding those old ways. What our coaches are creating is an anomaly. In a time where everybody's trying to work less. We've got a group of kids who are willing to work more.\"",
      "It's not just Irvin who has gotten behind this Miami team. Edgerrin James has been at games. Devin Hester, too. Santana Moss texted Cristobal after Miami's win over Florida State. Dan Morgan and Greg Olsen reach out as well.",
      "Practices always have a former player or two (or more) around. Former Miami coach Jimmy Johnson has been around the team. Ed Orgeron, who coached at Miami, is always nearby. The excitement among those who have been part of Miami's five title runs is obvious.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why I came to Miami as a player. That\u2019s why a lot of my teammates, our teammates, came here to Miami,\u201d Cristobal said. \"And that\u2019s why a lot of guys have come back. And we need to keep doing that. And we just need to make it almost like a token of gratitude. It is our role to do that and mentor the guys that have followed us, which is this current team right now, and help them get to the future.\u201d",
      "Irvin particularly enjoyed last weekend's win at Florida State. It took him back to 1987, when he scored a pair of fourth-quarter touchdowns to lift Miami to a 26-25 win over the Seminoles on that same Doak Campbell Stadium field. That win helped Miami win the national title.",
      "He got run over on the sideline during that game, a collision where a pair of Miami defenders kept driving a Florida State runner backward after the play was over. Hurricanes linebacker Wesley Bissainthe got called for a personal foul on the play, and Irvin \u2014 along with ESPN sideline reporter Holly Rowe \u2014 ended up on the ground.",
      "Both were all smiles afterward.",
      "\u201cI do all this for our coach,\" Irvin said. \"Mario Cristobal sacrificed for this and we all have to follow him. We will follow him right to heaven, to that championship. He's the one to get us there.\u201d",

      "Wilson \u2014 a four-time MVP who is already one of the league's all-time greats \u2014 continued to add to her legacy on Wednesday night with a 34-point, 14-rebound performance that helped the Aces navigate a hostile road environment and shake off a late Mercury rally.",
      "Wilson has already set a WNBA record with 291 postseason points through 11 games and is averaging 26.5 points and 10.1 rebounds per game. The 29-year-old is still at the peak of her basketball powers, using her 6-foot-4 frame and soft touch around the basket to score in bunches.",

(AP) \u2014 Chris Jones took ownership of his mistake on the decisive play in the Chiefs' loss to Jacksonville last week, when the three-time All-Pro defensive tackle thought Trevor Lawrence was down and stopped on the play, only to watch the Jaguars quarterback scramble to his feet and into the end zone.",
      "Lawrence's touchdown with 23 seconds remaining gave the Jaguars a 31-28 victory over the Chiefs.",
      "\u201cIt's a teaching point for me. A little adversity. I can't think the play is over, you know what I mean?\u201d Jones said Thursday, the day he typically speaks to local reporters. \u201cIt's a learning lesson. I thought it was over, thought we had him down.\u201d",
      "The Jaguars faced first-and-goal at the 1-yard line following a pass interference penalty. But they did not have any timeouts, so if Lawrence had been tagged down on the play, they probably would have had just one more chance at a winning touchdown.",
      "\u201cIt's a weird deal,\u201d Chiefs defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo said. \u201cListen, we always talk about, \u2018Never assume.\u2019 ... I think guys got caught up in the the moment. They thought he was down. Hopefully we learned from it.\u201d",
      "Indeed, several Chiefs players other than Jones watched as Lawrence got back to his feet and dived into the end zone.",
      "\u201cSomehow, some way, we needed to get him down,\u201d Spagnuolo said. \u201cThere were other things that went on that play that would have given us another chance to defend another play. We're assuming Chris would have got there. We don't know that. There are a lot of things on that play that could have gone better. All the guys would tell you that.\u201d",
      "Jones has never been one to shirk responsibility for a play or a mistake, and he owned up to it Thursday. But he also said that it was purely coincidental that he chose to deactivate his social media accounts before the game against Jacksonville.",
      "Not surprisingly, Jones was harshly criticized for what some perceived as a lack of effort on the eventual winning touchdown.",

      "Decades later, Common is helping set a different kind of tone for basketball: He has teamed up with his longtime collaborators to compose \u201cVictory\u201d as the official theme for NBA on Prime, the streaming platform announced Thursday. He worked with Karriem Riggins and James Poyser on the song, which will be a part of Amazon\u2019s first exclusive season of NBA coverage.",
      "Common said he drew some inspiration for the song by watching basketball.",
      "\u201cBasketball has a soul to it,\u201d said Common, a three-time Grammy winner, who has also won an Emmy and Oscar. \u201cIt\u2019s nostalgic but forward. The rhythm, the harmony, the movement, the teamwork, the star player. We wanted to capture all that in sound.\u201d",
      "After learning Amazon wanted him as a composer, Common said one of his first calls was to his mother to share the news. It was a moment he described as a perfect partnership from the start.",
      "\u201cYou never know where God is going to lead you,\u201d Common said. \u201cYou just got to stay open and be true to your craft, because now I feel like I'm part of the NBA in the way I'm supposed to be.\u201d",
      "The song will serve as the signature sound of NBA on Prime each week starting with the upcoming season. It was recorded with a 70-piece orchestra at a studio in Nashville.",
      "The trio \u2014 whose credits span hip-hop, jazz and soul \u2014 produced three versions of the score including orchestral, hip-hop and rock.",
      "Manny Marroquin, a Grammy-winning engineer, will mix the final recordings before the theme\u2019s Oct. 24 debut during Prime Video\u2019s opening-night doubleheader featuring the Boston Celtics at the New York Knicks and the Minnesota Timberwolves at the Los Angeles Lakers.",
      "Poyser said it was important for the team to create a melody that could live in fans' heads long after the broadcast.",
      "\u201cWe knew it had to be something that you could just hum,\u201d said the three-time Grammy winner. \u201cLike when you hear it, you got to be able to remember the melody.\u201d",

      "For Common, the project felt like destiny fulfilled.",

      "The collaborators hope \u201cVictory\u201d resonates for many generations \u2014 much like NBC\u2019s \u201cRoundball Rock\u201d \u2014 and opens doors for more artists of color in sports scoring.",

This natural weather phenomenon often turbocharges the Atlantic hurricane season, but this La Nina may be too weak and fleeting to cause much trouble.",
      "In the United States, La Nina often means more precipitation \u2014 including possible snowstorms \u2014 in northern areas and winter dryness in the South. It can bring heavier rains in Indonesia, the Philippines, parts of Australia, Central America, northern South America and southeastern Africa. It also can mean drought in the Middle East, eastern Argentina, eastern China, Korea and southern Japan, meteorologists said.",
      "A La Nina occurs when certain parts of the Central Pacific Ocean cool by half a degree Celsius (0.9 degrees Fahrenheit) compared to normal. The world had been flirting with one this year and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration declared Thursday that La Nina conditions have formed. But it's likely to be not very strong and may disappear in the next few months, based on multi-factor computer model forecasts by NOAA and Columbia University, said Michelle L'Heureux, lead scientist on the NOAA team that studies both La Nina and El Nino.",
      "\"There is a three out of four chance it will remain a weak event,\" L'Heureux said in an email. \u201cA weaker event tends to exert less of an influence on the global circulation, so it's possible there will be surprises ahead.\u201d",
      "Surprising already describes the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, which was forecast to be stronger than normal, but so far is a tad below average in activity. Traditionally, during a La Nina, there's a weakening of the wind shear that hampers hurricane formation and strengthening, allowing more and bigger storms, especially later in the year, such as late October and into early November and in the Caribbean, said University of Albany hurricane expert Brian Tang.",
      "But Brian McNoldy, who studies tropical cyclones, sea level rise and extreme heat at the University of Miami, said he thinks this La Nina is too late and too little to do much.",

      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 iPhone users have a new tool to combat the scourge of nuisance phone calls: a virtual gatekeeper that can screen incoming calls from unknown numbers.",
      "It's among the bevy of new features that Apple rolled out with last month's release of iOS 26. The screening feature has been getting attention because of the ever-increasing amount of robocalls and spam calls that leave many phone users feeling harassed.",
      "Here's a run-through of the new function:",
      "First, you'll need to update your iPhone's operating system to iOS 26, which is available to the iPhone 11 and newer models.",
      "To switch call screening on, go into Settings--Apps\u2014Phone. Scroll down and you'll find a new option: Screen Unknown Callers.",
      "You'll be presented with three choices. The Never option lets any unknown call ring through, while Silence sends all unidentified numbers directly to voicemail. What you want to tap is the middle option: Ask Reason for Calling.",
      "If the option isn't there, try restarting your phone.",
      "I still couldn't find it after updating to iOS 26, but, after some online sleuthing, I checked my region and language settings because I saw some online commenters reporting they had to match. It turns out my region was still set to Hong Kong, where I lived years ago. I switched it to the United Kingdom, which seemed to do the trick and gave me the updated menu.",
      "Call screening introduces a layer between you and new callers.",
      "When someone who's not in your contacts list dials your number, a Siri-style voice will ask them to give their name and the purpose of their call.",
      "At the same time, you'll get a notification that the call is being screened. When the caller responds, the answers will be transcribed and the conversation will pop up in speech bubbles.",
      "You can then answer the call.",
      "Don't want to answer? Send a reply by tapping one of the pre-written messages, such as \u201cI'll call you later\u201d or \u201cSend more information,\u201d which the AI voice will read out to the caller.",
      "Or you can type out your own message for the computer-generated voice to read out.",
      "If you don't respond right away, the phone will continue to ring while you decide what to do.",
      "In theory, call screening is a handy third way between the nuclear option of silencing all unknown callers \u2014 including legitimate ones \u2014 or letting them all through.",

      "\u201cBubbles obviously are never very easy to identify, but we can see there are a few potential symptoms of a bubble in the current situation,\u201d said Adam Slater, lead economist at Oxford Economics.",
      "Those symptoms include rapid growth in tech stock prices, the fact that tech stocks now comprise about 40% of the S&P 500, market valuations that appear \u201cstretched\u201d beyond their worth and \u201ca general sense of extreme optimism in terms of the underlying technology, despite the enormous uncertainties around what this technology might ultimately yield,\u201d Slater said.",
      "The most optimistic projections about the fruits of generative AI products foresee a transformation of the economy, leading to annual productivity gains that Slater says have not been seen since the reconstruction of Europe after World War II. At the lower end, economist Daron Acemoglu of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has predicted a \u201cnontrivial but modest\u201d U.S. productivity gain of just 0.7% over a decade.",

With tech stocks accounting for an increasingly large share of benchmark stock indexes, stock markets are \u201cparticularly exposed should expectations around the impact of AI become less optimistic.\u201d",
      "The bank outlined so-called downside risks, including shortages of electricity, data or chips that could slow AI progress, or technological changes that could lessen the need for the type of AI infrastructure currently being built around the world.",
      "The IMF's Georgieva said current stock valuations \u201care heading toward levels we saw during the bullishness about the internet 25 years ago. If a sharp correction were to occur, tighter financial conditions could drag down world growth,\u201d she said.",

      "From capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or sucking water out of dry desert air, the trio's new form of molecular architecture can absorb and contain gases inside stable metal organic frameworks.",
      "The frameworks can be compared to the timber framework of a house, and Hermione\u2019s famous beaded handbag, in that they are small on the outside but very large on the inside, according to Olof Ramstr\u00f6m, a member of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry.",
      "The chemists worked separately but added to each other\u2019s breakthroughs, which began in 1989 with Robson.",
      "\u201cMetal-organic frameworks have enormous potential, bringing previously unforeseen opportunities for custom-made materials with new functions,\u201d Heiner Linke, chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry, said in a news release.",
      "The committee cited the potential for using the frameworks to separating so-called \u201cforever chemicals\u201d from water.",
      "Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, are a group of chemicals that have been around for decades and have now spread into the air, water and soil. They are also referred to as \u201cforever chemicals.\u201d",
      "Hans Ellegren, secretary-general of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, announced Wednesday's prize in Stockholm. It was the third prize announced this week.",
      "Robson, 88, is affiliated with the University of Melbourne in Australia, Kitagawa, 74, with Japan\u2019s Kyoto University and Yaghi, 60, with the University of California, Berkeley.",
      "Kitagawa spoke to the committee, and the press, over the phone Wednesday after his win was announced.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m deeply honored and delighted that my long-standing research has been recognized,\" he said.",

      "Tesla has talked about a cheaper car to appeal to more cost-conscious consumers for years, though the two new \u201cstandard\u201d models are priced well above the $25,000 price tag promised. They come as customers are widely expected to hold off from purchases over the next several months due to the recent expiration of a $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles.",

      "Google also said it faced an Oct. 22 deadline to begin complying with the judge's order if the Supreme Court didn't grant its request for a stay. The Mountain View, California, company was seeking the protection while pursuing a last-ditch attempt to overturn the December 2023 jury verdict that condemned the Play Store as an abusive monopoly.",

      "Google had been insulated from the order while trying to overturn it and the monopoly verdict, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected that attempt in a decision issued two months ago.",
      "In its filing with the Supreme Court, Google argued it was being unfairly turned into a supplier and distributor for would-be rivals.",
      "Donato concluded the digital walls shielding the Play Store from competition needed to be torn down to counteract a pattern of abusive behavior. The conduct had enabled Google to to reap billions of dollars in annual profits, primarily from its exclusive control of a payment processing system that collected a 15-30% fee on in-app transactions.",

      "Mexico's use of the system helped it overturn a penalty decision in a match they ended up tying 2-2 against Spain. It also led to Paraguay winger Enso Gonz\u00e1lez being red-carded after kicking South Korea striker Hyeon-oh Kim.",
      "Unlike VAR, which uses special cameras and a supporting team of officials, FVS referees review their decisions based on images captured by the television broadcast, without further assistance.",

      "STOCKHOLM -- STOCKHOLM (AP) \u2014 Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.",
      "Brunkow, 64, is a senior program manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle. Ramsdell, 64, is a scientific adviser for Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco. Sakaguchi, 74, is a distinguished professor at the Immunology Frontier Research Center at Osaka University in Japan.",

      "She said she had ignored the earlier call from the Nobel committee. \u201cMy phone rang and I saw a number from Sweden and thought: \u2018That\u2019s just, that\u2019s spam of some sort.'\u201d",

      "The immune system has many overlapping systems to detect and fight bacteria, viruses and other bad actors. Key immune warriors such as T cells get trained on how to spot bad actors. If some instead go awry in a way that might trigger autoimmune diseases, they\u2019re supposed to be eliminated in the thymus \u2014 a process called central tolerance.",
      "The Nobel winners unraveled an additional way the body keeps the system in check.",
      "The Nobel Committee said it started with Sakaguchi\u2019s discovery in 1995 of a previously unknown T cell subtype now known as regulatory T cells or T-regs. Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.",
      "The Nobel Committee said two years later, Sakaguchi linked the discoveries to show that the Foxp3 gene controls the development of those T-regs \u2014 which in turn act as a security guard to find and curb other forms of T cells that overreact.",
      "Brunkow said she and Ramsdell were working together at a small biotech company and they were investigating why a particular strain of mice had an over-active immune system. They had to work with brand new techniques to find the mouse gene behind the problem \u2014 but quickly realized it could be a major player in human health, too",

      "The Senate voted Thursday to repeal the resolution that authorized the 2003 U.S. invasion, following a House vote last month that would return the basic war power to Congress.",
      "The amendment by Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, a Democrat, and Indiana Sen. Todd Young, a Republican, was approved by voice vote to an annual defense authorization bill that passed the Senate late Thursday \u2014 a unanimous endorsement for ending the war that many now view as a mistake.",
      "Iraqi deaths were estimated in the hundreds of thousands, and nearly 5,000 U.S. troops were killed in the war after President George W. Bush\u2019s administration falsely claimed that then-President Saddam Hussein was stockpiling weapons of mass destruction.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the way the war ends, not with a bang but a whimper,\u201d Kaine said after the vote, which lasted only a few seconds with no debate and no objections. Still, he said, \u201cAmerica is forever changed by those wars, and the Middle East is too.\u201d",
      "Supporters in both the House and Senate say the repeal is crucial to prevent future abuses and to reinforce that Iraq is now a strategic partner of the United States. The House added a similar amendment to its version of the defense measure in September, meaning the repeal is likely to end up in the final bill once the two chambers reconcile the two pieces of legislation. Both bills also repeal the 1991 authorization that sanctioned the U.S.-led Gulf War.",
      "While Congress appears poised to pass the repeal, it is unclear whether President Donald Trump will support it. During his first term, his administration cited the 2002 Iraq resolution as part of its legal justification for a 2020 U.S. drone strike that killed Iranian Gen. Qassim Soleimani. It has otherwise been rarely used.",

As James mounted a lawsuit claiming that Trump's business persona was built partly on lies, he returned fire, calling her \u201cgrossly incompetent\u201d and \u201can evil person.\"",
      "James, a Democrat, and Trump, a Republican, have long been legal and political foes, tangling in dozens of lawsuits over the years.",
      "On Thursday, Trump's Justice Department indicted James on mortgage fraud charges after he vowed revenge on his enemies, escalating a feud that has persisted since she campaigned for attorney general in 2018. She has denied wrongdoing.",
      "Here's a look at some of James and Trump's legal tussles:",
      "James sued Trump after his first term, alleging in September 2022 that he inflated his net worth by billions of dollars by misleading banks and insurers about the value of assets such as Trump Tower and the Mar-a-Lago property in Florida. She dubbed it \u201cThe art of the steal,\u201d a twist on the title of Trump's memoir. After a trial, a judge ordered Trump last year to pay a massive monetary penalty. An appeals court later threw out the penalty, which had grown to more than $500 million with interest, but affirmed a lower-court finding that Trump committed fraud. James is now asking the state's highest court to reinstate the penalty, while Trump is seeking to have other non-monetary punishments lifted.",
      "Trump sparred with James at a deposition for her civil fraud lawsuit in April 2023. Answering questions for seven hours at her Manhattan office, he told her that \u201cthe whole case is crazy\u201d and accused her staff of trying to trip him up like fictional TV lawyer Perry Mason did to witnesses. A few months later, they came face-to-face again as Trump testified at trial. Trump looked away from James and scowled as he walked past her on the way into court. On the witness stand, he accused her of pursuing him to advance her career. \u201cShe\u2019s a political hack, and this is a disgrace that a case like this is going on,\u201d he testified, adding that James \u201cshould be ashamed of herself.\u201d",
      "Working with a coalition of Democratic state attorneys general, James sued Trump and his administration multiple times since he returned to the White House in January, challenging everything from cuts to funding for counterterrorism and public safety to plans to deploy National Guard troops in Oregon. Those efforts began the day after Trump took office with a lawsuit challenging his effort to overturn birthright citizenship. Other lawsuits have challenged the work of Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency, mass firings of federal workers and the revocation of temporary protected status for Venezuelans.",

      "During his first term, James sued the administration at least 66 times in a two-year span, challenging policies on environmental, immigration and education policy, health care and other issues. She fought his plans to include a question about immigration status on the Census, winning in the U.S. Supreme Court, and sued the U.S. Postal Service over slowdowns before the 2020 election. Other major victories during the first term included restoring what\u2019s known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals or DACA, which allows people who came to the country unlawfully as children to remain, and a ruling that barred immigration authorities from arresting people at courthouses.",
      "James teamed with then-Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. to bring tax fraud charges against the Trump Organization and Allen Weisselberg, its chief financial officer. The company was convicted in 2022 of helping its executives dodge taxes on extravagant perks such as Manhattan apartments and luxury cars. James assigned two lawyers to work with Vance\u2019s office after uncovering evidence of potential criminal wrongdoing. James was not involved when Trump was prosecuted last year by Alvin Bragg, the current District Attorney, and convicted of falsifying business records.",
      "In 2019, James finalized an agreement brokered by her predecessor dissolving his charitable foundation and forcing him to pay $2 million to various nonprofits as a fine for misspending funds to further his political and business interests. The Trump Foundation\u2019s $1.7 million in remaining funds were also given away. Trump acknowledged in a court filing that he allowed campaign staff to coordinate with the charity for a veterans fundraiser before the 2016 Iowa caucuses. He also admitted to arranging for it to pay $10,000 for a 6-foot (1.8-meter) portrait of him and the spending of $11,525 in foundation funds on sports memorabilia and Champagne at a charity gala.",
      "Trump sued James in 2021 in an attempt to block her from investigating him and his businesses. After a federal judge in New York quickly threw out the case, Trump sued her again in Florida. A judge there refused to block the probe, writing in December 2022: \u201cThis litigation has all the telltale signs of being both vexatious and frivolous.\u201d Trump abandoned efforts to revive his first lawsuit against James after the Florida judge rejected a lawsuit he filed against his 2016 presidential election rival Hillary Rodham Clinton. In tossing that case, U.S. District Judge Donald M. Middlebrooks ordered Trump and one of his lawyers \u2014 Alina Habba, currently acting U.S. attorney in New Jersey \u2014 to pay nearly $1 million for filing frivolous lawsuits for political purposes, which the judge said amounted to a \u201cpattern of abuse of the courts.\u201d",

      "A federal grand jury in Chicago on Wednesday indicted Devon Horton, currently superintendent of the 93,000-student DeKalb County school district, on 17 counts including wire fraud, embezzlement and tax evasion. The indictment alleges the 48-year-old Horton issued more than $280,000 in contracts to three friends and received more than $80,000 in kickbacks from 2020 through 2023 while he was superintendent of the Evanston-Skokie school district.

      "The sheriff\u2019s office for metro Phoenix has spent millions of dollars budgeted for compliance costs in a racial profiling case over Joe Arpaio\u2019s immigration crackdowns on things that had little or nothing to do with a court-ordered overhaul of the agency",
      "PHOENIX -- PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 The sheriff\u2019s office for metro Phoenix spent millions of dollars budgeted for compliance costs in a racial profiling case over Joe Arpaio\u2019s immigration crackdowns on things that had little or nothing to do with a court-ordered overhaul of the agency, according to an expert\u2019s report.",
      "The report released Wednesday criticized the use of compliance money by the Maricopa County Sheriff\u2019s Office to fund personnel costs and tasks, either in part or in full, that aren\u2019t connected to the overhaul.",
      "It also pointed out inappropriate spending: $2.8 million for surplus body-worn camera licenses that went beyond the court\u2019s orders; $1.5 million in renovations in the relocation of an internal affairs office; over $1.3 million to buy 42 vehicles; and an $11,000 golf cart to bring staff from headquarters to the internal affairs operation, even though the department was leasing parking space at the latter location.",
      "For over a decade, Maricopa County taxpayers have picked up the bill for remedying constitutional violations found in a 2013 profiling verdict over then-Sheriff Arpaio\u2019s traffic patrols targeting immigrants.",
      "The racial profiling case centered on 20 large-scale traffic patrols launched by Arpaio that targeted immigrants from January 2008 through October 2011. That led to the profiling verdict and expensive court-ordered overhauls of the agency\u2019s traffic patrol operations and, later, its internal affairs unit.",
      "The county says $323 million has been spent so far on legal expenditures, a staff that monitors the sheriff's department's progress and the agency's compliance costs. The county has said the total is expected to reach $352 million by July 2026.",
      "The federal judge presiding over the case expressed concerns about transparency in spending by the sheriff\u2019s office and ordered a review, leading to the blistering report from budget analysts. The report was prepared by budget analysts picked by the case's monitor.",
      "The report concluded 72% of the $226 million in spending by the sheriff\u2019s office from February 2014 to late September 2024 was either wrongly attributed or \u201cimproperly prorated\u201d to a compliance fund.",
      "Budget analysts who reviewed hundreds of employee records over roughly that time period found an average of 70% of all positions funded by compliance money were \u201cinappropriately assigned or only partially related to compliance.\u201d",
      "Those expenditures were unrelated to or unnecessary for compliance, lacked appropriate justification or resulted from purposeful misrepresentation by the sheriff\u2019s office, county leaders or both, the budget analysts wrote.",
      "Sheriff Jerry Sheridan\u2019s office released a statement saying its attorneys are reviewing the report to identify areas of common concern and any findings it may dispute. Sheridan, who took office this year, is the fourth sheriff to grapple with the case.",

      "Beginning earlier this year, county officials ramped up their criticism of the spending. They said the agency shouldn\u2019t still be under the court\u2019s supervision a dozen years after the verdict and shouldn\u2019t still be paying such hefty bills, including about $30 million to those who monitor the agency on behalf of the judge since around 2014.",
      "The report criticized Maricopa County and its governing board for a lack of oversight over the spending.",
      "Thomas Galvin, chairman of the county\u2019s governing board and a leading critic of the continued court supervision, said the board\u2019s legal counsel is reviewing the report. \u201cThe board has confidence in MCSO\u2019s budgeting team and will respond accordingly,\u201d Galvin said.",
      "Since the profiling verdict, the sheriff\u2019s office has been criticized for disparate treatment of Hispanic and Black drivers in a series of studies of its traffic stops. The latest study, however, shows significant improvements. The agency\u2019s also dogged by a backlog of internal affairs cases. While the agency has made progress on some fronts and garnered favorable compliance grades in certain areas, it hasn\u2019t yet been deemed fully compliant with the court-ordered overhauls.",

      "A Texas appeals court has paused the execution of Robert Roberson, who was set to be the first in the U.S. executed for a murder linked to shaken baby syndrome",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- AUSTIN, Texas (AP) \u2014 A Texas court's pause of the execution of Robert Roberson just days before he was set to die is likely to raise new arguments and scrutiny over cases that rely on the medical science and evidence in a diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome.",
      "Roberson would have been the first person in the nation executed in a case tied to shaken baby syndrome. He remains on death row for now, but the pause in his execution \u2014 the third since 2016 \u2014 not only buys him more time, but also possibly a new trial.",
      "Thursday's ruling by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals leaned into a decade-old state law that allows courts to review convictions based on science that has changed or been debunked, and a recent court ruling that overturned a conviction in another shaken baby case.",
      "Roberson, 58, was convicted in 2003 in the death of his 2-year-old daughter Nikki Curtis. He had been scheduled to receive a lethal injection on Oct. 16. The ruling did not overturn his conviction or immediately reduce his sentence.",
      "Critical to Roberson's case was the trial evidence of shaken baby syndrome, which refers to a serious brain injury caused when a child\u2019s head is hurt through shaking or some other violent impact, such as being slammed against a wall or thrown on the floor.",
      "Shaken baby syndrome has come under scrutiny in recent years; some lawyers and medical experts say the diagnosis has wrongly sent people to prison. Prosecutors and medical societies say it remains valid.",
      "In 2013, Texas lawmakers passed a measure nicknamed the \u201cjunk science law\u201d that allows courts to take a second look at a case if the science anchoring a conviction evolves or is debunked. But that law has not yet led to a new trial for a death-row inmate.",
      "That law was the basis in part of a delay in execution for Roberson back in 2016, but he was not granted a new trial and he remained on death row.",
      "Thursday's ruling cited the court's own decision last year to overturn the conviction of a Dallas man sent to prison for 35 years based on a similar shaken baby diagnosis. In that case, the court said the medical evidence and expert testimony might have been different if presented under 2024 scientific standards.",

(AP) \u2014 The Florida city of St. Petersburg, long a bastion of LGBTQ+ rights and mindful of its racially segregated past, is considering approval of two flags recognizing those issues after Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis ordered similar street murals erased because of supposedly political messages.",
      "The St. Petersburg City Council is set to vote Thursday afternoon on the flags, which were designed by an artist who did one of the main erased street murals. The resolution's sponsor, council member Gina Driscoll, said the goal is to assure residents and visitors that the city remains committed to diversity and inclusion.",
      "\u201cAs with most art, these flags and their colors have a meaning to each person that is as unique as we are,\u201d Driscoll said before the vote. \u201cFlags are a reflection of a city's identity, and these flags will go a step further in representing the people of St. Petersburg \u2014 all of us.\u201d",
      "One flag is dubbed \u201cHarmony\u201d and includes the city seal with a rainbow design. The city has long been known as a welcoming place for LGBTQ people and each year hosts one of the largest gay pride celebrations in the country. It also is a city where colorful murals are painted on buildings everywhere.",
      "The other flag, dubbed \u201cHistory,\u201d is a nod to the Black experience in St. Petersburg, which was once heavily segregated. In one example, Black police officers for years were prevented from arresting white people north of the Central Avenue boundary that cuts through downtown. A federal judge eventually overturned that practice.",
      "The flags are in reaction to a decision by DeSantis to erase street art around the state \u2014 the governor contends many are inappropriate roadway political messages \u2014 including at least five murals in St. Petersburg. One of those painted-over intersections was designed by artist Andrea Pawlisz, who also gave the flag designs to the city.",

      "NEW ORLEANS -- NEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 All 10 fugitives who made a brazen escape from a New Orleans jail in May are back in custody after the last inmate who was still on the run was captured hiding in the basement crawl space of an Atlanta home.",
      "Derrick Groves, 28, was found Wednesday holed up beneath the home by a police dog sent inside after an Atlanta Police Department SWAT team spent hours searching the home and deploying tear gas into it.",
      "The other nine inmates had been recaptured within six weeks of the May 16 breakout, most of them in Louisiana.",

      "Groves and nine other men made the audacious overnight escape by fleeing through a hole behind a toilet and scaling a wall while the lone guard assigned to their cell pod at the New Orleans jail was away getting food.",
      "The men scaled a fence and used blankets to avoid being cut by barbed wire. Surveillance footage showed some of them sprinting across a nearby interstate and into a neighborhood.",
      "Following the jailbreak, law enforcement tracked down three escapees within 24 hours and most of the others within the next few weeks. While some of the fugitives roamed through nightlife hot spots and another made Instagram posts, Groves had kept keep a low profile.",
      "The tip leading to Groves' capture came in via New Orleans Crimestoppers, an anonymous tip program, said Deputy U.S. Marshal Brian Fair. Groves was the only person in the house, and no one else was arrested.",

      "The garage door of the brick house was collapsed inward and blocked off by police after Groves was taken into custody. The home is in a neighborhood beside Tyler Perry Studios, one of the nation\u2019s largest movie production facilities.",
      "\u201cBased on how long it took a seasoned, well-trained SWAT team to get him out, he had planned to hide for a while,\" Fair said.",

(AP) \u2014 Century-old wreaths made from human hair fill the walls of Leila\u2019s Hair Museum, and glass cases overflow with necklaces and watch bands woven from the locks of the dead. There also are tresses purported to come from past presidents, Hollywood legend Marilyn Monroe and even Jesus.",
      "For about 30 years, this hair art collection in the Kansas City suburb of Independence attracted an eclectic group of gawkers that included the likes of heavy metal legend Ozzy Osbourne.",
      "But the museum's namesake, Leila Cohoon, died last November at the age of 92. Now her granddaughter, Lindsay Evans, is busy rehoming the collection of more than 3,000 pieces to museums across the country, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington, D.C.",
      "\u201cEvery time I come here, I feel her here,\u201d Evans said Monday while touring with representatives of the National Museum of Funeral History in Houston who left with around 30 pieces. \u201cThis place is her. And so I feel like this process of rehoming her collection has helped me grieve her in a way that I didn\u2019t even realize I really needed.\u201d",
      "It all started in 1956 when Cohoon, a hair dresser, was shopping for Easter shoes. Inside an antique store she found a gold frame filled with strands of hair twisted into the shape of flowers.",

      "This form of art peaked in popularity in the mid-1800s as women coiled the hair of the dead into jewelry or told their family history by intertwining the curls of loved ones into wreaths.",
      "But hair art had fallen out of favor by the 1940s, as memories were captured in photos, Evans said. Additionally, \u201cthis artwork was not celebrated because it was mostly done by women. And so in larger museums, they don\u2019t have a lot of this.\u201d",
      "Her grandmother saved some from being trashed, wrote a book and taught classes on the art form, training a new generation of artists.",

      "The frames filled the walls of her home and the beauty school she ran with her husband. She shoved them under beds and in closets. Eventually, the couple snatched up this building \u2014 a former car dealership \u2014 nestled between a fast-food restaurant and car wash.",
      "Celebrities caught wind of the attraction. Actress and comedian Phyllis Diller donated a hair wreath that had been in her family for generations. TV personality Mike Rowe filmed an episode of \u201cSomebody\u2019s Gotta Do It\u201d here. There might also be a few strands from Osbourne inside. When he came to visit, Cohoon snipped a lock, although Evans has yet to find it.",
      "Evans said her grandmother was tight-lipped on what she spent over the years, but she anticipates the worth of the art may top $1 million.",
      "As Genevieve Keeney, the head of the National Museum of Funeral History in Houston, waded through the collection, she eagerly eyed the jewelry that memorialized the dead, including a small pin containing the locks of a 7-year-old girl who died in 1811.",

      "A federal judge in New York tossed out a defamation lawsuit that Drake brought against Universal Music Group, ruling that lyrics branding the superstar as a pedophile in Kendrick Lamar's Grammy-winning diss track \"Not Like Us\" were opinion.",
      "Judge Jeannette A. Vargas on Thursday  rejected the suit in a written opinion that began by citing \"the vitriolic war of words\" and saying the case arose \"from perhaps the most infamous rap battle in the genre's history.\"",

      "\"I think it's necessary because the world is in a place where there's a lot of hate ... there's a demonization of like the Latino community, of the queer community....and I think, you know, we need to remind each other that love is the answer - not hate,\" Lopez told \"CBS Mornings\" co-anchor Gayle King about the new film, \"Kiss of the Spider Woman,\" which hits theaters Friday.",
      "Lopez said she was \"immediately floored\" when she read the script for the film by writer and director Bill Condon, known for his work on \"Chicago\" and \"Dreamgirls.\" The movie is based on a 1970s novel by Manuel Puig, which Lopez described as being far ahead of its time.",
      "The story's central message focuses on a transgender character and a cisgender political revolutionary who come from completely different worlds but, through extraordinary circumstances, come to recognize each other's humanity and develop a deep bond.",
      "\"I thought to myself: this is something I've wanted to do my whole life,\" she said.",
      "Playing three \"very different characters\"",
      "Lopez said the last time she felt that same thrill was when she was preparing for her star role in \"Selena.\" In \"Kiss of the Spider Woman,\" Lopez plays three different versions of the same woman.",
      "\"They're the same person, but they're three very different iterations of this woman and they're all very different characters and they have very different looks as well. And that was fun. But I think the essence of who they were was very different, but still the same. And I think that was the challenge,\" Lopez explained.",
      "Lopez said the film's core message is about seeing past differences.",
      "\"When you forget about all those things, if you forget about somebody's political views and you forget, we're all entitled to our opinions about everything and our ways of thinking, and even, you know, from where we grew up and where we're from all over the world. But the truth is, we're all human, we're all the same. And if we can just see that we can allow people to be who they are and love each other anyway,\" she said.",
      "She also spoke about her character, Ingrid Luna, who appears in one musical sequence. In that scene, Ingrid helps another character escape the harsh reality of prison through a fantasy-like performance. The number, titled \"Where You Are,\" serves as an emotional moment of release, inviting the character to forget his surroundings and find comfort through imagination.",
      "\"And I think that's what art and music and movies...films do for people. You know, and especially in difficult times of their life, I know for me, it definitely has been that way,\" Lopez said.",

      "As\u00a0Bad Bunny now prepares to take the NFL's biggest stage\u00a0for the Apple Music Super Bowl LX halftime show, Lopez is sharing her appreciation for the artist as he encourages people to learn Spanish. She said the message behind his performance, much like her new film, centers on love and openness, encouraging people not to close themselves off to new experiences.",
      "\"Music and art transcends language. It doesn't matter,\" she said. \"And he's done that probably more than anybody of any generation he really has.\"",
      "Lopez said the Super Bowl gives artists a rare opportunity to reach new audiences and show who they are.",
      "\"It's about not having so many ideas and closing yourself off to experiences that you might be missing out on something wonderful. Don't do that to yourself. That's what I would say,\" she said.",
      "She praised a moment when Bad Bunny brought singer Marc Anthony, the father of Lopez's children, onstage during a concert in Puerto Rico.",
      "\"It couldn't have been a more perfect moment. And I didn't even see it. I know it was perfect-- God didn't let me see it, because I would've exploded. I would've died,\" Lopez said.",
      "For Lopez, it's always important to keep her mind and heart open, telling King she still considers herself a \"hopeful romantic\" - the term she told King she preferred over \"hopeless romantic\" in an interview in 2022.",
      "\"100%. 100%. And the more self aware I become with the lessons that I learn and the hardships that I go through, the more I feel whole and complete on my own, the more I become hopeful for that same type of person to come into my life,\" said Lopez. \"The more I know the more, you know, that type of person will come into my life. Yeah. And so I'm excited for everything in the future.\""

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bob-ross-paintings-auction-public-radio-broadcast-npr-pbs/",
    "published": "Tue, 07 Oct 2025 14:06:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Thirty paintings by Bob Ross are set to be auctioned to support public television stations after federal funding cuts.",
    "story": [
      "Thirty paintings created by the bushy-haired, soft-spoken Bob Ross will soon be up for auction to defray the costs of programming for small and rural public television stations suffering under cuts in federal funding.",
      "Ross, a public television stalwart in the 1980s and '90s, \"dedicated his life to making art accessible to everyone,\" said Joan Kowalski, president of Bob Ross Inc. \"This auction ensures his legacy continues to support the very medium that brought his joy and creativity into American homes for decades.\"",
      "The 30 paintings to be auctioned span his career. Most were created on-air during single episodes of Ross' show, \"The Joy of Painting.\" Ross was known for his calm demeanor. During the show, he often spoke about painting happy little clouds and trees, and making no mistakes, only \"happy accidents.\" He died of cancer complications in 1995.",
      "Bonhams in Los Angeles will auction three of Ross' paintings on Nov. 11. Other auctions will follow in London, New York, Boston and online. Bonhams sold two early 1990s mountain-and-lake scenes of Ross in August for $114,800 and $95,750.",
      "The auctions of the 30 paintings soon to be sold have an estimated total value of $850,000 to $1.4 million, Bonhams said. All profits are pledged to stations that use content from distributor American Public Television.",
      "The idea is to help stations in need with licensing fees that allow them to show popular programs that include \"The Best of Joy of Painting,\" based on Ross' show, \"America's Test Kitchen,\" \"Julia Child's French Chef Classics\" and \"This Old House.\"",
      "As desired by President Donald Trump, Congress has eliminated $1.1 billion allocated to public broadcasting, leaving about 330 PBS and 246 NPR stations to find alternative funding sources.",
      "Many stations launched emergency fund drives. Some stations have received more help than they expected, CBS News previously reported. North Carolina public radio station WQHR raised more than $200,000 in just three days, surpassing the $174,000 they needed to fill. Hawaii Public Radio lost $525,000, but donations raised $650,000.",
      "NPR has also encouraged donors in wealthier areas to support stations in regions that are in greater need. PBS and NPR have also worked to reduce the annual dues stations pay for programming and other services to lower their costs. Some stations are working on collaborations to see if they can share services and reduce costs.",
      "Still, the federal cuts have had an impact. Not all stations have seen an outpouring of donors. PBS slashed its budget by 21% and laid off about 100 employees in September. Stations have also had to lay off staff and reduce programming, CBS News previously reported. No stations have shut down yet, but operators are worried about what happens if donor money dries up.",
      "\"I am a realist,\" PBS president Paula Kerger said in September. \"I have to believe that there are some vulnerable stations that are not going to make it.\"",
      "National Public Radio president and CEO Katherine Maher\u00a0told CBS News in July\u00a0that defunding public media services \"is a real risk to the public safety of the country.\"",
      "\"Public media, public radio, public television, are a critical part of the emergency response plans of nearly half of the states in this nation,\" Maher said in an interview with CBS News. \"If these types of emergency alerting go away, you will have fewer outlets to be able to respond in real time\" to future natural disasters."

      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' lawyers want the hip-hop mogul sent to a low-security federal prison in New Jersey to serve his four-year, two-month prison sentence, telling a judge Monday that the facility's drug treatment program will help him stay clean.",
      "In a letter, Combs' lawyers urged the judge presiding over his case, Arun Subramanian, to \"strongly recommend\" that the federal Bureau of Prisons place Combs at FCI Fort Dix, a massive prison located on the grounds of the joint military base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst.",
      "FCI Fort Dix, one of several dozen federal prisons with a residential drug treatment program, will best allow Combs \"to address drug abuse issues and to maximize family visitation and rehabilitative efforts,\" Combs' lawyer Teny Geragos wrote. He also cited educational and occupational programs available at the prison, located about 70 miles south of New York City.",
      "The request from Combs' attorney came after Subramanian asked his lawyers on Friday at the sentencing hearing to let him know their preference for a prison facility.",
      "Also Monday, President Trump told reporters that Combs had asked him for a pardon. Mr. Trump, referring to Combs by the nickname \"Puff Daddy,\" did not say if he would grant the request. Messages seeking comment on Mr. Trump's remarks were left for Combs' lawyers and his publicity team by The Associated Press.",
      "Combs' sentencing for two prostitution-related charges capped a federal case that featured harrowing testimony about violence, drugs and so-called \"freak-offs,\" and exposed the sordid private life of one of the most influential figures in music.",
      "While the criminal case against Combs came to an end, he still faces civil lawsuits, including from a former stylist who accused Combs of sexually, physically and emotionally abusing him while he was working for Combs and his label, Bad Boy Entertainment \u2014 allegations that Combs has denied, with his legal team calling them \"falsehoods.\"",
      "Deonte' Nash alleged he was frightened throughout his roughly decade-long experience working for the music mogul. The 39-year-old stylist claims Combs choked him multiple times, describing one alleged incident that occurred after he went to a restaurant with R&B singer Cassie Ventura, Combs' ex-girlfriend whose testimony was critical in his conviction.",
      "The \"I'll Be Missing You\" singer was convicted in July under the federal\u00a0Mann Act, which bans transporting people across state lines for any sexual crime. His trial ended in a split verdict, with acquittals on sex trafficking and racketeering charges that could have put him behind bars for life.",
      "Combs has been locked up at a federal jail in Brooklyn, the Metropolitan Detention Center, since his September 2024 arrest. His time there will be subtracted from his sentence, meaning he could get out in about three years.",
      "In a letter to Subramanian on the eve of sentencing, Combs said he has gone through a \"spiritual reset\" in jail and is \"committed to the journey of remaining a drug free, non-violent and peaceful person.\"",
      "\"I thank God that I'm stronger, wiser, clean, clear and sober,\" he wrote.",
      "Subramanian has not yet acted on the request to recommend placement at FCI Fort Dix.",
      "Judges often make recommendations about where inmates should serve time, but it's up to the Bureau of Prisons to decide. Those decisions, the agency has said, are based on a variety of factors, including the severity of the offense, the required security level and an inmate's programming needs.",
      "FCI Fort Dix, the largest single federal prison by population with just under 3,900 inmates, is about 64 miles southwest of New York City, where Combs was born and rose to fame as a rapper and entrepreneur in an array of businesses, including fashion, television and liquor. An adjacent minimum-security prison camp has 210 inmates.",
      "Combs once owned a home in New Jersey, selling it nearly a decade ago.",
      "His primary residence, according to court papers, has been a $48 million mansion on an island near Miami. That home and a mansion he owns in Los Angeles were raided by federal agents last year during the investigation that led to his arrest.",
      "FCI Fort Dix has been home to a number of high-profile inmates over the years, including reputed mobsters, drug traffickers, corrupt politicians and Martin Shkreli. For a time, it was run by the warden who had been in charge of a Manhattan federal jail when financier Jeffrey Epstein killed himself at the jail in 2019. That warden, Lamine N'Diaye, has since retired.",
      "In 2021, a 27-year-old Fort Dix inmate was stabbed in the eyeball by a fellow prisoner.",
      "In 2019, a Fort Dix inmate, a former inmate and two other people were arrested for using a drone to smuggle in contraband including cellphones, tobacco, weight-loss supplements and eyeglasses. The same year, a Fort Dix correctional officer pleaded guilty in a separate case to pocketing bribes to smuggle in contraband.",
      "During his time at Fort Dix, Shkreli ended up in solitary confinement amid allegations he was using a contraband smartphone to run his drug company from behind bars. Inmates are forbidden from conducting business and possessing cellphones."

    "story": [
      "\"You have to admit, I've been misunderstood,\" said singer-songwriter Yusuf Islam. \"Even when I wrote 'Foreigner,' I started with the words, There are no words I can use because the meaning still leaves for you to choose. And so, the artist, to try and explain himself, has got to work a bit harder.\"",
      "In a way, music was a by-product of a lifelong search, says Islam (also known as Cat Stevens), who met with us backstage in London.",
      "I asked, \"Do you get something out of playing on stage that you don't, playing alone?\"",
      "\"I get scared,\" he replied. \"A lot of human beings out there!\"",
      "But this musical giant who got his start in the 1960s, and is now in his late 70s, can still move a crowd.",
      "Nicole Perry Ellis came to London's Hyde Park with her daughter Natasha to attend a Yusuf concert. She described it as a \"very emotional moment. Because before [Natasha] was born, we used to listen to the music when I was pregnant.\"",
      "Natasha described Yusuf as timeless: \"He has spirit, he has soul, and it transcends.\"",
      "\"I think my songs have always been kind of profound in some way,\" Yusuf said. \"A lot of them are so relevant to the world today. I mean, 'Wild World'? You know, come on! And 'Peace Train,' waiting for the train to arrive. Boy, do we need it, yeah. I mean they're relevant.\"",
      "His core themes have endured, as his name has gone through its evolutions. \"I had a girlfriend who looked at me one day and said, 'Ooh, you look like a cat.' And I went, 'What?' That stuck. And then I was looking for a name, because it was going to be difficult to go into the record store and ask for, like, Stephen Demetre Georgiou's latest album.\"",
      "\"Do you think you would have been as successful as Stephen Demetre Georgiou?\" I asked.",
      "\"There's no \u2026 you can't play with fate,\" he replied.",
      "In his new memoir, \"Cat on the Road to Findout,\" he explores family, faith, career, and ego.",
      "He writes that reaching superstardom in his teens was quite difficult. \"The problem with success is that it kind of detaches you from reality in some sense,\" he said. \"Who are you? Are you that person on the screen, on the stage, or is there something more to you? I was looking for some big answers.\"",
      "I asked, \"What all did you try, spiritually?\"",
      "\"Well, you know, the bookshop is full of lots of different views of life and beliefs and philosophies, so I was digging around everywhere. I think the most important thing was when I finally reached the Quran at the end. And that just brought everything together.\"",
      "He took the name Yusuf Islam, and \u2013 believing that music was haram, or forbidden \u2013 redirected his royalties to fund his charity efforts, auctioned off instruments, focused on family, and for nearly 30 years left music.",
      "Why did he believe music was forbidden? \"It took me time to realize that a lot of what I was told in the beginning when I became a Muslim was not exactly right,\" he said. \"You know, Islam doesn't forbid anything that's healthy and morally good.\"",
      "I asked, \"How do you reconcile the you who put that aside, with the you who embraced music again?\"",
      "\"You go through stages,\" Yusuf said. \"At one time you can fall in love, and next time you're having such an argument with a person, you say, 'What the hell, get out of my life!' You know, you change, your attitude changes according to circumstance. Context is key.\"",
      "He provides context to a controversial chapter regarding Salman Rushdie's novel \"The Satanic Verses,\" which inflamed the Muslim world \u2013 and the fatwa calling for the author's death. In 1989, in an appearance on a British TV program where hypothetical questions were posed, he was asked if he'd attend an effigy burning of Rushdie, to which he replied, \"I would have hoped that it would have been the real thing, but actually no, if it's just an effigy I don't think I would be that moved to go there.\"",
      "\"I mean, I've got a British sense of humor,\" Yusuf said. \"I took it in a kind of slightly comical direction. It wasn't a good thing to do, because nobody laughed. So, you know, I kind of, I made a mistake in thinking that people might get the joke. But it was a serious issue, so I shouldn't have really done that.\"",
      "\"The joke you mean, saying preferred the real thing, not the effigy?\"",
      "\"Whatever, whatever, whatever.\"",
      "\"When you saw the headlines after that, do you worry even today that \u2013 \"",
      "\"Let's get off this subject, please,\" Yusuf said.",
      "\"You bring it up in the book, so it seems \u2013 \"",
      "\"No, it was only a little part of the book.\"",
      "I said, \"But it seems like with this book you partially wanted to set the record straight from your perspective.\"",
      "\"That's right,\" Yusuf replied. \"I think I've done that.\"",
      "I asked, \"How is it to sit down and write something so personal, to go through the good, the bad, the ugly, the beautiful?\"",
      "\"I left quite a lot of the ugly out, actually, to be honest!\"",
      "\"You were hard on yourself.\"",
      "\"Really? That's nice to know. I tried to be honest in my writing of songs, and in the writing of my book.\"",
      "This singer-songwriter who once gave up fame for faith has now found his balance, performing as Yusuf/Cat Stevens.",
      "Asked how it is to be performing using both names, Yusuf/Cat Stevens replied, \"Actually, it's very symbolic in a way, because for a long time what I wanted to do was to separate myself in a way from my past, and I did that. So, joining these two names together actually forms the complete picture of, like, who I am. And you just have to listen to the songs. They're biographical in themselves. I didn't have to write a book, actually. You just buy the records, you know?\"",

    "story": [
      "He has been called the greatest actor of his generation \u2013 a three-time Oscar-winner, and reluctant star. \"The work itself has always been, has remained nothing but a source of fascination and pleasure to me, the work itself,\" said Daniel Day-Lewis. \"The aftermath of the work has always been difficult for me. You know, you become to some extent a sales rep for that work. And I'm not good at that. I never was. And I'm still not. And that particular part of it, the public part of it, has always left me feeling emptied out.\"",
      "And eight years ago, he announced his retirement. But now, a clarification: \"I think that was a mistake,\" he said. \"I think it just created a kind of confusion. At the time, I never intended to retire from anything. I chose to stop doing one kind of work so that I could perhaps concentrate on a different kind of work.\"",
      "It was part musical interlude: \"My youngest son, Cashel, is a fiddle player. And once the idea took root in my head, like, 'I wonder if I could make him a fiddle,' that was the \u2014 you know, things tend to, yeah, it's hard to let go of a thing.\"",
      "He made three, and he says he has the makings of a fourth, \"but I just haven't got down to it yet.\"",
      "Day-Lewis admits he was surprised to feel a strong impulse to return to acting: \"And largely it was in response to the knowledge that Ronan would be making films.\"",
      "Twenty-seven-year-old middle son Ronan Day-Lewis brings credentials and expectations: His mother, filmmaker and author Rebecca Miller, and grandfather, playwright Arthur Miller.",
      "I asked Ronan, \"Was your move to film a surprise to your parents?\"",
      "\"Not really, because I started making little movies with my friends when I was, like, seven,\" he replied. \"When I was really young, I would always be the one kind of annoyingly trying to corral everyone into making a little movie on our dad's, like, flip camera in the backyard or something.\"",
      "\"Anemone\" is his directorial debut, co-written with his father, who plays Ray Stoker. The story unfolds in a remote cabin. Ronan said, \"The first kind of concrete anchor, I think, was the idea of this man who's kind of in this form of self-exile, that he's living in the middle of nowhere. For some reason that pertains to his past, he's kind of separated himself and banished himself to this isolated place.\"",
      "After twenty years, his brother (played by Sean Bean) arrives to bring Ray Stoker back to the son he's never met. Daniel said, \"I felt I knew Ray fairly early on in the writing process. I don't know why I did. I just did. I can't explain it.\"",

      "Daniel Day-Lewis is legendary for his immersive preparation \u2013 as a fashion designer (\"Phantom Thread\"), in the boxing ring (\"The Boxer\"), in a wheelchair (\"My Left Foot\"). But after more than 20 film roles, one character remains elusive: Daniel Day-Lewis.",
      "I asked what drives him to such perfection.",
      "\"I've resisted analysis to a large extent because, maybe out of superstition, I thought it might interfere with the impulse, which was strong in me and still is,\" Daniel replied. \"But I mean, put on the spot I'd say it's got something to do with that period of time which was very bleak in my life when I was sent away to school.\"",
      "His mother, actress Jill Balcon, came from a prominent British film family. His father, Cecil Day-Lewis, who died when Daniel was 15, was well-known in literary circles \u2013 perhaps not so well-known at home.",
      "\"It's not that we never got to see him,\" said Daniel. \"He was a good man. But my only conversations that I remember having with him [was] when I was in trouble, which I was frequently for all kinds of different things. That's my memory of it. It may be a distorted memory.\"",
      "In 1968, his father was named poet laureate of the United Kingdom, and Daniel was sent to boarding school at 11. \"I felt like I was at sea,\" he said. \"I had no friends. I was being bullied. I was scrappy, but in that place you're considered to be, like, just outrageously uncivilized if you took a swipe at someone, which I did now and then.\"",
      "Despite pleading, he was left to tough it out: \"It was my father's decision. He believed I should stay there, and that I would feel a sense of defeat if I left. But I don't think, because he didn't really see me, he didn't understand the degree to which I was already defeated.\"",
      "And yet, boarding school is where he found his life's work. \"I did a few little bits and pieces in school plays,\" he said. \"And it wasn't the magic of the theater for me; it was the alternative world, where everything around me seemed fairly dark. That was a place that was illuminated for me.\"",
      "But stardom came with a darker side, as he was forewarned by the head of a prestigious summer theater program for teens 50 years ago. \"He launched into a kind of cautionary tale about the world of professional acting and the theater, about the sleaze and the corruption, and I was really quite na\u00efve at that time. But something about what he said that day stayed with me. I never wondered about the work, but I began to wonder about the world that I was going into. And so, I did reach a crossroads where I wondered whether perhaps I'd become a cabinet maker, a furniture maker, instead.\"",

    "story": [
      "Miley Cyrus has been in the public eye for most of her life, and while you might know her music, don't think you really know her.",
      "Asked what it's like to go through life and have strangers think they know her, Cyrus replied, \"I love my life, so I don't ever really have \u2013 I haven't made too much of a list of the things that are negative about it, 'cause there's so many great things. But I would say one of the things that I don't love and don't appreciate so much is when you meet somebody and they go, 'Wow, you're like, so cool. You're so smart. You're nothing like I thought you would be.' So yeah, that's a tough one.\"",
      "Her ninth album might not be what you'd expect, either. In \"Something Beautiful,\" Cyrus stretches herself artistically. As one critic put it, the album takes her from pop princess to legacy artist. That's quite a leap, even for someone with music in their blood.",
      "Miley's mom, Tish Cyrus Purcell, is a producer. Dad is country star Billy Ray Cyrus. Her godmother? Dolly Parton.",
      "Miley Cyrus lived with showbiz royalty, and that raspy voice, all her life: \"I've sounded like this since I was little. My dad used to have all the country singers come over to the house, and George Jones would, you know, joke that I had smoked cigarettes or been up all night, you know, even when I was four years old.\"",
      "At age 13, she was suddenly famous after being cast as \"Hannah Montana,\" in the Disney Channel series about a girl who was a typical teen by day and a pop star by night. It's a role she's still proud of: \"I love her. She's everything. I would have nothing, none of this \u2013 I mean, maybe I could've figured it out, maybe I could've gotten myself from Nashville, Tennessee, to Los Angeles. I don't know. But she did it a lot faster, and better, and set me up for the life that I have now. So love her, gratitude, all of that.\"",
      "The years after \"Hannah Montana\" were a bit less wholesome. Her 2013 MTV Music Video Awards performance was met with shock and outrage, especially among moms of young kids who had grown up watching her as a Disney star.",
      "I asked, \"There were moms that were trying to, I guess, cancel you?\"",
      "\"Yeah. I was the first person to maybe ever be canceled, I guess.\"",
      "\"How would you describe that time in your life?\"",
      "\"Well, you know, I didn't know until I was older actually how brutal it really was,\" Cyrus said. \"It was very, I guess, you know, challenging for other people. But for me it was a good time. It looked fun, and it was fun.\"",
      "Eventually it was all a little too much fun. Cyrus says she's been sober for a few years now.",
      "\"How has sobriety affected you?\" I asked.",
      "\"Well, I like showing up 100%, 100% of the time,\" Cyrus replied. \"The hardest part about balancing, you know, any sort of substance use or drinking when you want to do what I do is you're going, 'Okay, well, now I have to get sober for this thing, 'cause I wanna show up my best.' And now, I get to trim out so much of the preparation of getting yourself into the right place mentally and physically. I'm just always ready.\"",
      "Something she was ready for: \"Flowers,\" the biggest pop single of 2023, and her biggest record to date.",
      "She was also ready for this: Her first two Grammys, for best pop solo performance and record of the year, for \"Flowers.\" Accepting the Grammy she said, \"This award is amazing, but I hope it doesn't change anything, because my life was beautiful yesterday.\"",
      "For Miley Cyrus, today is looking good as well.",
      "\"Sunday Morning\" joined her this summer at L.A.'s Million Dollar Theatre, where she was shooting a music video for the deluxe version of \"Something Beautiful.\" The song is \"Secrets,\" and if you think it sounds a bit like Fleetwood Mac, you're right: you can hear drummer Mick Fleetwood and guitarist Lindsey Buckingham on the track.",
      "Miley sings about a white flag of surrender, and her outfit is basically a white flag in itself. She told us the song is meant as a peace offering to her dad, Billy Ray Cyrus. They'd been estranged since her parents' divorce in 2022.",
      "Asked how he reacted when she gave him the song, Miley replied, \"My dad cried. You know, you don't see your dad cry a lot. But with me and my dad, we just have always communicated better through music with each other.\"",
      "\"And you're at peace now with each other?\"",
      "\"Yeah.\"",
      "And at 32, it seems Miley Cyrus is at peace with herself.",
      "\"I think the authentic joy of doing what I want to do has always eclipsed the negatives for me,\" she said. \"I feel really good. And I really like who I am, and I like what I'm doing with my life. And I think if I was outside of myself, I would want to be a part of what I'm doing in any way that I could be. 'Cause I think what I'm doing is cool. So, that actually feels good. I like what I do. I like who I am.\"",

      "\"It would be more than my mortgage payment,\" Hunt said.",
      "The tax credits were authorized under the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021. The number of people who enrolled in ACA marketplace health insurance plans doubled from 11 million in 2020 to more than 24 million in 2025, largely because of those subsidies, according to KFF Health News.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 3.8 million Americans won't be able to afford health insurance without the tax credits by 2035, including two million by next year. Without the credit, the average ACA premium would double by about 114%, KFF Health News says.  \u00a0 \"When people lose health insurance, it can mean significant financial debt,\" said Sabrina Corlette, director for the Center for Health Insurance Reform at Georgetown University. \"...It also means that people are waiting to the last minute to get necessary care, often ending up in our emergency rooms.\"",

      "\"The people affected will come from red states, they'll come from blue states,\" Corlette said. \"...The folks who will be hit the hardest are in about 10 red states that have not expanded the Medicaid program.\"",
      "Hunt says she has reached out to lawmakers for help and hopes that they can work together.",
      "\"Why can't we just figure this out?\" Hunt asks.",
      "Corlette emphasized the ACA marketplaces are a safety net as more Americans move to gig work.\u00a0 Health care advocacy groups told CBS News those under the ACA will probably be notified in the next few weeks whether their premium will increase.",
      "\"It's for entrepreneurs, it's for freelancers,\" she said. \"It's for gig economy workers who are driving Ubers, or are doing Taskrabbit. So these are folks who are contributing to our economy.\""

    "story": [
      "Stockholm\u00a0\u2014 Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.",
      "Brunkow, 64, is a senior program manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle. Ramsdell, 64, is a scientific adviser for Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco. Sakaguchi, 74, is a distinguished professor at the Immunology Frontier Research Center at Osaka University in Japan.",
      "Brunkow got the news of her prize from an AP photographer who came to her home in the early hours of the morning.",
      "She said she had ignored the earlier call from the Nobel committee. \"My phone rang and I saw a number from Sweden and thought: 'That's just, that's spam of some sort.'\"",
      "\"When I told Mary she won, she said, 'don't be ridiculous,'\" said her husband, Ross Colquhoun.",
      "\"It was a nice surprise,\" Sakaguchi told a news conference from the University of Osaka in western Japan. \"I hope researches into the area will further progress so that our findings can be used in treatment, and I hope we can contribute to that as well.\"",
      "The immune system has many overlapping systems to detect and fight bacteria, viruses and other bad actors. Key immune warriors such as T cells get trained on how to spot bad actors. If some instead go awry in a way that might trigger autoimmune diseases, they're supposed to be eliminated in the thymus \u2014 a process called central tolerance.",
      "The Nobel winners unraveled an additional way the body keeps the system in check.",
      "The Nobel Committee said it started with Sakaguchi's discovery in 1995 of a previously unknown T cell subtype now known as regulatory T cells or T-regs. Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.",
      "The Nobel Committee said two years later, Sakaguchi linked the discoveries to show that the Foxp3 gene controls the development of those T-regs \u2014\u00a0which in turn act as a security guard to find and curb other forms of T cells that overreact.",
      "Brunkow said she and Ramsdell were working together at a small biotech company and they were investigating why a particular strain of mice had an over-active immune system. They had to work with brand new techniques to find the mouse gene behind the problem \u2014 but quickly realized it could be a major player in human health, too.",
      "\"From a DNA level, it was a really small alteration that caused this massive change to how the immune system works.\"",
      "The work opened a new field of immunology, said Karolinska Institute rheumatology professor Marie Wahren-Herlenius. Researchers around the world now are working to use regulatory T cells to develop treatments for autoimmune diseases and cancer.",
      "\"Their discoveries have been decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions and why we do not all develop serious autoimmune diseases,\" said Olle K\u00e4mpe, chair of the Nobel Committee.",
      "The award is the first of the 2025 Nobel Prize announcements and was announced by a panel at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm.",
      "Nobel announcements continue with the physics prize on Tuesday, chemistry on Wednesday and literature on Thursday. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday and the Nobel Memorial Prize in economics Oct. 13.",
      "The award ceremony will be held Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, who founded the prizes. Nobel was a wealthy Swedish industrialist and the inventor of dynamite. He died in 1896.",

      "The probe by the agency's Office of Defects Investigation involves Tesla vehicles equipped with \"FSD (Supervised)\" and \"FSD (Beta)\" versions of the the company's self-driving systems. Both require \"a fully attentive driver who is engaged in the driving task at all times,\" NHTSA said in a document filed as part of the probe.",

      "NHTSA has received reports of 58 safety violations linked to Tesla vehicles with FSD. Those incidents include more than a dozen crashes and fires, along with 23 injuries, according to the agency.",
      "U.S. regulators have  been investigating Tesla's automated driving systems for more than three years because of dozens of crashes that raised safety concerns, such as\u00a0a Seattle-area Tesla crash\u00a0in 2024 involving Full Self-Driving that killed a motorcyclist.",
      "\"The ultimate question is, 'Does the software work?'\" asked Seth Goldstein, a Morningstar analyst with a \"sell\" rating on Tesla shares stock.",

    "story": [
      "The IRS is adjusting the income limits for its federal income tax brackets to account for the impact of inflation, an annual reset that could provide relief for some Americans when they file their taxes next year.",
      "The IRS makes these adjustments, typically in October or November, to avoid what it known as \"bracket creep,\" which is when inflation pushes people into higher tax brackets, potentially forcing them to dole out more money come April.",
      "The upshot: Americans will have to earn more income next year before reaching a higher tax bracket. For example, the upper tax limit on a single filer making $50,000 will be 12% in 2026 versus 22% in 2025.",
      "See the updated tax brackets below.",
      "The IRS did not respond to a request for comment on the inflation rate it applied in adjusting its tax brackets for 2026. Bloomberg Tax forecasted last month that the agency would apply an inflation rate of 2.7%.",
      "In 2024, the IRS adjusted\u00a0its tax bracket thresholds by 5.4%\u00a0to account for the lingering inflation that erupted during the pandemic. That followed a\u00a0historically large adjustment\u00a0of 7% in 2023. The IRS uses Consumer Price Index data for the past 12 months to reset the brackets.",
      "Standard Deduction",
      "In addition to setting the federal income tax brackets, the IRS also released changes to 2026 standard deductions on Thursday.",
      "Married couples filing jointly will have a standard deduction of $32,200Heads of households will have a standard deduction of $24,150Single taxpayers and married individuals will face a standard deduction of $16,100",
      "Married couples filing jointly will have a standard deduction of $32,200",
      "Heads of households will have a standard deduction of $24,150",
      "Single taxpayers and married individuals will face a standard deduction of $16,100",
      "Seniors could see additional relief due to a provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that provides a temporary tax deduction of up to $6,000 for people aged 65 and older. The tax break, which is set to expire at the end of 2028, is available to those with an adjusted gross income of $75,000 or less for single filers and $150,000 or less for couples filing jointly.",
      "The IRS \u00a0announced Wednesday that an agency-wide furlough would begin on Oct. 8 due to a lapse in federal appropriations as a result of the government shutdown. Taxpayers with an Oct. 15 extension deadline should plan on submitting their returns as planned, according to the IRS.",
      "\"Taxpayers should continue to file, deposit, and pay federal income taxes as they normally would; the lapse in appropriations does not change Federal Income Tax responsibilities,\" a spokesperson told CBS News in an email.",
      "Understanding your tax bracket",
      "There's a misconception that Americans pay the top tax rate on every dollar of their income, but that isn't the case. Taxation in the U.S. is progressive, meaning that tax rates increase the more you earn. In other words, the seven income tax rate brackets \u2014 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35% and 37% \u2014 represent the percentage you'll pay on portions of your income.",
      "For instance, a single taxpayer making $50,000 in taxable income in 2026, will pay 10% in federal taxes on the first $12,400 of their income (the top threshold for the 10% bracket) and then 12% on the remaining $37,600.",
      "To determine your marginal tax bracket, you must first figure out what your highest taxable income is.",
      "For instance, a married couple with $150,000 in gross income would first subtract the 2026 standard deduction of $32,200 from that amount, leaving them with $117,800 in taxable income. That would put their top marginal tax rate at 22%. However, their effective tax rate is much lower:",
      "Their first $24,800 of income will be taxed at 10%, or $2,480 in taxesTheir earnings from $24,800 to $100,800 would be taxed at 12%, or $9,120 in taxes\u00a0Their income from $100,800 to $117,800 would be taxed at 22%, or $3,740 in taxes",
      "Their first $24,800 of income will be taxed at 10%, or $2,480 in taxes",
      "Their earnings from $24,800 to $100,800 would be taxed at 12%, or $9,120 in taxes",
      "Their income from $100,800 to $117,800 would be taxed at 22%, or $3,740 in taxes",
      "Combined, they would pay $15,340 in federal income taxes, giving them an effective tax rate of 13%.",
      "How the OBBBA will impact taxes",
      "The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law by President Trump in July, made most of the tax cuts from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent, helping some American taxpayers avert a scheduled tax increase.",
      "As a result of the Republican spending bill, the typical filer could see an average tax cut of $3,752 in 2026, with benefits varying depending on the filer's geographic location, according to an\u00a0analysis\u00a0in August from the Tax Foundation.",
      "A taxpayer's income will also influence the tax cuts they see, with higher-income Americans more likely to see a bigger benefit from tax provisions in the legislation than lower-income households.",
      "A July\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the Tax Policy Center found that the typical household in the bottom quintile \u2014 those earning up to $34,600 per year \u2014 will save an average of about $150 in tax payments in 2026, or 0.8% of their income. By comparison, those in the top quintile \u2014 those who earn $217,101 or more \u2014 will save an average of $12,540 next year, or 2.5% of their income."

      "The National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), the union representing the nation's air traffic controllers, on Monday instructed its members to keep working\u00a0during the\u00a0government shutdown. Because air traffic controllers are classified as essential workers, they're expected to continue working without pay, although they would receive back pay once the shutdown ends.",
      "\"It is normal for a few air traffic controllers to call in sick on any given day, and this is the latest example of how fragile our aviation system is in the midst of a national shortage of these critical safety professionals,\" NATCA said in statement.",
      "It added, \"NATCA has consistently warned that the controller staffing shortage leaves the system vulnerable, and today's events underscore the urgent need to accelerate training and hiring.\"",
      "The TSA has seen a slight increase in air traffic controllers\u00a0calling in sick\u00a0since the shutdown began last week, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Monday at a news conference at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey.",
      "\"We're tracking sick calls, sick leave. And have we had a slight tick up in sick calls? Yes,\" he told reporters. \"You'll see delays come from that. ...

      "Although a short U.S. government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",
      "$1 billion hit",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",
      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Transportation Department responded to requests for comment about the impact of a potential government shutdown on travel in the U.S.",
      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers. Although Amtrak receives some federal funding and could eventually be impacted if a shutdown dragged on, the rail service is financially healthy enough to pay workers in the near term and keep trains in operation, the group\u00a0said in a statement last week.",
      "Passport services are also deemed essential and would be expected to operate during a government shutdown."

    "summary": "The U.S. government shut down on Wednesday after Congress failed to approve funding for federal agencies. Here's how that could affect Social Security recipients.",
    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",
      "Benefit verificationsEarnings record corrections and updates unrelated to the adjudication of benefitsPayee accountingsPrisoner activities \u2014 suspensionRequests from third parties for queriesFreedom of Information Act requestsIT enhancement activities, public relations and trainingReplacement Medicare cardsOverpayments processing",

      "Freedom of Information Act requests",
      "IT enhancement activities, public relations and training",
      "Replacement Medicare cards",
      "Overpayments processing",
      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",
      "\"If you're a Social Security recipient, you're going to get your check, and that's obviously a good thing,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank focused on free trade, told CBS News."

      "As part of the refresh, the pizza chain also unveiled a new jingle called \"Dommmino's,\" stretching the brand name to include \"mmm.\" Customers can hear it at the end of Domino's new promotional video, which features singer Shaboozey, the Grammy-winning artist behind the popular track \"A Bar Song (Tipsy).\" Shaboozey also collaborated with Beyonc\u00e9 for two songs on her 2024 album Cowboy Carter.",

According to it's website, Domino's generates more than 85% of sales via digital ordering channels. In its July earnings\u00a0report, the company posted a 4.3% increase in revenue from the same quarter in 2024.",

    "summary": "Minutes from September Fed meeting reveal a divide between members who support additional rate cuts and those worried about inflation.",
    "story": [
      "Federal Reserve officials remain cautious about future interest rate cuts, with an account from the central bank's meeting in September underscoring the division among central bank officials over the best path for monetary policy.",
      "While some officials think the Fed's benchmark rate is too high and weighing on the economy, others point to persistent inflation that remains above the central bank's 2% target as evidence of the need need to show caution in lowering borrowing costs.",
      "Most members of the Fed's rate-setting committee supported further reductions to its key interest rate this year, according to minutes from last month's meeting released on Wednesday.",
      "A majority of Fed officials perceived growing risks to the job market since their previous meeting in July, while the threat of rising inflation \"had either diminished or not increased,\" according to the minutes. As a result, the central bank decided at its Sept. 16-17 meeting to reduce its key rate by a quarter of a percentage point, its first cut since December of 2024.",
      "\"The overall message appears to be that, although most participants are on board with further cuts, it probably won't take much for the FOMC to take a slower approach than it indicated last month,\" Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said in a research note. \"We still see scope for the Fed to skip its projected cut in December, based on our view that the economy and labor market will outperform current downbeat expectations.\"",
      "Fed rate cuts often gradually lead to lower borrowing costs for mortgages,\u00a0auto loans, credit cards and business loans, encouraging more spending and hiring.",
      "Only one official formally dissented from the quarter-point cut \u2014 Stephen Miran, who was appointed by President Trump and was approved by the Senate just hours before the meeting began. He supported a larger, half-point cut instead.",
      "But the minutes also noted that \"a few\" policymakers said they could have supported keeping rates unchanged, or said that \"there was merit\" in such a step.",
      "The differences help explain Chair Jerome Powell's statements during the news conference that followed the meeting: \"There are no risk-free paths now. It's not incredibly obvious what to do.\"",
      "Miran said in remarks Tuesday that he thinks inflation will steadily decline back toward the Fed's 2% target, and as a result he doesn't think the Fed's rate needs to be nearly as high as it is. Rental costs around the U.S. are steadily falling and will bring down inflation, he predicted, while higher tariff revenues will reduce the government's budget deficit and reduce longer-term interest rates, giving the Fed more room to cut.",
      "Yet ther Fed officials remain concerned about stubbornly high inflation, the minutes showed. Jeffrey Schmid, president of the Federal Reserve's Kansas City branch, said in a speech Monday that \"inflation is too high\" and argued that the Fed should keep rates high enough to cool demand and prevent inflation from worsening.",
      "\"Looking ahead, most participants indicated that additional policy easing would likely be appropriate later this year, provided inflation continued to trend lower and labor market risks persisted,\" EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco said in a research note assessing the latest Fed minutes. \"However, views diverged, with some participants noting that financial conditions were not particularly tight and warning against over-correcting.\"",
      "Austan Goolsbee, president of the Fed's Chicago branch, said in an interview Friday with The Associated Press that he supported a cautious approach toward further lowering rates, and wanted to see evidence that inflation would cool further.",
      "\"I am a little uneasy with front-loading rate cuts, presuming that those upticks in inflation will just go away,\" he said."

    "published": "Wed, 08 Oct 2025 15:12:26 -0400",
    "summary": "A range of factors has driven gold prices to record highs this year \u2014 a surge some Wall Street analysts think is likely to continue.",
    "story": [
      "Gold is glittering for investors, with prices now topping a record $4,000 an ounce. But the reasons behind the shiny metal's surge may be less than dazzling, with Wall Street analysts saying it reflects growing unease over the U.S. economy and political stability.",
      "The price of gold has leaped 53%\u00a0this year alone, far outpacing the 15% gain in the S&P 500 stock index over the same period. The price of an ounce of gold edged higher on Wednesday, touching $4,078, according to financial data company FactSet, with some analysts predicting it to go higher.",
      "Investors have long turned to gold during periods of economic turmoil and high inflation, viewing it as both a safe haven when markets turn volatile and a hedge against rising prices.",
      "Of late, however, stock prices have steamed to record highs this year, economic growth has accelerated in recent months and inflation this year has remained relatively subdued, prompting questions about what's fueling investors' renewed appetite for gold.",
      "\"$4,000 an ounce seemed far-fetched at the start of the year as gold entered 2025 near $2,800 an ounce. But after a ~50% rally, here we are,\" eToro U.S. investment analyst Bret Kenwell said in an email.",
      "The reasons for the surge boil down to several economic and political factors, according to Kenwell and other investment analysts.",
      "Economic uncertainty",
      "Gold is often a refuge for investors when they're worried about the economy, and the ongoing U.S. government shutdown is only fueling their anxieties, according to Nigel Green, CEO of investment firm deVere Group.",
      "\"The situation in Washington has reminded investors that political promises do not equate to financial security. Gold represents protection from that uncertainty, but its price now also reflects how much faith has drained from other assets. That level of dependence always carries risk,\" Green said in an email.",
      "Although the economy continues to expand, investors are also expressing concern about potential headwinds to growth, including the impact of U.S. tariffs and a weakening job market, according to economists.",
      "Federal agencies currently aren't releasing economic data due to the government shutdown, now in its second week. That makes it more difficult to get a handle on the state of the economy, said Kevin Ford, FX and macro strategist at Convera.",
      "\"[T]he US economy remains a challenge to read due to the ongoing government shutdown, which has severely diminished visibility,\" Ford noted. \"However, the shutdown is a material headwind: S&P Global Ratings estimates it could trim GDP growth by 0.1\u22120.2 percentage point for every week the government remains closed.\"",
      "Fed rate cuts",
      "In September, the Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark interest rate for the first time since late 2024 and signaled that two more cuts could be in the cards later this year.",
      "Gold has risen partly due to investor expectations that the Fed is entering a cycle of easing its monetary policy, according to Bart Melek, head of commodity strategy at TD Securities.",
      "With interest rates seemingly heading lower, gold is more attractive as a financial asset because investors aren't losing out on higher yields from Treasuries and other government bonds, he told investors in a report. And with inflation drifting up due to the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, gold can also continue to offer an inflation hedge.",
      "Gold \"may be a better safe-haven than Treasuries,\" Melek wrote. \"Add to that the fact that ore grades are dropping, the increased use of these factors of production suggests that gold would be better at protecting purchasing power.\"",
      "Global gold demand",
      "Investments in gold have also been driven by other factors. Analysts point to strong gold demand from central banks around the world amid heightened geopolitical tensions, such as the ongoing wars in Gaza and Ukraine.",
      "\"The gold rally started in 2022,\" Giovanni Staunovo, commodity analyst at UBS Global Wealth Management, said via email on Tuesday. The \"trigger point\" for the increase was when the U.S. and other Western allies moved to freeze around $300 billion of Russian foreign holdings at the beginning of the war in Ukraine, he added.",
      "Central banks in other nations are \"the quiet force behind this climb,\" deVere's Green said. \"They are buying close to one thousand [tons] of gold each year to reduce exposure to the dollar and to reinforce their financial resilience. When official institutions keep accumulating at this rate, they create a strong foundation beneath the market, but even that has limits.\"",
      "Where could gold go from here?",
      "Some investment pros think gold has more room to run, pointing to ongoing economic challenges such as the slowing U.S. job market and rising inflation, as well as the Fed likely continuing to push down borrowing costs.",
      "\"We think the rally is not yet done \u2014 we expect prices to rise to $4,200/oz over the coming months \u2014 and keep our 'attractive' rating on gold in our global strategy,\" Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, CIO Americas and global head of equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, told investors in an email.",
      "Goldman Sachs is forecasting that gold could hit $4,900 an ounce by December 2026, Reuters reported.",
      "Still, experts urge average investors not to put all their eggs in one basket. Critics say gold isn't always the inflation hedge many claim and that there are more efficient ways to protect against potential loss of capital, such as derivative-based investments.",
      "\"Gold is perceived by many market participants as a safe-haven asset. But investors need to be aware it has a volatility of 10-15%,\" Staunovo noted. He added that smaller amounts of physical gold, such as gold coins or 1-gram bars, have larger ranges between buying and selling prices."

      "Though she had been alerted that something might be wrong by a letter in the mail from an attorney offering assistance in warding off foreclosure, she said her lender never informed her that she was about to lose her home.",
      "\"They never called me and told me they were just going to rip my house right underneath me,\" Draxler told CBS News.",
      "Draxler's lender said it notifies all borrowers of a possible foreclosure by mail and by phone throughout the process, in compliance with federal debt collection rules.",
      "Before learning that her home was entering foreclosure, Draxler, who is 57 and on disability, said she stayed afloat financially by relying on her son, who contributed $600 a month to help take care of household expenses. But after he moved out in 2024, her bills began to pile up, she told CBS News. Draxler soon fell behind on her mortgage.",
      "The financial pressures bearing down on Draxler highlight the struggles of homeowners still grappling with the rising cost of everything from housing and\u00a0groceries to\u00a0energy bills\u00a0and insurance coverage. With many households stretched thin, unexpected events such as job loss, unplanned medical expense or even simple car problems can cause people to fall behind on their mortgages.",
      "\"I just couldn't do it anymore\"",
      "Although foreclosures \u2014 which include default notices, scheduled auctions or bank repossessions \u2014 remain well below their pre-pandemic levels, they are on the rise.",
      "As of August, foreclosure filings had risen six straights months year-over-year and were up 18% from the same period in 2024, according to property data firm ATTOM. Through June, roughly 188,000 properties had foreclosure filings, putting the U.S. on track to surpass the roughly 322,000 U.S. properties that went into foreclosure in 2024.",
      "\"Paying for the house, the car, the necessity bills \u2014 I just couldn't do it anymore,\" said Draxler, who had come close to losing her home in foreclosure on three previous occasions over the last decade.",
      "Roughly 94% of mortgage defaults occur after a homeowner loses income to extenuating circumstances,\u00a0according\u00a0to The Urban Institute, citing\u00a0data\u00a0from the National Bureau of Economic Research.",
      "Rising homeownership costs",
      "A key factor behind the rise in foreclosure rates is the growing cost home insurance, utilities, property taxes, repairs and other homeownership expenses. For example, single-family homeowners with a mortgage today pay an average of\u00a0$2,370 a year for property coverage\u00a0\u2014 up nearly 70% from five years ago, according to data from ICE Mortgage Technology.",
      "In addition to rising homeowners insurance costs, many households are also contending with exorbitant property taxes as well as elevated interest rates.",
      "\"All of these rising costs associated with holding a home, you have increasing pressure on existing homeowners to continue to be able to afford and pay for their mortgages,\" Geoff Smith, executive director of the Institute for Housing Studies at DePaul University, told CBS News.",
      "Todd Teta, chief product and technology officer at ATTOM, also cited the recent slowdown in hiring as a factor behind rising mortgage delinquencies, noting that job loss often drives foreclosures.",
      "A high interest rate environment can be particularly challenging for homeowners with variable-rate loans, which reset at certain intervals in part based on market conditions. That means a homeowner might see a major jump in their monthly mortgage payment if their reset occurs when interest rates are elevated.",
      "A narrow escape",
      "More such loans are now hitting their reset periods, Teta noted, a trend he expects to continue. \"While there has been a small dip in interest rates, they remain significantly higher than just a few years ago, so borrowers with upcoming resets are still likely to see sizable payment increases.\"",
      "As for Draxler, she managed to keep her home by filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which allows debtors to hold onto their property and pay off debt over time, usually within three to five years. But coming so close to losing her home of more than 30 years continues to weigh on her.",
      "\"I did not want to lose my house,\" Draxler said. \"I wouldn't have no place to go.\""

    "story": [
      "Wealth has long been tied to longevity in the U.S. and other countries, but a new analysis helps quantify the gap between how long low-income older Americans and their more affluent peers tend to live.",
      "Low-income people over 60 years old die an average of nine years earlier than high-income older Americans, according to the new study from the National Council on Aging\ufeff\u00a0(NCOA) and University of Massachusetts Boston's LeadingAge LTSS Center, which studies aging.",
      "Generally, middle-income older Americans are also dying younger than wealthier people, the researchers founds. About 15% of seniors with annual household incomes of roughly $60,000 died during the four-year study period, compared with about 11% in households with incomes of around $120,000.",
      "\"This is the first time we've tied health and wealth together \u2014 this was really shocking for me,\" said Jessica Johnston, senior director of the NCOA's Center for Economic Well-Being, of the nine-year life gap. \"We all traditionally and culturally were taught to value our elders, and if we played by the rules we could age well, and I think that's changing.\"",
      "The study is based on an analysis of data from 2018 to 2022 gathered through the University of Michigan's Health and Retirement Study, a longitudinal panel study that tracks 10,000 households. NCOA, a nonprofit group based in Arlington, Virginia, advocates for older adults.",
      "The findings have implications for an aging society that has seen widening economic inequality, with the income gap between the richest and poorest households growing wider in recent decades, according to the Urban Institute, a think tank in Washington, D.C., as well as\u00a0to other researchers.",
      "As the U.S. population ages, the divide between rich and poor is also reflected in the experiences of senior citizens, with many reaching retirement age without the financial resources to handle shocks like a health emergency or the loss of a spouse, the NCOA study found.",
      "The difference in average mortality age by income could be due to a lack of preventative care for low-income seniors, an inability to pay for care as they age or the stress of financial instability, Johnston said.",
      "The poverty rate among U.S. seniors rose to 15% last year from 14% in 2023, the highest among all age groups, according to Census data.",
      "\"Older adults are placed into situations where they are going to have to make really difficult decisions: Am I going to go to the grocery store, am I going to pay rent or am I going to get my medication?\" Johnston told CBS News. \"It's not only about forgoing one of those things, but it's the added stress about those decisions.\"",
      "About 80% of people over 60 have few, or even zero, financial assets and would struggle to cope with a financial shock like the loss of a spouse or needing long-term care, according to the report. Most of those Americans will face financial insecurity in their later years, the researchers said.",
      "\"If older adults can't afford long-term care or can't afford medicine, family members are often picking up that cost,\" Johnston said. \"The lost economic productivity among Gen Xers and millennials will play out over the next one to two decades.\""

    "published": "Tue, 07 Oct 2025 14:06:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Thirty paintings by Bob Ross are set to be auctioned to support public television stations after federal funding cuts.",
    "story": [
      "Thirty paintings created by the bushy-haired, soft-spoken Bob Ross will soon be up for auction to defray the costs of programming for small and rural public television stations suffering under cuts in federal funding.",
      "Ross, a public television stalwart in the 1980s and '90s, \"dedicated his life to making art accessible to everyone,\" said Joan Kowalski, president of Bob Ross Inc. \"This auction ensures his legacy continues to support the very medium that brought his joy and creativity into American homes for decades.\"",
      "The 30 paintings to be auctioned span his career. Most were created on-air during single episodes of Ross' show, \"The Joy of Painting.\" Ross was known for his calm demeanor. During the show, he often spoke about painting happy little clouds and trees, and making no mistakes, only \"happy accidents.\" He died of cancer complications in 1995.",
      "Bonhams in Los Angeles will auction three of Ross' paintings on Nov. 11. Other auctions will follow in London, New York, Boston and online. Bonhams sold two early 1990s mountain-and-lake scenes of Ross in August for $114,800 and $95,750.",
      "The auctions of the 30 paintings soon to be sold have an estimated total value of $850,000 to $1.4 million, Bonhams said. All profits are pledged to stations that use content from distributor American Public Television.",
      "The idea is to help stations in need with licensing fees that allow them to show popular programs that include \"The Best of Joy of Painting,\" based on Ross' show, \"America's Test Kitchen,\" \"Julia Child's French Chef Classics\" and \"This Old House.\"",
      "As desired by President Donald Trump, Congress has eliminated $1.1 billion allocated to public broadcasting, leaving about 330 PBS and 246 NPR stations to find alternative funding sources.",
      "Many stations launched emergency fund drives. Some stations have received more help than they expected, CBS News previously reported. North Carolina public radio station WQHR raised more than $200,000 in just three days, surpassing the $174,000 they needed to fill. Hawaii Public Radio lost $525,000, but donations raised $650,000.",
      "NPR has also encouraged donors in wealthier areas to support stations in regions that are in greater need. PBS and NPR have also worked to reduce the annual dues stations pay for programming and other services to lower their costs. Some stations are working on collaborations to see if they can share services and reduce costs.",
      "Still, the federal cuts have had an impact. Not all stations have seen an outpouring of donors. PBS slashed its budget by 21% and laid off about 100 employees in September. Stations have also had to lay off staff and reduce programming, CBS News previously reported. No stations have shut down yet, but operators are worried about what happens if donor money dries up.",
      "\"I am a realist,\" PBS president Paula Kerger said in September. \"I have to believe that there are some vulnerable stations that are not going to make it.\"",
      "National Public Radio president and CEO Katherine Maher\u00a0told CBS News in July\u00a0that defunding public media services \"is a real risk to the public safety of the country.\"",
      "\"Public media, public radio, public television, are a critical part of the emergency response plans of nearly half of the states in this nation,\" Maher said in an interview with CBS News. \"If these types of emergency alerting go away, you will have fewer outlets to be able to respond in real time\" to future natural disasters."

      "The union representing the nation's air traffic controllers is directing its members to keep working during the U.S. government shutdown now stretching\u00a0into its second week, with the labor group warning that failure to report for duty could lead to termination.",
      "The National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) told members Monday that it discourages federal employees from taking any actions that would compromise air safety. The group represents more than 20,000 air traffic controllers, engineers and professionals in aviation safety-related roles.",
      "\"Air traffic controllers and other aviation safety professionals take their responsibility to protect the safety of the flying public very seriously. Participating in a job action could result in removal from federal service,\" NATCA said in a message to members posted in part on the group's\u00a0website. \"It is not only illegal, but it also undermines NATCA's credibility and severely weakens our ability to effectively advocate for you and your families.\"",
      "Sick calls edge up",
      "The union's warning came as Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Monday at a news conference at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey that TSA has seen a slight increase in air traffic controllers\u00a0calling in sick since the shutdown began last week.",
      "\"We're tracking sick calls, sick leave. And have we had a slight tick up in sick calls? Yes,\" he told reporters. \"You'll see delays come from that. ... Our priorities are safety, and so if we have additional calls, we will reduce the flow consistent with a rate that's safe for the American people.\"",
      "Duffy also acknowledged the potential effect on worker morale of being required to work without pay.",
      "\"They have bills,\" he said. \"So now they're thinking about that at the same time that they're controlling the airspace, which I don't like that. \u2026 We want them to leave their personal problems at the door when they go into a tower or into a facility.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Duffy told\u00a0CNBC that controllers are anxious both because the job itself is demanding and because \"they're concerned they may not get a paycheck.\"",
      "The \"shutdown is forcing them to work without the guarantee that their paychecks come in a timely manner. So they're stressed,\" he added.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration defines air traffic controllers as\u00a0essential workers, requiring them to stay on the job during government closures despite going unpaid. Essential employees required to continue working during a shutdown are guaranteed back pay once the stalemate ends and lawmakers restore government funding.",
      "\"We cannot stress enough that it is essential to avoid any actions that could reflect poorly on you, our Union, or our professions,\" NATCA said in the message to workers.\u00a0\"We urge you to stand in solidarity with your brothers and sisters by continuing to exhibit the same unwavering professionalism that the aviation community and the American people deserve.\"",
      "\"Uncertainty and hardships\"",
      "In a video message on TikTok, NATCA President Nick Daniels also noted that the government shutdown \"creates uncertainty and hardships for our members.\"",
      "NATCA didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "TSA officers are also deemed essential essential workers under federal rules and must continue reporting to work during the lapse in federal funding. During previous shutdowns, being forced to work without pay has led to a rise in worker absences\u00a0and some leaving government service, according to former TSA officials.",
      "During the 34-day government shutdown from December of 2018 to January of 2019, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick, according to the agency, leading to delays in security screenings at major airports across the U.S.",
      "More recently, a\u00a0nationwide shortage of air traffic controllers has led to delays at airports across the U.S. According to a CBS News review, more than 90% of air traffic control towers across the country are understaffed (Visit\u00a0fly.faa.gov\u00a0for real-time information on any flight impacts at U.S. airports because of staffing, weather or other factors.)",
      "As the impasse in Congress continues, the Senate is expected to hold procedural votes again on Monday night on dueling measures to fund the government and end the shutdown."

These first drafts honoring America's 250th Birthday and @POTUS are real,\" U.S. Treasurer Brandon Beach\u00a0wrote\u00a0in a social media post on Friday, which included drawings of the coin. \"Looking forward to sharing more soon, once the obstructionist shutdown of the United States government is over.\"",
      "The obverse, or heads, side of the coin features Mr. Trump's profile, while the tails side depicts the president with his fist raised and a U.S. flag flying behind him, which is reminiscent of the photo taken after a\u00a0failed assassination attempt\u00a0on the president in Pennsylvania last year. The tails side also has the words \"fight fight fight\" emblazoned over Mr. Trump's image.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Thursday granted a restraining order temporarily blocking the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois, after state and local leaders objected to the deployment.",
      "In a ruling from the bench, U.S. District Judge April Perry said no National Guard units may be deployed in Illinois for the next 14 days. A full written ruling will be published on Friday, and Perry said she expects her order will be appealed.",
      "The restraining order expires at 11:59 p.m. on Oct. 23, but Perry has scheduled a telephone hearing for 9 a.m. on Oct. 22 to determine if it should be extended for another 14 days.",
      "Perry's ruling means National Guard units already sent to the Chicago area cannot operate on the mission they were sent for \u2014 to protect federal agents and facilities in Illinois, including a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Broadview, where 45 soldiers arrived overnight.",
      "While the restraining order remains in effect for 14 days, the Trump administration had moved to deploy troops in Illinois for at least 60 days, so it's very possible both sides will be back in court before the restraining order expires.",
      "Perry said her decision came down to a \"credibility determination,\" and she found the Department of Homeland Security's assessment of recent events in the Chicago area to be \"unreliable.\"",
      "The judge ruled there is no credible evidence of an organized rebellion in Illinois, despite multiple protests and some assaults against federal agents, nor was there any evidence that the federal government has been unable to enforce the law without bringing in troops amid an ongoing\u00a0immigration crackdown in the Chicago area.",
      "The judge said there is \"no doubt there have been acts of vandalism and assaults\" during the ICE operation in Chicago, but she could not agree that local law enforcement have been unable to handle the situation, calling the Trump administration's claims otherwise \"unreliable.\"",
      "She also noted that federal grand juries have refused to indict a number of protesters who were arrested outside the Broadview ICE facility, casting \"significant doubt\" on Homeland Security's credibility and assessment of what's happening on the streets in the Chicago area.",
      "The judge also said there is overwhelming evidence that deploying troops would lead to civil unrest, and said the provocative nature of ICE agents' actions, and in some cases constitutional violations, has led to an increase in protest activity already.",
      "\"I find that allowing the National Guard to deploy will only add fuel to the fire that the defendants have started,\" she said.",
      "Because the National Guard is not trained in law enforcement functions or de-escalation tactics, the judge said allowing troops at the Broadview ICE facility or anywhere else would not be responsible, noting state and local police have indicated they are able to provide protection and keep the peace.",
      "The judge said adding militarized and untrained troops to the situation would not be in the community's best interest.",
      "In a statement Thursday night, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said: \"Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders like [JB] Pritzker have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets. President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities and we expect to be vindicated by a higher court.\"",
      "Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul said he believes the judge \"did a very careful job of weighing the evidence\" and \"made the correct decision to enter a temporary restraining order.\"",
      "\"This is an important decision not just for the state of Illinois, but for the entire country. The question of states' sovereignty was addressed in this decision. The question of whether or not the President of the United States should have unfettered authority to militarize our cities was answered today,\" he said.",
      "In a statement, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson called the judge's ruling \"a win for the people of Chicago and the rule of law.\"",
      "\"Judge Perry echoed many of the points that we have made repeatedly: Trump's deployment is illegal, unconstitutional, dangerous, and unnecessary. There is no rebellion in Chicago. There are just good people standing up for what is right,\" Johnson said. \"The judge established that the Trump administration is unreliable. They lie, misrepresent, and put people in danger. We will continue to use all of the tools at our disposal to end the Trump administration's war on Chicago.\"",
      "Gov. JB Pritzker also praised the judge's ruling in a post on X.",
      "\"Donald Trump is not a king \u2014 and his administration is not above the law.  Today, the court confirmed what we all know: there is no credible evidence of a rebellion in the state of Illinois.  And no place for the National Guard in the streets of American cities like Chicago,\" Pritzker wrote.",
      "Lawsuit filed by Chicago and Illinois called Trump's deployment of troops \"patently unlawful\"",
      "In a lawsuit suit, filed Monday, the state of Illinois and city of Chicago claimed that the Trump administration's \"deployment of federalized troops to Illinois is patently unlawful.\"",
      "\"Plaintiffs ask this court to halt the illegal, dangerous, and unconstitutional federalization of members of the National Guard of the United States, including both the Illinois and\u00a0Texas National Guard,\" the lawsuit states.",
      "The federal government filed its response with moments to spare\u00a0before a midnight deadline Wednesday night, in a 59-page filing that argued President Trump has the legal authority to deploy the troops and that state objections should not block the operation.",
      "Attorneys for the federal government also argued the courts should be \"highly deferential\" when reviewing a president's judgment, saying it's within the scope of the authority the executive branch is given by the Constitution and statutes.",
      "Perry began hearing arguments in the case at the Dirksen Federal Courthouse in Chicago at 11 a.m., and noted at the start of proceedings that the hearing has taken on new urgency because in the time between the lawsuit being filed Monday and today's hearing, the government has already deployed 500 National Guard troops to Illinois and Chicago.",
      "The judge initially declined to grant an emergency temporary restraining order in the hours after the lawsuit was filed but warned the federal government they should \"take a pause\" on deployment amid the legal proceedings.",
      "READ MORE: U.S. District Court chief judge says National Guard not needed at Dirksen Federal Building",
      "Lawyers for the state of Illinois and the federal government gave opening statements before being questioned for hours by Judge Perry. Many of her questions focused on what exactly the National Guard would be authorized to do in their capacity of \"protecting\" federal property and federal agents.",
      "Judge Perry admitted the open-ended nature of the president's order is cause for concern.",
      "The federal government's attorneys argued repeatedly that the president's judgment in deciding to federalize the National Guard in Illinois is not reviewable by the courts, and declined to articulate clear parameters on the guard's orders because the situation is fluid. They said orders issued would be tailored to the needs of the moment.",
      "Would they be limited to protecting ICE? The attorney for the government said probably. When Judge Perry asked if the guard might go into neighborhoods, hospitals and schools, the attorney said there is a vetting process but didn't describe it.",
      "Could they help any federal agency? The government's attorney answered, \"I actually don't know the answer to that.\"",
      "And the big question: Will they be fighting crime in Chicago? \"Certainly to an extent,\" the Trump administration's attorney said. \"The mission, again, is a federal protection one.\"",
      "The attorneys repeatedly cited violence and \"riots\" in Illinois, particularly at the Broadview ICE facility, but the judge questioned whether the government was presenting an accurate representation of the violence on the ground, at one point pointing out the gulf between statements made on social media and reporting in Illinois.",
      "We do know 45 members of the Texas National Guard were at the Broadview ICE facility ahead of Thursday's hearing. In the state's opening argument, they mentioned internal communications from the person in charge at Broadview said \"the situation was under control.\"",
      "Perry also asked the government's lawyers about two temporary restraining orders issued against ICE in the past 48 hours for violations of the First and Fourth amendments \u2014 one in a lawsuit in Chicago filed against ICE by reporters and media members, the other filed by an immigration attorney to prevent ICE from searching his phone \u2014 which the government said they were not aware of.",
      "Perry questioned the government about its definition of the \"danger of rebellion,\" and what acts would comprise such a rebellion. At one point, when asking the government about threats made toward ICE and other federal agents, Perry noted, \"I agree with you about threats across the U.S. now. Mine started about 10 minutes after I got the case.\"",
      "Perry had fewer questions for the state, asking them about their definition of rebellion, the distinction between state and local law enforcement powers and military forces and their objections to using the military to protect federal property. Illinois attorneys argued the power to determine military conditions belongs to Congress, and they do not believe the president can summon troops to places where other law enforcement can be used effectively.",
      "Perry also asked about why they think a temporary restraining order is necessary. Attorneys for Illinois referenced statements made by Mr. Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, particularly at the meeting of generals and other military leaders who were called to the Pentagon.",
      "In closing arguments, the state argued the president doesn't have the authority to send in troops to fight crime, and said the case is full of bad faith and abandonment of public virtues, and presents a \"risk of wanton tyranny.\"",
      "The federal government argued in return that there is coordinated and complex violence in Illinois, and the president has a right to respond. They argued that a temporary restraining order would interfere with the president's decision to protect personnel and property.",
      "Mr. Trump has claimed that Chicago is \"out of control\" as justification for sending in the National Guard, and his administration and the Department of Homeland Security have claimed that federal agents and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities need protection from protesters.",
      "The president once again spoke about Chicago on Thursday, thanking Texas Gov. Greg Abbott for his troops and \"doing what has to be done.\" Chicago Mayor Johnson reacted to his latest comments outside court, saying, \"We said that this deployment had nothing to do with public safety. We said that this has nothing to do with immigration. This is purely political.\""

    "story": [
      "A grand jury in Virginia indicted New York Attorney General Letitia James on Thursday, marking the second Trump foe to face federal prosecution in recent weeks.",
      "James was charged with one count of bank fraud and one count of making false statements to a financial institution. The indictment alleges that James bought a house in Norfolk, Virginia, in 2020 with a mortgage that required her to use it as a second home, but she ultimately rented it to a family and used it as an investment property. It accuses her of misrepresenting how the house was used to get a lower interest rate.",
      "The indictment says James purchased the home for $137,000 and borrowed $109,600 \u2014 and by getting more favorable lending terms and a larger seller credit, she allegedly saved herself $18,933 over the life of the loan.",
      "Lindsey Halligan, the acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, said in a statement: \"No one is above the law. The charges as alleged in this case represent intentional, criminal acts and tremendous breaches of the public's trust.\"",
      "James called the charges \"baseless\" in a video statement.",
      "\"This is nothing more than a continuation of the president's desperate weaponization of our justice system,\" she said.",
      "James's attorney, Abbe Lowell, said James \"flatly and forcefully denies these charges\" and said he is \"deeply concerned that this case is driven by President Trump's desire for revenge.\"",
      "James has drawn Mr. Trump's ire for years. Her office sued the president and the Trump Organization for fraud in 2022, leading a judge to issue a nine-figure judgment against the company. Mr. Trump has\u00a0referred to\u00a0James as \"scum,\" \"corrupt\" and \"racist.\"",
      "The indictment came exactly two weeks after a grand jury in the same Virginia courthouse voted to indict\u00a0another Trump adversary, former FBI Director James Comey, on charges of lying to Congress. James was indicted by a different grand jury than the one that indicted Comey, according to a source familiar with the matter.",
      "Last month, Mr. Trump publicly urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to look into Comey, James and a third longtime Trump antagonist, Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California.",
      "In May, CBS News reported that the Justice Department had launched a criminal probe into James around alleged mortgage fraud. Three months later, the Justice Department expanded its investigation into James for her office's handling of its Trump Organization probe.",
      "The mortgage fraud investigation began after William Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, wrote a letter to Bondi alleging that James \"has, in multiple instances, falsified bank documents and property records to acquire government backed assistance and loans and more favorable loan terms.\"",
      "Pulte claimed James received deals on mortgage terms by falsifying information related to several different properties over the course of decades \u2014 not including the 2020 purchase that led to Thursday's charges. Pulte's allegations include listing another home in Norfolk, Virginia, as her \"principal residence\" despite living and working in New York, buying a five-family property in Brooklyn with a loan that is only available for homes with four units or less, and an accusation that in 1983, James' father signed mortgage documents stating they were husband and wife.",
      "James denied the allegations at the time, calling them \"baseless.\"",
      "In April, Lowell \u2014 an attorney for James whose firm frequently represents clients that it believes have been unfairly targeted by the Trump administration \u2014 sent a letter to the Department of Justice refuting the allegations laid out in Pulte's letter.",
      "Lowell called the allegations \"long-disproven\" and referred to the investigation as \"the latest act of improper political retribution \u2014 this time directed at Ms. James \u2014 publicly instigated and endorsed by President Trump.\"",
      "DOJ charges another longtime Trump foe",
      "Mr. Trump has sparred with James since she was elected New York attorney general in 2018 and began pursuing cases against the president, his businesses and his administration.",
      "In the civil\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0against Mr. Trump and the Trump Organization, James' office accused the company of fraudulently inflating the value of its real estate assets to gain more favorable lending terms in what she called \"the art of the steal,\" a play on the name of Mr. Trump's book, \"The Art of the Deal.\" The president denied wrongdoing, and he and his attorneys lashed out at James, characterizing the case as politically motivated.",
      "After a trial that delved deeply into Mr. Trump's business empire, a judge ordered the president and his company to pay a judgment in excess of $350 million \u2014 which ballooned to over a half-billion dollars including interest. Judges on New York's appellate court later\u00a0tossed out the judgment over the summer, calling it \"excessive.\"",
      "Since returning to office, Mr. Trump has taken the unprecedented step of encouraging the Justice Department to look into people who he believes wronged him during his first term or his four years out of office \u2014 including Comey and James.",
      "The moves have been met with some internal backlash. The acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Erik Siebert, resigned last month, amid concern from prosecutors in the office that the Trump administration could fire him for failing to prosecute James.",
      "Siebert was replaced as interim U.S. attorney by Lindsey Halligan, a former Trump attorney and White House aide. Just days after she was sworn in, the office asked a grand jury to indict Comey for allegedly lying during a Senate hearing five years ago.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump-aligned attorney Ed Martin \u2014 who leads the Justice Department's new Weaponization Working Group \u2014 pressed James to resign\u00a0as state attorney general in an August letter obtained by the Associated Press."

    "story": [
      "Republican Winsome Earle-Sears and Democrat Abigail Spanberger faced off for the first and only time on the debate stage Thursday night in Virginia's high-stakes gubernatorial race.",
      "It was a fiery affair in which Earle-Sears, who is trailing in the race, went on the offensive from the very beginning, repeatedly interrupting Spanberger and asking her several direct questions.",
      "Spanberger, who largely avoided addressing her Republican opponent directly, sought to cast a bipartisan tone at times. Over the course of the hourlong affair, the candidates sparred over violent rhetoric, the federal shutdown and transgender children. The economy was largely an afterthought.",
      "Virginia is one of just two states choosing governors this November, and its election is often seen as a bellwether for the party in power across the Potomac River ahead of midterm elections next year.",
      "Washington politics are especially relevant this year in Virginia, as President Trump's cuts to the federal workforce and Congress' current government shutdown have an outsize impact in a state filled with federal employees and military personnel.",
      "Here are some takeaways from the debate at Norfolk State University:",
      "Perhaps even more than policy differences, the candidates' personal styles shaped the hourlong debate.",
      "Earle-Sears, with her only chance to confront Spanberger before Election Day, was far more aggressive. She repeatedly turned toward Spanberger and addressed her by her first name, interrupting almost every answer, despite being admonished by the moderators over and over.",
      "The approach put the Democrat on the defensive after months of running the race largely on her own terms as the perceived frontrunner.",
      "Spanberger, while she criticized her opponent at times, faced forward throughout, avoided eye contact, and only rarely addressed Earle-Sears directly. She did not speak during Earle-Sears' answers, even when her opponent asked direct questions, which happened often.",
      "Earle-Sears also told Spanberger she \"should have stayed in Congress\" and frequently questioned her truthfulness.",
      "\"Don't lie like that, Abigail!\" she shouted at one point.",
      "The interruptions lasted up until the very final moments of the debate when the moderators cut off the microphones.",
      "A scandal shaped the very beginning of the debate, although it was not a scandal directly involving either candidate onstage.",
      "Instead, it was the Democratic candidate for attorney general, Jay Jones. He has been heavily criticized in recent days following last week's publication of text messages from 2022 in which he suggested that Virginia's former Republican House speaker get \"two bullets in the head.\"",
      "While Spanberger had previously shared \"disgust\" about Jones's words, heading into Thursday night's debate she had not called for him to drop out of the race, while Mr. Trump and Earle-Sears publicly pressed Jones to do so. Over and over again Thursday night, Earle-Sears pushed Spanberger on whether she would do the same.",
      "Earle-Sears, in her first comment of the debate, took an unrelated question about the state's vehicle tax and questioned Spanberger over the Jones issue. When asked by a moderator about Jones, Spanberger quickly denounced the text messages, as she had soon after they became public last week. But she was evasive when asked whether she continued to endorse Jones. After being pressed about the topic, Spanberger tried to distance herself from Jones and said it was up to voters to make an individual decision.",
      "\"Abigail, what if he said it about your three children? Is that when you would say it's time to get out of the race?\" Earle-Sears asked. She later added of Spanberger, \"She has no courage.\"",
      "Spanberger had largely avoided the issue in the days leading up to the debate, aside from issuing a public statement condemning the texts. But facing repeated questions from the moderators and her opponent, she was forced to weigh in. The Democratic congresswoman declined to say whether Jones should leave the race, saying it's up to voters to make their own decision.",
      "\"Are you saying political murder is OK?\" Earle-Sears charged.",
      "\"Once again, I have denounced political violence, political rhetoric, no matter who is leading the charge,\" Spanberger responded, pointing to violent rhetoric from Mr. Trump that Earle-Sears declined to denounce and trying to sound a bipartisan tone.",
      "\"You routinely refer to me as your enemy. I'm not your enemy. You are not my enemy. We are political opponents,\" Spanberger said.",
      "In the race to succeed Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who under state law cannot run for another term this year, Spanberger has been viewed as having a sizable advantage. But statewide races in Virginia can become surprisingly close by election day, and Jones' words have been met with bipartisan backlash and helped galvanize Republican momentum.",
      "The clash comes as threats of political violence have escalated across the country following the shooting deaths of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and former Minnesota Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband.",
      "The showdown over the shutdown flared Thursday night.",
      "The federal shutdown, which has been underway for more than a week, is especially prevalent in Virginia, home to roughly 315,000 federal workers. Even before much of the federal government closed its doors last week, many Virginians were already affected by Mr.\u00a0Trump's spring push to slash federal jobs and his ongoing threats to impose more mass firings.",
      "Earle-Sears, a vocal Trump supporter, had perhaps the more difficult challenge during the debate. She argued that she is best positioned to strengthen the state's economy, even as she was reluctant to criticize the Republican president's job cuts in the state.",
      "She declined to criticize Mr. Trump or call on him to end the shutdown when asked directly by the moderators Thursday.",
      "Instead, she blamed Democrats for the mess and called on Spanberger to push Virginia Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, both Democrats, to vote in favor of a spending bill that would end the impasse with the Republican-controlled Congress.",
      "Spanberger complied.",
      "\"I would encourage everyone, our Democratic senators, our Democratic House members, our Republican House members, to work and come back to the table,\" she said.",
      "Many voters say they're most concerned about the direction of the economy, but some of the most pointed moments of the debate were focused on cultural issues.",
      "In particular, Earle-Sears pressed Spanberger on whether she would keep transgender youths out of high school sports and bathrooms.",
      "The Republican lieutenant governor has flooded the airwaves with ads focused on the cultural divide that helped Mr. Trump win the presidency last fall, casting Spanberger as unwilling to protect Virginia's children from sexual predators.",
      "\"My answer is that each local community decision should be made between parents and educators and teachers in each community,\" Spanberger said, pointing to her background in law enforcement and role as a mother.",
      "\"Nothing is more important to me than the safety of all children,\" she said.",
      "Spanberger declined to say whether she would rescind the measure signed by Youngkin that would require students to go only to the restrooms of their birth gender.",
      "That did not satisfy Earle-Sears, who pressed Spanberger on what she would say if her own children were forced to undress in a bathroom with biological males. The Republican also implied that transgender students are a safety threat when asked.",
      "\"We know that biological men are larger in strength than women,\" she said. \"This is biology.\"",
      "Two women stood on the debate stage as the Democratic and Republican nominees for the first time in state history, a reminder that Virginia is poised to elect its first female governor, no matter who wins on Nov. 4.",
      "Spanberger, 46, is a mother of three school-age children. She has represented a congressional district in northern Virginia since 2019. Her background is in law enforcement as a former CIA agent.",
      "In one of the few warm exchanges of the night, Earle-Sears pointed to her role as a mother when asked what qualities she likes about her opponent.",
      "\"I believe she is a devoted mom. I truly believe that,\" Earle-Sears said. \"And I do believe that she cares.\"",
      "Earle-Sears, a Marine veteran, may be better known statewide, having served as lieutenant governor for the last four years. A native of Jamaica, the 61-year-old mother of two, is the first Black woman elected to statewide office in Virginia.",
      "Spanberger complimented parts of her record.",
      "\"I admire her faith,\" Spanberger said, \"and her service to this country.\""

      "Mills' planned campaign launch was first reported by Axios.",
      "Mills, who is term-limited, has served as governor of Maine since 2019, after working as the state's attorney general. She drew national attention earlier this year when she verbally argued with President Trump at a White House event after he pressed Maine to comply with his administration's push to block transgender girls and women from competing in female sports.",
      "\"See you in court,\" Mills said to Mr. Trump.",
      "Mills was a top recruit for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. She will enter an expanding primary field that includes three other Democratic contenders \u2014 among them Graham Platner, an oyster farmer who has emerged as a rising progressive and anti-establishment voice.",
      "The Maine Senate race could mark a rare opportunity next year for Democrats to flip a GOP-held seat and contest the Senate's 53-47 Republican majority, despite an otherwise challenging Senate terrain. Maine leans Democratic, with Joe Biden defeating Mr. Trump by 9 percentage points in 2020 and Kamala Harris beating Mr. Trump by 7 percentage points last year.",
      "But Democrats have struggled for years against Collins, a five-term incumbent with a track record of breaking with Mr. Trump and her congressional Republican colleagues. She won reelection in 2020 by an 8.6-point margin, despite Democratic nominee Sara Gideon spending nearly $62.9 million on the race \u2014 more than double Collins' $29.6 million."

    "summary": "Photos of Jeffrey Epstein's cell show a scene of disarray that never underwent a proper inspection, according to experts.",
    "story": [
      "The federal investigation into the death of convicted sex-trafficker Jeffrey Epstein was marred by significant lapses, experts told CBS News, including the failure by investigators to interview potential witnesses, properly preserve certain evidence and run basic forensic tests.",
      "Nearly two years passed before investigators interviewed the two key corrections officers on duty the night Epstein died in his cell in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in downtown New York City, in what was later ruled a suicide, according to court documents. One of those officers was the only person to attest to seeing Epstein hanging by a bedsheet from his bunk.",
      "And details pulled from 90 photos of the cell and other evidence collected in the hours after Epstein's death \u2014 but before FBI agents arrived to process the scene \u2014 appear to show a succession of basic oversights, ranging from an absence of evidence markers to items being moved, experts told CBS News.",
      "\"The FBI literally has all of the best tools. I mean, spared no expense. They have every tool you can imagine. And they used none of it as far as we can tell,\" forensic analyst Nick Barreiro said after reviewing the photos, many of which have never been published. \"How are there not way more people pointing out the absurdity of this?\"",
      "The images were previously obtained by 60 Minutes. After the recent release of surveillance video from the night Epstein died, which appeared to show details that contradicted official reports, CBS News reviewed them and other documents with several forensic experts.",
      "The results of the federal investigation were made public in 2023, four years after Epstein's death, in a report by the Department of Justice Office of Inspector General. It concluded that the financier, who entered a guilty plea in 2008 on state-level charges of procuring a child for prostitution, died by suicide. That matched the findings shared by Attorney General William Barr, who told Congress in August he had no doubts that Epstein had taken his own life. But lingering questions, raised by individuals including Epstein's lawyers and brother, have fueled continued speculation and suspicion.",
      "\"I do not believe he died by suicide, no,\" Epstein's co-defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell, said this summer during her interview in August with the Deputy U.S. Attorney General Todd Blanche.",
      "Epstein's brother, Mark, told \"60 Minutes\" in 2020 that, in his view, the evidence he has seen to date points more to murder than suicide. Five years later, he still questions the investigation.",
      "\"This was never properly investigated as a proper homicide, it was never investigated,\" Mark Epstein told CBS News recently.",
      "Nothing about the CBS News review into the investigation of Epstein's death suggests foul play. But the review found that the federal probe did not follow typical investigative procedures into a suspicious death.",
      "\"Evidence photography 101\"",
      "Epstein's body was discovered at 6:30 a.m. on Aug. 10, 2019 by corrections officer Michael Thomas when he arrived at his cell to deliver breakfast. Thomas said he found the accused felon in a near-seated position, suspended from the top of the bunk by a homemade noose, with his legs straight out and his buttocks approximately 1 inch to 1 and a half inches off the floor, according to the inspector general's report. Internal corrections department memos obtained exclusively by CBS News described him as \"cold,\" with \"no palpable pulses.\"",
      "The first FBI agents arrived at the cell more than seven hours later, at 1:35 p.m., according to the 2023 report. But when they arrived, photos show they found a disorganized, rifled-through clutter. Crucially, Epstein's lifeless body had already been removed from the cell, eliminating a critical source of information investigators would need to determine how and when he died, forensic pathologist Michael Baden said.",
      "\"The fact that he was moved diminishes the ability to determine how long he was dead before he was found,\" Baden said.",
      "Emergency medical technicians wrote in their report on the incident, which was obtained by CBS News, that the staff they interacted with could not say when Epstein was last seen alive or describe how he \"was found in [the] jail cell other than to say 'we found him on the ground.'\"",
      "Inside the cell, piles of linens had been strewn about, mattresses were squeezed into a corner on the floor near his bunk bed and Epstein's personal items were rearranged or moved, photos from the scene show. Experts who reviewed photos of the scene for CBS News said there were also inconsistencies between the investigators' official reports and what the images show.",
      "\"In those photographs, it was obvious that things were moved around,\" said former New York Police Department detective Herman Weisberg, who is now managing director of Sage Intelligence. \"It definitely appeared to me that the scene was, for lack of a better term, staged a bit.\"",
      "Epstein's medications, a special mask for treating sleep apnea, and at least one piece of fabric tied into a noose appeared in different places over the course of 90 minutes, when a photographer from the medical examiner's office was documenting the scene.",
      "Weisberg and other experts emphasized that, regardless of whether Epstein's death was a suicide, the cell should have been treated as a crime scene using standard investigatory practices.",
      "\"It almost appears to me that whoever was investigating this just took it at face value that it was a suicide with no foul play whatsoever, suspected,\" Weisberg said. \"But in a situation as high-profile as this, I would always, as an investigator, consider that there might be foul play.\"",
      "While some experts questioned federal investigators' treatment of the scene, forensic pathologist Judy Melinek, who used to work at the New York City Medical Examiner's office, said her former employer appears to have handled the case by the book.",
      "\"It's just people doing what they normally do for any other case,\" Melinek said. \"The majority of [cases] if you weren't such a high profile decedent, the scrutiny would not apply. This is how they treat every other jail death of somebody who is not high profile.\"",
      "The sequence of evidence photos starts with a picture of the stairs leading up to Epstein's cellblock, Tier L. Underlying data from the photo shows it was taken at 9:34 a.m. \u2014 three hours after Epstein's body was found, and four hours before federal investigators arrived.",
      "Time went by even as the nation's top law enforcement officer sought a rapid investigation.",
      "\"I was obviously covering it very quickly and wanted to rule out anything other than suicide,\" Barr told Congress in August, adding that \"within an hour, or minutes of finding out about it, I directed the [inspector general] to have people in New York go to the scene and conduct an investigation.\"",
      "On the back wall, a surveillance camera is visible. It was streaming, but was not recording. This was due to a hard-drive malfunction that had previously been identified but not fixed, according to a Justice Department report.",
      "Next is a blurry image of the door to Epstein's cell, number 220. Running underneath the door was a cable that provided power to a CPAP machine. Epstein had initially been assigned to a cell in a different tier, but he was moved to cell 220 for easier access to an outlet, according to Bureau of Prisons records.",
      "The jail's computer systems were never updated to note that move, according to investigators. A source close to the investigation told CBS News that corrections staff rarely updated internal inmate moves, instead preferring to call out their names while in the tiers.",
      "Two documents on the door are shown in images after Epstein's death. One was a printout with Epstein's personal details and a booking photo. Above that was the ID card for Epstein's former roommate, Efrain Reyes.",
      "Cells typically hold two inmates, and following a suspected suicide attempt two weeks earlier, Epstein was mandated by correction officials to have a cellmate. The day before Epstein's death, however, Reyes was transferred out of the detention center. Investigators eventually concluded that Reyes' move allowed Epstein the solitude needed to kill himself.",
      "From the first photo to the last, it is clear the scene in the cell was chaotic \u2014 so much so that investigators never conclusively determined which strip of bedsheet was around Epstein's neck when he died.",
      "Photos of the bed also raise questions. One shows an orange string hanging from a bar. This picture was included in a 2023 report by the Department of Justice's Inspector General, alongside a description of how Epstein was found, suggesting investigators believed that was what he had used to hang himself.",
      "If that was the case, and the room hadn't been disturbed before the photographer arrived, Epstein's rear would have come to rest on a mattress, instead of hovering over the floor \u2014 complicating investigators' explanation of how he hanged himself.",
      "Some of the evidence was not photographed in Epstein's cell, but instead appeared to be in an entirely different room \u2014 one with floor tiles distinct from the bare concrete of Epstein's cell. These pictures show a defibrillator and another strip of orange cloth tied into a noose-like shape. It is visibly different from the one shown hanging from Epstein's bed frame.",
      "There is no indication in official reports where this noose was found, or which of several knotted strips of bed linen may have been removed from around Epstein's neck. A rendering of this noose was included in Epstein's official autopsy. But the Justice Department later revealed in its 2023 report that \"the noose depicted is not the ligature Epstein used to kill himself.\"",
      "By the time FBI agents arrived, it was clear their work would be scrutinized by the top brass inside the Justice Department.",
      "\"After the suicide, I told the headquarters to make sure that they flooded the zone,\" Barr told Congress in an August deposition.",
      "There is no indication in any official report that an FBI crime scene investigators, officially known as an Evidence Response Team, ever ran fingerprints or DNA tests on anything found in the cell.",
      "Epstein's autopsy report indicates medical examiners collected fingernail clippings, and swabs from his neck and hands. Epstein's brother Mark told CBS News that he still hasn't received any information about the results of DNA tests, if they were carried out, and Barr said in his deposition that he couldn't remember if they had been done.",
      "A 2024 report by Department of Justice researchers warned that investigators risk missing an important \"opportunity\" to gather evidence \"if DNA is not collected at the scene as needed or at the time of examination.\" They advised that \"body swabs should be considered both at the scene and during autopsy.\"",
      "Weisberg said investigators left too many stones unturned, missing the opportunity to close the case in a way that would feel conclusive to the public.",
      "\"In the back of any good investigator's mind, he's preparing this to be scrutinized by counsel. In this case, you're preparing it to be scrutinized by a lot of desktop detectives \u2026 so you better have all of your facts straight,\" Weisberg said.",
      "The FBI \"inspected the cell and retrieved what [they] believed to be relevant to its investigation into the cause of Epstein's death, which included one torn sheet, miscellaneous papers, and an MP3 player,\" inspector general investigators wrote in the 2023 report.",
      "Forensic analyst Barreiro said he considered the agency's treatment of the scene to be striking.",
      "\"Some really shoddy work here, if you can even call it that,\" Barreiro said. \"I mean there's an absence of work here.\"",
      "One basic procedure, which Barreiro referred to as \"evidence photography 101,\" is photographing scenes in a progression that goes from a wide shot to close-ups, with markers identifying evidence.",
      "\"There's no evidence markers in any of these photographs. Like, how do you keep track once you get the stuff back to the crime lab? This is essentially useless,\" said Barreiro, a former police detective and an FBI-trained member of the Digital Imaging and Video Recovery Team.",
      "Richard Esposito, a former New York Police Department deputy commissioner said, \"it appears there may have been several procedural, operational, and investigative missteps at this crime scene.\"",
      "\"Ultimately, determining the true facts and circumstances in a death investigation-and transparently communicating those findings to the public-helps dispel misinformation and reduce the spread of conspiracy theories,\" said Esposito, who is a CBS News law enforcement contributor.",
      "Interviews",
      "Federal investigators questioned 54 people before issuing their final report, including three inmates who had been housed on Epstein's tier, as well as jail staff, administrators, contractors and his brother. However, several other witnesses or their representatives told CBS News they were not interviewed. That included many other inmates housed in Epstein's tier the night of his death, at least one staffer who arrived at Epstein's cell shortly after his body was found and nearly all of the visitors he saw in the days leading up to his death.",
      "Two witnesses who did provide eyewitness accounts, with their lawyers present, were in the cell directly across from Epstein's the night he died. One described seeing Thomas, the first corrections officer on scene, enter Epstein's cell and begin performing CPR, only to emerge holding a rope and a defibrillator. The other said he saw Thomas enter and shake Epstein. He said Thomas tried to pick Epstein up, but fell over. He then began giving chest compressions, the inmate said.",
      "The accounts, which appear in the official report, do not explain what is seen in photos of the jail tier \u2014 their cell windows covered by papers that could have obscured any view outside.",
      "It's not clear if the cell window was papered over in the time after Epstein's death but before the first photos were snapped. The Bureau of Prisons declined to comment.",
      "Attempts to reach Thomas were unsuccessful. A lawyer for his former coworker, Tova Noel, said she would not comment. The former officers agreed to be interviewed by investigators in 2021, as part of a deal that saw prosecutors drop charges of falsifying records related to mandatory checks on Epstein and other inmates, after falling asleep on the job.",
      "Other staffers with first-hand knowledge of the scene and other events were never contacted by federal investigators, according to interviews with CBS News.",
      "Investigators also decided not to interview some of Epstein's visitors, several sources told CBS News. The inmate spent the bulk of his daylight hours with a large, rotating cast of attorneys \u2014 including on the day before his death. The younger lawyers were there not only to provide counsel, but also \"to basically hold his hand\" and \"babysit,\" according to one source. They kept Epstein company, chatting with him about life, politics, literature and any other topic that came to his mind.",
      "\"You'd think if the investigation was a priority, they'd want to take a run at the younger people who were working for him,\" one source told CBS News. \"Nothing.\"",
      "One lawyer who visited Epstein nine days before his death was David Schoen. He said Epstein told him he was actively planning to fight the criminal charges levied against him.",
      "\"And this is why I've said, that in my view \u2014 I don't have anything to base it on other than anecdotal \u2014 I don't think he committed suicide, because he was very engaged in the idea of fighting the case,\" Schoen said. \"He hired me. And to kill himself nine days later wouldn't have made a lot of sense.\"",
      "While many who were close to Epstein have publicly questioned that he died by suicide, Barr has said it was \u2014 and remains \u2014 the most logical conclusion. The alternative would've been too complicated, Barr said in his August deposition.",
      "\"This would've required coordination from probably two dozen people, maybe, within the prison. And all these people were in different groups,\" Barr said. \"You know, the people who were repairing the cameras, the people who, you know, were responsible for opening and closing the door, the people who were responsible for putting in a new cellmate, things like that. \""

      "The international award honors people or organizations whose work makes the world a more peaceful place. Nominees aren't made public by the Nobel Committee, but some individuals publicly share who they nominate. World leaders, humanitarians and international organizations have received the peace prize since it was first given out in the early 20th century.",
      "Here's what to know about the Nobel Peace Prize and if Mr. Trump could receive it:",
      "When is the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize awarded?",
      "The 2025 winner of the Nobel Peace Prize will be announced on Friday, Oct. 10 at 5 a.m. ET. It will be awarded on Dec. 10 at a formal ceremony in Oslo, Norway.",
      "What is the Nobel Peace Prize?",
      "The Nobel Prize was established by a Swedish businessman named Alfred Nobel. In his will, he said that his fortune was to be used to establish a fund that could distribute prizes \"to those who ... shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind,\" according to the Nobel Peace Prize's website.",
      "Nobel's will specified that it be given \"to the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between the nations and the abolition or reduction of standing armies and the formation and spreading of peace congresses,\" but many different kinds of work have been honored, including efforts to combat climate change and promote democracy.",
      "The award has been given to politicians who sought international peace, people who have worked for arms control and nuclear disarmament, and international human rights agencies. Other Nobel prizes are awarded for achievements in medicine, literature and other fields.",
      "Winners receive a medal, diploma and monetary prize, according to the award's website. The 6.6-centimeter gold medal shows a portrait of Nobel, with his name, birth year and year of death engraved on the edge. The back of the medal shows three men embracing, to symbolize international fraternity, and is engraved with the phrase \"For peace and fraternity among peoples\" in Latin.",
      "How is the Nobel Peace Prize awarded?",
      "According to the prize's website, the Nobel Peace Prize should be awarded to the person who has done the most to advance peace in the world. It is awarded by a committee selected by Norway's parliament. The other Nobel prizes are awarded in Sweden.",
      "Any person or organization can be nominated by any eligible nominators, according to the prize's website. Eligible nominators include members of national assemblies, members of governments, members of bodies like the International Court of Justice, college professors or directors and former prizewinners or members of the Nobel Committee. The nomination deadline is Jan. 31. Over 330 candidates were submitted for the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize.",
      "The nominations aren't vetted before the nomination deadline, according to the prize's website, so nominations are not endorsements from the committee. The committee does not publicly comment on nominees. The names of nominees and nominating committee can't be announced for 50 years.",
      "Once the deadline passes, the Nobel Committee looks at the nominees and creates a shortlist of \"the most interesting and worthy candidates.\" Those shortlisted nominees then undergo \"assessments and examinations\" from committee members, according to the prize's website.",
      "The committee then decides on the winner or winners of the Nobel Peace Prize at its last meeting before the prize winners are announced in early October. The decision is made by majority vote, according to the prize website, but the committee attempts to make a unanimous decision on the winner.",
      "Who has won the Nobel Peace Prize?",
      "The Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded 105 times since 1901, according to the prize's website. One hundred and thirty-nine laureates have been awarded, including 92 men, 19 women and 28 organizations.",
      "The prize's first recipients were French scientist and politician Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Passy and Jean Henry Durant, a Swiss businessman and co-founder of the Red Cross. Passy was honored for his \"lifelong work for international peace conferences, diplomacy and arbitration,\" while Durant received the award for his \"humanitarian efforts to help wounded soldiers and create international understanding,\" according to the prize's website.",
      "Other notable prizewinners have included Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai in 2014 and former President Barack Obama in 2009. Obama's win, for \"extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples,\" was considered a surprise, as he had been in office for less than a year.",
      "Former President Jimmy Carter received the honor in 2002. Holocaust survivor and author Elie Wiesel was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986, and Bishop\u00a0Desmond Tutu, who worked to end apartheid in South Africa, received it in 1984.",
      "Organizations that have received the Nobel Peace Prize include the United Nations' World Food Program and the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons.",
      "Could Donald Trump get the Nobel Peace Prize?",
      "Mr. Trump has touted himself as the \"president of peace\" and has said he\u00a0ended six or seven wars during his second term, including conflicts between Israel and Iran, India and Pakistan and Thailand and Cambodia. Not all of the conflicts have been fully settled, and it's not clear if the United States' actions or influence were decisive in all of them, foreign policy experts previously told CBS News. Mr. Trump also proposed a peace deal for Israel and Hamas that was agreed to on Wednesday, and he has\u00a0spoken with world leaders about ending Russia's war in Ukraine.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters in\u00a0June that the Nobel Committee \"should give\" him the Nobel Peace Prize, and that he \"should have gotten it four or five times.\" In September, Mr. Trump told United Nations delegates that \"everyone says\" he should get the award. He made similar comments when military generals gathered in Virginia last week.",
      "In private, Mr. Trump has told some associates that his presidency might be remembered for his pursuit of peace more than anything else, a source close to him told CBS News' Robert Costa. The president would like to be considered for the honor, but expectations inside the White House are low that he would get a \"fair hearing\" by the Nobel Committee, another source said.",
      "Mr. Trump was nominated for the prize by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in July and by the government of Pakistan in June. This week, the Israeli Hostages Families Forum called on the Nobel Prize committee to give the peace prize to Mr. Trump for his \"unwavering commitment and extraordinary leadership\" in seeking a deal to bring home the remaining hostages taken by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023. Netanyahu repeated his call\u00a0for Mr. Trump to receive the peace prize Thursday after Israel and Hamas agreed to the \"first phase\" of a deal he helped broker to end the war in Gaza.",
      "But these efforts have come past the deadline for the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize, and it wasn't immediately clear if Mr. Trump was nominated for the 2025 prize. He was also\u00a0nominated for the prize\u00a0during his first term.",
      "Experts told The Associated Press the Nobel Committee is unlikely to award Mr. Trump the prize for his second-term achievements so far. However, Obama was awarded the prize without having secured any peace agreements in his first year in the White House.",
      "The committee tends to focus on \"the durability of peace, the promotion of international fraternity and the quiet work of institutions that strengthen those goals,\" the AP reported. The committee also likely does not want to be seen as caving to political pressure, one expert told the AP."

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump is going to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center Friday morning for what the White House says is his \"routine yearly checkup,\" just six months after undergoing what the White House at the time described as his \"annual physical examination\" at the same facility.",
      "When asked, the White House declined to explain why the president is undergoing a second yearly checkup. Mr. Trump, 79, may travel to the Middle East in the days after his medical visit, the White House said Wednesday, after he announced the first phase of a peace deal between Israel and Hamas.",
      "\"On Friday morning, President Trump will visit Walter Reed Medical Center for a planned meeting and remarks with the troops,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement late Wednesday. \"While there, President Trump will stop by for his routine yearly check up. He will then return to the White House. President Trump is considering going to the Middle East shortly thereafter.\"",
      "The president is able to receive basic medical care at the White House from the physician to the president, but presidents typically go to Walter Reed for more extensive examinations and procedures.",
      "The president's annual physical results as released by the White House in April showed no abnormalities, aside from minor sun damage \u2014 and scarring \"on the right ear from a gunshot wound\" \u2014 a result of the assassination attempt against him in July 2024. His April records also say that he had a colonoscopy in July 2024 and was recommended to undergo another in 2027.",
      "After the president was seen with swollen ankles at the FIFA Club World Cup and a bruised hand on multiple occasions, Leavitt in July told the press that according to the readout from the president's April exam, his health was normal. The latest full exam by the White House Medical Unit, however, revealed the president has chronic venous insufficiency.",
      "According to Johns Hopkins and the Cleveland Clinic, chronic venous insufficiency occurs when veins in the legs do not function normally, leading to poor blood flow back up to the heart. The president's physician, Capt. Sean Barbabella, said that an examination revealed no evidence of a more serious condition such as deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease, and the president remains in \"excellent\" overall health. The White House has said the president's bruised hand is a result of the extensive handshaking that's part of his job."

    "story": [
      "Approximately 500 National Guard soldiers from Texas and Illinois have been deployed in the Chicago area and mobilized to protect federal agents and facilities amid a legal battle over their deployment.",
      "According to the U.S. Northern Command at the Department of Defense, approximately 200 soldiers from the Texas National Guard and 300 soldiers from the Illinois National Guard have been \"employed in the greater Chicago area.\" Their mobilization will last for a period of at least 60 days.",
      "\"These forces will protect U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other U.S. government personnel who are performing federal functions, including the enforcement of federal law, and to protect federal property,\" Northern Command said in a statement.",
      "The troops have been stationed at the U.S. Army Reserve Center in southwest suburban Elwood, where new fencing has been installed since the Texas guard members first arrived on Tuesday. Crews also have installed privacy screens along the interior of the existing fence line.",
      "Several trailers have been set up at the facility as temporary living quarters. Several soldiers were seen moving in with bags of belongings on Tuesday; some holding rifles and carrying folding chairs, possibly for meetings or other trainings.",
      "Northern Command said as part of their duties to protect federal agents and facilities, the troops would be assigned to establish security perimeters, perform crowd control, and use de-escalation tactics. While soldiers would be allowed to temporarily detain people to prevent an assault or interference with federal agents, Northern Command said they will not be arresting protesters.",
      "There were a handful of demonstrations outside the facility on Wednesday; a couple to protest against the arrival of Texas guard members, and a couple more to support them.",
      "Illinois state leaders said they only got word late Monday night that the 200 Texas National Guard troops would be stationed at the Elwood base starting Tuesday.",
      "Retired U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Richard Hayes was the highest-ranking member of the Illinois National Guard. In his 30-plus-year career, he said he's never seen a National Guard from a different state federalized and then sent to another state.",
      "\"This is novel. It doesn't mean it's necessarily illegal, it's just different,\" he said. \"As far as the soldiers are concerned, the Illinois National Guard, even the Texas National Guard, they don't get a say in whether they go or not go. It's not a political organization, they're just here to do what they're being asked to do.\"",
      "There has been little movement in or out of the training facility since the troops arrived, and CBS News Chicago legal analyst Irv Miller said he's not surprised.",
      "It remains in question whether the troops will be sent out on protection details, since the state of Illinois and city of Chicago have filed a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's deployment of the National Guard. Gov. JB Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson have argued there is no crisis requiring the troops' presence in the Chicago area.",
      "Federal judge April Perry scheduled a hearing for Thursday for arguments on a request for a temporary restraining order blocking the troop deployment. Perry declined to immediately issue that restraining order on Monday when the lawsuit was filed to give the federal government time to file briefs, which it did, minutes before the 11:59 p.m. CDT Wednesday deadline she set.",
      "In the 59-page filing, the government argued that President Trump has the legal authority to deploy the troops and that state objections should not block the operation. The federal attorneys also argued that courts should be \"highly deferential\" when reviewing a president's judgment in such matters in light of the authority they say the executive branch is given by the Constitution and statutes.",
      "Miller said it's likely leaders are waiting for the judge's decision before making any moves.",
      "\"Oh, absolutely. I mean, the judge didn't explicitly state that they couldn't come into the city, but I think if you read between the lines as to what she was saying, that it probably would be a good idea if everybody waited until she made the decision on Thursday to decide what they're going to actually do,\" Miller said.",
      "Miller said he expects the judge to grant the temporary restraining order prohibiting the deployment for now, but any decision will likely be appealed to a higher court.",
      "A federal judge in Oregon has blocked the Trump administration from deploying any National Guard units to Portland. That judge has ruled the relatively small protests outside Portland's immigration processing facility didn't justify the use of federalized forces and allowing the deployment could harm Oregon's state sovereignty.",
      "Since that ruling, Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek has called on U.S. Northern Command to demobilize the 200 Oregon National Guard troops and 200 California National Guard troops that the Trump administration had mobilized for Portland.",
      "Mr. Trump has suggested, regardless of what happens in court, he might invoke the Insurrection Act \"if it was necessary\" to deploy troops to Portland and Chicago.",
      "\"If people were being killed and courts were holding us up, or governors or mayors were holding us up, sure I'd do that. I mean, I want to make sure that people aren't killed,\" he said earlier this week.",
      "U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin said the president invoking the Insurrection Act to justify a troop deployment \"would be terrible.\"",
      "\"It would be illegal and unconstitutional, because there is no basis in law for his invasion with these troops from Texas into the state of Illinois. He is not making life any better for our state, and he's not making it any safer,\" Durbin said."

    "story": [
      "Ahead of Wednesday's\u00a0government shutdown, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development on Tuesday posted a banner in large type on its homepage blaming the shutdown on the \"Radical Left,\" an allegation that an ethics group said was a \"blatant violation\" of the Hatch Act.",
      "\"The Radical Left are going to shut down the government and inflict massive pain on the American people unless they get their $1.5 trillion wish list of demands,\" the message read. \"The Trump administration wants to keep the government open for the American people.\"",
      "A complaint filed Tuesday with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel by the nonprofit consumer advocacy group Public Citizen alleged that the banner on HUD's website was a \"blatant violation\" of the Hatch Act, describing it as \"highly partisan\" and seeking to \"idolize the Trump administration \u2026 without attributing any blame for the lack of compromise causing the shutdown.\"",
      "The Hatch Act is a federal law passed in 1939 that \"limits certain political activities of federal employees as well as some state, D.C., and local government employees who work in connection with federally funded programs,\" according to the Office of Special Counsel.",
      "Its purpose, among other things, is to \"ensure that federal programs are administered in a nonpartisan fashion,\" the office explains.",
      "\"This is such an obvious violation of the Hatch Act that it raises the question: 'How on Earth does HUD think they can get away with this?'\" Craig Holman, a government ethics expert with Public Citizen, who filed the complaint on behalf of his group, said in a statement. \"The answer is that the Trump administration has managed to neuter the ethics enforcement offices in the executive branch. Those who are responsible for enforcing the Hatch Act \u2014 namely, the Office of Special Counsel, followed by the Office of Government Ethics and the Attorney General's office \u2014 have all been taken over by Trump loyalists or those who are intimidated by Trump.\"",
      "\"The sheer crassness of this partisan advertisement by HUD using taxpayer dollars to campaign against Democrats and promote the Trump administration is going to make it exceedingly difficult for even a neutered ethics office to ignore,\" Holman added.",
      "The Office of Special Counsel is an independent federal agency that is designed to enforce the Hatch Act, investigate wrongdoing within the executive branch and protect whistleblowers from retaliation.",
      "\"Instead of agreeing to a clean funding extension, Democrats are planning a government shutdown over their $1.5 trillion wish list of demands, like free health care for illegal aliens,\" White House spokesperson Davis Ingle told CBS News in a statement Wednesday regarding the complaint. \"The Democrats petty political games are unnecessarily hurting the most vulnerable Americans in our society. Why is the media more focused on a banner than reporting on the impact of a Democrat shutdown on the American people?\"",
      "An HUD spokesperson told CBS News in another statement Wednesday that the \"Far Left is barreling our country toward a shutdown, which will hurt all Americans. At HUD, we are working to keep critical services online and support our most vulnerable.\"",
      "And in a separate statement provided later Wednesday, HUD spokeswoman Kasey Lovett said that the \"Radical Left has shut down the government. As a result, HUD's Office of Public Affairs is operating in a limited capacity, which impacts our ability to promptly engage with the mainstream media. Once the government is reopened, we look forward to being back in touch.\"",
      "Earlier this year, President Trump fired Special Counsel Hampton Dellinger, the head of OSC, and replaced him with acting Special Counsel Jamieson Greer. Dellinger sued over the firing, but it was upheld by a federal appeals court. Since returning to office, Mr. Trump has fired more than a dozen federal inspectors general who are tasked with investigating wrongdoing at government agencies.",
      "The shutdown, which took effect at 12 a.m. Wednesday, came after the Senate failed to push through a short-term funding bill that passed the House earlier this month.",
      "Democrats have called for the bill to include a permanent extension of tax credits passed in 2021 for those receiving health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, as well as a rollback of Medicaid cuts that were part of Mr. Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" that passed this summer.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers have argued that the \"big, beautiful bill\" did not cut Medicaid, but instead that it eliminated fraud within the program.",
      "\"We're not cutting Medicaid,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said in June, prior to the passage of the \"big, beautiful bill.\" \"What we're doing is strengthening the program. We're reducing fraud, waste and abuse that is rampant in Medicaid to ensure that that program is essential for so many people.\"",
      "Meanwhile, lawmakers from both parties cast blame on the other over the shutdown. Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday night that \"Republicans have until midnight to cut the garbage and get serious,\" while Senate Majority Leader John Thune called the shutdown \"totally avoidable,\" adding that \"if the government shuts down, it is on the Senate Democrats.\""

    "story": [
      "Although a short U.S. government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",
      "$1 billion hit",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",
      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Transportation Department responded to requests for comment about the impact of a potential government shutdown on travel in the U.S.",
      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers. Although Amtrak receives some federal funding and could eventually be impacted if a shutdown dragged on, the rail service is financially healthy enough to pay workers in the near term and keep trains in operation, the group\u00a0said in a statement last week.",
      "Passport services are also deemed essential and would be expected to operate during a government shutdown."

    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",

      "Replacement Medicare cards",
      "Overpayments processing",
      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",

      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The U.S. government shut down Wednesday morning after President Trump and congressional Republicans at odds with Democrats over the path forward were unable to\u00a0avert a lapse in federal funding.",
      "Mr. Trump had said Sunday that a shutdown was likely, rejecting Democrats' push for Congress to permanently extend enhanced tax credits for Americans enrolled in health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, which expire at the end of the year. The president met with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries at the White House on Monday, but the meeting ended without a breakthrough.",
      "The president canceled an earlier meeting with Republican and Democratic congressional leaders set for last week, calling their demands \"unserious and ridiculous,\" and House Republicans left Washington, D.C., earlier this month after approving a stopgap measure that kept the government funded until Nov. 21. But the proposal failed to garner the necessary support in the Senate. A Democrat-backed counter-plan to extend funding through Oct. 31, which included other party priorities, also failed in the upper chamber.",
      "In an effort to ramp up the pressure on Democrats to go along with Republicans' funding measure, the White House budget office sent a memo to federal agencies last week telling them to consider reduction-in-force plans for mass layoffs of certain federal workers during a shutdown.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Before 1980, agencies largely continued operating during a lapse in funding with the assumption that Congress would act quickly. But in 1980 and 1981, then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti authored a series of legal opinions that found government agencies didn't have the authority to continue running during a gap in funding.",
      "President Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns during his time in office, the longest of which lasted three days. There were three funding gaps between 1990 and 1995, then none until 2013.",
      "The threat of a government shutdown has become more frequent over the past decade, as Congress has found itself engaged in funding fights that are ultimately resolved with massive, yearlong spending packages. The most recent lapse in government funding, in late 2018, caused $3 billion in permanent losses, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are expected to feel the impacts of a shutdown if a deal isn't reached this time around.",

House and Senate negotiators worked over the weekend to reconcile their differences and passed identical bills on Sunday.",

      "Washington \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of federal employees could soon go without pay or face potential layoffs, since a government shutdown went into effect on Wednesday, Oct. 1.",
      "The GOP-controlled House passed a bill earlier this month to extend government funding until Nov. 21, but the bill stalled in the Senate, where Democratic votes were needed to advance it. Democrats wanted an extension of health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans opposed. With hours left before the midnight deadline Wednesday, the Senate voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded.",
      "Under the shutdown, federal employees in critical positions are required to stay on the job. Many others will be forced to stay home. Both groups will have their paychecks delayed until Congress approves more spending. Most federal contractors might not get paid at all.",
      "Here's what the shutdown means for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
      "Will members of Congress get paid during a government shutdown?",
      "The short answer is yes. Lawmakers will continue to draw a paycheck.",
      "The reason is because of how their pay is treated under the Constitution and federal law. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution states: \"The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\" Lawmakers' pay has been funded by a permanent appropriation since 1983, according to a recent Congressional Research Service\u00a0report, meaning funding for their pay doesn't need to be renewed annually.",
      "Members' pay rate is set by a process established by federal law, and the 27th Amendment says any law to change their pay can't take effect until after the next congressional election.",
      "Most members earn a salary of $174,000 per year, a rate that has not changed since 2009. The speaker of the House earns $223,500, while the president pro tempore of the Senate and the party leaders in both chambers make $193,400.",
      "When it comes to other federal entities, the law that governs how they must act during a lapse in funding is known as the Antideficiency Act. In short, it says that federal agencies generally can't spend more money than Congress has approved. This means many agencies must furlough employees \u2014 that is, tell them to stay home \u2014 if they haven't received funding.",
      "There are some exceptions. Some programs, like Social Security and Medicare, have permanent funding, and benefits continue to be paid out as normal. Employees whose jobs are necessary to protect life and property must also stay on the job. Those whose roles are authorized by other laws can keep working, as can officials with constitutional responsibilities.",
      "When it comes to congressional staffers, each office determines which employees are deemed essential and thus allowed to keep working during a shutdown. Most are expected to keep all or nearly all of their employees on board, though the staffers won't be paid until more funding is approved.",
      "Does the president get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Yes. The Constitution prohibits reducing the president's salary while in office, \"thus effectively guaranteeing the president of compensation regardless of any shutdown action,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report from 2018.",
      "The president earns $400,000 annually, an amount set by Congress in 2001.",
      "His aides and staffers, however, are subject to the furlough requirements under the Antideficiency Act, meaning those in nonessential positions could be told to stay home until Congress authorizes more funding. In past shutdowns, presidents have furloughed many executive branch employees to increase pressure on Congress to take action.",
      "Do other federal employees get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Federal employees, whether they remain on the job or are furloughed, won't get paid while the government is shut down.",
      "They also face the risk of being permanently laid off if there's a shutdown, according to a memo from the Office of Budget and Management. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Those who still have jobs will receive back pay once funding is restored to their agency. In prior shutdowns, Congress had to approve back pay for employees, but a 2019 law made it mandatory. Contractors \u2014 who were responsible for carrying out about $755 billion worth of government work in the last fiscal year \u2014 are not guaranteed back pay.",
      "Each agency determines which positions are considered essential and which are not. The Office of Management and Budget has directed agencies to notify employees no later than two business days before a lapse in funding about their work and pay status.",
      "Some members of Congress have previously pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of lawmakers continuing to be paid while other federal employees miss out on their checks. In 2023, members of both parties offered different proposals that would prevent Congress from getting paid during shutdowns, but none attracted widespread support, and the 27th Amendment forbids any immediate change."

    "published": "Thu, 09 Oct 2025 08:58:33 -0400",
    "summary": "Much of the federal government shut down after Congress failed to reach a deal to approve new funding. Here's what that means.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Much of the federal government shut down Wednesday, after Congress failed to reach a deal to approve new funding.",
      "Republicans had proposed extending government funding at current levels until Nov. 21 to allow for members to continue working on full-year appropriations bills. Democrats made a counteroffer to keep the government open through October, but attached health care provisions and restrictions on President Trump's ability to withhold funding, both of which are nonstarters with most Republicans.",
      "The two sides were dug in on their positions, increasing the chances of a shutdown beginning Wednesday. Congressional leaders met with President Trump at the White House on Monday to search for a path forward, but walked away in the same position.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass funding for some or all agencies, which can't spend money that hasn't been approved by lawmakers. There have been 14 shutdowns since 1980, with the most recent coming in 2018. That shutdown lasted 34 days.",
      "Here's what to know about what happens during the government shutdown:",
      "What is a government shutdown?",
      "Most federal government agencies are funded annually by a dozen appropriations bills that need to be passed by Congress and signed by the president before the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1. These are often grouped together into one large piece of legislation known as an \"omnibus\" bill to speed up the process when Congress inevitably needs to pass a number of them at the last minute.",
      "If the funding deadline passes without Congress authorizing more spending, the government must fully or partially shut down, depending on which agencies are already funded. Ahead of this year's deadline, none of the 12 appropriations bills have been enacted. Some agencies got an infusion of money in the Republican-passed \"one big, beautiful bill\" earlier this year, meaning certain programs and functions in some departments will remain funded in the event of a shutdown, chiefly the Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Lawmakers regularly buy themselves more time to finish spending bills by passing what's known as a continuing resolution, which temporarily extends current funding levels to keep agencies functioning while they work to reach an agreement on new spending.",
      "The Constitution says the Treasury Department cannot spend money without a law authorizing it. Under a statute known as the Antideficiency Act, agencies are required to cease operations \u2014 with certain exceptions \u2014 in the absence of funding authorized by Congress. The act, a version of which first passed in 1870, with several significant updates since, also prohibits the government from entering into financial obligations without congressional sign-off.",
      "\"Treasury cannot pay out any money if there's not a law providing for who gets the money,\" said Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. \"If those annual bills expire, then there is no law appropriating money for certain functions.\"",
      "What happens during a government shutdown, and who is affected?",
      "In a shutdown, the federal government must stop all non-essential functions until funding is approved by Congress and signed into law, except for programs that are funded by other means, like fees or other legislation. Each agency determines what work is essential and what is not. Members of Congress make that determination for their own staff, as well.",
      "\"No money can come out of Treasury whether you're essential or not essential. But who can keep working and incur obligations, even when there are no appropriations \u2014 there are three exceptions,\" Glassman said.",
      "Those exceptions are defined by the Antideficiency Act. They allow the government to fund operations to protect life and property, and keep officials involved in the constitutional process on the job, like the president, his staff and members of Congress.",
      "All active-duty military members, many federal law enforcement officers and employees at federally funded hospitals are considered essential, along with air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers. Each agency determines which of its employees can stay on the job.",
      "In a step that differs from previous shutdowns, the Office of Budget and Management last week told federal agencies to consider permanent mass layoffs for programs or projects that have discretionary funding that runs out on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices issued during a shutdown, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Whether employees are essential or not, if their pay is dependent on annual appropriations, they won't get paid during a shutdown.",
      "Essential employees continue to work during the shutdown, but don't get paid until funding is restored to their agency. Employees in nonessential positions are typically furloughed until the government is funded again, although that could look different this time if there are widespread layoffs. Under a 2019 law, furloughed employees are guaranteed to receive back pay once the shutdown is over.",
      "A Senate report published in 2019 found that government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion, including at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed workers who were not permitted to work.",
      "What is open and closed during a shutdown?",
      "Entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continue to function during a shutdown because benefit payments are funded through permanent appropriations that don't require renewal. Entitlement payments keep going out, but the working budgets of the agencies that oversee the programs require approval by Congress. That means staff could be furloughed, causing delays in enrolling new beneficiaries or other service interruptions.",
      "\"Any type of interaction you're having at a customer service level with the federal government could definitely be affected,\" Glassman said.",
      "For example, travel plans could be disrupted if air traffic control and airport security, who are essential workers, do not show up to work in protest for not being paid immediately. Many national parks stayed open during the last shutdown in 2018 and 2019, but understaffing led to vandalism and cuts in visitor services. The parks largely closed during the 2013 shutdown. The U.S. Postal Service continues to operate, since it is self-funded.",
      "Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the public may not notice the effects if the shutdown is short-lived.",
      "\"The truth is, most people won't really feel much of a difference,\" MacGuineas said. \"If you've got a vacation planned to a National Park, you're going to be [upset] and disappointed. But most people will go on with their everyday lives and interact with the government the same way they do and not feel a big difference. That could get worse, the longer it lasts.\"",
      "The Senate report found the 2018-2019 shutdown had widespread impacts across a variety of government functions that ceased or were curtailed during the lapse in funding. It noted that furloughs in many agencies like the SEC, Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Product Safety Commission hampered enforcement and investigations. The report said the Justice Department canceled 60,000 immigration hearings.",
      "The effects could be even more pronounced this time around, given the possibility that the administration could use the shutdown to implement mass layoffs, furthering the president's aim of permanently reducing the federal workforce.",
      "When was the last government shutdown?",
      "The last government shutdown stretched from December 2018 until January 2019, when congressional funding for nine executive branch departments with roughly 800,000 employees lapsed.",
      "The five-week partial shutdown cost the economy $11 billion, according to a Congressional Budget Office report. The CBO said most of that would be recovered once the shutdown ended, but estimated a permanent loss of about $3 billion.",
      "Businesses across the country that relied on government customers reported a slowdown in business and some said they had to lay off employees. Tens of thousands of immigration court hearings were canceled. Government contractors struggled to feed their families and pay their bills.",
      "The shutdown stemmed from a standoff over Mr. Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to fund a wall along the border with Mexico. Mr. Trump had vowed to close the government if the funding wasn't included in spending legislation, but Democrats refused to give in.",
      "Mr. Trump conceded after insisting for weeks that he would not reopen the government without money for the wall, signing a bill to reopen the government for three weeks while Congress negotiated a spending deal.",
      "Three weeks later, Mr. Trump signed a compromise spending bill to avert another government shutdown, ultimately accepting a bill that did not meet his $5.7 billion demand for his long-promised border wall.",
      "When was the longest government shutdown?",
      "Before the early 1980s, the government would typically continue operating as usual even when funding bills hadn't been passed, but that changed after the attorney general issued opinions stating that it was illegal for the government to spend money without congressional approval.",
      "Since 1980, there have been 14 shutdowns, most of which lasted just a few days.",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history was the 2018-2019 lapse, which lasted 34 full days. Before that, the record was 21 days in 1995 and 1996, when President Bill Clinton held out against steep spending and tax cuts favored by Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich."

    "story": [
      "The president of Colombia alleged Wednesday that a boat struck by the U.S. military in the Caribbean Sea last week carried Colombian citizens, a claim a White House official called \"baseless and reprehensible.\"",
      "The U.S. military has hit at least four alleged drug boats since last month, with the most recent known strike on Oct. 3 killing four \"narco-terrorists\" in a vessel off the coast of Venezuela, according to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The Trump administration argues the attacks are necessary to halt drug trafficking, but critics say the administration lacks legal approval to carry out the strikes.",
      "On Wednesday, Colombian President Gustavo Petro wrote on X: \"Indications show that the last bombed boat was Colombian with Colombian citizens inside it.\"",
      "Petro did not specify the source of his information or why he believes the people on\u00a0the boat were Colombian citizens, though he said he hopes their families come forward. The U.S. military has not publicly identified the boat's passengers.",
      "The White House quickly denounced Petro's statement. A White House official told CBS News the U.S. \"looks forward to President Petro publicly retracting his baseless and reprehensible statement so that we can return to a productive dialogue on building a strong, prosperous future for the people of [the] United States and Colombia.\"",
      "The White House official also described Colombia as an important U.S. partner despite \"policy differences with the current government.\"",
      "The first leftist elected president of Colombia in decades, Petro has periodically clashed with the Trump administration. He denounced the strikes on alleged drug boats in a speech before the United Nations last month, and days later, he encouraged members of the U.S. military to \"disobey\" Mr. Trump's orders during a New York protest \u2014 leading the State Department to announce it would revoke his visa. Meanwhile, the U.S. has accused his government of not cooperating on anti-drug trafficking efforts.",
      "Petro's most recent allegation adds to mounting scrutiny of the Trump administration's campaign of strikes against alleged drug-carrying vessels in the Caribbean.",
      "President Trump has cast the strikes as part of a broader gambit to combat drug smuggling and stem the flow of deadly narcotics into the U.S. His administration has designated several cartels and Latin American gangs as terrorist organizations, and since August, several U.S. Navy vessels have been stationed in the Caribbean as part of an anti-cartel mission \u2014 drawing stiff backlash from the Venezuelan government.",
      "\"Every one of those boats is responsible for the death of 25,000 American people and the destruction of families,\" Mr. Trump said in a speech in Virginia marking the Navy's 250th anniversary over the weekend. \"So when you think of it that way, what we're doing is actually an act of kindness.\"",
      "In a notice to Congress obtained by CBS News, the Trump administration described the passengers on one alleged drug boat as \"unlawful combatants\" \u2014 the term that President George W. Bush's administration used to describe members of al Qaeda \u2014 and argued that the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with the cartels.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters Wednesday the attacks are \"targeted strikes against imminent threats against the United States,\" and the president does not need permission from Congress to carry them out.",
      "But critics \u2014 including some members of Congress \u2014 have argued Mr. Trump is acting without legal authority, and have pushed the administration to provide evidence that the boats were carrying drugs or that the passengers were guilty of anything. Congress has not authorized the use of military force against drug cartels.",
      "On Wednesday, Senate Democrats forced a vote on a resolution that sought to block further strikes. The measure failed 48-51, but it picked up support from Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a longstanding skeptic of military force.",
      "\"If anyone gave a you-know-what about justice, perhaps those in charge of deciding whom to kill might let us know their names, present proof of their guilt, show evidence of their crimes,\" Paul said. \"Is it too much to ask to know the names of those we kill before we kill them? To know what evidence exists of their guilt? At the very least, the government should explain how the gang came to be labeled as terrorists.\""

      "\"There has been no authorization to use force by Congress in this way,\" Schiff said Wednesday, saying the strikes risk escalating into a full-blown conflict with Venezuela. \"I feel it is plainly unconstitutional.\"",
      "The strikes in the Caribbean Sea have prompted bipartisan backlash, with lawmakers questioning their legality. Congress, which has the sole authority under the Constitution to declare war, has not authorized the use of military force against drug cartels.",
      "The Trump administration says it has conducted four strikes on alleged drug-trafficking boats near Venezuela since Sept. 2, killing at least 21 people.",
      "In a notification to Congress after the second strike in mid-September, the Trump administration said the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels it has designated as terrorist organizations. The drugs smuggled by these cartels kill tens of thousands of Americans each year and constitute an \"armed attack\" against U.S. citizens, according to the White House.",
      "The Trump administration has designated several drug cartels and gangs as terrorist organizations, including Venezuela's Tren de Aragua, Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel and El Salvador's MS-13.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was at the Capitol on Wednesday to meet with Senate Republicans, told reporters the president has the authority to order the strikes without congressional authorization.",
      "\"These are targeted strikes against imminent threats against the United States,\" he said.",
      "Regarding claims that the U.S. is acting in self-defense, David Janovsky, the acting director of The Constitution Project at Project on Government Oversight said, \"The situation in the Caribbean is not that.\"",
      "Democrats' war powers resolution said the designation of drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations \"provides no legal authority for the president to use force against members of designated organizations or any foreign state.\"",
      "Kaine said the administration has not provided answers to lawmakers' questions on the intelligence supporting the strikes, the legal rationale for them or why the decision was made to attack the boats instead of intercept them.",
      "\"The White House does not maintain there's any congressional authorization,\" Kaine said. \"These military actions should stop unless authorized by Congress \u2014 not stopped, period, permanently, forever, can't-do-them stopped \u2014 unless authorized by congressional action.\"",
      "Under the War Powers Resolution of 1973, the president is required to consult Congress before introducing armed forces into hostilities, unless there has been a declaration of war or other congressional authorization. If Congress does not authorize military force, the president has to withdraw forces within 90 days. The law was enacted in response to the Vietnam War as a check on the president's power to wage war without the consent of Congress.",
      "Paul has been the loudest GOP critic of the strikes on the alleged drug smuggling boats. After the first strike, Paul condemned Vice President JD Vance, who said \"killing cartel members who poison our fellow citizens is the highest and best use of our military.\"",
      "\"What a despicable and thoughtless sentiment it is to glorify killing someone without a trial,\" Paul wrote.",
      "Paul underscored his point in a floor speech Wednesday, saying the strikes risk killing innocent people and the administration has presented no evidence that the boats were carrying drugs.",
      "\"If anyone gave a you-know-what about justice, perhaps those in charge of deciding whom to kill might let us know their names, present proof of their guilt, show evidence of their crimes,\" Paul said. \"Is it too much to ask to know the names of those we kill before we kill them? To know what evidence exists of their guilt? At the very least, the government should explain how the gang came to be labeled as terrorists.\"",
      "Paul added, \"the blow-them-to-smithereens crowd also conveniently ignores the fact that death is generally not the penalty for drug smuggling.\"",
      "During debate on the resolution, other Republicans were untroubled about the president taking unilateral action against the alleged drug traffickers and that the administration has left Congress in the dark on details of the strikes.",
      "\"These strikes were fully compliant and fully justified,\" Republican Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho said.",
      "There were similar efforts by Congress over the summer to reassert its authority to declare war as tensions boiled over between Israel and Iran. The U.S. became directly involved in the 12-day war by bombing Iran's nuclear facilities before Iran and Israel agreed to a ceasefire.",
      "After the Iran strikes, the Senate voted down a measure that Kaine had introduced in the days before the bombings to block President Trump from using further military force against Iran.",
      "\"The Iran situation was extremely time-limited,\" Janovsky said. \"The administration has made it very clear that they continue, and have in fact continued, to carry out these strikes in the Caribbean. So I think that certainly creates more ongoing urgency for Congress to act in some way in this case.\"",
      "Schiff said Congress has abdicated its war-declaring responsibilities because members don't want to go on the record on the issue. He said that sets a dangerous precedent.",
      "\"We're blowing up ships thousands of miles from our shore,\" Schiff said. \"What is to stop some other nation from deciding, well, they're going to use the same precedent to blow up ships thousands of miles from their shore, whether in the South China Sea or elsewhere, with a purported rationale that they're engaged in some kind of trafficking and therefore they're taking action? I don't think this is a practice we want to see other nations adopt.\""

    "published": "Wed, 08 Oct 2025 14:42:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Trump made substantial inroads in heavily Latino areas in New Jersey in 2024, but many have since soured on him and the GOP, a CBS News analysis finds.",
    "story": [
      "With just weeks to go, the New Jersey governor's race is tightening and garnering national attention as an early test of voter sentiment about President Trump's second term and the ability of Democrats to counter Republicans ahead of next year's midterm elections.",
      "New Jersey's Latino electorate is emerging as a potentially decisive voting bloc in the battle between Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli, who is backed by Mr. Trump.",
      "Most independent polls show Sherrill leading with likely voters ahead of the election on Nov. 4, though generally just by single digits.",
      "Democrats are worried \u2014 national party sources tell CBS News that Sherrill \"needs help,\" and allies have begun to rally more support for her in the closing weeks of the campaign.",
      "\"We're jumping right into this New Jersey race, despite a lot of folks thinking it's a blue state and we may not need to act,\" says Janet Murguia, president of UnidosUS Action Fund.",
      "The political arm of the nation's largest Latino advocacy organization, UnidosUS, is expected to announce it's endorsing Sherrill on Wednesday, betting that Latinos could help decide this race.",
      "\"She's strong on housing, healthcare, and education which our community and Latino voters care a lot about, and she doesn't see Latinos as an afterthought,\" said Murguia, adding that 2025 has underscored the importance of a governor's role in fending off the Trump administration, citing California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker as examples.",
      "Sherrill, some Democrats admit, has struggled with her message, which often echoes the playbook former Vice President Kamala Harris employed in her failed 2024 White House campaign. Several Democrats tell CBS News that Sherrill's campaign has yet to articulate a compelling economic message and has failed to sharpen the focus on \"kitchen table\" issues like inflation and cost of living.",
      "In the presidential election, Harris carried New Jersey with 52% of the vote, but Mr. Trump made significant inroads, especially among Latino communities.",
      "New Jersey's 9th Congressional District provides a stark illustration of the trend. Voters elected Democrat Nellie Pou to the U.S. House last year, but in an election-night surprise, Mr. Trump carried the district at the presidential level. For reference, former President Joe Biden carried it by 19 points in 2020. This is a heavily Latino district and one of just 13 districts across the country that backed Mr. Trump while electing a Democrat to the House.",
      "Mr. Trump made substantial inroads in other heavily Latino areas, too. For example, the working-class city of Paterson has a population that is over 60% Latino. Mr. Trump's share of the vote there nearly doubled between 2020 and 2024, cutting the Democratic margin in half. And Passaic, a city with a 70% Latino population, actually flipped to Mr. Trump in 2024. In both of these cities, his vote margin increased by over 30 points. He also flipped the county and became the first Republican to win the presidential vote in Passaic in over 30 years.",
      "While these shifts were partly due to Biden voters switching to Mr. Trump in 2024, they also occurred as a result of changes in turnout. New Jersey saw a decline in turnout rates from 2020 to 2024, and the drops were more pronounced among Latino voters and registered Democrats. Many Biden 2020 voters simply stayed home, helping explain why Harris' vote totals were much lower than Biden's in these communities, while Mr. Trump's actually rose slightly.",
      "The gaps in turnout between White voters and voters of color often increase in off-year elections, so a big question in 2025 is what turnout will look like in the state's ethnically diverse communities, like those in Passaic. That will shape the final vote margin between Sherill and Ciattarelli.",
      "While Republicans made inroads with Latinos in New Jersey and across the country last year, many have soured on Mr. Trump and the GOP.",
      "CBS News polling throughout the 2024 campaign pointed to dissatisfaction with the economy and rising prices as key drivers of voting decisions. Today, CBS News polling indicates that many voters are still unhappy with the direction of the country and the economy specifically.",
      "According to the latest CBS News national survey, most Latinos rank either the economy / jobs (26%) or inflation (25%) as the most important issue facing the country. Two-thirds of Latinos rate the national economy negatively. And Mr. Trump's job approval rating has slid to 38% among Latinos, from a high of 49% at the start of his term.",
      "In particular, Mr. Trump's approval rating on handling inflation has fallen to a 32% among Latinos, and majorities say his policies are costing the U.S. jobs and making them worse off financially.",
      "Nationwide, most Latinos now say whether or not they support him, they believe that Mr. Trump is not following through on the promises he made during his campaign.",
      "These numbers suggest this may be why the Sherrill campaign is trying to link Ciattarelli and Mr. Trump as much as possible, as well as emphasizing the cost of living in the state. It remains to be seen whether Democrats will be able to reverse recent trends by winning back some Biden-to-Trump Latinos and by giving their infrequent voters a reason to turn out this fall."

      "California's controversial plan to redraw its congressional maps mid-decade is among the most pressing issues discussed by\u00a0candidates in the 2026 gubernatorial race.",
      "Xavier Becerra, Chad Bianco, Ian Calderon, Stephen J. Cloobeck, Steve Hilton, Katie Porter, Tony Thurmond, Antonio Villaraigosa, Butch Ware, Betty Yee and Leo Zacky shared their thoughts and where they stand on the issue.",
      "Proposition 50, placed on the ballot by the state legislature for a November special election, would authorize California lawmakers to redraw the state's congressional districts.",
      "The redistricting effort, backed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, is aimed at sending more Democrats to Congress by redrawing\u00a0five of the state's districts for U.S. House seats\u00a0to be more favorable to Democrats in next year's midterm elections. California Democrats call it a countermeasure to President Trump's push for\u00a0Texas' recent redistricting, which favors Republicans in the midterms.",
      "Unlike in Texas, California voters took the power to draw these maps away from lawmakers in 2020 and established an\u00a0independent redistricting commission.\u00a0Proposition 50 would give that power back to lawmakers for the next five years, through the next presidential election.",
      "Over several weeks in September, CBS News California Investigates sat down with each candidate to ask questions on a variety of issues that matter to voters, including Proposition 50.",
      "While Democratic candidates generally backed Proposition 50 along party lines, some admitted unease when pressed on the controversial partisan details. Republican and Green Party opponents defended their opposition as they responded to arguments in favor of the measure.",
      "What do you think of the governor's plan?",
      "Former Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a Democrat who served as Health and Human Services Secretary in the Biden administration, defended the plan as necessary to protect California's voice in Washington, saying it would \"make sure that Donald Trump doesn't put his thumb on the scale on the votes in Congress.\"",
      "Republican candidate Steve Hilton condemned the plan, saying outright that it is \"totally corrupt and it's unconstitutional and it is illegal.\"",
      "\"Politicians shouldn't draw their own maps,\" Hilton said. \"I mean, that's obviously wrong and corrupt. Common sense tells you that.\"",
      "Former state Assemblymember Ian Calderon, also a Democrat, said he supports the plan and emphasized California's position as a donor state.",
      "\"At the end of the day, if we're going to have hope of any type of leverage throughout the next couple of years during Donald Trump's presidency, it would be really helpful if Democrats controlled Congress, so that we could fight back and secure the money that is coming to California,\" Calderon said.",
      "However, he acknowledged unease with the Democratic gerrymandering and noted that his wife vehemently opposed Prop 50. \u00a0\"She thinks that districts should be drawn by independent redistricting commissions and that it is wrong for the state to be putting its finger on the scale, Calderon said.",
      "Republican candidate Leo Zacky called the proposal \"unconstitutional,\" criticizing Democratic lawmakers for redrawing the independent redistricting commission's maps for their own partisan purposes.",
      "\"The way that it's set up is that we, the people, are supposed to figure out how the districts are supposed to be drawn,\" he said. \"[Newsom is] violating the Constitution. He's spending a ton of money doing it. It's trash. It's a waste.\"",
      "Green Party candidate Butch Ware accused Democrats of consolidating power under the guise of fighting Republican overreach.",
      "\"In the state of California, are y'all feeling that this has been a state that has been well-run and for your best interest? So you're going to essentially hand them the keys to make sure that they own every district in the state? You imagine thinking that you can fight fascism with fascism,\" Ware said.",
      "While Democratic former State Controller Betty Yee called the redistricting effort \"essential\" to prevent the manipulation of elections, \"as the president has asked the state of Texas to do.\"",
      "\"We have a process for this. It's after every decennial census\u2026 And just the idea that there is manipulation that is being directed from the top, that's going to affect California's representation, our proportionate representation,\" Yee said. \"We have to fight that.\"",
      "Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, who is running as a Democrat, said the redistricting effort is California's opportunity to counter \"gerrymandering coming out of states like Texas.\"",
      "\"Not only will it give voters something better and the chance to gain five new Democratic seats. We're doing it in a way that is transparent,\" he said. \"We're going to do it in a way that lets the voters decide.\"",
      "Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, also a Democrat, said the redistricting effort is a necessary response to Republican attempts to rig elections elsewhere.",
      "\"Let the people decide, and I'm for it. I think people have a right to challenge what's going on, this rigged election that they're trying to do,\" Villaraigosa said.",
      "Businessman Steve Cloobeck, a Democrat, supported the plan and said \"we have to preserve Democracy.\" Another Democrat, Katie Porter, who's a law professor and former member of Congress, said she is in \"support of the governor's plan.\"",
      "Republican Sheriff Chad Bianco of Riverside County expressed opposition.",
      "\"It's like saying murder is not acceptable, so I'm going to go murder you,\" Bianco said. \"Let me tell you how broken something is by telling you I'm going to break it more.\"",
      "Message to Californians who voted for Trump",
      "The Democratic candidates also explained their message   to the roughly 40% of California voters who supported Donald Trump in 2020, voters whose political representation could be diminished under the new district maps.",
      "Becerra said he would talk to them \"straight out\" and emphasized his intention to win every vote. Becerra also emphasized that now is the time to stand up for the rule of law and Democracy.",
      "\"No one should do power grabs. No one is a king. No one has a right to deny you your vote,\" he said.",
      "Like Becerra, Calderon said his campaign would focus on listening to all voters, not just talking at them.",
      "\"There are a lot of Republicans in the state who don't necessarily love everything Trump is doing,\" Calderon said. \"They just want to be heard.\"",
      "Thurmond echoed similar arguments, saying that many of Mr. Trump's voters may not support all of the president's policies.",
      "\"Most Americans do not support attacks on the immigrant communities or education cuts,\" he said. \"Just because they voted for Trump doesn't mean they agree with everything.\"",
      "Yee acknowledged that some voters, particularly in rural Republican districts, may feel disenfranchised.",
      "\"What I will say to them also is, look, these are areas of the state that actually want to become vital economies. These are areas that actually have probably disproportionate rates of people on Medicaid. These are parts of the states where people are relying on food assistance more than probably other parts,\" Yee said. \"I would just say, who's going to best represent those interests when those cuts are upon you?\"",
      "Businessman Steve Cloobeck emphasized loyalty to California's interests rather than party politics.",
      "\"I would look at the polls of the state right now. The polls say protect California. Whatever the California customers want, I will be their leader and represent them,\" Cloobeck said.",
      "Villaraigosa said he expects to alienate some voters on both sides, but believes many are still looking for leadership that bridges divides.",
      "\"I know there are Democrats that I might alienate in the course of this race, and there will be Republicans I alienate. There will also be Democrats and some Republicans that want a leader who's a uniter who wants to work with both sides, who wants the focus on common sense. So you win a few, you lose a few.\"",
      "Porter, who has represented a swing district in Orange County, was the only candidate\u00a0to refuse to directly answer the question, taking issue with the premise that she might need Republican voters to win.",
      "\"How would I need them in order to win?\" Porter asked. \"If it is me versus a Republican, I think that I will win the people who did not vote for Trump.\"",
      "As several of her opponents noted, in\u00a0California's top-two open primary\u00a0system, Republican voters could help put a Democratic candidate over the top.",
      "Porter then threatened to call off the interview, taking issue with too many follow-up questions. She ultimately stayed and continued answering questions.",
      "The Republican and Green Party Proposition 50 opponents also defended their opposition to pro-redistricting arguments.",
      "Do two wrongs make a right?",
      "The candidates also confronted the ethical dilemma\u00a0that even some Prop 50 supporters acknowledge: Does fighting one partisan maneuver with another set the wrong precedent? In other words, do two wrongs make right?",
      "\"It's let me tell you how broken something is by telling you I'm going to break it more,\" Bianco said.",
      "Becerra defended the plan as necessary to protect California's voice in Washington.",
      "\"Donald Trump is afraid he's going to lose his slim majority of Republicans come 2026,\" Becerra said. \"So he's trying to rig the process to give himself more Republicans. That is not a Democratic process. We're going to fight as we need to make sure our votes count.\"",
      "Calderon offered a conflicted view, calling it \"kind of a sh---- choice\" but emphasizing the political stakes.",
      "\"If we're going to have hope of any type of leverage during Donald Trump's presidency, it would be really helpful if Democrats controlled Congress.\"",
      "Ware warned voters not to fall for partisan manipulation.",
      "\"This doesn't serve the voters of California. It serves the DNC. It does not help us. It helps them,\" Ware said. \"They are using Californians essentially as a prop in their battle between Democrats and Republicans.\"",
      "Porter said it's not two wrongs, highlighting the nature in which Texas approached its redistricting.",
      "\"What Texas is doing is acting out of the course of the census, not following new census data\u2026 They're doing it because Donald Trump instructed them to do it,\" she said.",
      "Villaraigosa said he's for letting the people decide on the matter to challenge corruption.",
      "\"I think people have a right to challenge what's going on, this rigged election that they're trying to do,\" he said.",
      "Thurmond called the special election on Proposition 50 \"an important moment for voters to decide.\"",
      "Yee reaffirmed her stance on California's move to counter Texas' redistricting effort.",
      "\"Just the idea that there's manipulation that is being directed from the top that's going to affect California's proportionate representation, we have to fight back,\" she said.",
      "Cloobeck also highlighted California's position as a donor state.",
      "\"Donald Trump's actions have been such that he wants to just attack California. He has not shown us any gratitude for all the billions of dollars of tax dollars the federal government gets from California,\" he said.",
      "Hilton described the difficulty California faces in properly redrawing its congressional districts mid-decade rather than after the federal census every 10 years.",
      "\"By drawing these maps in the middle, they don't know who lives where,\" he said. \"Millions of people have left California. In Los Angeles, whole communities have burned down. Who knows who lives there? There's no way that they can honor that constitutional requirement.\"",
      "Hilton stressed that even before Newsom's redistricting effort, California already had \"a massively distorted political map.\"",
      "Acknowledging that Republicans make up about 40% of the vote in California but have just 17% of the congressional seats, Hilton said, \"With this new plan that they've got, it would be down to 6%.\"",
      "Hilton argued that those voters are being pushed out of representation altogether, saying that the plan would unfairly increase the weight of Democratic votes by as much as eight times compared to Republican ones.",
      "\"We're completely violating the principle of equal protection, the whole idea,\" Hilton said.",
      "While candidates differ sharply on Proposition 50, voters will have the final say. The redistricting plan will go before voters in a special election on November 4. If approved, the new congressional maps would remain intact through the 2028 presidential election, until 2030.",

    "story": [
      "Tokyo \u2014 An agitated bear roamed the aisles of a grocery store in central Japan, injuring two men and frightening shoppers, officials said Wednesday, while Japanese media said a man was found dead after a separate suspected bear mauling.",
      "More and more wild bears have been spotted in Japan in recent years, even in residential areas, due to factors including a declining human population and climate change.",
      "A man was found dead on a mountain Wednesday in the northern Iwate region after a suspected bear attack, according to public broadcaster NHK, citing police.",
      "Separately, the 4.5-foot adult bear that entered the grocery store Tuesday evening in Numata, Gunma, north of Tokyo, lightly injured a man in his 70s and another in his 60s, regional police and fire officials said.",
      "The store is close to mountainous areas, but has never had bears come near before, Hiroshi Horikawa, a management planning official at the grocery store chain, told AFP.",
      "\"It entered from the main entrance and stayed inside for roughly four minutes,\" he said. \"It almost climbed onto the fish case and damaged glass. In the fruits section, it knocked over a pile of avocados and stamped on them.\"",
      "The store's manager told local media that around 30 to 40 customers were inside at the time, and that the bear became agitated as it struggled to find the exit.",
      "Also on Tuesday, a farmer in Iwate region was scratched and bitten by a bear, accompanied by a cub, just outside his house.",
      "A Spanish tourist on Sunday was attacked by a bear at a bus stop in scenic Shirakawa-go village in central Japan.",
      "Between April and September, 108 people nationwide suffered injuries caused by bears, including five deaths, according to the environment ministry. There were a record number of human encounters with bears in Japan last year, with 219 attacks including six deaths in the 12 months to April 2024.",
      "The impacts of climate change on the bears' food sources and hibernation cycles has been cited by experts as a key factor, but there are also implications as Japan's aging population shrinks and humans abandon more rural areas.",
      "That depopulation has left bears \"a chance to expand their range,\" biologist Koji Yamazaki, from Tokyo University of Agriculture,\u00a0told CBS News' Elizabeth Palmer in 2023.",
      "Japan is one of the few places in the world where a large mammal species has been reclaiming habitat \u2014 which is good news for the bears, but if, as biologists suspect, the bear population is growing, the country will have to figure out new ways to protect people and vital infrastructure from the animals."

    "story": [
      "Stockholm\u00a0\u2014 John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret and John M. Martinis won the Nobel Prize in Physics on Tuesday for research on seemingly obscure quantum tunneling that is advancing digital technology.",
      "Clarke, 83, conducted his research at the University of California, Berkeley; Martinis at the University of California, Santa Barbara; and Devoret at Yale and also at the University of California, Santa Barbara.",
      "\"To put it mildly, it was the surprise of my life,\" Clarke told reporters at the announcement by phone after being told of his win.",

      "\"Our discovery in some ways is the basis of quantum computing. Exactly at this moment where this fits in is not entirely clear to me.\"",
      "However, speaking from his cellphone, Clarke added: \"One of the underlying reasons that cellphones work is because of all this work.''",
      "The Nobel committee said that the laureates' work in the 1980s continues to provide opportunities to develop \"the next generation of quantum technology, including quantum cryptography, quantum computers, and quantum sensors.\"",
      "\"It is wonderful to be able to celebrate the way that century-old quantum mechanics continually offers new surprises. It is also enormously useful, as quantum mechanics is the foundation of all digital technology,\" said Olle Eriksson, Chair of the Nobel Committee for Physics.",
      "The 100-year-old field of quantum mechanics deals with the seemingly impossible subatomic world where switches can be on and off at the same time and parts of atoms tunnel through what seems like impenetrable barriers. The prize winning trio's work helped take that into the larger world, where it has the potential to supercharge computing and communications.",
      "What the three physicists did \"is taking the scale of something that we can't see, we can't touch, we can't feel and bringing it up to the scale of something recognizable and make it something you can build upon,\" said Physics Today editor-in-chief Richard Fitzgerald, who in the 1990s worked in the field on a competitors' group.",
      "\"Quantum computers is one very sort of obvious use, but they're also can be used for quantum sensors, so to be able to make very sensitive measurements of, for example, magnetic fields, and perhaps also for cryptography, so to encode information so it cannot be easily listened to by a third party,\" Mark Pearce, a professor of astrophysics and Nobel Physics Committee member, told The Associated Press.",
      "It is the 119th time the prize has been awarded. Last year, artificial intelligence pioneers John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton won the physics prize for helping create the building blocks of machine learning.",
      "On Monday, Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for discoveries about how the immune system knows to attack germs and not our bodies.",
      "Nobel announcements continue with the chemistry prize on Wednesday and literature on Thursday. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday and the Nobel Memorial Prize in economics on Oct. 13.",
      "The award ceremony will be held Dec. 10, the anniversary of the 1896 death of Alfred Nobel, the wealthy Swedish industrialist and the inventor of dynamite who founded the prizes.",

      "Despite the proposed cuts, NASA's acting administrator, Sean Duffy, said last month as he introduced a new class of 10 NASA astronaut candidates that there's a possibility one of them could be among the first Americans to put their boots on Mars. However, flights are not yet on the drawing board, and most experts say no such NASA mission is likely to launch within the next decade, and probably longer.",

      "Brunkow got the news of her prize from an AP photographer who came to her home in the early hours of the morning.",
      "She said she had ignored the earlier call from the Nobel committee. \"My phone rang and I saw a number from Sweden and thought: 'That's just, that's spam of some sort.'\"",
      "\"When I told Mary she won, she said, 'don't be ridiculous,'\" said her husband, Ross Colquhoun.",
      "\"It was a nice surprise,\" Sakaguchi told a news conference from the University of Osaka in western Japan. \"I hope researches into the area will further progress so that our findings can be used in treatment, and I hope we can contribute to that as well.\"",
      "The immune system has many overlapping systems to detect and fight bacteria, viruses and other bad actors. Key immune warriors such as T cells get trained on how to spot bad actors. If some instead go awry in a way that might trigger autoimmune diseases, they're supposed to be eliminated in the thymus \u2014 a process called central tolerance.",
      "The Nobel winners unraveled an additional way the body keeps the system in check.",
      "The Nobel Committee said it started with Sakaguchi's discovery in 1995 of a previously unknown T cell subtype now known as regulatory T cells or T-regs. Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.",
      "The Nobel Committee said two years later, Sakaguchi linked the discoveries to show that the Foxp3 gene controls the development of those T-regs \u2014\u00a0which in turn act as a security guard to find and curb other forms of T cells that overreact.",
      "Brunkow said she and Ramsdell were working together at a small biotech company and they were investigating why a particular strain of mice had an over-active immune system. They had to work with brand new techniques to find the mouse gene behind the problem \u2014 but quickly realized it could be a major player in human health, too.",
      "\"From a DNA level, it was a really small alteration that caused this massive change to how the immune system works.\"",

    "story": [
      "The moon will appear slightly larger and brighter Monday night during what's known as a supermoon.",
      "October's supermoon is the first of three this year. It happens when a full moon is closer to Earth in its orbit. That makes the moon look up to 14% bigger and 30% brighter than the faintest moon of the year, according to NASA. The subtle difference happens a few times a year, sometimes coinciding with other astronomical events such as lunar eclipses.",
      "\"It's not really very unusual,\" said Derrick Pitts, chief astronomer with the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia.",
      "Everyone in the world can see a supermoon without special equipment, if the skies are clear. But the difference can be tough to discern, especially if people haven't observed the regular moon on the nights leading up.",
      "\"If you go out and just look at the moon when it's very high in the sky, there is nothing relative to it to give you an idea of how big it looks,\" Pitts said.",
      "In the latest viewing, the moon will pass within about 224,600 miles of Earth. The closest supermoon of the year is slated for November, followed by another in December.",
      "The spectacles continue in 2026 with two lunar eclipses: a total eclipse across much of North America, Asia and Australia in March, and a partial one in August across the Americas, Africa and Europe.",
      "Why does the moon appear bigger and brighter during a supermoon?",
      "Like Earth's orbit around the Sun, the moon's orbit around Earth is elliptical, or oval-shaped. This means it's positioned at different distances from the planet depending on the time of the month. The distances range from about 226,000 miles and 251,000 miles, according to NASA.",
      "When the moon is hovering around one of those closer distances along its path in orbit, and there's also a full moon, it becomes a supermoon. The proximity to Earth can make the moon appear bigger to skywatchers on the ground. Sunlight reflecting off the moon can also appear brighter, NASA says.",
      "Supermoons only happen three or four times a year, since the moon's closeness to Earth rarely coincides with monthly full moons. They aren't identical, either. Astronomers generally consider a full moon to be \"super\" if the moon's position in orbit is at least 90% of the distance from its farthest point to Earth in the ellipse to its closest. The absolute closest point\u00a0is called the perigee."

      "\"Yep, they'll be monitoring the system and ready to take over at a moment's notice,\" McMullen said. \"But we'll also have real live aircraft out there for it to fight against. Those jets will be piloted by real fighter pilots trying their best to outsmart the AI.\"",
      "So, are we witnessing a revolution?",
      "\"If we continue down this path, it has the potential to be a revolution,\" said Spain.",
      "\"You actually can take more risk\"",
      "Retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Clint Hinote says it is a revolution born of necessity: \"The Air Force was so good for so long that it didn't need to change. Now it needs to change, and it's trying to figure out how.\"",
      "Change because the Chinese air force, which recently \u00a0showcased its newest jet fighters and its own AI drone, could be more than a match for the U.S. Air Force. According to Hinote, \"If we have to fight China, we're likely doing it in their front yard, and that means they can bring many, many more things to bear than we can, because it's so far away. You're having to achieve kill ratios of 10 to 1, 15 to 1, and 20 to 1 to even stay in the game.\"",
      "I asked, \"How do these war games come out when American pilots are going up against 20 to 1 odds?\"",
      "\"The war games don't turn out very well,\" Hinote replied. \"We lose.\"",
      "The Air Force is counting on AI drones to even the odds, by bringing to an aircraft what a human pilot doesn't. McMullen said, \"The big thing with artificial intelligence is the ability to handle large amounts of data. A human out in a complex air combat environment, there's just no way to absorb all of it. Artificial intelligence might be able to take all of the data information, and then process that very quickly, and then make real-time decisions.\"",
      "AI drones will be about half the length of a manned jet fighter, and one-quarter the cost \u2013 $20 to 30 million each. Hinote said, \"You could buy more airplanes, put them in the field, and still not break the bank. The key would be that you don't have to bring the human operator home; you actually can take more risk.\"",
      "Spain says the Air Force expects to have 150 AI-piloted aircraft by the end of the decade, and eventually up to 1,000.",
      "I asked, \"These drones aren't just going to sit in a hangar waiting for war with China. What are they going to do in peacetime?\"",
      "\"It's pretty wide open,\" Spain replied.",
      "\"Could you send up AI drones to intercept those Russian bombers that come down off the coast of Alaska?\"",
      "\"Yes, you could do that,\" he said.",
      "Those intercepts can turn nasty in an instant. Last year a Russian fighter rocked an American F-16, so AI drones would have to be prepared to shoot.",
      "So, is AI going to be making life-or-death decisions? \"Absolutely not,\" said Spain. \"Absolutely not. The human who's controlling the AI will make the life-and-death decisions.\"",
      "At least for now.",
      "Making life-or-death decisions",
      "Hinote said, \"Increasingly militaries around the world, including the United States military, are going to be pressured to give the machines more leeway in making those life-or-death decisions.\"",
      "Including the capability to fire on their own? \"The United States military is investing in the experimentation that you would need to be able to produce the types of platforms that could fire on their own if you gave them that option,\" Hinote said.",
      "If adversaries let AI make those decisions, what happens? \"I think they do so at their own peril,\" said Spain. \"Because the AI can be fooled, the AI can be overwhelmed. It can give you false outcomes. We've seen that AI can hallucinate. So, it's not a guarantee of success. What it guarantees is that it will do something quickly.\"",
      "\"Don't you at least have to give your pilots that option?\" I asked.",
      "\"To go full autonomy and just let it go? I don't think America is comfortable with that yet,\" Spain replied. \"I'm not saying that couldn't be a future world that we live in where we trust it. But I don't think we're there right now, certainly, and certainly not to start. We have to build that trust over time.\"",
      "At Top Gun AI, pilots keep putting in the reps, test flight after test flight, simulation after simulation, to build that trust.",
      "Asked whether he would rather go into combat with a human wingman or an AI wingman, McMullen replied, \"When we're talking about the threats of tomorrow, if I can send an uncrewed asset into a high-risk environment, I'd rather do that than send a human pilot.\"",

      "An Indiana man convicted in the 2001 rape and murder of a teenage girl was executed by injection early Friday in the state's third execution since resuming capital punishment last year.",
      "Roy Lee Ward, 53, was put to death at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City. Indiana Department of Correction said in a statement that the process started shortly after midnight and Ward was pronounced dead at 12:33 a.m.",
      "Ward's last meal was from Texas Corral and included a hamburger. His last words, as reported by the Indiana Department of Correction were \"Brian is going to read them,\" but it was unclear exactly when he made the statement.",
      "He was convicted in the rape and murder of 15-year-old Stacy Payne. Authorities said Ward attacked the girl with a knife and dumbbell in her family's home near Dale, about 30 miles east of Evansville. The crime rocked the small community of roughly 1,500 people.",
      "Payne was stabbed repeatedly and died of her injuries several hours after the attack, French news agency AFP notes, adding that he was arrested at the scene while still holding a knife.",
      "Ward had exhausted his legal options after more than two decades. His attorney, Joanna Green, said days before the execution that Ward was \"very remorseful\" about the crime.",
      "Ward's execution came amid questions about Indiana's handling of the powerful sedative pentobarbital. Last year, state officials ended a 15-year pause on executions, saying they'd been able to obtain drugs used in lethal injections that had been unavailable for years.",
      "The Indiana Department of Correction said it had obtained \"enough pentobarbital to follow the required protocol\" for Ward's execution. Ward's attorneys had raised concerns about the use of the drug and how the state stored it, including temperature issues.",
      "Among 27 states with death penalty laws, Indiana is one of two that bar media witnesses to executions. Ward's witness list included attorneys and spiritual advisers.",
      "His case trailed through the courts for more than 20 years.",
      "Ward was convicted of the crimes in 2002 and sentenced to death. But after the Indiana Supreme Court overturned the conviction and ordered a new trial, he pleaded guilty in 2007. A decade later, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case. In 2019, he sued Indiana, seeking to stop all pending executions.",
      "Last month, the Indiana Supreme Court declined to stay the execution and Gov. Mike Braun rejected Ward's clemency bid.",
      "The victim's family members said they were ready for justice to be carried out, remembering Payne as an honor student and cheerleader with an influence beyond her short life.",
      "\"Now our family gatherings are no longer whole, holidays still empty. Birthdays are sad reminders of what we lost,\" her mother Julie Wininger told the parole board last month. \"Our family has endured emotional devastation.\"",
      "Ward skipped the parole board interview for his clemency bid, saying he didn't want to force the victim's family to travel to the prison and that he couldn't always say what he meant. Attorneys say Ward was recently diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, which affected his ability to communicate.",
      "One of his spiritual advisers, Deacon Brian Nosbusch, said ahead of the execution that Ward had thought deeply about his actions.",
      "\"He knows he did it,\" Nosbusch said. \"He knows it was horrendous.\""

    "summary": "Tropical Storm Jerry could become a hurricane by the weekend, forecasters say.",
    "story": [
      "Tropical Storm Jerry could become a hurricane by the weekend, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said early Thursday.",
      "Tropical storm conditions are possible later today into Friday on portions of the northern Leeward Islands as Jerry passes nearby, forecasters said.",
      "As of 11 p.m. ET Thursday, Jerry's core was some 100 miles east of the northern Leeward Islands, the Caribbean chain east of Puerto Rico that starts with the Virgin Islands and extends down to Guadeloupe.",
      "Jerry had maximum sustained winds of 60 mph as it moved northwest at 17 mph, forecasters said, adding that \"gradual strengthening is forecast during the next few days and Jerry could become a hurricane by late Friday or Saturday.\"",
      "Tropical storm warnings were in effect for Anguilla, Barbuda, Sint Maarten, St. Barthelemy and St. Martin. Tropical storm watches were in effect for Antigua, Montserrat, Nevis, Saba, St. Eustatius and St. Kitts, as well as Guadalupe and the adjacent islands.",
      "Maps show Jerry's path",
      "On the forecast track, Jerry's center is expected to pass near or northeast of the northern Leeward Islands later today and tonight, the hurricane center noted. It wasn't\u00a0posing any threat to southern Florida.",
      "\"Through Friday,\" the center said, \"two to four 4 inches of rain with local storm total maxima to six inches are expected across the Leeward and Virgin Islands. This rainfall brings a risk of flash flooding, especially in urban areas and in steep terrain.\"",
      "What's more, \"Swells generated by Jerry are beginning to reach the Leeward and Windward Islands. These swells will spread westward toward the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico tonight, then toward the rest of the Greater Antilles over the next couple of days. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.\"",
      "Hurricanes this season",
      "Jerry strengthened into a tropical storm Tuesday and is the 10th named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. It developed on the heels of several Atlantic storms, including Hurricane Humberto and Hurricane Imelda, which emerged at the end of September. Concerns that both could strike Bermuda briefly circulated, but only Imelda ultimately brushed the coast of the island as a Category 2 hurricane before quickly weakening on its way out to the open ocean.",
      "Humberto and Imelda also hit the southeastern United States with destructive surf, causing multiple coastal homes in North Carolina's Outer Banks to collapse.",
      "This has been a relatively quiet hurricane season, which typically runs annually from June 1 to Nov. 30 in the Atlantic. While Jerry is the 10th named storm this year, just one of the nine others \u2014 Chantal \u2014 actually made landfall in the U.S.",
      "When the current season began, an outlook released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration indicated that between 13 and 19 named storms would form in the Atlantic, with up to nine becoming hurricanes and as many as five strengthening into powerful Category 5 storms. But, as the months progressed, NOAA revised its outlook in August to predict that 13 to 18 named storms would form, including five to nine hurricanes."

    "story": [
      "Republican Winsome Earle-Sears and Democrat Abigail Spanberger faced off for the first and only time on the debate stage Thursday night in Virginia's high-stakes gubernatorial race.",
      "It was a fiery affair in which Earle-Sears, who is trailing in the race, went on the offensive from the very beginning, repeatedly interrupting Spanberger and asking her several direct questions.",
      "Spanberger, who largely avoided addressing her Republican opponent directly, sought to cast a bipartisan tone at times. Over the course of the hourlong affair, the candidates sparred over violent rhetoric, the federal shutdown and transgender children. The economy was largely an afterthought.",
      "Virginia is one of just two states choosing governors this November, and its election is often seen as a bellwether for the party in power across the Potomac River ahead of midterm elections next year.",
      "Washington politics are especially relevant this year in Virginia, as President Trump's cuts to the federal workforce and Congress' current government shutdown have an outsize impact in a state filled with federal employees and military personnel.",
      "Here are some takeaways from the debate at Norfolk State University:",
      "Perhaps even more than policy differences, the candidates' personal styles shaped the hourlong debate.",
      "Earle-Sears, with her only chance to confront Spanberger before Election Day, was far more aggressive. She repeatedly turned toward Spanberger and addressed her by her first name, interrupting almost every answer, despite being admonished by the moderators over and over.",
      "The approach put the Democrat on the defensive after months of running the race largely on her own terms as the perceived frontrunner.",
      "Spanberger, while she criticized her opponent at times, faced forward throughout, avoided eye contact, and only rarely addressed Earle-Sears directly. She did not speak during Earle-Sears' answers, even when her opponent asked direct questions, which happened often.",
      "Earle-Sears also told Spanberger she \"should have stayed in Congress\" and frequently questioned her truthfulness.",
      "\"Don't lie like that, Abigail!\" she shouted at one point.",
      "The interruptions lasted up until the very final moments of the debate when the moderators cut off the microphones.",
      "A scandal shaped the very beginning of the debate, although it was not a scandal directly involving either candidate onstage.",
      "Instead, it was the Democratic candidate for attorney general, Jay Jones. He has been heavily criticized in recent days following last week's publication of text messages from 2022 in which he suggested that Virginia's former Republican House speaker get \"two bullets in the head.\"",
      "While Spanberger had previously shared \"disgust\" about Jones's words, heading into Thursday night's debate she had not called for him to drop out of the race, while Mr. Trump and Earle-Sears publicly pressed Jones to do so. Over and over again Thursday night, Earle-Sears pushed Spanberger on whether she would do the same.",
      "Earle-Sears, in her first comment of the debate, took an unrelated question about the state's vehicle tax and questioned Spanberger over the Jones issue. When asked by a moderator about Jones, Spanberger quickly denounced the text messages, as she had soon after they became public last week. But she was evasive when asked whether she continued to endorse Jones. After being pressed about the topic, Spanberger tried to distance herself from Jones and said it was up to voters to make an individual decision.",
      "\"Abigail, what if he said it about your three children? Is that when you would say it's time to get out of the race?\" Earle-Sears asked. She later added of Spanberger, \"She has no courage.\"",
      "Spanberger had largely avoided the issue in the days leading up to the debate, aside from issuing a public statement condemning the texts. But facing repeated questions from the moderators and her opponent, she was forced to weigh in. The Democratic congresswoman declined to say whether Jones should leave the race, saying it's up to voters to make their own decision.",
      "\"Are you saying political murder is OK?\" Earle-Sears charged.",
      "\"Once again, I have denounced political violence, political rhetoric, no matter who is leading the charge,\" Spanberger responded, pointing to violent rhetoric from Mr. Trump that Earle-Sears declined to denounce and trying to sound a bipartisan tone.",
      "\"You routinely refer to me as your enemy. I'm not your enemy. You are not my enemy. We are political opponents,\" Spanberger said.",
      "In the race to succeed Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who under state law cannot run for another term this year, Spanberger has been viewed as having a sizable advantage. But statewide races in Virginia can become surprisingly close by election day, and Jones' words have been met with bipartisan backlash and helped galvanize Republican momentum.",
      "The clash comes as threats of political violence have escalated across the country following the shooting deaths of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and former Minnesota Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband.",
      "The showdown over the shutdown flared Thursday night.",
      "The federal shutdown, which has been underway for more than a week, is especially prevalent in Virginia, home to roughly 315,000 federal workers. Even before much of the federal government closed its doors last week, many Virginians were already affected by Mr.\u00a0Trump's spring push to slash federal jobs and his ongoing threats to impose more mass firings.",
      "Earle-Sears, a vocal Trump supporter, had perhaps the more difficult challenge during the debate. She argued that she is best positioned to strengthen the state's economy, even as she was reluctant to criticize the Republican president's job cuts in the state.",
      "She declined to criticize Mr. Trump or call on him to end the shutdown when asked directly by the moderators Thursday.",
      "Instead, she blamed Democrats for the mess and called on Spanberger to push Virginia Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, both Democrats, to vote in favor of a spending bill that would end the impasse with the Republican-controlled Congress.",
      "Spanberger complied.",
      "\"I would encourage everyone, our Democratic senators, our Democratic House members, our Republican House members, to work and come back to the table,\" she said.",
      "Many voters say they're most concerned about the direction of the economy, but some of the most pointed moments of the debate were focused on cultural issues.",
      "In particular, Earle-Sears pressed Spanberger on whether she would keep transgender youths out of high school sports and bathrooms.",
      "The Republican lieutenant governor has flooded the airwaves with ads focused on the cultural divide that helped Mr. Trump win the presidency last fall, casting Spanberger as unwilling to protect Virginia's children from sexual predators.",
      "\"My answer is that each local community decision should be made between parents and educators and teachers in each community,\" Spanberger said, pointing to her background in law enforcement and role as a mother.",
      "\"Nothing is more important to me than the safety of all children,\" she said.",
      "Spanberger declined to say whether she would rescind the measure signed by Youngkin that would require students to go only to the restrooms of their birth gender.",
      "That did not satisfy Earle-Sears, who pressed Spanberger on what she would say if her own children were forced to undress in a bathroom with biological males. The Republican also implied that transgender students are a safety threat when asked.",
      "\"We know that biological men are larger in strength than women,\" she said. \"This is biology.\"",
      "Two women stood on the debate stage as the Democratic and Republican nominees for the first time in state history, a reminder that Virginia is poised to elect its first female governor, no matter who wins on Nov. 4.",
      "Spanberger, 46, is a mother of three school-age children. She has represented a congressional district in northern Virginia since 2019. Her background is in law enforcement as a former CIA agent.",
      "In one of the few warm exchanges of the night, Earle-Sears pointed to her role as a mother when asked what qualities she likes about her opponent.",
      "\"I believe she is a devoted mom. I truly believe that,\" Earle-Sears said. \"And I do believe that she cares.\"",
      "Earle-Sears, a Marine veteran, may be better known statewide, having served as lieutenant governor for the last four years. A native of Jamaica, the 61-year-old mother of two, is the first Black woman elected to statewide office in Virginia.",
      "Spanberger complimented parts of her record.",
      "\"I admire her faith,\" Spanberger said, \"and her service to this country.\""

      "Dominion Voting Systems, one of the nation's largest election technology companies, has been acquired by St. Louis-based Liberty Vote. The acquisition caps a half-decade that saw Dominion thrust into the public eye amid false accusations of election rigging.",
      "Liberty Vote announced the purchase of Dominion Thursday afternoon. The terms of the deal were not immediately disclosed.",
      "Liberty Vote was founded by Scott Leiendecker, a former Republican elections director for St. Louis. He also founded KNOWiNK, which describes itself as the largest provider of electronic poll book technology in the United States, used in dozens of states. KNOWiNK says it was built \"exclusively in America\" and has a bipartisan team of former elections administrators, directors and poll workers, according to a company spokesperson.",
      "In a statement Thursday, Liberty Vote said it would be \"100% AMERICAN OWNED,\" and that \"as of today, Dominion is gone.\" Dominion was incorporated in Toronto but in 2009, it moved its headquarters to Denver.",
      "\"Liberty Vote signals a new chapter for American elections\u2014one where trust is rebuilt from the ground up,\" Leiendecker said. \"Liberty Vote is committed to delivering election technology that prioritizes paper-based transparency, security, and simplicity so that voters can be assured that every ballot is filled-in accurately and fairly counted.\"",
      "The acquisition marks a significant development in the U.S. election technology industry, bringing together two major players that would provide key infrastructure for voting and voter verification systems across dozens of states ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "Dominion provided voting systems in key battlegrounds such as Georgia \u2014 a state Biden narrowly won \u2014 which became the catalyst for unfounded narratives against Dominion that also led to harassment and threats against election officials in states where they utilized the company's voting tabulation systems. Dominion spent years fending off claims from President Trump and his allies, who alleged that the company's machines were manipulated to favor Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election.",
      "The fallout from those claims led to a series of high-profile defamation lawsuits. In 2023, Fox News agreed to pay nearly $800 million to settle Dominion's suit, while Newsmax settled for $67 million. The company alleged Fox broadcasted unsubstantiated allegations that Dominion's software manipulated vote counts. Dominion's lawsuit highlighted 20 such statements aired on a slew of shows on the network.",
      "Dominion also filed separate cases against Trump allies, including a $1.3 billion lawsuit against Rudy Giuliani, which ended in September with an undisclosed settlement. Giuliani was a leading figure in the effort to overturn Mr. Trump's defeat. The terms of the settlement were not made public."

    "summary": "The IRS on Thursday announced adjustments to the federal income tax brackets and standard deductions for 2026.",
    "story": [
      "The IRS is adjusting the income limits for its federal income tax brackets to account for the impact of inflation, an annual reset that could provide relief for some Americans when they file their taxes next year.",
      "The IRS makes these adjustments, typically in October or November, to avoid what it known as \"bracket creep,\" which is when inflation pushes people into higher tax brackets, potentially forcing them to dole out more money come April.",
      "The upshot: Americans will have to earn more income next year before reaching a higher tax bracket. For example, the upper tax limit on a single filer making $50,000 will be 12% in 2026 versus 22% in 2025.",
      "See the updated tax brackets below.",
      "The IRS did not respond to a request for comment on the inflation rate it applied in adjusting its tax brackets for 2026. Bloomberg Tax forecasted last month that the agency would apply an inflation rate of 2.7%.",
      "In 2024, the IRS adjusted\u00a0its tax bracket thresholds by 5.4%\u00a0to account for the lingering inflation that erupted during the pandemic. That followed a\u00a0historically large adjustment\u00a0of 7% in 2023. The IRS uses Consumer Price Index data for the past 12 months to reset the brackets.",
      "Standard Deduction",
      "In addition to setting the federal income tax brackets, the IRS also released changes to 2026 standard deductions on Thursday.",
      "Married couples filing jointly will have a standard deduction of $32,200Heads of households will have a standard deduction of $24,150Single taxpayers and married individuals will face a standard deduction of $16,100",
      "Married couples filing jointly will have a standard deduction of $32,200",
      "Heads of households will have a standard deduction of $24,150",
      "Single taxpayers and married individuals will face a standard deduction of $16,100",
      "Seniors could see additional relief due to a provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that provides a temporary tax deduction of up to $6,000 for people aged 65 and older. The tax break, which is set to expire at the end of 2028, is available to those with an adjusted gross income of $75,000 or less for single filers and $150,000 or less for couples filing jointly.",
      "The IRS \u00a0announced Wednesday that an agency-wide furlough would begin on Oct. 8 due to a lapse in federal appropriations as a result of the government shutdown. Taxpayers with an Oct. 15 extension deadline should plan on submitting their returns as planned, according to the IRS.",
      "\"Taxpayers should continue to file, deposit, and pay federal income taxes as they normally would; the lapse in appropriations does not change Federal Income Tax responsibilities,\" a spokesperson told CBS News in an email.",
      "Understanding your tax bracket",
      "There's a misconception that Americans pay the top tax rate on every dollar of their income, but that isn't the case. Taxation in the U.S. is progressive, meaning that tax rates increase the more you earn. In other words, the seven income tax rate brackets \u2014 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35% and 37% \u2014 represent the percentage you'll pay on portions of your income.",
      "For instance, a single taxpayer making $50,000 in taxable income in 2026, will pay 10% in federal taxes on the first $12,400 of their income (the top threshold for the 10% bracket) and then 12% on the remaining $37,600.",
      "To determine your marginal tax bracket, you must first figure out what your highest taxable income is.",
      "For instance, a married couple with $150,000 in gross income would first subtract the 2026 standard deduction of $32,200 from that amount, leaving them with $117,800 in taxable income. That would put their top marginal tax rate at 22%. However, their effective tax rate is much lower:",
      "Their first $24,800 of income will be taxed at 10%, or $2,480 in taxesTheir earnings from $24,800 to $100,800 would be taxed at 12%, or $9,120 in taxes\u00a0Their income from $100,800 to $117,800 would be taxed at 22%, or $3,740 in taxes",
      "Their first $24,800 of income will be taxed at 10%, or $2,480 in taxes",
      "Their earnings from $24,800 to $100,800 would be taxed at 12%, or $9,120 in taxes",
      "Their income from $100,800 to $117,800 would be taxed at 22%, or $3,740 in taxes",
      "Combined, they would pay $15,340 in federal income taxes, giving them an effective tax rate of 13%.",
      "How the OBBBA will impact taxes",
      "The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law by President Trump in July, made most of the tax cuts from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent, helping some American taxpayers avert a scheduled tax increase.",
      "As a result of the Republican spending bill, the typical filer could see an average tax cut of $3,752 in 2026, with benefits varying depending on the filer's geographic location, according to an\u00a0analysis\u00a0in August from the Tax Foundation.",
      "A taxpayer's income will also influence the tax cuts they see, with higher-income Americans more likely to see a bigger benefit from tax provisions in the legislation than lower-income households.",
      "A July\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the Tax Policy Center found that the typical household in the bottom quintile \u2014 those earning up to $34,600 per year \u2014 will save an average of about $150 in tax payments in 2026, or 0.8% of their income. By comparison, those in the top quintile \u2014 those who earn $217,101 or more \u2014 will save an average of $12,540 next year, or 2.5% of their income."

      "\"It just really makes us all very nervous,\" said Chamois Andersen, a senior leader at Defenders of Wildlife, a key non-profit partner on the federal agency's Black-Footed Ferret Recovery Plan. \"It's not something we can play around with, in terms of the timing and the funding. It's that endangered of a species.\"",
      "The government has been partially shut down for more than a week after a budget standoff in Congress over federal spending limits and extending expiring tax credits for health insurance.",
      "Andersen warns the next two months are critical for successfully introducing the captive ferrets. Fall provides the essential window for new ferrets to hone their hunting skills and begin mating before winter arrives. While many won't survive the cold, those that do will help stabilize the fragile, wild population.",
      "The Fish and Wildlife Service maintains a captive breeding program facility in Fort Collins, Colorado, where many of the ferrets await release. The facility is currently at full capacity, Andersen said.",

      "The results of the federal investigation were made public in 2023, four years after Epstein's death, in a report by the Department of Justice Office of Inspector General. It concluded that the financier, who entered a guilty plea in 2008 on state-level charges of procuring a child for prostitution, died by suicide. That matched the findings shared by Attorney General William Barr, who told Congress in August he had no doubts that Epstein had taken his own life. But lingering questions, raised by individuals including Epstein's lawyers and brother, have fueled continued speculation and suspicion.",
      "\"I do not believe he died by suicide, no,\" Epstein's co-defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell, said this summer during her interview in August with the Deputy U.S. Attorney General Todd Blanche.",
      "Epstein's brother, Mark, told \"60 Minutes\" in 2020 that, in his view, the evidence he has seen to date points more to murder than suicide. Five years later, he still questions the investigation.",
      "\"This was never properly investigated as a proper homicide, it was never investigated,\" Mark Epstein told CBS News recently.",
      "Nothing about the CBS News review into the investigation of Epstein's death suggests foul play. But the review found that the federal probe did not follow typical investigative procedures into a suspicious death.",
      "\"Evidence photography 101\"",
      "Epstein's body was discovered at 6:30 a.m. on Aug. 10, 2019 by corrections officer Michael Thomas when he arrived at his cell to deliver breakfast. Thomas said he found the accused felon in a near-seated position, suspended from the top of the bunk by a homemade noose, with his legs straight out and his buttocks approximately 1 inch to 1 and a half inches off the floor, according to the inspector general's report. Internal corrections department memos obtained exclusively by CBS News described him as \"cold,\" with \"no palpable pulses.\"",
      "The first FBI agents arrived at the cell more than seven hours later, at 1:35 p.m., according to the 2023 report. But when they arrived, photos show they found a disorganized, rifled-through clutter. Crucially, Epstein's lifeless body had already been removed from the cell, eliminating a critical source of information investigators would need to determine how and when he died, forensic pathologist Michael Baden said.",
      "\"The fact that he was moved diminishes the ability to determine how long he was dead before he was found,\" Baden said.",
      "Emergency medical technicians wrote in their report on the incident, which was obtained by CBS News, that the staff they interacted with could not say when Epstein was last seen alive or describe how he \"was found in [the] jail cell other than to say 'we found him on the ground.'\"",
      "Inside the cell, piles of linens had been strewn about, mattresses were squeezed into a corner on the floor near his bunk bed and Epstein's personal items were rearranged or moved, photos from the scene show. Experts who reviewed photos of the scene for CBS News said there were also inconsistencies between the investigators' official reports and what the images show.",
      "\"In those photographs, it was obvious that things were moved around,\" said former New York Police Department detective Herman Weisberg, who is now managing director of Sage Intelligence. \"It definitely appeared to me that the scene was, for lack of a better term, staged a bit.\"",
      "Epstein's medications, a special mask for treating sleep apnea, and at least one piece of fabric tied into a noose appeared in different places over the course of 90 minutes, when a photographer from the medical examiner's office was documenting the scene.",
      "Weisberg and other experts emphasized that, regardless of whether Epstein's death was a suicide, the cell should have been treated as a crime scene using standard investigatory practices.",
      "\"It almost appears to me that whoever was investigating this just took it at face value that it was a suicide with no foul play whatsoever, suspected,\" Weisberg said. \"But in a situation as high-profile as this, I would always, as an investigator, consider that there might be foul play.\"",
      "While some experts questioned federal investigators' treatment of the scene, forensic pathologist Judy Melinek, who used to work at the New York City Medical Examiner's office, said her former employer appears to have handled the case by the book.",
      "\"It's just people doing what they normally do for any other case,\" Melinek said. \"The majority of [cases] if you weren't such a high profile decedent, the scrutiny would not apply. This is how they treat every other jail death of somebody who is not high profile.\"",
      "The sequence of evidence photos starts with a picture of the stairs leading up to Epstein's cellblock, Tier L. Underlying data from the photo shows it was taken at 9:34 a.m. \u2014 three hours after Epstein's body was found, and four hours before federal investigators arrived.",
      "Time went by even as the nation's top law enforcement officer sought a rapid investigation.",
      "\"I was obviously covering it very quickly and wanted to rule out anything other than suicide,\" Barr told Congress in August, adding that \"within an hour, or minutes of finding out about it, I directed the [inspector general] to have people in New York go to the scene and conduct an investigation.\"",
      "On the back wall, a surveillance camera is visible. It was streaming, but was not recording. This was due to a hard-drive malfunction that had previously been identified but not fixed, according to a Justice Department report.",
      "Next is a blurry image of the door to Epstein's cell, number 220. Running underneath the door was a cable that provided power to a CPAP machine. Epstein had initially been assigned to a cell in a different tier, but he was moved to cell 220 for easier access to an outlet, according to Bureau of Prisons records.",
      "The jail's computer systems were never updated to note that move, according to investigators. A source close to the investigation told CBS News that corrections staff rarely updated internal inmate moves, instead preferring to call out their names while in the tiers.",
      "Two documents on the door are shown in images after Epstein's death. One was a printout with Epstein's personal details and a booking photo. Above that was the ID card for Epstein's former roommate, Efrain Reyes.",
      "Cells typically hold two inmates, and following a suspected suicide attempt two weeks earlier, Epstein was mandated by correction officials to have a cellmate. The day before Epstein's death, however, Reyes was transferred out of the detention center. Investigators eventually concluded that Reyes' move allowed Epstein the solitude needed to kill himself.",
      "From the first photo to the last, it is clear the scene in the cell was chaotic \u2014 so much so that investigators never conclusively determined which strip of bedsheet was around Epstein's neck when he died.",
      "Photos of the bed also raise questions. One shows an orange string hanging from a bar. This picture was included in a 2023 report by the Department of Justice's Inspector General, alongside a description of how Epstein was found, suggesting investigators believed that was what he had used to hang himself.",
      "If that was the case, and the room hadn't been disturbed before the photographer arrived, Epstein's rear would have come to rest on a mattress, instead of hovering over the floor \u2014 complicating investigators' explanation of how he hanged himself.",
      "Some of the evidence was not photographed in Epstein's cell, but instead appeared to be in an entirely different room \u2014 one with floor tiles distinct from the bare concrete of Epstein's cell. These pictures show a defibrillator and another strip of orange cloth tied into a noose-like shape. It is visibly different from the one shown hanging from Epstein's bed frame.",
      "There is no indication in official reports where this noose was found, or which of several knotted strips of bed linen may have been removed from around Epstein's neck. A rendering of this noose was included in Epstein's official autopsy. But the Justice Department later revealed in its 2023 report that \"the noose depicted is not the ligature Epstein used to kill himself.\"",
      "By the time FBI agents arrived, it was clear their work would be scrutinized by the top brass inside the Justice Department.",
      "\"After the suicide, I told the headquarters to make sure that they flooded the zone,\" Barr told Congress in an August deposition.",
      "There is no indication in any official report that an FBI crime scene investigators, officially known as an Evidence Response Team, ever ran fingerprints or DNA tests on anything found in the cell.",
      "Epstein's autopsy report indicates medical examiners collected fingernail clippings, and swabs from his neck and hands. Epstein's brother Mark told CBS News that he still hasn't received any information about the results of DNA tests, if they were carried out, and Barr said in his deposition that he couldn't remember if they had been done.",
      "A 2024 report by Department of Justice researchers warned that investigators risk missing an important \"opportunity\" to gather evidence \"if DNA is not collected at the scene as needed or at the time of examination.\" They advised that \"body swabs should be considered both at the scene and during autopsy.\"",
      "Weisberg said investigators left too many stones unturned, missing the opportunity to close the case in a way that would feel conclusive to the public.",
      "\"In the back of any good investigator's mind, he's preparing this to be scrutinized by counsel. In this case, you're preparing it to be scrutinized by a lot of desktop detectives \u2026 so you better have all of your facts straight,\" Weisberg said.",
      "The FBI \"inspected the cell and retrieved what [they] believed to be relevant to its investigation into the cause of Epstein's death, which included one torn sheet, miscellaneous papers, and an MP3 player,\" inspector general investigators wrote in the 2023 report.",
      "Forensic analyst Barreiro said he considered the agency's treatment of the scene to be striking.",
      "\"Some really shoddy work here, if you can even call it that,\" Barreiro said. \"I mean there's an absence of work here.\"",
      "One basic procedure, which Barreiro referred to as \"evidence photography 101,\" is photographing scenes in a progression that goes from a wide shot to close-ups, with markers identifying evidence.",
      "\"There's no evidence markers in any of these photographs. Like, how do you keep track once you get the stuff back to the crime lab? This is essentially useless,\" said Barreiro, a former police detective and an FBI-trained member of the Digital Imaging and Video Recovery Team.",
      "Richard Esposito, a former New York Police Department deputy commissioner said, \"it appears there may have been several procedural, operational, and investigative missteps at this crime scene.\"",
      "\"Ultimately, determining the true facts and circumstances in a death investigation-and transparently communicating those findings to the public-helps dispel misinformation and reduce the spread of conspiracy theories,\" said Esposito, who is a CBS News law enforcement contributor.",
      "Interviews",
      "Federal investigators questioned 54 people before issuing their final report, including three inmates who had been housed on Epstein's tier, as well as jail staff, administrators, contractors and his brother. However, several other witnesses or their representatives told CBS News they were not interviewed. That included many other inmates housed in Epstein's tier the night of his death, at least one staffer who arrived at Epstein's cell shortly after his body was found and nearly all of the visitors he saw in the days leading up to his death.",
      "Two witnesses who did provide eyewitness accounts, with their lawyers present, were in the cell directly across from Epstein's the night he died. One described seeing Thomas, the first corrections officer on scene, enter Epstein's cell and begin performing CPR, only to emerge holding a rope and a defibrillator. The other said he saw Thomas enter and shake Epstein. He said Thomas tried to pick Epstein up, but fell over. He then began giving chest compressions, the inmate said.",
      "The accounts, which appear in the official report, do not explain what is seen in photos of the jail tier \u2014 their cell windows covered by papers that could have obscured any view outside.",
      "It's not clear if the cell window was papered over in the time after Epstein's death but before the first photos were snapped. The Bureau of Prisons declined to comment.",
      "Attempts to reach Thomas were unsuccessful. A lawyer for his former coworker, Tova Noel, said she would not comment. The former officers agreed to be interviewed by investigators in 2021, as part of a deal that saw prosecutors drop charges of falsifying records related to mandatory checks on Epstein and other inmates, after falling asleep on the job.",
      "Other staffers with first-hand knowledge of the scene and other events were never contacted by federal investigators, according to interviews with CBS News.",
      "Investigators also decided not to interview some of Epstein's visitors, several sources told CBS News. The inmate spent the bulk of his daylight hours with a large, rotating cast of attorneys \u2014 including on the day before his death. The younger lawyers were there not only to provide counsel, but also \"to basically hold his hand\" and \"babysit,\" according to one source. They kept Epstein company, chatting with him about life, politics, literature and any other topic that came to his mind.",
      "\"You'd think if the investigation was a priority, they'd want to take a run at the younger people who were working for him,\" one source told CBS News. \"Nothing.\"",
      "One lawyer who visited Epstein nine days before his death was David Schoen. He said Epstein told him he was actively planning to fight the criminal charges levied against him.",
      "\"And this is why I've said, that in my view \u2014 I don't have anything to base it on other than anecdotal \u2014 I don't think he committed suicide, because he was very engaged in the idea of fighting the case,\" Schoen said. \"He hired me. And to kill himself nine days later wouldn't have made a lot of sense.\"",
      "While many who were close to Epstein have publicly questioned that he died by suicide, Barr has said it was \u2014 and remains \u2014 the most logical conclusion. The alternative would've been too complicated, Barr said in his August deposition.",
      "\"This would've required coordination from probably two dozen people, maybe, within the prison. And all these people were in different groups,\" Barr said. \"You know, the people who were repairing the cameras, the people who, you know, were responsible for opening and closing the door, the people who were responsible for putting in a new cellmate, things like that. \""

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump is going to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center Friday morning for what the White House says is his \"routine yearly checkup,\" just six months after undergoing what the White House at the time described as his \"annual physical examination\" at the same facility.",
      "When asked, the White House declined to explain why the president is undergoing a second yearly checkup. Mr. Trump, 79, may travel to the Middle East in the days after his medical visit, the White House said Wednesday, after he announced the first phase of a peace deal between Israel and Hamas.",
      "\"On Friday morning, President Trump will visit Walter Reed Medical Center for a planned meeting and remarks with the troops,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement late Wednesday. \"While there, President Trump will stop by for his routine yearly check up. He will then return to the White House. President Trump is considering going to the Middle East shortly thereafter.\"",
      "The president is able to receive basic medical care at the White House from the physician to the president, but presidents typically go to Walter Reed for more extensive examinations and procedures.",
      "The president's annual physical results as released by the White House in April showed no abnormalities, aside from minor sun damage \u2014 and scarring \"on the right ear from a gunshot wound\" \u2014 a result of the assassination attempt against him in July 2024. His April records also say that he had a colonoscopy in July 2024 and was recommended to undergo another in 2027.",
      "After the president was seen with swollen ankles at the FIFA Club World Cup and a bruised hand on multiple occasions, Leavitt in July told the press that according to the readout from the president's April exam, his health was normal. The latest full exam by the White House Medical Unit, however, revealed the president has chronic venous insufficiency.",
      "According to Johns Hopkins and the Cleveland Clinic, chronic venous insufficiency occurs when veins in the legs do not function normally, leading to poor blood flow back up to the heart. The president's physician, Capt. Sean Barbabella, said that an examination revealed no evidence of a more serious condition such as deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease, and the president remains in \"excellent\" overall health. The White House has said the president's bruised hand is a result of the extensive handshaking that's part of his job."

      "Anthony Boyd, 53, has been on death row in Alabama for the last three decades. He was convicted in 1995 of capital murder and kidnapping in the death of George Huguley, and a jury voted 10-2 to recommend that he receive the death penalty.",
      "Boyd spoke via phone Wednesday at a rally in Alabama that was organized by the nonprofit Execution Intervention Project, which advocates for people on death row.",
      "\"This is not just about me,\" Boyd said on speaker phone from the Alabama prison where he is being held. \"This is about the injustice that's going on in this state. I'm a prime example of these crooked courts and the way they fight.\"",
      "The rally took place in Talladega, where Boyd's family and other supporters unveiled a billboard along a highway that read: \"Save Anthony Boyd.\"",
      "\"We're here because we want the people of Alabama to know that the death penalty is more complicated than just this game of calling people monsters, this game of just tossing people away and acting like people don't matter,\" said Rev. Jeff Hood, a spiritual adviser and the nonprofit's co-founder, who became a vocal activist against capital punishment after witnessing numerous executions.",

The lethal injection alternative is designed to cause asphyxiation as inmates are forced to inhale pure nitrogen, instead of breathable air, through a gas mask. Critics believe the procedure constitutes undue suffering, but the state has repeatedly insisted it's humane. Alabama\u00a0tested the method for the first time\u00a0on a condemned inmate last January.",
      "Another man convicted in Huguley's murder was also condemned for the crime and is currently on death row.",

    "story": [
      "Although a short U.S. government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",
      "$1 billion hit",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",
      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Transportation Department responded to requests for comment about the impact of a potential government shutdown on travel in the U.S.",
      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers. Although Amtrak receives some federal funding and could eventually be impacted if a shutdown dragged on, the rail service is financially healthy enough to pay workers in the near term and keep trains in operation, the group\u00a0said in a statement last week.",

Lesley sued last spring over her termination and reached the settlement with county officials Wednesday. She had been the director since 2012 and with the library 27 years, Wyoming Public Radio reported.",
      "\"I do feel vindicated. It's been a rough road, but I will never regret standing up for the First Amendment,\" Lesley said.",
      "A major coal-mining area on the Western high plains, Campbell County is among the most conservative areas in one of the most conservative states.",

      "The county denied Lesley's claims. Only Lesley's performance \u2014 not the dispute over the books \u2014 played a role in her dismissal, the county argued in court documents.",

      "\"We hope at least that it sends a message to other library districts, other states, other counties, that the First Amendment is alive and strong and that our values against discrimination also remain alive and strong,\" said Lesley's attorney, Iris Halpern. \"These are public entities, they're government officials, they need to keep in mind their constitutional obligations.\"",
      "Halpern and her firm, Rathod Mohamedbhai in Denver, have supported fired library employees elsewhere in recent years. Under the settlement agreement, Lesley is dropping her lawsuit, though a separate lawsuit she has filed against three individuals who contested the books will continue.",

    "summary": "Trump made substantial inroads in heavily Latino areas in New Jersey in 2024, but many have since soured on him and the GOP, a CBS News analysis finds.",
    "story": [
      "With just weeks to go, the New Jersey governor's race is tightening and garnering national attention as an early test of voter sentiment about President Trump's second term and the ability of Democrats to counter Republicans ahead of next year's midterm elections.",
      "New Jersey's Latino electorate is emerging as a potentially decisive voting bloc in the battle between Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli, who is backed by Mr. Trump.",
      "Most independent polls show Sherrill leading with likely voters ahead of the election on Nov. 4, though generally just by single digits.",
      "Democrats are worried \u2014 national party sources tell CBS News that Sherrill \"needs help,\" and allies have begun to rally more support for her in the closing weeks of the campaign.",
      "\"We're jumping right into this New Jersey race, despite a lot of folks thinking it's a blue state and we may not need to act,\" says Janet Murguia, president of UnidosUS Action Fund.",
      "The political arm of the nation's largest Latino advocacy organization, UnidosUS, is expected to announce it's endorsing Sherrill on Wednesday, betting that Latinos could help decide this race.",
      "\"She's strong on housing, healthcare, and education which our community and Latino voters care a lot about, and she doesn't see Latinos as an afterthought,\" said Murguia, adding that 2025 has underscored the importance of a governor's role in fending off the Trump administration, citing California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker as examples.",
      "Sherrill, some Democrats admit, has struggled with her message, which often echoes the playbook former Vice President Kamala Harris employed in her failed 2024 White House campaign. Several Democrats tell CBS News that Sherrill's campaign has yet to articulate a compelling economic message and has failed to sharpen the focus on \"kitchen table\" issues like inflation and cost of living.",
      "In the presidential election, Harris carried New Jersey with 52% of the vote, but Mr. Trump made significant inroads, especially among Latino communities.",
      "New Jersey's 9th Congressional District provides a stark illustration of the trend. Voters elected Democrat Nellie Pou to the U.S. House last year, but in an election-night surprise, Mr. Trump carried the district at the presidential level. For reference, former President Joe Biden carried it by 19 points in 2020. This is a heavily Latino district and one of just 13 districts across the country that backed Mr. Trump while electing a Democrat to the House.",
      "Mr. Trump made substantial inroads in other heavily Latino areas, too. For example, the working-class city of Paterson has a population that is over 60% Latino. Mr. Trump's share of the vote there nearly doubled between 2020 and 2024, cutting the Democratic margin in half. And Passaic, a city with a 70% Latino population, actually flipped to Mr. Trump in 2024. In both of these cities, his vote margin increased by over 30 points. He also flipped the county and became the first Republican to win the presidential vote in Passaic in over 30 years.",
      "While these shifts were partly due to Biden voters switching to Mr. Trump in 2024, they also occurred as a result of changes in turnout. New Jersey saw a decline in turnout rates from 2020 to 2024, and the drops were more pronounced among Latino voters and registered Democrats. Many Biden 2020 voters simply stayed home, helping explain why Harris' vote totals were much lower than Biden's in these communities, while Mr. Trump's actually rose slightly.",
      "The gaps in turnout between White voters and voters of color often increase in off-year elections, so a big question in 2025 is what turnout will look like in the state's ethnically diverse communities, like those in Passaic. That will shape the final vote margin between Sherill and Ciattarelli.",
      "While Republicans made inroads with Latinos in New Jersey and across the country last year, many have soured on Mr. Trump and the GOP.",
      "CBS News polling throughout the 2024 campaign pointed to dissatisfaction with the economy and rising prices as key drivers of voting decisions. Today, CBS News polling indicates that many voters are still unhappy with the direction of the country and the economy specifically.",
      "According to the latest CBS News national survey, most Latinos rank either the economy / jobs (26%) or inflation (25%) as the most important issue facing the country. Two-thirds of Latinos rate the national economy negatively. And Mr. Trump's job approval rating has slid to 38% among Latinos, from a high of 49% at the start of his term.",
      "In particular, Mr. Trump's approval rating on handling inflation has fallen to a 32% among Latinos, and majorities say his policies are costing the U.S. jobs and making them worse off financially.",
      "Nationwide, most Latinos now say whether or not they support him, they believe that Mr. Trump is not following through on the promises he made during his campaign.",
      "These numbers suggest this may be why the Sherrill campaign is trying to link Ciattarelli and Mr. Trump as much as possible, as well as emphasizing the cost of living in the state. It remains to be seen whether Democrats will be able to reverse recent trends by winning back some Biden-to-Trump Latinos and by giving their infrequent voters a reason to turn out this fall."

    "title": "ICE targets NYC immigration courts more than others, analysis suggests",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ice-agents-new-york-city-immigration-courts-analysis/",
    "published": "Wed, 08 Oct 2025 12:49:00 -0400",
    "summary": "ICE has made nearly 2,400 arrests that likely took place in immigration courthouses around the country, and analysis of federal data finds.",
    "story": [
      "Tensions at Manhattan's immigration courts are reaching a boiling point.",
      "Last week, Immigration and Customs Enforcement reinstated the officer who was initially relieved of duties after shoving an Ecuadorian woman to the ground as he arrested her husband. The next day, ICE agents shoved journalists, sending one to the hospital.",
      "\"Every single week I would ask myself, is this when everything is going to fall apart and explode, and I'm still waiting for it, but we're getting closer,\" said Allison Cutler, an immigration attorney from New York Legal Assistance Group who is in court at 26 Federal Plaza almost every day.",
      "New York City has seen 460 ICE arrests this year through July that likely took place in immigration court, more than in any other city, a new analysis of federal data found. The estimates, by mathematician Joseph Gunther, are the first attempt to quantify arrests in immigration courts at a national level.",
      "Gunther identified nearly 2,400 ICE arrests likely made in immigration courts across the country, a total he said may still be an undercount. The analysis fills a gap left by the lack of DHS reporting on how many arrests ICE has made in or around courts.",
      "Those arrested very rarely had criminal records, the analysis found. Over 90% had only civil immigration charges, such as crossing the border illegally.",
      "ICE did not respond to a CBS News request for comment about the analysis, but Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a May news release that \"arrests of criminal illegal aliens in courthouses is common sense.\"",
      "\"It conserves valuable law enforcement resources because they already know where a target will be,\" she said. \"These illegal aliens have gone through security and been screened to not have any weapons.\"",
      "To quantify courthouse arrests, Gunther cross-referenced data on ICE arrests from the Deportation Data Project with data on immigration court hearings from the Executive Office for Immigration Review. ICE data does not have precise location information on arrests. But by comparing dates, places and demographic information between the two datasets, Gunther compiled a list of arrests that likely took place on the same day as a court hearing. The methodology was reviewed by two immigration experts.",
      "\"These are the first general estimates of something that shouldn't be secret in the first place,\" Gunther said. \"It shouldn't be necessary at all to do this drawn-out data analysis to know such basic facts.\"",
      "ICE began making arrests at immigration courts in late May, when DHS rescinded Biden-era guidance limiting them.",
      "DHS attorneys then began moving to dismiss cases and initiate expedited removal proceedings. Once immigrants face expedited removal, they are detained and are not entitled to any more hearings before a judge.",
      "Previously, expedited removal had been mostly limited to migrants encountered near the border. In January, the Trump administration expanded that to apply to undocumented immigrants anywhere in the U.S. who entered less than two years ago.",
      "On Aug. 30, a federal judge paused this expansion, blocking ICE's strategy of fast-tracking deportations of those with dismissed cases.",
      "ICE is also arresting immigrants in court with ongoing cases, immigration attorneys and court watchers said.",
      "\"A lot of immigration judges say, I'm going to give you another court date, but I don't know what will happen when you leave this court room,\" said Dee Ann Croucher, a volunteer who observes hearings in El Paso multiple times a week. \"I saw a lady just break down sobbing when they said that to her.\"",
      "The woman was detained in the hallway after the hearing, Croucher said.",
      "Immigrants arrested in court are often transferred far from home and family, limiting access to legal representation and sometimes placing them in a more conservative court system, immigration attorneys said.",
      "A CBS News analysis of the arrests Gunther identified found that nearly all were transferred to another facility, often hundreds of miles away. Those arrested in New York were moved an average of more than 1,000 miles away, often to Texas or Louisiana.",
      "Some have been released from detention after federal judges ruled their detainment was unlawful, but not everyone has the legal resources to file a petition, said Hasan Shafiqullah, immigration supervising attorney at the Legal Aid Society.",
      "\"Many people are languishing in detention,\" he said. \"Because detention is so terrible, people are often giving up and just saying, \"You know what? Just give me a deportation order.\"",
      "In Miami, some are choosing to self-deport after ICE arrested them in court, said Miami immigration attorney Antonio Ramos, whose office is in the same building as the court.",
      "Miami's immigration court sees the second-most hearings for non-detained immigrants, following New York. There have been about a third of estimated in-court arrests in Miami than in New York this year, according to the analysis.",
      "New York City's immigration courts see more non-detained hearings than any other city. Cutler, the New York immigration attorney, said that ICE agents have told her they are specifically targeting New York City because of its sanctuary policies.",
      "\"I've had officials tell me this to my face that they are punishing New York,\" she said. \"They would say, when New York stops being a sanctuary city, that is when we will leave.\"",
      "DHS has been clear that New York and other cities with sanctuary policies will be the target of increased enforcement, but did not respond to inquiries from CBS News about how they choose which courts to deploy ICE officers to.",
      "Following New York, Gunther's analysis found there were 190 ICE arrests in El Paso that likely took place in immigration court. Immigration courts in the Los Angeles area \u2014 within the city itself and in Van Nuys and Santa Ana \u2014 also had a high number of estimated arrests when combined, at 282.",
      "Immigration advocates who observed the arrests in El Paso's court described a less hostile atmosphere and no instances of excessive force. In one case, volunteers were able to negotiate with ICE agents to allow a noncitizen with a medical disorder to be electronically monitored instead of being detained, said Emily Miller, program manager at the Border Immigration Law and Justice Center in El Paso.",
      "\"We have developed a cordial relationship with ICE,\" said Miller, who helps coordinate a group of volunteer court watchers. \"Whether we agree with what [ICE is] doing or not, there is no yelling and filming taking place anymore. At the beginning, there was yelling and filming, we saw ICE be more forceful, that has stopped.\"",
      "Twenty-one of the arrests in El Paso were of children who were arrested with their family members, the analysis estimated. It identifies a total of 76 children arrested, almost all in Texas or the Los Angeles area, and none in New York.",
      "The Biden-era memo had prohibited courthouse arrests because it would \"disincentivize noncitizens from appearing for their hearings.\" When a noncitizen does not appear for their hearing, an immigration judge may order them removed \"in absentia.\"",
      "Immigrants face \"an impossible catch 22,\" said Amy Belsher, supervising attorney at the New York Civil Liberties Union: show up to court and risk arrest, or stay home and receive a deportation order.",
      "The rate of \"in absentia\" removal orders have ticked upward from 46% of non-detained case completions in May, when the arrests first started, to 52% in August.",
      "\"It's going to do lasting and irreparable harm to noncitizens' trust in government systems,\" Belsher said."

    "summary": "Bill Nye the Science Guy on Monday protested against a federal budget proposal that would see NASA's funding reduced from $24 billion to $18.8 billion.",
    "story": [
      "Bill Nye and hundreds of others gathered at Capitol Hill on Monday to protest against the Trump administration's proposed budget cuts to NASA, arguing that Congress has an obligation to promote the progress of science.",
      "\"The United States would cede leadership to other countries, especially [the] China National Space Administration,\" if funding to NASA Science is cut, Nye said. In an interview on \"The Takeout\" following the protest, Nye argued NASA's budget is just \"a sliver of the pie\" of the nearly $1.7 trillion federal budget.",
      "\"It's barely the width of the pie cutter, it's less than 0.1% of the federal budget and the return is extraordinary,\" he told CBS News' Major Garrett.",
      "A White House budget proposal\u00a0issued\u00a0earlier this year would see NASA's funding cut by about 25% for fiscal year 2026, from about $24 billion to $18.8 billion.",
      "Nye, the CEO of Planetary Society and former host of \"Bill Nye the Science Guy,\" and around 300 space advocates said Monday\u00a0that dozens of missions would be at risk \u2014 including NASA's Perseverance Mars rover and the Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the moon for the first time in half a century \u2014 if the cuts are approved by Congress.",
      "Despite the proposed cuts, NASA's acting administrator, Sean Duffy, said last month as he introduced a new class of 10 NASA astronaut candidates that there's a possibility one of them could be among the first Americans to put their boots on Mars. However, flights are not yet on the drawing board, and most experts say no such NASA mission is likely to launch within the next decade, and probably longer.",
      "Duffy also said he was confident the U.S. would beat China and win the second space race back to the moon.",
      "Referring to the recent news of Mars rover Perseverance uncovering\u00a0rocks that may hold potential signs of ancient microscopic life, Nye said a NASA budget cut would put the U.S. behind as China plans to launch its sample-return mission in 2028, possibly bringing back samples in 2033.",
      "\"Everybody, understand that if we were to find evidence of life on another world, it would change the course of human history,\" he added. \"So you say, 'Well, how much does that cost?' We're not sure. We've never done it.\"",
      "The 69-year-old science advocate said investing in NASA is \"priceless,\" telling Garrett: \"NASA also, objectively, every dollar that goes into NASA Science comes back at least a factor of three times, so if you put $1 into NASA Science, you're going to get $3 back into the economy.\"",
      "\"Global positioning, situational awareness ... digital cameras, mobile phones \u2014 everything is a result of exploring the cosmos,\" Nye added."

    "story": [
      "Lima, Peru \u2014 \u00a0Peru's Congress voted unanimously early Friday to remove deeply unpopular President Dina Boluarte from office as a crime wave grips the South American nation.",
      "Lawmakers had set up a debate and impeachment trial late Thursday in the 130-member unicameral Congress after voting to accept four requests for a vote to remove the 63-year-old Boluarte from office over what they said was her government's inability to stem crime.",
      "They requested that Boluarte come before them shortly before midnight to defend herself, but when she did not appear they immediately voted to oust her. In short order, 124 lawmakers voted just past midnight to impeach Boluarte. There were no votes against the effort.",
      "The shocking turn of events came just hours after a shooting at a concert in the capital inflamed anger over crime roiling the country.",
      "Unlike eight previous attempts to remove her, almost all legislative factions expressed support for the latest requests.",
      "Boluarte took office in December 2022 after Parliament used the same mechanism to impeach her predecessor.",
      "The president of the Congress, Jos\u00e9 Jer\u00ed, a 38-year-old lawyer, was sworn in early Friday as the interim president to serve out Boluarte's term. Elections are scheduled for next April and Boluarte's term was to end July 28, 2026.",
      "After Friday's vote, Boluarte spoke on national television, recounting her administration's achievements. \"I have not thought of myself, but rather of Peruvians,\" she said.",
      "Minutes into her speech, the broadcast was interrupted to show Jer\u00ed's swearing in.",
      "Jer\u00ed said he would defend Peru's sovereignty and hand over power to the winner of the April election.",
      "Peru's first female president was its sixth leader in just under a decade. A normal presidential term is five years.",
      "Boluarte assumed power in Peru in 2022 to complete the term of then-President Pedro Castillo, who was removed from office just two years into his five-year term after attempting to dissolve the legislature to avoid his own removal. She had served as Castillo's vice president before becoming president.",
      "There were more than 500 protests demanding her resignation in the first three months of her presidency.",
      "Plagued by scandals, her administration's inability to address Peru's incessant crime proved to be her undoing.",
      "Boluarte had approval ratings between 2% and 4% amid accusations she'd illicitly profited from her office and was behind lethal crackdowns on protests in favor of her predecessor, the Reuters news agency reports. She denies any wrongdoing.",
      "She's been the subject of multiple investigations, French news agency AFP points out, including one of her alleged failure to declare gifts of luxury jewels and watches, a scandal dubbed \"Rolexgate.\" She also gave herself a large pay increase in July.",
      "On Wednesday, she partially blamed the crime situation on immigrants living in the country illegally.",
      "\"This crime has been brewing for decades and has been strengthened by illegal immigration, which past administrations haven't defeated,\" she said during a military ceremony. \"Instead, they've opened the doors of our borders and allowed criminals to enter everywhere ... without any restrictions.\"",
      "Official figures show that 6,041 people were killed between January and mid-August, the highest number during the same period since 2017. Meanwhile, extortion complaints totaled 15,989 between January and July, a 28% increase compared to the same period in 2024.",
      "The country's latest presidential crisis erupted after a man opened fire and wounded five people Wednesday during a concert by Peru's most popular cumbia groups, Agua Marina.",
      "Prime Minister Eduardo Arana on Thursday defended Boluarte during a crime-focused hearing before Parliament, but it wasn't enough to dissuade lawmakers from pursuing the motions to get the president out of office.",
      "\"Parliament's concerns are not resolved by addressing a request for impeachment, much less by approving it,\" Arana told lawmakers. \"We are not clinging to our positions. We are here, and we knew from the beginning that our first day here could also be our last day in office.\""

      "Other witnesses said they saw students and workers poured out of schools, office buildings and shopping malls.",
      "Children evacuated schools in Davao city, which has about 5.4 million people and is the biggest city near the epicenter, about 155 miles west of Davao Oriental province.",
      "The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Honolulu said small waves were detected on the coasts of the Philippines and Indonesia before the threat passed about two hours after the quake. It said small sea fluctuations may continue.",
      "Alejandro warned that tsunami waves could hit six nearby coastal provinces from Davao Oriental up to two hours after the temblor struck at 9:43 a.m. \"We urge these coastal communities to be on alert and immediately evacuate to higher grounds until further notice,\" Alejandro said in a video news briefing.",

      "President Trump hopes to join the exclusive list of presidents and vice presidents who have received one of the world's most prestigious honors: the Nobel Peace Prize, which will be announced Friday.",
      "The international award honors people or organizations whose work makes the world a more peaceful place. Nominees aren't made public by the Nobel Committee, but some individuals publicly share who they nominate. World leaders, humanitarians and international organizations have received the peace prize since it was first given out in the early 20th century.",
      "Here's what to know about the Nobel Peace Prize and if Mr. Trump could receive it:",
      "When is the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize awarded?",
      "The 2025 winner of the Nobel Peace Prize will be announced on Friday, Oct. 10 at 5 a.m. ET. It will be awarded on Dec. 10 at a formal ceremony in Oslo, Norway.",
      "What is the Nobel Peace Prize?",
      "The Nobel Prize was established by a Swedish businessman named Alfred Nobel. In his will, he said that his fortune was to be used to establish a fund that could distribute prizes \"to those who ... shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind,\" according to the Nobel Peace Prize's website.",
      "Nobel's will specified that it be given \"to the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between the nations and the abolition or reduction of standing armies and the formation and spreading of peace congresses,\" but many different kinds of work have been honored, including efforts to combat climate change and promote democracy.",
      "The award has been given to politicians who sought international peace, people who have worked for arms control and nuclear disarmament, and international human rights agencies. Other Nobel prizes are awarded for achievements in medicine, literature and other fields.",
      "Winners receive a medal, diploma and monetary prize, according to the award's website. The 6.6-centimeter gold medal shows a portrait of Nobel, with his name, birth year and year of death engraved on the edge. The back of the medal shows three men embracing, to symbolize international fraternity, and is engraved with the phrase \"For peace and fraternity among peoples\" in Latin.",
      "How is the Nobel Peace Prize awarded?",
      "According to the prize's website, the Nobel Peace Prize should be awarded to the person who has done the most to advance peace in the world. It is awarded by a committee selected by Norway's parliament. The other Nobel prizes are awarded in Sweden.",
      "Any person or organization can be nominated by any eligible nominators, according to the prize's website. Eligible nominators include members of national assemblies, members of governments, members of bodies like the International Court of Justice, college professors or directors and former prizewinners or members of the Nobel Committee. The nomination deadline is Jan. 31. Over 330 candidates were submitted for the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize.",
      "The nominations aren't vetted before the nomination deadline, according to the prize's website, so nominations are not endorsements from the committee. The committee does not publicly comment on nominees. The names of nominees and nominating committee can't be announced for 50 years.",
      "Once the deadline passes, the Nobel Committee looks at the nominees and creates a shortlist of \"the most interesting and worthy candidates.\" Those shortlisted nominees then undergo \"assessments and examinations\" from committee members, according to the prize's website.",
      "The committee then decides on the winner or winners of the Nobel Peace Prize at its last meeting before the prize winners are announced in early October. The decision is made by majority vote, according to the prize website, but the committee attempts to make a unanimous decision on the winner.",
      "Who has won the Nobel Peace Prize?",
      "The Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded 105 times since 1901, according to the prize's website. One hundred and thirty-nine laureates have been awarded, including 92 men, 19 women and 28 organizations.",
      "The prize's first recipients were French scientist and politician Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Passy and Jean Henry Durant, a Swiss businessman and co-founder of the Red Cross. Passy was honored for his \"lifelong work for international peace conferences, diplomacy and arbitration,\" while Durant received the award for his \"humanitarian efforts to help wounded soldiers and create international understanding,\" according to the prize's website.",
      "Other notable prizewinners have included Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai in 2014 and former President Barack Obama in 2009. Obama's win, for \"extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples,\" was considered a surprise, as he had been in office for less than a year.",
      "Former President Jimmy Carter received the honor in 2002. Holocaust survivor and author Elie Wiesel was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986, and Bishop\u00a0Desmond Tutu, who worked to end apartheid in South Africa, received it in 1984.",
      "Organizations that have received the Nobel Peace Prize include the United Nations' World Food Program and the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons.",
      "Could Donald Trump get the Nobel Peace Prize?",
      "Mr. Trump has touted himself as the \"president of peace\" and has said he\u00a0ended six or seven wars during his second term, including conflicts between Israel and Iran, India and Pakistan and Thailand and Cambodia. Not all of the conflicts have been fully settled, and it's not clear if the United States' actions or influence were decisive in all of them, foreign policy experts previously told CBS News. Mr. Trump also proposed a peace deal for Israel and Hamas that was agreed to on Wednesday, and he has\u00a0spoken with world leaders about ending Russia's war in Ukraine.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters in\u00a0June that the Nobel Committee \"should give\" him the Nobel Peace Prize, and that he \"should have gotten it four or five times.\" In September, Mr. Trump told United Nations delegates that \"everyone says\" he should get the award. He made similar comments when military generals gathered in Virginia last week.",
      "In private, Mr. Trump has told some associates that his presidency might be remembered for his pursuit of peace more than anything else, a source close to him told CBS News' Robert Costa. The president would like to be considered for the honor, but expectations inside the White House are low that he would get a \"fair hearing\" by the Nobel Committee, another source said.",
      "Mr. Trump was nominated for the prize by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in July and by the government of Pakistan in June. This week, the Israeli Hostages Families Forum called on the Nobel Prize committee to give the peace prize to Mr. Trump for his \"unwavering commitment and extraordinary leadership\" in seeking a deal to bring home the remaining hostages taken by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023. Netanyahu repeated his call\u00a0for Mr. Trump to receive the peace prize Thursday after Israel and Hamas agreed to the \"first phase\" of a deal he helped broker to end the war in Gaza.",
      "But these efforts have come past the deadline for the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize, and it wasn't immediately clear if Mr. Trump was nominated for the 2025 prize. He was also\u00a0nominated for the prize\u00a0during his first term.",
      "Experts told The Associated Press the Nobel Committee is unlikely to award Mr. Trump the prize for his second-term achievements so far. However, Obama was awarded the prize without having secured any peace agreements in his first year in the White House.",
      "The committee tends to focus on \"the durability of peace, the promotion of international fraternity and the quiet work of institutions that strengthen those goals,\" the AP reported. The committee also likely does not want to be seen as caving to political pressure, one expert told the AP."

    "story": [
      "The president of Colombia alleged Wednesday that a boat struck by the U.S. military in the Caribbean Sea last week carried Colombian citizens, a claim a White House official called \"baseless and reprehensible.\"",
      "The U.S. military has hit at least four alleged drug boats since last month, with the most recent known strike on Oct. 3 killing four \"narco-terrorists\" in a vessel off the coast of Venezuela, according to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The Trump administration argues the attacks are necessary to halt drug trafficking, but critics say the administration lacks legal approval to carry out the strikes.",
      "On Wednesday, Colombian President Gustavo Petro wrote on X: \"Indications show that the last bombed boat was Colombian with Colombian citizens inside it.\"",
      "Petro did not specify the source of his information or why he believes the people on\u00a0the boat were Colombian citizens, though he said he hopes their families come forward. The U.S. military has not publicly identified the boat's passengers.",
      "The White House quickly denounced Petro's statement. A White House official told CBS News the U.S. \"looks forward to President Petro publicly retracting his baseless and reprehensible statement so that we can return to a productive dialogue on building a strong, prosperous future for the people of [the] United States and Colombia.\"",
      "The White House official also described Colombia as an important U.S. partner despite \"policy differences with the current government.\"",
      "The first leftist elected president of Colombia in decades, Petro has periodically clashed with the Trump administration. He denounced the strikes on alleged drug boats in a speech before the United Nations last month, and days later, he encouraged members of the U.S. military to \"disobey\" Mr. Trump's orders during a New York protest \u2014 leading the State Department to announce it would revoke his visa. Meanwhile, the U.S. has accused his government of not cooperating on anti-drug trafficking efforts.",
      "Petro's most recent allegation adds to mounting scrutiny of the Trump administration's campaign of strikes against alleged drug-carrying vessels in the Caribbean.",
      "President Trump has cast the strikes as part of a broader gambit to combat drug smuggling and stem the flow of deadly narcotics into the U.S. His administration has designated several cartels and Latin American gangs as terrorist organizations, and since August, several U.S. Navy vessels have been stationed in the Caribbean as part of an anti-cartel mission \u2014 drawing stiff backlash from the Venezuelan government.",
      "\"Every one of those boats is responsible for the death of 25,000 American people and the destruction of families,\" Mr. Trump said in a speech in Virginia marking the Navy's 250th anniversary over the weekend. \"So when you think of it that way, what we're doing is actually an act of kindness.\"",
      "In a notice to Congress obtained by CBS News, the Trump administration described the passengers on one alleged drug boat as \"unlawful combatants\" \u2014 the term that President George W. Bush's administration used to describe members of al Qaeda \u2014 and argued that the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with the cartels.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters Wednesday the attacks are \"targeted strikes against imminent threats against the United States,\" and the president does not need permission from Congress to carry them out.",
      "But critics \u2014 including some members of Congress \u2014 have argued Mr. Trump is acting without legal authority, and have pushed the administration to provide evidence that the boats were carrying drugs or that the passengers were guilty of anything. Congress has not authorized the use of military force against drug cartels.",
      "On Wednesday, Senate Democrats forced a vote on a resolution that sought to block further strikes. The measure failed 48-51, but it picked up support from Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a longstanding skeptic of military force.",
      "\"If anyone gave a you-know-what about justice, perhaps those in charge of deciding whom to kill might let us know their names, present proof of their guilt, show evidence of their crimes,\" Paul said. \"Is it too much to ask to know the names of those we kill before we kill them? To know what evidence exists of their guilt? At the very least, the government should explain how the gang came to be labeled as terrorists.\""

      "In a notification to Congress after the second strike in mid-September, the Trump administration said the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels it has designated as terrorist organizations. The drugs smuggled by these cartels kill tens of thousands of Americans each year and constitute an \"armed attack\" against U.S. citizens, according to the White House.",

      "Under the War Powers Resolution of 1973, the president is required to consult Congress before introducing armed forces into hostilities, unless there has been a declaration of war or other congressional authorization. If Congress does not authorize military force, the president has to withdraw forces within 90 days. The law was enacted in response to the Vietnam War as a check on the president's power to wage war without the consent of Congress.",
      "Paul has been the loudest GOP critic of the strikes on the alleged drug smuggling boats. After the first strike, Paul condemned Vice President JD Vance, who said \"killing cartel members who poison our fellow citizens is the highest and best use of our military.\"",

      "Paul added, \"the blow-them-to-smithereens crowd also conveniently ignores the fact that death is generally not the penalty for drug smuggling.\"",
      "During debate on the resolution, other Republicans were untroubled about the president taking unilateral action against the alleged drug traffickers and that the administration has left Congress in the dark on details of the strikes.",
      "\"These strikes were fully compliant and fully justified,\" Republican Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho said.",
      "There were similar efforts by Congress over the summer to reassert its authority to declare war as tensions boiled over between Israel and Iran. The U.S. became directly involved in the 12-day war by bombing Iran's nuclear facilities before Iran and Israel agreed to a ceasefire.",
      "After the Iran strikes, the Senate voted down a measure that Kaine had introduced in the days before the bombings to block President Trump from using further military force against Iran.",
      "\"The Iran situation was extremely time-limited,\" Janovsky said. \"The administration has made it very clear that they continue, and have in fact continued, to carry out these strikes in the Caribbean.

      "\"We're blowing up ships thousands of miles from our shore,\" Schiff said. \"What is to stop some other nation from deciding, well, they're going to use the same precedent to blow up ships thousands of miles from their shore, whether in the South China Sea or elsewhere, with a purported rationale that they're engaged in some kind of trafficking and therefore they're taking action? I don't think this is a practice we want to see other nations adopt.\""

      "The current round of indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas began on Oct. 6 in Egypt, with Egyptian and Qatari officials acting as intermediaries. U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff, and Mr. Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, had been expected to join the talks on Wednesday, days after Netanyahu confirmed he had sent a delegation \"to close the technical details of the release of our hostages.\"",
      "The war in Gaza, which has roiled the Middle East, was sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel. That attack killed some 1,200 people and saw 251 others taken as hostages back into Gaza.",
      "Israel's retaliatory war in Gaza against Hamas, which the U.S. and Israel consider a terrorist organization, has killed more than 67,000 people, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health, which does not distinguish between civilian and combatant casualties.",
      "Of the 251 hostages who were taken into Gaza, 148 were either freed as part of previous ceasefire agreements or\u00a0rescued by Israeli forces, according to the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The bodies of another 57 hostages were returned or recovered, the ministry says.",
      "Mr. Trump's peace plan had called for Hamas to release all 48 remaining hostages. Israel believes 20 of them are still alive. In return, Israel would release 250 Palestinians serving life sentences, along with approximately 1,700 other Gazans detained since the start of the war.",
      "Hamas said on Oct. 4 it agreed to key portions of Mr. Trump's original proposal \u2014 including the release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel and relinquishing its governance of Gaza. But the group had said other parts of the plan needed to be further negotiated."

    "story": [
      "Update: President Trump on Oct. 8\u00a0announced that Israel and Hamas have struck a deal\u00a0for Hamas to release all remaining hostages and for Israel to withdraw its forces to an \"agreed upon line,\" in what he called the \"first Phase\" of a peace deal to end the two-year-long war.",
      "President Trump offered up a 20-point plan Monday that he cast as a roadmap to end the Israel-Hamas war, a proposal that was backed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2014 though it remains unclear how Hamas will respond.",
      "The plan \u2014 which was presented as Netanyahu visited the White House \u2014 calls for Hamas to return all Israeli hostages within 72 hours, and for Israel's military to begin withdrawing from parts of the Gaza Strip in phases. It proposes handing over parts of Gaza to a \"technocratic\" committee and deploying a temporary security force backed by Arab states.",
      "Mr. Trump said in a joint press conference with Netanyahu that his goal is to ensure a \"sustainable, long-term peace.\"",
      "Israel and Hamas have been at war since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led terrorists attacked southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. Since then, Israel has waged an intense aerial bombardment and ground campaign in the Gaza Strip. More than 60,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which does not specify how many of the dead were civilians or militants.",
      "Netanyahu said Monday he supports the plan, which \"achieves our war aims.\" He said if Hamas does not accept the offer, \"Israel will finish the job by itself.\"",
      "Hamas has not yet responded to the proposal. Qatar's prime minister and Egypt's intelligence chief met with negotiators from Hamas, who said they would review the proposal \"in good faith\" and provide a response, a White House official told CBS News.",
      "Some unanswered questions about the plan still linger, including the exact timing of possible Israeli withdrawals from Gaza and the involvement of different international partners.",
      "Israel and Hamas would stop fighting, trade hostages and prisoners",
      "The plan calls for an immediate end to fighting if both Israel and Hamas agree to the plan, with Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip immediately withdrawing to an \"agreed upon line.\"",
      "\"During this time, all military operations, including aerial and artillery bombardment, will be suspended, and battle lines will remain frozen until conditions are met for the complete staged withdrawal,\" the plan states.",
      "Within 72 hours of Israel accepting the deal, which Netanyahu appeared to do Monday, Hamas is expected to free all remaining hostages. Some 50 hostages are still in Gaza, fewer than half of whom are believed to be alive, according to Israeli authorities.",
      "In exchange, Israel is expected to release 250 Palestinians serving life sentences, as well as 1,700 other Gazans who were detained following the start of the current conflict. The plan calls for the remains of 15 deceased Gazans to be returned for every one deceased hostage. The Israeli releases would take place after the hostages are released by Hamas.",
      "The plan calls for Gaza to be demilitarized \"under the supervision of independent monitors,\" with any weapons factories and tunnels destroyed and weapons decommissioned.",
      "\"A guarantee will be provided by regional partners to ensure that Hamas, and the factions, comply with their obligations and that New Gaza poses no threat to its neighbors or its people,\" one of the 20 points states.",
      "Aid and economic development would enter Gaza",
      "The plan states \"full aid will be immediately sent\" to Gaza, which has faced severe food shortages and has fallen into famine in some regions, according to the world's leading authority on food crises.",
      "It calls for aid deliveries that are at least equal to the levels agreed upon during a prior two-month ceasefire that began in January, with supplies flowing through the Rafah border crossing in southern Gaza. It also states the plan would involve \"rehabilitation of hospitals and bakeries.\"",
      "It states aid would be distributed by \"international institutions not associated in any manner with either party,\" including the United Nations and the Red Crescent. The plan does not mention the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a controversial U.S.- and Israeli-backed group that has handled many aid deliveries in the territory in recent months, whose members have been repeatedly accused of firing at Palestinians trying to get aid.",
      "The proposal also floats convening a \"panel of experts\" that could draw up economic redevelopment plans for the Gaza Strip. It states Gaza would exist in a \"special economic zone\" with \"preferred tariff and access rates.\"",
      "Gaza to be led by \"technocratic\" group and stabilization force, not Hamas",
      "After Israel withdraws from parts of Gaza, the plan calls for the territory to be governed by neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority, which currently oversees much of the West Bank.",
      "Instead, the enclave would be governed by a \"technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee, responsible for delivering the day-to-day running of public services and municipalities for the people in Gaza.\" It's not clear who would participate in that committee, but the plan states it would be composed of \"qualified Palestinians and international experts.\"",
      "Overseeing this new governing structure would be a \"Board of Peace\" chaired by Mr. Trump.",
      "In a press conference Monday, the president said he's slated to lead the board \"not at my request, believe me. I'm very busy. But we have to make sure this works.\"",
      "The plan also envisions an \"International Stabilization Force\" that would temporarily oversee security in Gaza. This group would be backed by the U.S. and Arab states, and tasked with training \"vetted Palestinian Police forces\" in collaboration with Jordan and Egypt.",
      "It states Hamas would need to \"agree to not have any role in the governance of Gaza, directly, indirectly, or in any form.\" But Hamas members would get amnesty if they \"commit to peaceful co-existence and to decommission their weapons,\" and members of the group who want to leave the territory would be able to do so.",
      "The plan would also \u2014 at least temporarily \u2014 sideline the Palestinian Authority, which has played a key part in security and governance in the occupied Palestinian territories since the 1990s. The authority is dominated by Fatah, a political movement that has long been at odds with Hamas, and it has not governed Gaza since Hamas took over the strip in 2007.",
      "Netanyahu has long criticized the Palestinian Authority. He said Monday the group would have \"no role whatsoever in Gaza without undergoing a radical and genuine transformation,\" including changes to its education system and an end to a long-controversial stipend system for the families of Palestinian militants.",
      "The West Bank \u2014 which Israel has occupied since 1967 \u2014 is home to millions of Palestinians and hundreds of thousands of Israeli settlers. Since the 1990s, the territory has been split up between areas where the Palestinian Authority has some degree of control and areas fully governed by the Israeli military. The Gaza Strip was also occupied in 1967, though Israel withdrew from the territory and removed its settlements in 2005. The territory has been under a tight Israeli and Egyptian blockade since Hamas' 2007 takeover.",
      "Israel would withdraw from Gaza and won't annex territory",
      "The Israel Defense Forces would immediately withdraw from part of Gaza after a deal is reached. It would continue to withdraw from parts of the territory and hand over control to the new International Stabilization Force \"based on standards, milestones, and timeframes linked to demilitarization.\"",
      "Israeli forces would remain present in a \"security perimeter,\" however, until Gaza \"is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat,\" the plan states. Netanyahu said Monday the IDF would remain in that perimeter \"for the foreseeable future.\"",
      "If Hamas doesn't accept the proposal, it calls for the plan to \"proceed in the terror-free areas\" that are handed over from the Israeli military to the new stabilization force.",
      "Plan calls statehood an \"aspiration of the Palestinian people\"",
      "The proposal does not lay out a clear roadmap for an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. But it says that, if the plan works out, \"the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, which we recognize as the aspiration of the Palestinian people.\"",
      "Netanyahu has ruled out allowing a Palestinian state to be formed, and has castigated U.S. allies like the United Kingdom and France for recognizing a Palestinian state last week at the United Nations General Assembly, calling it an \"absurd prize for terrorism.\" Mr. Trump has also opposed calls for a Palestinian state. But key Arab partners have backed Palestinian statehood and cast it as a necessary component of any long-term resolution.",
      "The plan also pushes for an \"interfaith dialogue process\" to \"try and change mindsets and narratives of Palestinians and Israelis,\" and a \"dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous co-existence.\""

President Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner were expected to arrive in Egypt on Wednesday to join the conversations, a source familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "The war was sparked by the Hamas-led, Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack, in which around 1,200 people were killed and 251 others taken as hostages. Israeli officials believe 48 of those people remain captive, though only 20 are believed to still be alive.",
      "Since that day, the Gaza Strip's Hamas-run Ministry of Health says Israel's retaliatory war has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians. Israel disputes that figure but provides no estimate of its own, and the United Nations considers the health ministry's count the most reliable information available, as Israel has barred foreign journalists from operating independently in Gaza.",
      "Ricardo Pires, a spokesman for the United Nations children's charity UNICEF, said this week that what he calls Israel's \"disproportionate response\" in Gaza has killed or maimed at least 61,000 children since the war started.",
      "UNICEF and the global charity Save the Children, which cited data compiled by the Hamas-run Gaza Government Media Office, say that on average, a child dies every hour in Gaza \u2014 or \"a classroom of children\" per day, as UNICEF put it.",
      "Since the war started, Save the Children says at least 20,000 kids have been killed in total \u2013 amounting to nearly a third of all Palestinians believed to have died in the war.",
      "UNICEF spokesman James Elder, told CBS News that when he visited one of Gaza's beleaguered hospitals this week, \"the first thing I saw was four children who had all been shot by quadcopters [military drones], then I went into a hallway and it was wall-to-wall children across all the corridors.\"",
      "\"There was a boy bleeding out on the floor who had apparently been there for five hours, then he was put on a stretcher only for another child to be put in his place,\" Elder told CBS News. \"Then I watched a little girl die. That's half an hour here in Gaza.\"",
      "The staggering death toll does not reflect the thousands more children who have been maimed and injured, or those who have lost one or both parents during the war.",
      "At a makeshift camp for Palestinian orphans in the southern city of Khan Younis, CBS News' team in Gaza saw some of the young faces behind the grim statistics.",
      "\"I wish the war were just a dream I'd wake up from and see my parents next to me,\" said 14-year-old Deena Al-Za'arab, who lost both of her parents.",

      "\"I just want to go back to how it used to be,\" she told CBS News. \"Whenever we heard the sound of missiles my father would hold us, but now he's gone, and we are always scared.\"",
      "UNICEF says one in five children in Gaza is acutely malnourished, and Elder stressed that the trauma being inflicted on the youngest is not just physical.",
      "\"The kids not only lost loved ones \u2014 it's not just about just having your mother killed, it's about watching your mother die, then add that level of trauma to being displaced \u2014 and we talk of displacement, it sounds like a neutral or abstract term. It's not. It's violent. It's repetitious, and it also increases trauma.\"",
      "The U.N. estimates that about 90% of Gaza's population, some 1.9 million people, have been forcibly displaced during the war, many of them multiple times as the focus of Israel's military operations has shifted. Most recently, the Israel Defense Forces ordered everyone to leave Gaza City, the enclave's biggest population center, and to move further south, to areas such as Khan Younis.",
      "It's led to another mass exodus, which aid workers say has increased the suffering in the region and made it harder to help those showing up, often with nothing.",
      "\"There have been several hundred thousands of people who have moved from the north recently, in the last few weeks,\" Olga Cherevko, a spokesperson for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, told CBS News' Haley Ott on Wednesday.",

You can see a lot of people living on the side of the road, pitching tents on the sides of the roads \u2026 There are many people who fled on foot and, of course, were not able to bring anything with them, and this creates extremely difficult conditions in terms of hygiene, sanitation and these kinds of things.\"",

      "El Paso Bishop Mark Seitz also showed Leo a video detailing the plight of migrants, and told The Associated Press afterward that Leo vowed to \"stand with\" them and the Catholic leaders who are trying to help them.",
      "\"He had a few words for us, thanking us for our commitment to the immigrant peoples and also saying that he hopes that the bishops' conference will speak to this issue,\" said Seitz, chair of the migration committee of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.",
      "Leo, who was born in Chicago and is also a citizen of Peru, hasn't spoken much about U.S. politics since being named the leader of the Catholic Church, but recently pointed out what he sees as contradictions in debates around abortion, the death penalty and immigration.",
      "\"Someone who says 'I'm against abortion but says I am in favor of the death penalty' is not really pro-life,\" he said earlier this month. \"Someone who says that 'I'm against abortion, but I'm in agreement with the inhuman treatment of immigrants in the United States,' I don't know if that's pro-life.\"",
      "Catholic leaders in the U.S. have denounced the Trump administration's crackdown, which has split up families, incited fears and upended life in American churches and schools that serve migrant communities. The administration has defended the crackdown as safeguarding public safety and national security.",
      "\"We don't want to get into the political fray, we're not politicians, but we need to teach the faith,\" and especially the Gospel message recognizing the inherent dignity of all God's children, and to care for the poor and welcome the stranger, Seitz said.",

U.S. citizens, immigrants with legal status and children have been among those detained in increasingly brazen and aggressive encounters by federal agents. In Leo's hometown of Chicago, immigration agents have stormed apartment complexes by helicopter as families slept, deployed chemical agents near a public school and put handcuffs on a city official at a hospital.",
      "\"They can't go out. They are afraid to shop, to go to church and so they stay home,\" wrote Maria in one of the letters delivered to Leo. Originally from Guatemala, she has lived in San Francisco for a quarter-century and qualified for asylum years ago, but has relatives in the U.S. who are not legal.",
      "\"The pope needs to talk to Trump and ask Trump to think about what he's doing to immigrants,\" she wrote. \"The pope needs to plead with Trump and Trump needs to listen to him. Trump has to change what he's doing.\"",
      "Just before he died, Pope Francis strongly rebuked the Trump administration's plans for mass deportations, warning that the forceful removal of people purely because of their illegal status deprives them of their inherent dignity.",
      "History's first U.S. pope has followed in Francis' line. Last weekend, Leo celebrated a special Holy Year Mass for migrants, denouncing the \"coldness of indifference\" and the \"stigma of discrimination\" that migrants desperate to flee violence and suffering often face. Asked by reporters this week about the crackdown in Chicago, Leo declined to comment.",
      "Prior to becoming pope, Leo, or then-Cardinal Robert Prevost, often shared posts on social media that were critical of the Trump administration's stances on immigration.",
      "On Wednesday, Leo was running late for the audience with Seitz and the delegation of around a dozen people, including members of the Hope Border Institute, an advocacy group formed in partnership with the El Paso diocese. The delegation members assured Leo that they would stand with him as they chatted in a Vatican reception room.",
      "\"Later on in the meeting he said, 'I will stand with you,' so it was a beautiful little exchange,\" said Seitz.",

    "published": "Wed, 08 Oct 2025 12:03:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Energy think tank Ember says a slight drop in global fossil fuel power marks \"a turning point,\" as the U.S. and Europe lag behind by China and India in investment.",
    "story": [
      "Worldwide solar and wind power generation has outpaced electricity demand this year, and for the first time on record, renewable energies combined generated more power than coal, according to a new analysis.",
      "Global solar generation grew by a record 31% in the first half of the year, while wind generation grew by 7.7%, according to the report by the energy think tank Ember, which was released Tuesday. Solar and wind generation combined grew by more than 400 terawatt hours, which was more than the increase in overall global demand in the same period, it found.",
      "\"A turning point\" for global fossil fuel power generation",
      "The findings suggest it is possible for the world to wean off polluting sources of power \u2014 even as demand for electricity skyrockets \u2014 with continued investment in renewables including solar, wind, hydropower, bioenergy and geothermal energies.",
      "\"That means that they can keep up the pace with growing appetite for electricity worldwide,\" said Ma\u0142gorzata Wiatros-Motyka, senior electricity analyst at Ember and lead author of the study.",
      "At the same time, total fossil fuel generation dropped slightly, by less than 1%.",
      "\"The fall overall of fossil may be small, but it is significant,\" said Wiatros-Motyka. \"This is a turning point when we see emissions plateauing.\"",
      "The firm analyzes monthly data from 88 countries representing the vast majority of electricity demand around the world. Reasons that demand is increasing include economic growth, electric vehicles and data centers, rising populations in developing countries and the need for more cooling as temperatures rise.",
      "Meeting that demand by burning fossil fuels such as coal and gas for electricity releases planet-warming gases including carbon dioxide and methane. This leads to more severe, costly and deadly extreme weather.",
      "China and India leading the green energy transition",
      "Ember also dedicated part of its report to an analysis of China, India, the European Union and the U.S., which, combined, account for nearly two-thirds of electricity generation and carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector globally.",
      "In the first six months of the year, China added more solar and wind than the rest of the world combined, and its fossil fuel generation fell by 2%, the report said.",
      "India saw record solar and wind growth that outpaced the growth in demand. India's fossil fuel generation also dropped.",
      "In both nations, emissions fell.",
      "\"It's often been said by analysts that renewable energy doesn't really lead to a reduction in fossil fuel use,\" said Michael Gerrard, founder and director of the Columbia University Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, who was not involved in the report. \"This report highlights an encouraging step in the opposite direction.\"",
      "U.S. and Europe see fossil fuel power generation increase",
      "In the U.S., demand growth outpaced the growth of clean power generation. In the E.U., sluggish wind and hydropower generation contributed to higher coal and gas generation, the report said. In both markets, fossil fuel generation and emissions increased.",
      "The U.S. clean energy market faces challenges as President Trump's administration shifts federal policy away from renewables and toward boosting coal, oil and gas production. The administration has terminated Biden-era funding that supported clean energy projects, repealed policy underpinning climate-related regulation and halted wind energy developments.",
      "Just last week the Trump administration announced that it would be canceling $8 billion in climate-related projects in 16 Democratically governed states, in funding cuts announced amid a federal government shutdown.",
      "Russ Vought, head of the Office of Management and Budget, announced the cancellations on social media and said additional details would be provided by the Department of Energy. All of the states affected by the cuts voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, and all are represented by Democrats in the Senate.",
      "Meanwhile, the administration has lifted barriers to coal mining, granted two years of regulatory relief to coal-fired power plants and other polluting industries and dedicated millions of dollars to these coal plants.",
      "In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly last month, Mr. Trump\u00a0attacked renewable energy and questioned the validity of the concept of climate change.",
      "Experts warn that Mr. Trump's efforts to block clean energy will have a long-term impact.",
      "\"The federal government is greatly increasing the growth of artificial intelligence, which is going to massively increase electricity demand, and they're also shutting down the cheapest new sources of electricity, wind and solar. That's going to lead to a gap in supply and demand,\" Gerrard said.",
      "Renewables \"still have an opportunity to make inroads into displacing fossil fuels, even with some demand growth,\" said Amanda Smith, senior scientist at research organization Project Drawdown, who also wasn't involved in the report.",
      "Smith said that while she remained \"very cautiously optimistic that renewables can continue to grow and continue to displace fossil fuels in the U.S. I am more optimistic on the world scale.\""

      "The reason for the weapons' presence in the delivery remains a mystery.",

      "The strange discovery came just days after a live grenade was found by a toddler in the front yard of his family's home in Washington state. Authorities said a 3-year-old boy discovered a World War II-era hand grenade, and a bomb squad removed and disposed of the explosive. No one was injured, according to the sheriff's office."

    "summary": "Fishermen in Trinidad and Tobago are fearing that a U.S. military strike in the Caribbean could kill them and their livelihoods.",
    "story": [
      "On a recent afternoon, Kenrick Modie finished untangling his fishing net in a quiet Caribbean village.",
      "As he slipped into a hammock at his home overlooking the sea, he worried that his life and livelihood could be wiped out by a U.S. military strike.",
      "Modie lives in the Caribbean twin-island nation of Trinidad and Tobago, which is now entangled in a geopolitical face-off between the United States and Venezuela, just 11 miles away.",
      "U.S. President Trump \"is giving instructions to shoot and kill people,\" Modie said about recent U.S. military strikes targeting suspected drug vessels in the Caribbean as it bulks up its military presence in the region. \"What could we do? We're just a little dot.\"",
      "The United States has carried out at least four strikes on alleged drug-carrying boats in the waters off Venezuela in recent weeks, with at least two of the vessels originating from Venezuela. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the fourth strike on Friday, saying \"four male narco-terrorists\" were killed, but offering no other details on who they were.",
      "Mr. Trump declared in a notification to Congress viewed by CBS News that the U.S. was in an \"armed conflict\" with drug cartels in the Caribbean, alleging they are trying to bring \"deadly poison\" to U.S. shores.",
      "Meanwhile, Venezuela has accused the U.S. of military buildup and aggression, prompting President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to place the country's military and civilians willing to take up arms on high alert.",
      "Stuck in the middle is Trinidad and Tobago, a nation with a multimillion-dollar fishing industry that employs thousands of fishermen who cast their nets almost daily to sustain themselves and their families.",
      "\"If we die, we die\"",
      "Trinidad and Tobago's Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar has said that drug cartels have contributed to pain and suffering in her country, and she has urged the U.S. to \"kill them all violently.\"",
      "She also said she is willing to grant the U.S. access to Trinidad and Tobago, if needed, so Americans can defend Guyana from neighboring Venezuela, which has claimed two-thirds of Guyana as its own.",
      "Maduro said that Persad-Bissessar's willingness to grant such access is like declaring war against Venezuela. The Venezuelan president has called for a return to good relations with its Caribbean neighbor, even as Trinidad and Tobago's government claims there's no bad blood between the countries.",
      "While those in authority trade words and military commanders ramp up their posturing, dozens of fishermen in Trinidad and Tobago feel their lives are at risk, given the ongoing U.S. strikes and escalation of tensions with Venezuela.",
      "\"If we die, we die, that's how this life is,\" Modie said.",
      "He fears being killed by a U.S. military strike while out fishing because he believes his boat could be mistaken for a drug-smuggling vessel. Modie said he hasn't seen substantial evidence that those killed in the U.S. strikes were indeed transporting drugs. He also worries about innocent fishermen being killed and falsely labelled as narco-terrorists by authorities, with the dead men being unable to clear their names.",
      "Fishing in fear",
      "Only seven miles separate Trinidad and Venezuela at their closest point. On a clear day, Venezuela is visible from the village of Icacos, which is located on Trinidad's southwestern tip.",
      "Driving around Icacos and neighboring Cedros village, dozens of boats strewn along the shoreline show how heavily these communities depend on fishing.",
      "Fishermen in these two villages say they are already under threat from pirates, and the military buildup at sea now adds yet another threat.",
      "Watching three other fishermen unload their catch for the day at the Cedros Fishing Complex, Kamal Bikeran said his crew now stays in shallower waters and isn't going as far out to sea as before, because of the tension involving the three countries.",
      "\"The U.S. has come there, and the Venezuelan military is saying they are more present, so you have to watch out,\" Bikeran said. \"At any point in time, outside there, you could be taken out.\"",
      "Forced to fish in shallower waters, Bikeran and other fishermen said the heightened regional tension is drying up their livelihoods, as they are now catching fewer fish.",
      "Mr. Trump gave fishermen a reason to worry after the first U.S. military strike on Sept. 2, which he said killed 11 suspected narco-terrorists.",
      "\"Boat traffic is substantially down,\" Mr. Trump said in early September. \"I don't even know about fishermen. They may say, 'I'm not getting on the boat.'\"",
      "The president repeated that sentiment in remarks Sunday at an event celebrating 250 years of the U.S. Navy in Norfolk, Virginia, saying, \"We're so good at it that there are no boats. In fact, even fishing boats. Nobody wants to go into the water anymore.\"",
      "Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly in late September, Caribbean leaders referred to the region as a zone of peace.",
      "Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley appealed for dialogue to avoid a war between the U.S. and Venezuela. The prime minister of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Ralph Gonsalves, described the foreign militarization of the waters near Venezuela as \"exceedingly troubling.\"",
      "Fishing in fear has become the new reality, said Shyam Hajarie, who has been a fisherman for more than 40 years. The Cedros native, like others, depends on his daily catches to support his family. He's unsure if the military buildup in the Caribbean would soon affect fish prices at the market.",
      "\"Just praying that everything works out with this situation with Venezuela and the U.S.,\" he said. \"That they make peace and not war.\""

      "\"And he said, 'No, no, no, no, the trucks, it \u2014 they were appropriated, but we don't know where they are,'\" he continued. \"I'm like, it's not a needle in a haystack. I mean, this is a semi-tractor truck. My mind is swimming in exactly how do you lose, you know, that many thousands of bottles of tequila?\"",
      "More than 24,000 bottles of tequila went missing in November 2024, when two trucks transporting them to the Santo Tequila warehouse in Lansdale, Pennsylvania, were stolen. The tequila had been transported from Mexico to Texas, then loaded into two trucks bound for the warehouse.",
      "According to CEO Dan Butkus, when the shipment was late arriving at the warehouse, the team received word from the logistics company that the trucks had mechanical issues and would be delayed.",
      "The tequila was originally meant to arrive at the warehouse on a Wednesday, and on Friday they heard from the logistics company that the truck had broken down near Washington, D.C. They then received a video of a broken truck and a message saying the \"mechanics advised the truck will be fixed Saturday\" and would arrive on Monday.",
      "They originally thought the tequila was delayed due to a mechanical problem. (Ethan Miller/Getty Images for Los Santos: Santo Puro Mezquila)",
      "\"We don't think anything's wrong, we are a day or two behind delivery. And meanwhile, they track these with GPS,\" Butkus said. \"Then on Monday, we get an email that the truck is close. GPS says it's within a couple miles of our warehouse in Lansdale, can you let us know when it arrives?\"",
      "The trucks never arrived. The Santo Tequila team later discovered that the trucking company, hired by their logistics provider, had outsourced the job to two other trucking companies. Those turned out to be fake operations using fraudulent email addresses, letterheads and phone numbers \u2014 a scam known as \"double brokering.\"",

      "According to Keith Lewis \u2014 a former police officer who now works with law enforcement to crack down on these types of crimes through his company, Verisk CargoNet \u2014 these fake companies \"bid on jobs they suspected might be valuable and hired unsuspecting drivers online\" who think they are delivering their cargo to the intended destination.

      "A three-judge panel, composed of two Trump appointees and one Clinton appointee, seemed deeply skeptical of the case made by Oregon Assistant Attorney General Stacy Chaffin, including her assertion that Trump\u2019s descriptions of the violence in Portland were hyperbolic and \"untethered from reality.\"",
      "Judges sharply questioned Chaffin about the specifics of the protests in Portland. Many of them focused on specifics, including dates of protests and number of arrests, in asking why \u2014 in the state's view \u2014 these conditions failed to meet the standard needed to justify Trump's deployment of the National Guard.",
      "\"I\u2019m not sure even President Lincoln would have been able to authorize the use of force right now\" if his actions were to be scrutinized under the \"much more stringent reviewability standard\" implied by Oregon here, Judge Ryan Nelson, a Trump appointee, interjected loudly, one of several times he cut off Chaffin as she attempted to answer the court's questions.",

      "Rebellions \"are unusual and extreme emergencies,\" Chaffin said, noting that the bulk of agents\u2019 complaints on record are focused instead on them being short-staffed.

The first is that there is a threat of \"rebellion\" underway, and the second is that the federal government cannot carry out the law without the help of the National Guard.",
      "McArthur argued that Portland meets the criteria of an \"active threat,\" regardless of the weeks that passed between Trump\u2019s June memo authorizing the federalization of National Guard troops and his September attempt to deploy the Oregon National Guard to Portland.",

      "The ad campaign received a sharp rebuke from a Chubb spokesperson, who called it \"completely dishonest\" in a statement to Fox News Digital.",
      "\"Evan has called out China\u2019s authoritarian approach and predatory practices. He has repeatedly called for the U.S. to stand up and defend its interests,\" the spokesperson said.",

      "\"I\u2019ve worked with Evan Greenberg for several years now on American relations with China,\" O'Brien said. \"In my dealings with Evan, he has been a proponent of U.S. interests in the region. Through its operations in China, his company has contributed to shrinking the U.S. trade deficit.\"",
      "However, a Fox News Digital review found that Greenberg has personal and professional entanglements with the CCP, including meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping and offering public statements praising the CCP\u2019s global vision.",
      "Earlier this year, Greenberg reportedly attended China\u2019s prestigious China Development Forum alongside executives like Blackstone\u2019s Stephen Schwarzman and Mastercard\u2019s Michael Miebach. The annual forum, which includes delegates from all over the world, also includes access to dozens of top CCP officials, according to a list of delegates released earlier this year.",
      "During this same week, Greenberg was\u00a0pictured in a press release posted by the Chinese government showing him shaking hands with Wang Yi, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, a top CCP position. The press release paraphrased Greenberg saying, \"U.S.-China relationship is the most significant bilateral relationship in the world.\"",
      "In 2024,\u00a0Greenberg was photographed not only shaking hands with Xi in Beijing as Chair of the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations. He was also offering glowing remarks about China\u2019s \"resilience and vitality.\"",

      "In 2022, Xi sent personal greetings to a gala honoring Greenberg. Meanwhile, Greenberg sits on the advisory board of Tsinghua University School of Economics and Management, an institution tied directly to China\u2019s national security and defense apparatus. That university operates under a wing of the Chinese government known for defense tech development, a connection that would likely raise red flags for any U.S. executive overseeing sensitive insurance data.",

      "Greenberg has also called on the U.S. to \"tone down rhetoric about Taiwan\" and slammed efforts to contain the CCP as \"self-isolating\" and doomed to fail. In shareholder letters, he\u2019s warned against treating U.S.-China competition as a \"new cold war\" and labeled some American trade protections as \"wrongheaded\" and \"unwise.\"",
      "Greenberg has acknowledged the complicated nature of the Taiwan situation, however.",
      "\"Taiwan presents the most proximate risk of conflict for the U.S.-China relationship,\" he said in 2022. \"Beijing has made its ambition clear that it wants to pull Taiwan into its orbit and, increasingly, is matching resources to its ambitions.\u00a0Washington is improving coordination with allies to collectively deter China from using force, while at the same time supporting Taiwan\u2019s efforts to improve its self-defense.\"",
      "Also in 2022, Chubb secured Chinese government approval to acquire majority control of Huatai Insurance Group, a Chinese firm with over $10 billion in assets. That stake has since grown to 85.5%. Meanwhile, Greenberg\u2019s father, Hank Greenberg, orchestrated business deals and meetings with CCP officials, including a Xi-endorsed event ahead of a key U.S.-China summit.",

      "Greenberg has not exclusively been complimentary of China and has voiced concerns and critiques about China, saying last year, \"China has undermined its appeal in many parts of the region through its revanchist efforts to demand acquiescence to its territorial claims and mismanagement of its own economy.\"",
      "\"Beijing\u2019s dimming domestic performance is reducing its appeal, and its bullying behavior is driving many countries closer to the United States.\"",
      "A 2022 Chubb annual report states that the U.S. is seeking an Indo-Pacific region that \"remains free from Chinese hegemony.\" The insurance company's 2023 annual report was also critical of China, saying, \"China is viewed both as important and as a source of anxiety for many countries around the world. China is a revisionist and revanchist power that is pursuing a large-scale expansion in military capabilities.\"",

      "\"As the saying goes, your friends show who you really are, and Greenberg's actions have made it clear he is all in on the CCP.

In March, the Finnish president \u2014 once a national golf team player \u2014 turned up at Mar-a-Lago not with briefing notes, but with clubs, challenging Trump to a round and earning something rarer than a trade deal: rapport.",

      "\"We are not just stopping boats and destroying drugs meant to poison our communities. We are making them change their operations, and that will heighten animosity.\"",

      "Cybercriminals are getting smarter every day, and one of their most convincing tricks is disguising phishing emails to look like they're coming from people you trust. Work emails are particularly dangerous because they lower your guard. After all, if the sender is your boss or IT department, why would you suspect anything? Unfortunately, scammers know this and use it to their advantage. I recently received an email from Krysti from Rockwall, Texas, who highlighted a similar issue.",

      "Why work email scams are so dangerous",
      "Phishing attempts that impersonate coworkers or employers are particularly effective because they rely on trust and urgency. You're more likely to open an attachment or click a link if you believe it's tied to your job. Scammers often spoof legitimate email addresses or use addresses that look almost identical to the real ones, hoping you won't notice the subtle difference.",

Clicking a fake link might lead to a login page designed to harvest your credentials. Even if nothing obvious happens right away, attackers could still be collecting background information to use in a future attack.",
      "These scams are becoming harder to spot, too. Some are powered by artificial intelligence-generated text, making them free of the usual grammar mistakes that used to be obvious red flags. Others use stolen email threads to insert themselves into ongoing conversations. That's why even seasoned professionals fall for them.",

      "7 ways to check if your device or data is compromised",
      "Some cyber threats don't reveal themselves immediately. Scammers often collect small bits of data over time or wait weeks before trying to use what they've stolen. The following steps are actions anyone can take to make sure their device and personal data remain secure, and to catch any signs of compromise before they turn into serious problems.",
      "1) Consider a personal data removal service",
      "The more personal information about you that's publicly available, the easier it is for scammers to target you. Data removal services can help by scanning hundreds of data broker websites and removing your details from them. Reducing this digital footprint not only makes it harder for attackers to build profiles on you but also limits how easily phishing attempts can be tailored to your life.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Your information could already be circulating in breach dumps and underground markets without you realizing it. Identity protection services monitor known dark-web sources, forums and leak sites for your email, phone, SSN and other sensitive details. If they find a match, they alert you so you can act quickly: change passwords, turn on two-factor authentication, and place fraud alerts or credit freezes with the credit bureaus.",

      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Even if you never shared payment details, attackers may attempt account takeovers or fraudulent transactions using any information they have. Review your bank, credit card and online account statements frequently for unusual activity. Pairing this habit with identity theft protection tools gives you an added safety net, as they often include financial monitoring and fraud alerts to catch problems quickly.",
      "Email accounts are often the central hub for many other services. If your inbox is compromised, attackers might try to break into linked accounts such as cloud storage, messaging apps or collaboration tools. Check each of these services for unfamiliar logins, permission changes or device activity, and secure them by changing passwords and enabling two-factor authentication.",
      "Weak or reused passwords are one of the easiest ways for attackers to break into accounts after a breach. A password manager solves this by generating and storing strong, unique passwords for every site you use. It also acts as a passive phishing detector. If the tool doesn't autofill a login form, that's a sign the page could be fake. Over time, this significantly reduces your risk of falling victim to credential-based attacks.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "Modern cyber threats go beyond viruses. A strong antivirus solution now acts as a full security layer, blocking phishing websites, detecting malicious scripts and stopping suspicious activity before it can compromise your device. If you've interacted with a suspicious attachment or link, a reputable antivirus tool can catch malware that might still be hiding in the background.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

    "story": [
      "Paradromics is shifting from research to clinical trials.",
      "When someone stops breathing, the clock starts ticking. First responders often need to get air into the lungs fast, and one of the most reliable ways is to slide a tube into the windpipe. This process, called intubation, keeps the airway open so that oxygen can flow again.",
      "Here's the catch: intubation is incredibly hard. Even trained doctors can struggle, and every extra second puts the patient at greater risk. Now, researchers at UC Santa Barbara have designed a soft robotic device that could change how first responders handle these emergencies. It helps guide the breathing tube into place quickly, safely, and with far less training than traditional methods.",

      "Why breathing tubes are so tough to place",
      "Our bodies are built to keep food and foreign objects out of the lungs. A small flap called the epiglottis blocks the windpipe during swallowing, and the path into the trachea is narrow and curved. To get around these obstacles, current tools are rigid. Medics have to lift the epiglottis with a metal scope and carefully angle the tube forward. If it slips into the esophagus instead, oxygen goes to the stomach instead of the lungs.\u00a0\"Traditional tools must be stiff so you can push them, and they only turn by pressing on sensitive tissue,\" explained Elliot Hawkes, professor of mechanical engineering at UCSB.",

      "Even trained doctors can struggle with intubation. (Universal Images Group/Getty Images)",
      "How the soft robot works",
      "The new system, called the soft robotic intubation system (SRIS), takes a gentler approach. First, a curved guide sits at the back of the throat. Then a soft inflatable tube slowly unrolls from the inside out as it advances. Instead of being forced in, it naturally follows the right path into the windpipe. This reduces friction, lowers the risk of injury and adapts to different body shapes automatically.\u00a0\"This growing paradigm naturally accounts for minor variations in anatomy,\" said lead author David Haggerty, a recent UCSB Ph.D. graduate.",

      "The results are eye-opening:",
      "Experts had a 100% success rate.Paramedics and EMTs reached a 96% success rate with just five minutes of training.Non-experts placed the tube in an average of 21 seconds, less than half the time needed with advanced video laryngoscopes.",

Scammers deliberately strike during this window when defenses are low. A scammer who can reference your personal information, family information or property details doesn't sound like a criminal, they sound like a legitimate professional. Scams often use the weapon of urgency \u2014 you have to purportedly act fast to avoid asset seizures, legal penalties or missed deadlines.

Contact the probate court directly using publicly listed numbers, not information provided by the caller. Ask your estate attorney about any claims before making payments.",

The announcement comes at a time when large-scale attacks on cloud CRM systems have already shaken tech and retail sectors alike, with Salesforce clients such as Google, Allianz and Dior reporting similar intrusions. These earlier incidents exposed names, emails and phone numbers, which were sufficient for attackers to launch phishing campaigns or extortion attempts.",

      "TRANSUNION BECOMES LATEST VICTIM IN MAJOR WAVE OF SALESFORCE-LINKED CYBERATTACKS, 4.4M AMERICANS AFFECTED",
      "What you need to know about the Stellantis breach",
      "Stellantis was formed in 2021 through the merger of the PSA Group and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. Today, it ranks among the world's largest automakers by revenue and is fifth in volume globally. The company houses 14 well-known brands, including Jeep and Dodge, as well as Peugeot, Maserati and Vauxhall, and operates manufacturing infrastructure across more than 130 countries. That global scale naturally makes it a tempting target for cyber adversaries.",
      "Stellantis confirmed hackers stole customer contact details in a recent breach. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "In its public statement, Stellantis clarified that only contact information was taken. Since the compromised third-party platform does not host financial or deeply sensitive personal data, Stellantis asserts that Social Security numbers, payment details and health records were out of reach of the attackers. In response, the company activated its incident response protocols, launched a full investigation, contained the breach, notified authorities and began alerting affected customers. It also issued warnings about phishing and urged customers not to click suspicious links.",
      "Stellantis has not revealed how many customers the breach affected. The company also has not specified which contact fields, such as email, phone, or address, attackers accessed.",
      "The alleged culprit, ShinyHunters, and Salesforce breaches",
      "While Stellantis has not explicitly named the hacker group behind the breach, multiple sources tie this incident to the ShinyHunters extortion campaign, which has spearheaded a wave of data thefts targeting Salesforce this year.",
      "ShinyHunters claims to have stolen over 18 million records from Stellantis' Salesforce instance, which includes names and contact details, according to Bleeping Computer. These attacks form part of a broader campaign aimed at Salesforce customers. In recent months, ShinyHunters has often worked in concert with groups like Scattered Spider and targeted companies including Google, Cisco, Adidas, Allianz Life, Qantas and brands under LVMH such as Dior and Tiffany & Co.",
      "OVER 2B USERS FACE PHISHING RISKS AFTER GOOGLE DATA LEAK",
      "The attack is linked to a wider wave of Salesforce data thefts this year. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Their reported method is fairly ingenious. Attackers exploit OAuth tokens tied to integrations like Salesloft's Drift AI chat tool to pivot into Salesforce environments. Once inside, they can harvest valuable metadata, credentials, AWS keys, Snowflake tokens and more.",
      "In fact, the FBI recently issued a Flash alert that surfaced numerous indicators of compromise linked to these Salesforce environment attacks and warned organizations to harden defenses. The cumulative toll is staggering. ShinyHunters asserts it has stolen over 1.5 billion Salesforce records across some 760 companies.",
      "7 ways to protect yourself from breaches like Stellantis",
      "Even if only contact details were exposed, that's enough for attackers to target you. Here's how to stay protected.",
      "Even basic contact details can be scraped from breaches and sold on data broker platforms, where they are used for spam, scams and targeted attacks. A data removal service can help track down and request the deletion of your information from these databases, reducing your long-term exposure.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Stolen emails and phone numbers could fuel phishing campaigns. (REUTERS /Rebecca Cook)",
      "The most immediate risk after a breach like this is targeted phishing. Attackers now have legitimate contact details, so their emails and texts can look convincingly real. Be skeptical of any message claiming to be from Stellantis, your car brand or a related service, especially if it urges you to click a link, download an attachment or share personal details.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "If attackers get your contact information, they may try the same password on other sites. This is called credential stuffing. A password manager can create strong, unique passwords for every account. That way, one breach will not put your other accounts at risk. It also helps you quickly update credentials in case you suspect a compromise.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks.

      "2FA adds an extra step to your logins by requiring a temporary code or approval in addition to your password. Even if attackers manage to steal your password, they will need that second factor to gain access. This significantly reduces the chances of account takeover attempts succeeding.",
      "Attackers often combine exposed contact information with other data to build complete identity profiles. Identity theft protection services monitor for suspicious activity, such as unauthorized credit applications or changes to official records, and alert you early so you can act before serious damage occurs. Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at CyberGuy.com.",
      "After a breach, it is worth auditing your accounts, not just with Stellantis but also with related services such as financing portals, insurance accounts or loyalty programs. Look for unusual sign-ins, unfamiliar devices, or changes to your personal details. Most services offer tools to review login history and security events, making checking these a routine habit.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Even giants in manufacturing are vulnerable when cloud platforms and third-party systems are part of their customer workflow. The same patterns seen in attacks on Google, LVMH and others have now reached the auto industry in a serious way. As Stellantis confronts the fallout, the broader lesson is clear. Organizations must treat the surfaces exposed by their service providers and SaaS integrations with as much vigilance as their own core systems.",

      "Mac malware often hides in the background, making it hard to spot at first. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Signs your Mac might be infected",
      "Spotting malware on macOS is not always straightforward. Many threats are designed to stay hidden, running quietly in the background while collecting data or opening a backdoor for attackers. Still, there are a few red flags that usually signal something is wrong.",
      "One of the first signs is slower performance or frequent overheating. If your Mac suddenly takes a long time to boot, runs hot during light tasks or lags when performing simple actions, it might be doing more behind the scenes than you realize. Apps that crash or freeze more often than usual are another warning sign. Occasional app failures are normal, but if built-in tools like Safari, Notes or Mail begin acting unstable, it may point to malicious interference.",
      "It is also worth paying attention to what is happening under the hood. Checking Activity Monitor for unknown processes or unusually high CPU or memory usage can reveal malware that tries to hide itself with random or unfamiliar names. Redirected web traffic is another classic symptom. If your browser takes you to strange websites, shows pop-ups, or installs new extensions you never approved, adware or spyware might already be present.",
      "Finally, unexplained changes to your security settings should always raise suspicion. If you notice your firewall turned off, privacy permissions modified, or login items appearing without your knowledge, something could have gained unauthorized control of your system.",

      "How macOS protects you by default",
      "Apple has built several layers of defense into macOS, many of which run silently in the background to keep your system secure. Knowing how they work can help you understand what protections are already in place and where you might still need to add more safeguards.",
      "Gatekeeper is one of the most important built-in security tools. It checks every app before it runs to make sure it comes from a verified developer, warning or blocking you if the app is not trusted. Another layer of defense is XProtect, Apple's built-in malware scanner. It updates automatically and can stop many known threats from running, although it is not as thorough as specialized antivirus software.",
      "System Integrity Protection, or SIP, is another important safeguard. It locks down critical system files and processes so that malware cannot tamper with them even if it gains access. macOS also uses sandboxing and strict permission controls to contain threats. Apps run in isolated environments and must explicitly request permission to access sensitive data such as your camera, files, or location.",
      "Together, these features make it significantly harder for malicious software to infect your Mac or cause serious damage. However, they are not perfect. Attackers are constantly developing new techniques to bypass these protections, and many threats rely on human error rather than technical exploits. That is why taking additional precautions is still essential, even on a Mac.",

      "Kurt the CyberGuy reports on how Instagram safety tools are not 'foolproof' for kids, shares tips for how to protect teens online and more on 'Fox & Friends.'",
      "Meta is rolling out new protections aimed at making social media safer for young people. In September 2024, Instagram introduced Teen Accounts, which come with built-in safeguards that limit who can contact teens, what content they see and how long they spend on the app.",
      "Since then, adoption has been strong: 97% of teens ages 13-15 kept the default settings, and 94% of parents say Teen Accounts are helpful. Now, Meta is expanding those protections beyond Instagram. Teen Accounts are coming to Facebook and Messenger worldwide, bringing stronger safety standards to more of the apps teens use every day.",

      "However, not everyone agrees that these protections go far enough.\u00a0Research regarding the effectiveness of Instagram's teen safety features, as reported by child-safety advocacy groups and corroborated by researchers at Northeastern University (Sept. 25, 2025), paints a different picture. The study found that only eight of 47 safety features tested were fully effective, and internal documents suggest that Meta was aware of some shortcomings. Critics also argued that certain protections, like manual comment-hiding, place the burden on teens themselves rather than preventing harm upfront. They questioned whether time management tools were robust enough, giving some features middling grades despite functioning as described.",
      "\"Misleading and dangerously speculative reports such as this one undermine the important conversation about teen safety,\" Meta told CyberGuy, \"This report repeatedly misrepresents our efforts to empower parents and protect teens, misstating how our safety tools work and how millions of parents and teens are using them today.",
      "\"Teen Accounts lead the industry because they provide automatic safety protections and straightforward parental controls. The reality is teens who were placed into these protections saw less sensitive content, experienced less unwanted contact and spent less time on Instagram at night.

By adding built-in protections, the company reduces risks for teens without requiring parents to manage every setting. At the same time, the School Partnership Program gives educators new tools to protect students in real time. The online safety curriculum goes one step further by teaching kids how to recognize threats and respond confidently. Still, advocacy groups and independent researchers question whether these efforts are enough, and Meta's strong defense shows just how high the stakes are in the teen safety debate. As teens spend more of their lives online, the responsibility to protect them grows. The real test will be how well these tools hold up against evolving online threats.",

      "When pressed about concerns relating to a government\u2019s ability to enforce mass surveillance through the ease that the technology could offer, even if that is not the original intent, Starr said it comes down to establishing those protections for personal privacy from the get-go.",

      "Blair concluded, \"The\u00a0right to life, guaranteed under Section 33 of the 1999 Nigerian Constitution, is meaningless unless the state acts decisively to punish those who violate it.

      "In the Chicago hearing, Perry seemed skeptical of some of the Justice Department's claims about the need to deploy the Guard in the country's third most populous city, and questioned whether protests around an ICE facility had gotten violent because of how federal agents were treating protesters.",
      "She also pressed the lawyer for DOJ, Eric Hamilton, on what the guard would be doing in Chicago and whether members would be armed.",
      "\"What are they being trained and deployed to do?\" the judge asked at one point, while also noting the parameters of their duties are vague. \"I am very much struggling to find where this would stop,\" Perry said.",
      "Hamilton said they were being deployed on a \"federal protective mission,\" but that he did not know what their exact duties would be.",
      "During oral arguments in the Portland case, the judges \u2014 two Trump appointees and a Clinton appointee \u2014 expressed concerns about the ability of a lower court judge to make decisions about a military deployment, and suggested that the city and state had not shown enough deference to the president.",
      "\u201cIt just seems a little counterintuitive to me that the City of Portland can come in and say no, you need to do it differently,\u201d Judge Ryan D. Nelson, one of the Trump nominees, said.",
      "The attorney for Oregon, Stacy Chaffin, said presidential deference \"has a limit, and that limit is this case.\" That's because Trump's rationale for calling up the troops \u2014 including that Portland is \"war ravaged\"  \u2014 is \"untethered to the facts,\" she said.",
      "Eric McArthur, arguing for the DOJ, said the mobilization was both legal and necessary to defend against ongoing chaos outside Portland\u2019s immigration processing facility. Federal officials have been forced to call in back up as protesters block cars, spit on authorities and, in one instance, lit a fire outside the facility, he said.",
      "\u201cThese are violent people,\u201d he told the judges. \u201cThe president is entitled to say enough is enough and bring in the National Guard to reinforce the regular forces,\u201d he added.",
      "The hearings \u2014 in Chicago and San Francisco \u2014 began around noon ET in courthouses about 2,000 miles apart.",
      "Trump has defended his actions in both states. \"Everything we\u2019re doing is very lawful. What they\u2019re doing is not lawful,\" he said at the White House Wednesday.",
      "Abigail Jackson, a spokesperson for the White House, said the president \u201cwill not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities and we expect to be vindicated by the Court.\u201d",
      "Illinois on Monday sued, seeking to block the administration from deploying federalized National Guard troops on the streets of Chicago, contending it's illegal, unconstitutional and unnecessary.",
      "Trump ordered the deployment over the weekend. U.S. Northern Command said that 500 National Guard members have been mobilized \u2014 300 from Illinois and 200 from Texas \u2014 and that some of the troops from Texas were on duty \"in the greater Chicago area\" as of Wednesday night.",
      "\u201cThese forces will protect U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other U.S. Government personnel who are performing federal functions, including the enforcement of federal law, and to protect federal property,\u201d Northern Command said in a statement.",
      "Members of the Texas National Guard were spotted Thursday morning at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in the Chicago suburb of Broadview, NBC Chicago reported. The village told the station that 45 members of the Texas National Guard had arrived overnight.",
      "The site is one of two that the military said in a court filing that it plans on sending troops to in the coming days. The other site is a federal courthouse in Chicago \"due to two high profile cases involving DHS activities and personnel.\"",
      "The state's lawsuit argues that there's no need for troops in Chicago and that the administration has been trying to provoke unrest by increasing the presence of federal law agents who are using \"unprecedented, brute force tactics for civil immigration enforcement.\"",
      "Those tactics include shooting \"chemical munitions at groups that included media and legal observers\" at an ICE facility outside Chicago and staging a dramatically produced raid at an apartment building in which agents rappelled down from Black Hawk helicopters.",
      "\u201cThe community\u2019s horror at these tactics and their significant consequences have resulted in entirely foreseeable protests,\u201d the suit said.",
      "\u201cThe deployment of federalized National Guard, including from another state, infringes on Illinois\u2019s sovereignty and right to self-governance\" and \"will cause only more unrest,\" it added.",
      "At a hearing in a different case in federal court in Chicago Thursday, a judge signed a temporary restraining order in favor of a group of journalists, protesters and religious practitioners who filed suit earlier this week over federal agents\u2019 \u201cexcessive\u201d use of force and threats against what plaintiffs\u2019 actions described as reporting, \u201cpeaceful\u201d protest and prayer.",
      "U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis said the evidence in the case shows federal agents\u2019 actions against protesters and others \u201cclearly violate the Constitution,\u201d and \u201cmakes clear whatever lawlessness is occurring is not occurring by protesters.\u201d",
      "She issued an order blocking agents from arresting reporters and protesters without cause, and from using \"riot control weapons\" on \"members of the press, protesters, or religious practitioners who are not posing an immediate threat to the safety of a law enforcement officer or others.\"",
      "\u201cMy hope is that in entering this TRO, and providing this guidance, that we will no longer have the issues that we\u2019ve been experiencing in the Northern District of Illinois,\u201d the judge said.",
      "The White House has maintained that Trump is trying to keep American cities and federal personnel safe. Trump said this week that if the courts wind up derailing his efforts to use the National Guard, he could invoke the Insurrection Act, which would empower him to use the U.S. military domestically.",
      "\"The Trump administration is committed to restoring law and order in American cities that are plagued by violence due to Democrat mismanagement. And President Trump will not stand by while violent rioters attack federal law enforcement officers,\" the White House's Jackson said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "The administration made similar arguments to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, asking the panel to pause a federal judge's order in Oregon over the weekend blocking the state's National Guard from being federalized and deployed.",
      "The \"extraordinary\" order by U.S. District Judge Karen Immergut \u201cimproperly impinges on the Commander in Chief\u2019s supervision of military operations, countermands a military directive to officers in the field, and endangers federal personnel and property,\u201d Justice Department attorneys contended in their court filing.",
      "They also noted that the 9th Circuit blocked a similar restraining order this year involving National Guard troops in Los Angeles and held then that the president's judgment about whether troops are needed should get \"a great level of deference.\"",
      "Immergut, a Trump appointee, said in her order that the Portland case is different from the California one, in part because it appears Trump was acting in bad faith with his exaggerated claims of violence in the city, including that it was \"war ravaged\" with \"ICE Facilities under siege from attack by Antifa\" and \"crazy people\" who \"try to burn down buildings, including federal buildings\" every night.",
      "While there had been some violent protests in June, demonstrations \"were not significantly violent or disruptive in the days \u2014 or even weeks \u2014 leading up to the President\u2019s directive on September 27,\" Immergut wrote, describing the protests as mostly \"small and uneventful.\"",
      "\"On September 26, the eve of the President\u2019s directive, law enforcement 'observed approximately 8-15 people at any given time out front of ICE. Mostly sitting in lawn chairs and walking around. Energy was low, minimal activity,'\u201d her order said."

      "A federal judge has dismissed Drake\u2019s defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group over Kendrick Lamar\u2019s hit diss track \u201cNot Like Us.\u201d",
      "The ruling marks the legal culmination of a prolific feud between Drake and Lamar that spanned much of 2024, when the two rappers dropped a slew of tracks aimed at each other.",
      "In January, Drake, whose real name is Aubrey Drake Graham,  sued his record label in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, accusing UMG of defaming him by promoting \u201cNot Like Us,\u201d which contains lyrics accusing Drake of being a pedophile. (Lamar was not named as a defendant in the suit.)",
      "UMG, which represents both Drake and Lamar through different divisions, fired back in March with a motion to dismiss, claiming the suit was \u201cno more than Drake\u2019s attempt to save face for his unsuccessful rap battle\u201d with Lamar.",
      "In her decision on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Jeannette Vargas granted the record label\u2019s motion to dismiss, stating that \u201cthe allegedly defamatory statements in \u2018Not Like Us\u2019 are nonactionable opinion.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe issue in this case is whether \u2018Not Like Us\u2019 can reasonably be understood to convey as a factual matter that Drake is a pedophile or that he has engaged in sexual relations with minors,\u201d the judge stated in the decision. \u201cIn light of the overall context in which the statements in the Recording were made, the Court holds that it cannot.\u201d",
      "In his lawsuit, Drake had also accused UMG of conspiring to \u201cartificially inflate\u201d Lamar\u2019s \u201cNot Like Us\u201d on Spotify, including by using pay-to-play schemes, bots and other tactics.",
      "\u201cNot Like Us\u201d was the bestselling rap recording of 2024, and Lamar swept this year\u2019s Grammy Awards, taking home five wins. He headlined the Super Bowl halftime show in February, where the crowd loudly sang along as he performed the diss track.",
      "In Vargas\u2019 decision Thursday, she stated that Drake\u2019s claims were based on \u201cunreliable online commentary\u201d in the form of social media posts.",
      "Ultimately, the court stated, Drake \u201cfails to provide any facts or circumstances that would make it \u2018highly plausible\u2019 that UMG conducted such covert business tactics,\u201d and his complaint additionally failed to show \u201chow any of the deceptive practices allegedly utilized by UMG harmed consumers.\u201d",
      "In his original complaint, Drake had emphasized that the lawsuit is \u201cnot about\u201d Lamar but rather that it is aimed at \u201cthe music company that decided to publish, promote, exploit, and monetize allegations that it understood were not only false, but dangerous.\u201d",
      "It mentioned several instances of assailants attempting to threaten Drake at his home last May in the days after the song was released, including one case of a gunman shooting and wounding his security guard.",
      "Representatives for Drake and Lamar did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "A spokesperson for UMG said the label is \u201cpleased with the court\u2019s dismissal and look[s] forward to continuing our work successfully promoting Drake\u2019s music and investing in his career.\u201d",
      "\u201cFrom the outset, this suit was an affront to all artists and their creative expression and never should have seen the light of day,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement."

    "story": [
      "Each season of \"Love Is Blind\" comes with at least one major controversy, but Season 9 is filled with many viral moments that have viewers talking.",
      "After watching the first nine episodes of this season, fans of the Netflix series have strong thoughts on several cast members' behavior and the conversations they had both in and out of the dating pods.",
      "As we wait to see how the rest of the season pans out, we're recapping the biggest controversial moments so far.",
      "Patrick and Kacie's Awkward Breakup Conversation",
      "After connecting in the dating pods, Kacie McIntosh and Patrick Suzuki got engaged and met in person for the first time.",
      "Although they'd never seen each other until that moment, they had spoken at length about the topic of ethnicity, with Patrick opening up about his insecurities about being the only Asian person in his friend group while growing up and being judged for his looks. Kacie reassured him that his ethnicity didn't matter and said her siblings also date people of other races.",
      "Kacie and Patrick's first meeting went well, but Kacie soon spoke with producers and decided she needed to go home. In an awkward conversation that left both Patrick and viewers wondering if Kacie was breaking up with him, the duo sat down to talk.",
      "Kacie seemed to give Patrick false hope that she still wanted to date him, just without the cameras around. However, she told producers she didn't think her attraction to Patrick was \"going to grow that much.\"",
      "After the show premiered, Kacie told Netflix's Tudum that Patrick felt \"like a stranger\" when they met, but she had intended to date him \"slowly at our own pace at home in Denver.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Patrick told the Los Angeles Times that he was \"so confused\" about how Kacie approached the conversation. Still, he said the experience on the show was \"transformative.\"",
      "Multiple Participants Leaving the Dating Experiment Early",
      "Finding your soulmate without ever seeing them in person can feel like an intense experience. In Season 9, the dating experiment proved to be too much for two participants, who eventually decided to leave early.",
      "While dating in the pods, Anna Yuan connected with Patrick Suzuki and Blake Anderson. One day, she never showed up to her date with Patrick, leaving him to wonder what went wrong. Producers took Blake aside when he was also stood up by Anna. He then learned that she had gone home without saying goodbye to either of her connections.",
      "Anna spoke with Tudum about her decision to go home early and explained why she didn't tell Blake or Patrick that she was leaving.",
      "\"I was a wreck,\" she said. \"My eyes were almost swollen shut from crying. I was embarrassed.\"",
      "When producers offered Anna the opportunity to go on camera and talk with her dates, she didn't want to given her current state.",
      "Anna also admitted that she was \"scared\" as the experiment continued and she became more \"vulnerable\" in her dates.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m just sharing it with whoever I\u2019m dating or the other women \u2014 this is going to be broadcast for people,\u201d she said.",
      "Anna's parents were also confused about the experiment and worried that she was being \"kidnapped\" since producers were going to take away her phone. All of this added up to Anna feeling conflicted about continuing with the experiment.",
      "Blake Anderson developed feelings for Megan Walerius and Anna Yuan in the dating pods. One day, he got stood up when Anna decided to go home early. When he later decided to leave, he stood up Walerius on one of their dates.",
      "While speaking with TODAY.com, Anderson said his decision not to speak to Walerius before he left was \"clumsy\"",
      "\u201c(I) certainly didn\u2019t intend to leave anyone hanging,\u201d he said. \u201cThe departure was maybe a little bit clumsy on my part. I didn\u2019t think it through, but I truly thought in the moment I was doing the right thing.\u201d",
      "Anderson also explained why he chose to go home.",
      "\u201cI think I was more so kind of concerned with how I was feeling. The timeline was just a hurdle that I couldn\u2019t get over. I think at that point you only have so many days left before you\u2019re kind of faced with that, \u2018Hey, should I propose? Should I not?\u2019 I felt like I was nowhere close to that with any of my connections,\u201d he said.",
      "Nick and Annie's Controversial Comments About Raising LGBTQ+ Children",
      "When Nick Amato and Annie Lancaster brought up the topic of having children one day, they had a conversation that alienated some viewers. Nick asked what Annie would do if she learned that her child was a member of the LGBTQ+ community.",
      "While Annie said she would love her child \"no matter what,\" she did say she wouldn't be thrilled to hear the news.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll support my kids, but (would be) making sure that they\u2019re informed. Like, \u2018Do you know what you\u2019re doing? Do you know what you\u2019re getting into? Do you know what you\u2019re signing up for?\u201d she said.",
      "When Nick asked if Annie thought some subsets of the LGBTQ+ community were \"a fad,\" she said yes. Nick then explained why he holds that opinion and said he'd be concerned if his child's friend suggested they could be a member of the LGBTQ+ community.",
      "\u201cWhen kids start having those thoughts too young \u2014 and maybe I am old fashioned \u2014 but it\u2019s like a concern for me because who\u2019s telling you that?\u201d he said.",
      "Many viewers were disappointed with how the couple handled the conversation, with one X user calling it \"sickening beyond belief\" and another saying they would be \"fast forwarding through all of Annie and Nick scenes after that gross homophobic conversation.\u201d",
      "After the show premiered, Nick took to Instagram to share a video response to the backlash.",
      "\"I will LOVE and support my future children unconditionally, no matter how they identify. I take full accountability for how my words came across but I am glad it provoked this discussion and my learning,\" he captioned the post.",
      "\"I was born in a traditional Midwestern environment, and I now recognize how that shaped certain blind spots (I\u2019m thankful for the support of my friends recently for helping me learn this). That\u2019s not an excuse, just part of the work I\u2019m doing to grow and be better.\"",
      "In his video, Nick admitted \u201cthere\u2019s a lot that I didn\u2019t understand\u201d and said he used the word \"fad\" to refer to \u201cover-introducing sexual content material to kids\u2019 shows at a young age or the idea of gay identity.\u201d",
      "Joe's Comments About Madison's Body",
      "While dating Joe Ferrucci in the \"Love Is Blind\" pods, Madison Maidenberg opened up about an eye condition she has that could possibly make her go blind. After he reassured her that he would support her in good and bad times, Madison felt closer to Joe.",
      "After getting engaged, the couple met in person. Both Joe and Madison said they were attracted to each other. Madison asked if she was Joe's typical type and he said he had dated a \"variety\" of women. He called her \"gorgeous\" and she said she was \"pleasantly surprised\" with him.",
      "During the engaged couple's romantic getaway, Madison gushed about her physical attraction to her fianc\u00e9 in a confessional interview, saying, \"I'm totally into Joe. He's such a babe.\"",
      "However, Joe admitted that Madison wasn't his typical type, physically speaking.",
      "\u201cI am into thinner women, I would say, usually. That\u2019s just a preference, but not saying I wouldn\u2019t be interested in somebody that\u2019s kind of more, you know, larger physique,\u201d he said, adding that he knew that sounded \u201cterrible.\u201d",
      "Joe went on to say that \"physical attraction can grow\" since they had already established an emotional connection. \"There's a lot of attraction between the both of us,\" he said.",
      "While discussing the topic together, Madison asked Joe what he thought of her when they first met. \"It just felt like a stranger honestly,\" he said.",
      "Joe described how he took a moment to connect the person he'd been talking with in the pods with this person he met in person.",
      "Madison was curious to know if he thought she was \"hot\" and Joe said he did. She said she was also still connecting the physical and emotional elements. \"I'm not taking it personally, I promise,\" she said.",
      "Madison asked Joe if he felt like she was his \"person\" and he said yes. \"I was not at peace at first, but I'm at peace now. That's all that matters,\" he explained.",
      "Madison was \"super attracted\" to Joe, and he said he was \"attracted\" to her too. The next day, the couple agreed that they were having great sex, but Madison expressed concern that she was more into Joe than he was into her.",
      "\"I've always felt like I'm not enough. I just want somebody to think I'm enough,\" she said.",
      "Joe reassured Madison that he finds her \"beautiful,\" \"sexy\" and \"attractive.\" He also said he simply had a physical type in the past. \"I find your body attractive. I find everything about you attractive and that's only growing as well,\" he said.",
      "In an interview with Glamour, Madison said she experienced disordered eating after she returned from the trip to Mexico and appeared on the show.",
      "\u201cThe things that he said kind of carelessly really did impact me, you know?\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to be aware that words carry weight.\u201d",
      "Joe clarified his comments, saying, \u201cI never want to contribute to anyone feeling that way. She always came across as confident and comfortable in her own skin. Mind you, in our conversation, I was not shaming her. Just being truthful of who I went for in the past. I found her attractive, both in how she looked and how she carried herself.\u201d",
      "These days, Madison said she is \"healthy\" hopes Joe will \"be far more mindful\" while speaking about women's bodies.",
      "Mike's Comments About Diabetes",
      "Megan Walerius formed three main connections in the dating pods. Over time, she narrowed down her options to Jordan Keltner, a service manager and single father to a 5-year-old son, and Mike Brockway, an entrepreneur.",
      "Mike drew controversy for seeming to assume that Jordan\u2019s child\u2019s diet led to a diabetes diagnosis. While diet can increase risk on Type 2 diabetes, Jordan's son has Type 1 diabetes, the exact cause of which is not clear, per the Mayo Clinic.",
      "Mike approached the conversation by saying he was happy that he and Megan had spoken about the role nutrition will play in the way they parent their future children. He then mentioned that one of the other male participants has a son with diabetes.",
      "\"It's just like so crazy to me that that can be the case. I have a friend that was pre-diabetic and he just totally changed up his diet. And now he's good,\" Mike said.",
      "\"Wow,\" Megan said, seemingly uncomfortable with the conversation. Megan had previously shared that her father also had Type 1 diabetes.",
      "\"And so maybe it's not that easy for everyone, but I just think health and nutrition has to be top of mind,\" Mike continued.",
      "\"Right,\" Megan replied.",
      "Mike then quickly changed the subject, but opened up a much larger conversation for viewers. One took to X to comment, \"Sorry, who is this guy who literally doesn\u2019t understand diabetes? And does Megan agree with him, or is she just staying quiet cause she can\u2019t be bothered to educate?\"",
      "\"Why isn\u2019t anyone talking about how Mike is questions the nutrition of Jordon\u2019s son because he has type 1 diabetes???? Does he know the difference of type 1 and 2?\" another said."

    "story": [
      "Jewel has long been an advocate for mental health through her Inspiring Children Foundation and, in recent years, the #NotAloneChallenge campaign. The campaign, which kicks off its fourth year on Friday, Oct. 10 \u2014 World Mental Health Day \u2014 promotes mental health resources to those who need them.",
      "\u201cThe motivation was to go a step beyond raising awareness \u2014 to be able to put tools into people\u2019s hands that are usable and free,\u201d the Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter, whose full name is Jewel Kilcher, tells TODAY.com. \u201cI think a lot of people don\u2019t realize how many modalities there are. And so if one isn\u2019t working for you, it\u2019s not that you\u2019re broken, it\u2019s that you may not have the right tool.\u201d",
      "The tools on the website for the #NotAloneChallenge range from mood-boosting activities to information for help lines and in-person support.",
      "Jewel, 51, honed her own tools, which she has described in numerous interviews, at a young age. Raised by an abusive father, she left home at 15 and would later struggle with panic attacks.",
      "\u201cHappiness wasn\u2019t really taught in my household, and I wondered if it was a learnable skill or a teachable skill, or do kids like me just fall through the cracks, and you don\u2019t have hope the rest of your life?\u201d she recalls to TODAY.com. \u201cSo I set out on kind of this mission to see if it was a language that I could figure out how to speak, and I started writing as a side effect of that. It was sort of, you know, songs like \u2018Who Will Save Your Soul\u2019 or \u2018Angel Standing By\u2019 were sort of my medicine for myself.\u201d",
      "She has said other coping mechanisms, such as journaling and meditation, have helped her in her mental health journey. Reframing her relationship with anxiety has also been useful to her.",
      "She says she \u201cstopped thinking that anxiety meant something was wrong with me, and maybe it meant something was right with me, that my anxiety was my body\u2019s way of telling me I was consuming something that didn\u2019t agree with me. That there was a thought, a feeling or an action that I was consuming that made me anxious.",
      "\u201cAnd when I could start to bring awareness around those and then start curating which thoughts, feelings and actions I was participating in, it really made a big difference in my health,\u201d she continues.",
      "Regulating Her Fame",
      "After she released her debut album, \u201cPieces of You,\u201d featuring lead single \u201cWho Will Save Your Soul,\u201d in 1995, she faced a different sort of struggle in her life as she became a household name.",
      "Jewel says she can look back at that time now with \u201cmore appreciation,\u201d but in the moment she \u201cdidn\u2019t really enjoy being that famous.\u201d",
      "\u201cBy the time I did \u2018Spirit,\u2019 my second album (released in 1998), I started to regulate how famous I got. I started to take years between albums to kill my momentum. My mental health just didn\u2019t do good with being that level of fame,\u201d she says, remembering how people followed her and simple tasks like grocery shopping became difficult.",
      "\u201cI was like, wait, I don\u2019t actually have to be that famous. I can be less famous, and it\u2019s not that hard to do. You take time between albums, and you go under the radar really quickly,\u201d she adds. \u201cAnd so how I\u2019ve been able to manage my career now, the level that I have, is comfortable for me. It\u2019s manageable for me. I\u2019m able to do the things I want.",
      "I was like, wait, I don\u2019t actually have to be that famous. I can be less famous, and it\u2019s not that hard to do. You take time between albums, and you go under the radar really quickly.",
      "Jewel",
      "\u201cSo when I look back on that time I think of a lot of tiredness and exhaustion, but also exhilaration and wonder, because, you know, I had a dream come true.\u201d",
      "She refers to \u201cPieces of You\u201d as a \u201csincere album\u201d that hit record stores at the \u201cheight of coolness and cynicism and grunge\u201d in the music world. It spawned multiple Billboard Hot 100 hits \u2014 \u201cWho Will Save Your Soul,\u201d \u201cYou Were Meant For Me\u201d and \u201cFoolish Games\u201d \u2014 and went 12-times platinum.",
      "\u201cThe trajectory of my life was altered because people invested in that album and invested in me as a person, invested in my writing and my heart. \u2026 I sometimes don\u2019t know if people realize what a dynamic, real relationship it is,\u201d she explains. \u201cThe reason I can do this 30 years later is because people supported me as I\u2019ve gone into poetry or different genres or into mental health.\u201d",
      "Flexing Her Muscles (Literally) on Instagram",
      "Jewel helped establish the Inspiring Children Foundation, a nonprofit that describes its mission as helping at-risk youth with physical, emotional, social and mental health, over 20 years ago. Its #NotAloneChallenge not only provides mental health tools, but also encourages people to join the movement by recording a video to express who they\u2019re grateful for and to remind others that they are not alone. The initiative has also been expanded this year to include a Not Alone award event and wellness summit to be held in Las Vegas in November.",
      "The musician, who is mom to 14-year-old son Kase with ex-husband Ty Murray, has also put an emphasis on her physical health. She says she likes to practice yoga, do weight training, hike and embrace nature. The latter was evident in an Oct. 5 Instagram post in which she wrote, \u201cNature is so healing.\u201d",
      "A separate Instagram post a few weeks earlier received much more attention. On Sept. 16, she shared a selfie of her displaying her toned arms and legs.",
      "\u201cSummer recap: more travel, more lifting (because, 51 and gotta keep that muscle and bone up) more time with family and loved ones, more painting \u2026 more adventure, more joy,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Many of the comments on the post, which received nearly 68,000 likes, focused on her physique, but she doesn\u2019t quite get what the fuss is about.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was going to be that big of a deal. It really got picked up,\u201d she laughs. \u201cYeah, it was pretty funny to me.\u201d"

    "summary": "Former \"SNL\" star Kate McKinnon talks about her new book, \"Secrets of the Purple Pearl,\" and how being a \"weird\" kid helped inspire the \"Millicent Quibb\" series.",
    "story": [
      "In her words, Kate McKinnon was a \u201cweird\u201d kid.",
      "But it's precisely that peculiarity that has earned the former \"Saturday Night Live\" star two Emmy Awards, as well as roles in high-profile films like \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cGhostbusters,\u201d and, now, a bestselling children\u2019s book.",
      "\u201cI grew up reading and being inspired by quirky, female protagonists, particularly Pippi Longstocking, who I dressed up as to go to school,\u201d McKinnon says during a sit-down conversation with TODAY.com.",
      "While showing up to school in costume may not have earned her a lot of points in the popularity department, it did help lay the foundation for McKinnon's madcap adventure, \u201cThe Millicent Quibb School of Etiquette for Young Ladies of Mad Science.\u201d",
      "Released in 2024, the fantasy novel tells the eccentric tale of sisters Gertrude, Eugenia, and Dee-Dee Porch, outcasts in the persnickety town of Antiquarium, a place where residents are only allowed to own bichon fris\u00e9 dogs and all young women must attend etiquette school.",
      "Full of clever footnotes and detailed illustrations, the book became a New York Times bestseller and spawned the latest installment in the series, \"Secrets of the Purple Pearl,\" released on Sept. 30.",
      "\u201cThis genre is certainly my favorite literary genre because (of the) magic, fantasy, fun characters, but also it is the genre that deals most directly with questions of identity and coming into one\u2019s own discovering who you are, who you were born to be,\u201d she explains.",
      "According to McKinnon, all the characters in the \u201cMillicent Quibb\u201d series are based on her in one way or another, but the one  she sees herself in the most is the protagonist, Gertrude Porch.",
      "\u201cI definitely identify with her strong desire to help, her empathy, and, often, her plans to assist go awry because she tells weird jokes and she makes little weird comments and she\u2019s just odd and she can\u2019t really help it,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cSo often in my own life, the thing that seemed like, \u2018Oh, I can\u2019t do that, that\u2019s too much,\u2019 or, \u2018They\u2019ll think that\u2019s weird,\u2019 that ends up being the thing that people respond to the most. So, that\u2019s sort of the journey Gertrude is on. She\u2019s learning to trust that even though her thoughts are very out of the box, that\u2019s exactly what the world needs of her,\u201d says McKinnon.",
      "The daughter of a social worker and an architect, McKinnon grew up on Long Island and says that while her community was largely \u201cartsy,\u201d she, like Gertrude, still felt somewhat stifled.",
      "\u201cNo matter what community you grow up in, you get messages to tone it down, shave off the hard edges of who you are, fit yourself into a box,\u201d McKinnon says.",
      "The \u201cMillicent Quibb\u201d series is intentionally written for an older-elementary and middle-school-aged audience.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what people in this age group are learning how to deal with, and the question becomes, are you going to listen to that, and then spend a lifetime trying to figure out who you actually are? Or are you going to stay the course?\u201d",
      "\u2018I Took Apart VCRs to Look at Circuit Boards\u2019",
      "Much like her character, McKinnon decided to be true to herself, even if it meant not quite fitting in.",
      "\u201cI was so weird,\u201d says McKinnon. \u201cI had a little group of weird friends, and we loved science. We looked for aliens in the sky, and we ate honeysuckle in the schoolyard to try to figure out whether there was a correlation between the color of the honeysuckle and the sweetness of the nectar.",
      "I was so in love with the natural world as I was discovering it. And I was also lonely because I knew I was weird.",
      "Kate McKinnon",
      "\u201cI took apart VCRs to look at circuit boards. There was a ghost hunters club. I was so in love with the natural world as I was discovering it. And I was also lonely because I knew I was weird.\u201d",
      "What made her \u201cweird,\u201d however, also proved to be the catalyst for her success.",
      "While a student at Columbia University in 2006, McKinnon scored a role on the comedy series \u201cThe Big Gay Sketch Show,\u201d followed by a string of minor TV appearances, a trajectory that eventually led her to audition for \"SNL\" in 2012.",
      "After nabbing a coveted spot on the cast, McKinnon quickly rose through the ranks, becoming well-known for her celebrity impressions of Hillary Clinton, Martha Stewart, Ellen DeGeneres and others, eventually winning back-to-back Emmys in 2016 and 2017.",
      "After 11 seasons on the show, McKinnon stepped down, but not without leaving the world with a variety of memorable characters, including Colleen Rafferty (aka Ms. Rafferty), the raunchy, cigarette-smoking alien abductee in one of the show\u2019s most legendary sketches: \u201cClose Encounters.\u201d",
      "Since leaving, she returned to host the show in 2023 and again in 2025, resurrecting Ms. Rafferty for the \"SNL\" 50th anniversary special in February.",
      "\u201cI truly love people and connecting with a live audience is the greatest thing,\u201d she says.",
      "Introvert vs. Extrovert",
      "Between being an author and a performer, is there one McKinnon prefers over the other?",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a real introvert and so the lifestyle of just getting up and going to my computer by myself, it suits me very well. But I also love to collaborate with other funny people,\u201d she says.",
      "Currently, McKinnon is busy pickling the produce she grows on her farm, hanging out with a woodchuck in her yard that she\u2019s dubbed Bonnie and working on the third installment of \u201cMillicent Quibb,\u201d which is well underway.",
      "\u201cOne of the greatest dreams of my life would be to see the world that\u2019s in my head realized on a screen,\u201d she says.",
      "Are there plans for a movie?",
      "\u201cMake the phone call!\u201d she laughs."

      "\"We both have a sick sense of humor. And we love to throw dinner parties,\" Plaza adds. \u201cI think where we grew up, and we were both always in leadership roles. We have that in common.\u201d",
      "Plaza explains that while the pair met when they were in high school, they actually didn't go to the same school. Instead, they met in community theater at the Wilmington Drama League. Then, on the first day of college at New York University, they ran into each other at orientation.",
      "\"That was it. Dan was my only friend,\" Plaza says.",
      "While they stuck together, Murphy says it was the people around them who knew they would eventually become creative partners.",

      "\"We had written two Christmas stories, and we had ideas for more of the story, but we were like, 'Let's maybe take a break for a second and try a story with a little bit different tone,'\" Murphy says. \"So this witch is very different from our Christmas witch. She's little sillier and older.\"",

    "story": [
      "When it came to writing about his experience as a gay man going through Marine Corps boot camp, Greg Cope White cites wisdom from late legendary TV producer Norman Lear: \"Write the story you want to tell.\"",
      "The result was his 2015 memoir, \"The Pink Marine.\" White entered boot camp in 1979, when being gay in the military was illegal under United States law. The book opens with White at the end of his freshman year of college, learning that his best friend, Dale, was leaving the Air Force Academy for the Marine Corps, boot camp in Parris Island, South Carolina.",
      "\"I sat up. I liked boots. I loved the idea of summer camp,\" White writes. \"... I announced that I'd go with him.\"",
      "The new Netflix series \"Boots,\" which hit the platform Oct. 9, opens much the same way. Inspired by White's memoir, \"Boots\" follows Cameron Cope (Miles Heizer) as he joins friend Ray (Liam Oh) at boot camp.",
      "Like the memoir, the show chronicles the weekslong boot camp experience and the intense physical, emotional and mental development that comes with it. But from the jump, the TV adaptation \u2014 which was executive produced and in part written by White \u2014 has clear differences from the original work.",
      "First: the title.",
      "\"I love 'The Pink Marine.' I mean, I remember the second that that came to me. It's gorgeous,\" White tells TODAY.com. \"However, that's my story and my memoir. And so while it's a great title, our show is about an ensemble.\"",
      "Across the series' eight episodes, \"Boots\" gives a spotlight to different members of Cameron and Ray's group of recruits. Their camaraderie grows slowly from day one before culminating in \"The Crucible,\" one of the final tests of the recruits' fitness to join the U.S. Marine Corps.",
      "Some of those characters may feel familiar, White says.",
      "\"Look at all the characters that you may see a spark of from the book, but look what we built, look what we did in the writers room with these incredible backstories and characters,\" he says. \"We've created a show that everyone should find a way into, so we needed a title to represent that ensemble.\"",
      "\u2018I Owe Him the World\u2019",
      "After leaving the Marine Corps, White moved to New York to act and write. His credits in the entertainment industry include writing for the sitcoms \"Dream On\" and the \"All in the Family\" spinoff \"704 Hauser.\" He worked for Lear for more than a decade.",
      "\"Norman was always wanting to hear other stories,\" White tells TODAY.com. \"He knows his story. I know my story. We have to get those stories out of us so that other people can identify with, learn from, laugh at \u2014\u00a0all of that.\"",
      "Lear wrote a foreword for \"The Pink Marine,\" which first published in 2015, and wrote of White, \"I've known Greg Cope White for some thirty years, relied on him for ten, and have admired him every minute throughout.\"",
      "\u201cBoots\u201d represents one of Lear\u2019s last projects after his death in December 2023 at 101.",
      "\"Just even to be able to talk about him is something that little teenage me wouldn't believe I would be doing,\" White says now. \"So I owe him just the world.\"",
      "Lear is credited as an executive producer of \"Boots,\" alongside White, who also wrote one of the eight episodes.",
      "White says compared to writing the memoir, the making of the series felt like a perfectly synched group effort.",
      "\"It's so fun to think about it this way: I'm sitting there alone at my desk writing my book, wondering ... 'Is it good? Is anybody going to read it? Should I look for another job?'\" he recalls.",
      "\"Jump to this fantastic writers room ... and instead of just having my singular story, we get all those brains and all those minds and all those creatives that are going to build out this world so incredibly,\" he adds.",
      "\u2018Here\u2019s My Story\u2019",
      "Just like the title of the show is different from the memoir, so is the protagonist's name.",
      "\"Cameron Cope. Greg Cope. People are going to see similarities. People may want to find the differences. But he honors my story, Cameron does, as well as has his own version of what he's going through,\" White says.",
      "Cameron is brought to life by actor Miles Heizer, whose previous credits include \"13 Reasons Why\" and \"Parenthood.\"",
      "Heizer tells TODAY.com he didn't read White's book until after he booked the part.",
      "\"I had a very long audition process, and it's like, there's this part of you that's like, I don't want to get too invested,\" he says.",
      "Once he did book the role though, White was the first person he met in person from the production, Heizer says. After a few Zoom calls, the pair happened to end up on the same flight to New Orleans.",
      "\"He very graciously took my Chihuahua for me, because I have two dogs, and I wasn't allowed to fly with both of them,\" Heizer says.",
      "He also recalls their \"wonderful conversation\" about adapting White's story. He says White made it a point to say: \"This is Cameron's story. It doesn't need to be Greg's story.\"",
      "\"I think he allowed me a lot of comfort and freedom to be like, it's inspired by his experience. But if there's anything else I want to explore, he was more than open with that,\" Heizer says.",
      "\"I've never played a real person,\" he adds. \"So I was scared, but it's like, Greg's the coolest, easiest-going person. So it was very, very easy.\"",
      "Watching the show back, Heizer cites specific moments where his personality and humor comes through. In the trailer, Cameron and Ray debrief after an intense start to boot camp. After Ray reminds him that it's only day one, Heizer says, \"We've only been here for one day?\" before dramatically covering his mouth.",
      "\"Angus O' Brien, who plays Hicks in the show, we're like truly best, best friends,\" Heizer says. \"... He texted me, and he was like, I was just laughing because it was so you, like specifically you.\"",
      "There's a throughline between Cameron and Greg's story, White says.",
      "\"The angst of my fear of getting busted and caught and kicked out is throughout the story, through whichever version, and Cameron is going to live with that as well,\" White says.",
      "White says his message to Heizer after they first met was to make sure he didn't feel a need to attempt an impression. Still, he says, \"for lack of a better phrase, I'm trusting these people with my life.\"",
      "When White finally watched the final cut, knowing that it was locked and ready to broadcast, he says he got emotional.",
      "\"I'm a wet person. Norman always shared that there are two kinds of people, wet and dry, and he preferred wet because you might cut yourself on a dry person,\" White says. \"So even just trying to talk about it right now, I'm going to get emotional.",
      "\"To know that I had to serve in secret, yet, now here's my story out loud and proud. ... I'm just amazed that that's what has happened,\" he adds. \"I never thought I'd get to see that, ever.\"",
      "What Happens Next?",
      "\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8Warning: This section contains spoilers from the ending of Netflix's \"Boots.\"",
      "After boot camp, White served out a six-year commitment in the Marine Corps as an enlisted man, he writes at the end of \u201cThe Pink Marine.\u201d",
      "During that time, he went to Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune and Officer Candidates School and writes that he considered going to law school to serve in the Marine Judge Advocate General Corps.",
      "But the ending of the Season One sets up a different path for Cameron.",
      "While White entered boot camp in 1979, \"Boots\" takes place in 1990. Also, Season One notably ends with Cameron, Ray and the rest of the new Marines celebrating with karaoke. In the final moments of the show, as \"Under Pressure\" plays, a newscast playing on a TV over the bar reveals that Iraq had just invaded Kuwait. That event, which occurred in August 1990, marked the beginning of the Gulf War.",
      "\"Where the show goes, I hope the audience loves it as much as we do and likes it and thumbs ups it and shares it with friends,\" White says, \"so that we do get to come back and continue these stories and continue to follow these gorgeous lives that we've built so carefully in Season One.\""

      "In the release, Banks says that she\u2019s aware of people wondering if her invention is \u201cjust melted ice cream\u201d but that the question means she\u2019s \u201conto something.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd to clear things up? It\u2019s not,\u201d she said, adding that her team tried just melting her ice cream and a \u201cmultitude of other simple techniques,\u201d which didn\u2019t work.",
      "\u201cIt only worked when we got granular. And no, I won\u2019t tell you the recipe. But I will tell you it\u2019s damn good!\u201d Banks said \u2014 \u201cwith a smize\u201d \u2014 as the release noted.",
      "How Did She Come up With It?",
      "Banks says the product was the result of a year of \u201cmeticulous R&D,\u201d experimenting with temperature, texture and formulation of ice cream\u2019s bases, fats, sugars and stabilizers to create a dessert \u201cthat could be warmed without breaking down\u201d and maintained a \u201c\u2018melt-on-the-tongue\u2019 sensation.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt first, we tried just heating standard ice cream bases,\u201d Banks explained in the release. \u201cBut they turned sticky, gloopy, or too thin. The breakthrough came when we found the perfect viscosity \u2014 not too thick, not too thin \u2014 where hot ice cream still felt as dreamy as cold ice cream.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe result is a dessert that\u2019s scientifically sound yet sensorially magical \u2014 something between a scoop and a sip, familiar yet futuristic,\u201d she added.",
      "Banks Knows We\u2019re All Confused",
      "\u201cWhen something truly new hits, we often react with a little confusion,\u201d Banks said, comparing her invention\u2019s reception to the rollout of now-iconic desserts like salted caramel and bubble tea. \u201cThat\u2019s just human nature \u2014 we want to make sense of it, compare it to what we already know. I get it.\u201d",
      "\u201cFirst we question it, then we crave it. That\u2019s the natural rhythm of a lot of innovation. So yes, Hot Mama makes some people tilt their heads \u2014 and that\u2019s exactly where the magic starts,\u201d Banks continued.",
      "\u201cPeople think ice cream can only live in one temperature \u2014 cold. But I\u2019ve spent years studying how ice cream behaves, how it churns, how it melts, how it releases flavor \u2014 and Hot Mama flips that entire idea,\u201d she added. \u201cWhen we get the hot recipe just right, it blooms. The creaminess isn\u2019t too heavy. The flavor sings. This isn\u2019t melted ice cream \u2014 it\u2019s reimagined ice cream.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "As Constance Marie approached her 60th birthday, she had an idea to celebrate the major life milestone.",
      "The actor \u2014 known for her roles in \u201cGeorge Lopez,\u201d \u201cAmerican Family,\u201d \u201cSelena\u201d and \u201cWith Love\u201d \u2014 didn\u2019t want to throw just any party. She wanted to reclaim and learn more about her Mexican culture, while at the same time uplifting her Latino community and raising money for organizations important to her.",
      "That\u2019s when she decided to throw a sesenta\u00f1era, a take on the popular coming-of-age quincea\u00f1era party thrown for young women who turn 15.",
      "Celebrated much like a Sweet Sixteen throughout Latin America and the U.S., a quincea\u00f1era marks a 15-year-old girl\u2019s passage from girlhood to womanhood. In Marie\u2019s case, she multiplied it by four to embrace entering a new decade in her life.",
      "\u201cI had never been to a quincea\u00f1era. Nobody in my family has ever been to one. Nobody in my family has ever had one,\u201d Marie tells TODAY.com. \u201cEver since we did an episode on the \u2018George Lopez\u2019 show where my character throws a quincea\u00f1era for my (on-screen) daughter Masiela, I thought, \u2018Oh, my God, this is the coolest thing! I didn\u2019t know we could do this!\u2019 My family didn\u2019t come from any money or means, so we didn\u2019t even think about it.\u201d",
      "Marie says she can trace her family back to 1853 when they were living in New Mexico. However, throughout generations, she felt like much of their history and culture was stripped away. She, as well as her mother, didn\u2019t grow up speaking Spanish.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t cross the border. The border crossed us,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd along those generations, so many of the cultural touchstones, like Spanish and the traditions, were quietly stolen or robbed from us because we had to assimilate.\u201d",
      "Her work as an actor, she says, has given her the opportunity to celebrate her culture, and review and learn those cultural touchstones that she never grew up with. But she still feels like she has much to absorb.",
      "For her sesenta\u00f1era, she says she spent \u201chours and hours\u201d on YouTube learning about quincea\u00f1era traditions, including wearing an elegant formal dress, the crowning and shoe ceremony to symbolize entering womanhood, and a special dance. Marie didn\u2019t grow up \u201ccrazy religious,\u201d she says, so she didn\u2019t incorporate the Catholic mass and blessings.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m 60 years old. I have survived so much and I can make this what I want it to be,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I took what worked for me.\u201d",
      "Marie began documenting the preparation for her sesenta\u00f1era on Instagram, including going dress shopping at Rosy\u2019s Bridal in Los Angeles. She says the shop had just experienced an immigration raid by ICE, and she wanted to support the business in the aftermath. Her followers also saw her pick out her heels and accessories, as well as getting ready for her Sept. 26 party and snippets from the main event.",
      "When it came time for her big reveal, she donned an elegant red dress, inspired by Disney\u2019s first ever Latina princess, Elena of Avalor. Marie happened to voice the character of Do\u00f1a Paloma in the animated series.",
      "\u201cI just remember being at Disneyland and seeing \u2014 oh, it\u2019s going to make me cry \u2014 seeing a Latina princess and her red beautiful dress. And I thought, \u2018Oh, my God, I have to honor this,\u2019\u201d she says, adding that the color\u2019s brightness and boldness gave her confidence.",
      "She then changed into sneakers and a black dress for her \u201cbaile sorpresa,\u201d or surprise dance, which included participation of friends and fellow actors Gina Torres, Lisa Vidal, Angelique Cabral and Diana Maria Riva.",
      "Also included in her festivities was a \u201cbeautiful speech\u201d given by her 16-year-old daughter, Luna. \u201cI was so taken aback by that,\u201d Marie reflects. \u201cSixteen is hard for a young girl, especially with mothers and daughters, but I had to work so hard to not ugly cry and embarrass her because it just made me realize, \u2018Oh, my gosh, she does see me, and I am having a positive impact on her even in these difficult years.\u2019 So that was just so incredibly rewarding.\u201d",
      "There was also a heartwarming moment where Marie had her \u201cshowbiz children\u201d on the dance floor with her.",
      "\u201cI just wanted to celebrate them as well, because they are the future of our representation,\u201d she says. She adds that after 40 years in the entertainment community, \u201cI\u2019ve gotten so much feedback from everyone saying, \u2018I grew up with you. Your role as a mother inspired me, or your role as a deaf mother inspired my mother to learn sign language.\u2019 It\u2019s just so amazing the impact that we can have.\u201d",
      "She says her on-screen kids (which included Francia Raisa, Emeraude Toubia, Masiela Lusha and others) from her past projects are not only \u201ctalented and so wonderful,\u201d they\u2019ve truly taught her and made her a better actor and performer.",
      "Among other stand-out moments from the party included a performance by the all-female Mariachi Santa Monica group that sang Selena Quintanilla songs, food catered by La Nena Cantina, Don Julio tequila and a custom-made Loteria card of Marie in her red gown by Viridiana Osio.",
      "While the party aspect of it was a delight, Marie says she wanted to go one step further. She decided to raise awareness and funds for the organizations This Is About Humanity and Immigrant Defenders Law Center. Both nonprofits work together to raise money for immigrant communities who need help, including shelter, legal assistance, food and more.",
      "\u201cI just thought, \u2018OK, if I\u2019m going to do this, I\u2019m going to do this for something that\u2019s bigger than me,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cThese two organizations, I have worked with over the years and they are truly angels. They truly do make an impact on so many levels, for our community and for the undocumented immigrants.\u201d",
      "The sesenta\u00f1era was a night to remember, and one that made Marie reflect on the importance of celebrating one\u2019s Latinidad. She also stresses the fact that it\u2019s never too late to discover more about your heritage and ancestry.",
      "\u201cI say to any other women out there: Go have your special day, no matter what it looks like. Quincea\u00f1era, bat mitzvah \u2014 they should have older bat mitzvahs. Why not?\u201d she says. \u201cYou didn\u2019t get your day? Celebrate, reclaim! If it\u2019s your flower ceremony or whatever, I just think we have to be courageous enough to hope right now, and celebrate and uplift. That\u2019s what I was trying to do, and I really, truly urge anybody else to do the same thing.\u201d"

      "Below, writer and director Ben Leonberg breaks down what happens to Todd and Indy in the end \u2014 and why, in his mind, it's not a sad ending.",
      "What happens to Todd and Indy at the end of 'Good Boy'?",
      "Turns out there's a lot going on in this house beyond the haunting Indy senses. Todd is dying of an undisclosed illness \u2014 and Indy can't stop it from happening.",
      "As the movie goes on, Todd gets progressively sicker. Eventually, Todd is dragged down by the entity. \u201cYou\u2019re a good dog, but you can\u2019t save me,\u201d Todd says before he dies.",
      "The scenario mimics what we learned happened to Todd's grandfather, who also died of a similar disease. Indy has been seeing the apparition of Bandit, Todd's grandfather's dog who appeared to starve to death in the house.",
      "Indy, meanwhile, has life after Todd's death. He's left in the care of Todd's sister, Vera \u2014 a better fate than Bandit's.",
      "The ending might strike many as emotionally devastating, especially after watching Indy go through so much within a span of 70 minutes. But writer and director Leonberg says he and co-writer Alex Cannon don't see see the movie's conclusion as sad.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t see that the film is necessarily like a sad ending, especially for Indy,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cOur film is a bit of an inverse of the typical way that animals in human lives are part of how we learn about more mortality. A lot of us learn about death and dying from pets. I think the film kind of inverts that, and imagines \u2014 what is that experience like, if it\u2019s on the other shoe or paw, so to speak,\u201d Leonberg continues.",
      "Wait, is the house actually haunted?",
      "Indy has sensed, and cowered from, a presence. But is the house actually haunted, or is Indy just responding to the feeling of impending death?",
      "Leonberg says the answer is yes \u2014 to both. \u201cI think horror really works when there is an ambiguity between two things,\u201d Leonberg explains.",
      "Like \u201cThe Shining,\u201d he says the ending\u2019s interpretation can be up to the viewer.",
      "\u201cYou could make an argument there\u2019s nothing supernatural. (The Shining\u2019s) just a story of an alcoholic father trying to murder his family, or there\u2019s a haunted house and he\u2019s becoming possessed,\u201d Leonberg says.",
      "\u201cThe ambiguity between those two things is ultimately what\u2019s so interesting. So I think both of the scenarios you laid out are correct,\" he says."

      "The other is the ABBA ballad \u201cThe Winner Takes It All,\u201d Sherrill\u2019s powerful solo at the end of the show.",

      "It changed her perspective from focusing on how well she technically sang the song to ensuring that it connected with audience instead.",

      "The Israeli government approved the first part of the peace plan to end the conflict in Gaza, after a brutal two-year war that has ravaged the Palestinian enclave and sparked a global outcry, the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said early on Friday local time.",
      "\u201cThe government has just now approved the framework for the release of all of the hostages \u2014 the living and the deceased,\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s office said in a statement posted on X.",
      "Under the terms of the deal, the ceasefire should take effect within 24 hours.",
      "President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he plans to travel to Egypt for an official signing of the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas and that hostages will be released \u201con Monday or Tuesday.\u201d",
      "Trump's announcement on Wednesday that Israel and Hamas have agreed to the first phase of a ceasefire deal was widely welcomed Thursday by world leaders, the families of hostages and Palestinians who have endured more than two years of war.",
      "But huge questions remain about whether Trump's 20-point plan can successfully resolve the long-term future of the Gaza Strip, with uncertainty over its directive for Hamas to disband, as well as the governance of the shattered enclave.",
      "A spokesperson for Netanyahu's office said Thursday that a ceasefire would take effect 24 hours after the Cabinet had agreed on the deal and hostages would be released after 72 hours.",
      "Separately, the United States military is preparing options to deploy as many as 200 U.S. troops to Israel to support stabilization in Gaza and the flow of humanitarian aid and security assistance into the enclave, two U.S. officials familiar with the planning said.",
      "The U.S. troops will stay in Israel, where they will support logistics, transportation, engineering and planning, the officials said.",
      "\u201cThey will not be in Gaza. No U.S. boots on the ground in Gaza,\u201d one of the officials said.",
      "While the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas appeared imminent, explosions were seen and heard in southern Gaza on Thursday morning.",
      "Trump said Wednesday on social media that the sides had taken the \"first steps toward a strong, durable, and everlasting peace,\" calling it \"a GREAT Day for the Arab and Muslim World, Israel, all surrounding nations, and the United States of America.\"",
      "Among those to welcome the announcement was United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, who urged \"all concerned to abide fully by the terms of the agreement\" and described it as a \"momentous opportunity\" to recognize \"the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people.\"",
      "Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas \"praised the great efforts made by President Trump and all mediators to reach this agreement.\"",
      "Netanyahu said he had \"a very moving and warm conversation\" with Trump in which they \"congratulated each other on the historic achievement of signing the agreement to release all the hostages,\" his office said in a statement.",
      "\"If indeed this deal can hold, it'll bring in an era of peace that we haven't seen now in the Middle East for several years, ever since that terrible attack on Oct. 7,\" Col. Steve Warren, former principal deputy chief of public affairs at the Pentagon, told NBC News on Wednesday.",
      "The plan could come with a political cost for Netanyahu inside Israel. Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel\u2019s far-right national security minister, said Thursday on X that his party will \u201cbring down the government\u201d unless Hamas is \u201cdismantled.\u201d",
      "Celebrations and cautious optimism",
      "The announcement came after indirect talks involving Israel, Hamas and Steve Witkoff, U.S. ambassador at large, and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.",
      "Trump announced the breakthrough one day after the second  anniversary of the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack on Israel, in which 1,200 were killed and another 250 were kidnapped, and the start of Israel's war on Gaza in which more than 67,000 people \u2014 mostly women and children \u2014 have been killed, according to local health officials.",
      "While many governments defended Israel's initial right to respond to the attack, the scale of civilian death and suffering wrought by its war have drawn increasing international condemnation and isolation for the Jewish state. Last month, the United Kingdom became the latest Western nation to recognize Palestine as a state, joining a majority of countries that now do so worldwide.",
      "Much of Gaza is now a rubble-strewn wasteland, with most of its buildings damaged or destroyed, according to the U.N. And the world's leading body on hunger, Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, has declared that a famine is now playing out inside the cramped territory.",
      "Israel's military operation has been deemed a genocide by a U.N. commission of inquiry, the world-leading International Association of Genocide Scholars, and human rights groups such as Amnesty International. Israel denies the charge, saying it is only attempting to destroy Hamas, which it blames for putting Palestinians in harm's way.",
      "After news arrived that the first ceasefire phase had been agreed to, some Palestinians on the ground inside Gaza were celebrating \u2014 cheering, dancing and singing, video showed.",
      "The first phase of Trump's deal would see the return of the remaining 48 hostages, around 20 of whom are believed to be alive, while the Israeli military said it was poised to withdraw from Gaza to an agreed-upon line.",
      "Trump told reporters that while the administration knows where most of the hostages believed to be alive are, finding the bodies of deceased hostages could be a \u201cbigger problem.\u201d",
      "An international force tasked with finding missing hostages in the Gaza Strip will be established as part of the ceasefire and hostage release deal, Israeli broadcaster i24 reported, citing Israeli officials.",
      "There were celebrations in \"Hostages Square\" in Tel Aviv early Thursday, the culmination of two years in which families and friends of the remaining captives have angrily campaigned for their government to prioritize their loved ones over the continuation of the conflict.",
      "They could be heard in video chanting \"Nobel prize to Trump\" \u2014 a reference to Trump's long-standing ambition to win the Nobel Peace Prize, which is being announced Friday.",
      "The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents the families of Israeli hostages, said its members were feeling \"a mix of excitement, anticipation, and concern\" at the news. It expressed its \"profound gratitude to President Trump and his team for the leadership and determination that led to this historic breakthrough: an end to the war and a comprehensive agreement to return all the hostages.\"",
      "Ruby Chen, father of hostage Itay Chen, a U.S.-Israeli dual citizen, said on \"Stay Tuned NOW\" that while he shared this cautious hope, the captors had not \u201cprovided any sign of life\" for his son.",
      "Lasting agreement unclear",
      "While Hamas has agreed to participate in the hostage and prisoner exchange, it has not said it will disarm and disband \u2014 a key stipulation of Trump's proposal.",
      "A senior Hamas official, Osama Hamdan, said in an interview with Al Jazeera on Thursday that no Palestinians would surrender their weapons, though he did not explain whether that was the group\u2019s official position.",
      "Prominent Palestinian prisoner Marwan Barghouti, whose supporters dub the \u201cPalestinian Nelson Mandela,\u201d will not be released as part of a ceasefire agreement, Israeli government spokeswoman Shosh Bedrosian told reporters Thursday.",
      "The first phase also does not address Gaza's medium and long-term future. Trump's plan says the enclave should be temporarily governed by a \"technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee\" overseen by a \"Board of Peace\" led by Trump and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. That is until the Palestinian Authority, the chief political organ in the region, can be \"reformed.\"",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said it was moving to \"adjusted deployment lines soon\" but warned that parts of Gaza were \"still considered a dangerous combat zone\" and that its troops were \"deployed and operating anywhere in the Strip.\"",
      "Israel shattered the previous ceasefire \u2014 which lasted from Jan. 19 to March 18 \u2014 by launching a barrage of deadly airstrikes that killed hundreds of Palestinians across the Gaza Strip, ending two months of relative calm and plunging Gaza into a renewed humanitarian crisis.",
      "Israel blamed Hamas for the resumption of hostilities, citing the militant group\u2019s refusal to meet Israel\u2019s demand to release more hostages."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s personal touch \u2014 both as a heavy hand and a gentle guide \u2014 played a pivotal role at key moments in the development of a Middle East peace deal that promises to bring an end to Israel\u2019s two-year war in Gaza, current and former officials in the United States and other nations told NBC News.",
      "Trump announced on Wednesday that the \u201cfirst phase\u201d of the plan to end the conflict in Gaza had been agreed to, with a pause in fighting and the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners.",
      "Trump called it \u201ca great deal\u201d in a brief interview with NBC News on Thursday morning. \u201cEverybody is happy,\u201d he said.",
      "The deal accelerated over several crucial moments \u2014 Israel\u2019s strike on Qatar, discussions on the sidelines of the recent United Nations General Assembly in New York City and Jared Kushner\u2019s conversations with his father-in-law, these sources said.",
      "Also helpful, though, was an old-fashioned deadline. In recent weeks, Trump told advisers he wanted to announce a deal by Oct. 7, the second anniversary of the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel that precipitated the war, according to two people familiar with his instructions.",
      "The president, one of the people said, was fixated on the date both for its symbolic significance and because he saw it as a way to herald a new step forward in Israel\u2019s relationship with Saudi Arabia when Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman visits Washington next month.",
      "This account of the Trump administration\u2019s role in the ceasefire deal is based on interviews with a dozen sources in three countries.",
      "As the war in Gaza ground on \u2014 with more than 67,000 dead, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, declarations of famine and images of wounded children across social media \u2014 it threatened Trump\u2019s vision for a more interconnected Middle East that he began to implement in his first term with the Abraham Accords, which established relationships between Israel and several Arab nations.",
      "The war\u2019s intensity also presented an opportunity for Trump to coalesce regional powers around a peace plan to disarm Hamas, preclude Israel from seizing the West Bank and provide for the redevelopment of Gaza.",
      "Israel and Hamas agreed Wednesday to the first phase of that proposal \u2014 a ceasefire and an Israeli military pullback to a \u201cyellow line\u201d within Gaza that leaves more of the strip under the control of Palestinians. That is to be followed by Hamas\u2019 returning as many as 20 Israeli hostages and the remains of as many as 28 hostages and Israel\u2019s releasing nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and the remains of 15 dead Gazans.",
      "Trump was able to announce the pact just one day after his target.",
      "To do that, Trump had to maintain the trust of Israel and of a series of Arab- and Muslim-majority nations that could influence Hamas and Palestinian civilians. At the same time, he had to apply pressure. His ability to walk that tightrope was tested repeatedly.",
      "And, at times, the darkest hours yielded the biggest breakthroughs.",
      "Qatar strikes",
      "After months of negotiations with no result, a turning point came in September in the form of a surprise attack.",
      "Israeli forces launched airstrikes on the Qatari capital, Doha, in an attempt to kill the leaders of Hamas. Six people were killed, including a member of Qatar\u2019s internal security force.",
      "Over the course of the war, Israel has struck in Iran, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen, in addition to Gaza.",
      "But this was different. Qatar is a U.S. ally that hosts a strategic air base with 10,000 American troops. Trump and his team had come to view the Persian Gulf nation as a trusted partner in the negotiations between Israel and Hamas. The parents of an Israeli hostage had been in Doha that very morning, meeting Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani.",
      "The bombing blindsided and angered the White House, as well as the Arab world.",
      "Asked about the strikes at the time, Trump told reporters: \u201cI was very unhappy about it. Very unhappy about every aspect.\u201d",
      "But instead of killing the prospect of a deal, the Israeli attack prompted Trump and his team to ratchet up pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to bring the war to an end.",
      "\u201cIt was the moment that Trump said, \u2018Enough,\u2019\u201d said a former Israeli official, adding: \u201cThis deal, almost identical, has been on the table for over a year now. Netanyahu didn\u2019t want to do it, but Trump left him no choice.\u201d",
      "\u201cBoth Netanyahu and Hamas tried to say \u2018yes, but\u2019 to stall, but Trump decided to hear only \u2018yes\u2019 and pushed them into the corner,\u201d the former official said.",
      "Shortly after the strikes, Trump issued a warning to Israel: He would not support the annexation of the West Bank, as some far-right members of Netanyahu\u2019s Cabinet had proposed.",
      "The Americans, the Qataris and other Arab governments saw the surprise strikes as an opportunity to exert leverage, according to an Arab official and former Israeli officials with knowledge of the diplomatic talks.",
      "\u201cIt was a catalyst to bring pressure on the Israeli government, which had been the main obstacle to a deal,\u201d the Arab official said.",
      "U.N. General Assembly sidelines",
      "Weeks after the strikes on Doha, the U.N. General Assembly met along the bank of the East River in New York City.",
      "It was on the sidelines \u2014 where, historically, deals are often solidified with face-to-face interactions and handshakes \u2014 that the discussions \u201creally took a turn,\u201d Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday during a Cabinet meeting at the White House.",
      "Trump convened a meeting at the General Assembly with Arab- and Muslim-majority nations to sell his 20-point peace plan. Rubio said that is where Trump \u201ccreated this coalition\u201d before he presented the proposal to Netanyahu at the White House at the end of last month.",
      "Crucially, during that visit, Trump persuaded Netanyahu to call Al-Thani, the Qatari prime minister, to apologize for the Israeli strikes in Qatar. That allowed Qatar to remain engaged as a key intermediary in peace talks.",
      "\u201cIt is my understanding that the Qatari government viewed the apology as a way to move forward, and it saw its role, that it had invested in for quite a long time, as still vital to achieving a ceasefire and hopefully peace in the future,\u201d Nawaf Al-Thani, a former Qatari defense attach\u00e9 to the United States, told NBC News.",
      "Trump\u2019s handling of that episode was reminiscent for many observers of the way he reacted to Israel\u2019s and Iran\u2019s striking each other during a ceasefire agreement following American bombing raids on Iranian nuclear facilities in June.",
      "\u201cWe basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don\u2019t know what the f--- they\u2019re doing,\u201d Trump, clearly frustrated, said at the time. His rebuke of Israel, along with Iran, reassured Arab countries with ties to Shia-majority Iran. In that way, a former senior White House official said, Trump\u2019s messages to Israel after its strikes in Iran and in Qatar were similar.",
      "\u201cBoth showed the president\u2019s commitment to Israel, but also his commitment to the Arab countries,\u201d the former official said.",
      "Seeing the United States pushing Israel over the strike in Doha helped persuade Qatar, Turkey and other Arab governments to press Hamas, making it clear that the time for delays and foot-dragging was over, the officials said.",
      "As the negotiations advanced, both the U.S. and Arab negotiators chose to convey a united and optimistic front, placing Netanyahu at risk of potentially insulting Trump if he questioned the 20-point proposal Trump put on the table, the former Israeli official said.",
      "\u201cThe Trump people and Arab world just briefed total confidence and optimism before anything was finalized to make it seem like a done deal, which made saying \u2018no\u2019 a public affront to Trump, and Netanyahu can\u2019t do that,\u201d the former official said. \u201cIt was a show of very effective statecraft and use of leverage.\u201d",
      "Kushner\u2019s role",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law, became his chief envoy to the Middle East. There he was delivering a speech at the opening of the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem. There he was building relationships with Arab leaders, focusing on economic relations.",
      "Years later, Kushner became deeply involved in the negotiations between Israel and Hamas. He emerged, former Israeli officials said, because he carries important influence with regional governments and the president.",
      "\u201cKushner was the architect,\u201d a former Israeli official said.",
      "Kushner was able to convey to Trump that the conflict in Gaza threatened the future of his biggest diplomatic success the last time he was in office \u2014 the Abraham Accords.",
      "That deal produced peace agreements between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco. Trump has aimed to extend it to normalize relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel.",
      "\u201cThe entire legacy was in jeopardy,\u201d the former Israeli official said.",
      "Kushner and Trump\u2019s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, traveled to Egypt on Tuesday to hammer out details of the deal, according to senior U.S. officials.",
      "They went over various aspects of the proposal, including how Israeli military forces would be redeployed and the order of hostage and prisoner releases, the officials said, with one adding that an important feature of their work was the decision to \u201cseparate the peace deal into two clear phases.\u201d That allowed for an agreement on the exchange of people, while the deal\u2019s other points are negotiated in a second phase.",
      "The U.S. negotiators called Trump on Wednesday evening to get his final guidance before he announced that a deal was in place, the officials said. Israel\u2019s government approved the exchange Thursday evening.",
      "\u201cIt came together quick in a good way,\u201d Witkoff told NBC News in a brief telephone interview Thursday morning as he waited to board a flight to Israel.",
      "Kushner and Witkoff had about \u201cfive hours of sleep in the last three days,\u201d senior U.S. officials said.",
      "American negotiators expect the next phase to be \u201calmost a permanent ceasefire until all the other issues we have to deal with are negotiated and considered,\u201d one of the officials said, pointing to outstanding topics as thorny as how Gaza will be governed.",
      "U.S. officials cautioned Thursday that there is still a lot of work to do to ensure the ceasefire holds and the rest of the plans can be finalized and implemented.",
      "\u201cThis is a very delicate time,\u201d one of them said.",
      "Trump said he plans to travel to Egypt to put his signature on the Middle East agreement in the coming days.",
      "And the U.S. military is preparing options to deploy as many as 200 U.S. troops to Israel to support the International Stabilization Force for the long-term internal security solution for Gaza and to support the flow of humanitarian aid and security assistance into Gaza, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the planning.",
      "\u201cThey will not be in Gaza. No U.S. boots on the ground in Gaza,\u201d one of the officials said.",
      "The effort will be called the Civil-Military Coordination Cell, and U.S. troops could begin arriving in Israel immediately, the officials said.",
      "In addition to supporting moving aid and assistance into Gaza, they are expected to support the deconfliction mechanism between the two sides \u2014 basically making sure that both sides are upholding their part of the security agreements.",
      "\u201cI think right now,\u201d a senior U.S. official said, \u201cwe\u2019re just focused on making sure any gaps are patched up in the agreement.\u201d",
      "Trump allies say the agreement between Israel and Hamas, forged under immense pressure on both sides \u2014 including Trump\u2019s broad support for Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, the limits he placed on Netanyahu and a threat to let Israel destroy Hamas if it did not agree to the pact \u2014 is a testament to the validity of his peace-through-strength approach to foreign policy.",
      "\u201cHe understands that sometimes you have to use force to set the structure for peace,\u201d former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., who is close to Trump, said in an interview last week."

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Despite being headlined by a genuine star and staged at one of London\u2019s premier theaters, a play about the foundation of a sprawling and troubled public service seemed unlikely to provoke night after night of standing ovations.",
      "But that\u2019s what happened with \u201cNye,\u201d an unlikely hit about the creator, and origin story, of Britain\u2019s taxpayer-funded National Health Service.",
      "The play, written by Tim Price and directed by Rufus Norris, came at an inflection point for the NHS, as it\u2019s known. Almost 80 years after it was founded, the medical service once touted as the envy of the world is \u201cbroken\u201d and suffering the \u201cbiggest crisis in its history,\u201d the government says. The crisis at this national bedrock is part of a bigger malaise at the heart of British culture: rising prices, stagnant wages and crumbling public services.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m terrified, not just for the NHS, but for the whole of our society,\u201d Michael Sheen, who starred as Aneurin \u201cNye\u201d Bevan, the founder of the NHS, told NBC News in an interview. \u201cOnce it\u2019s torn down, then I guess people will think about what they\u2019ve lost.\u201d",
      "Sheen, 56, better known to international audiences as Tony Blair in \u201cThe Queen,\u201d David Frost in \u201cFrost/Nixon\u201d and the angel Aziraphale in the Amazon Prime series \u201cGood Omens,\u201d has spent much of the last two years honing his portrayal of Bevan, the socialist politician who dragged himself out of Wales\u2019 coal mines to will the NHS into existence.",
      "Though second nature to Brits, the ideal of the NHS is unfamiliar to many Americans: British people have universally free health care at the point of access \u2014 from ambulances attending car accidents to insulin for diabetes to cancer care to childbirth. Though some people do have private insurance, the idea of having to choose between illness and financial ruin is shocking in the U.K.",
      "Now, the Labour Party, which created the then-radical NHS in 1948, is battling its own economic constraints and record-setting unpopularity. It has a colossal task if it is to fix the crumbling hospitals replete with overworked doctors and bed-lined corridors.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer must turn around a behemoth whose budget of 200 billion English pounds ($269 billion) represents some 40% of all government spending, and whose 1.4 million employees are the world\u2019s seventh-largest workforce. In the United States, only the Department of Defense, Walmart and Amazon employ more people.",
      "Through all this, the core NHS ideal endures. Everyone in the U.K. has a story of a relative, or themselves, receiving the type of world-class care that puts a terrifying financial strain on millions of Americans. (In the past six years, this reporter\u2019s mother has had a single mastectomy and reconstruction, as well as three titanium plates in a shattered ankle, without having to pay a pound for the care.)",
      "But just as common are the tales of maddening, hourslong waits in overstretched emergency rooms, or weeklong delays just to see a community general practitioner. Many critics blame the sprawling crisis on years of underfunding by the now-ousted Conservative government of 2010-24, whose response to the 2008 financial crisis was to make drastic cuts to public services.",
      "It\u2019s perhaps unsurprising that a largely liberal London-theatergoing audience responded with applause and tears at the hagiography of Bevan at the National Theater. Though relatively unknown in wider society, admirers see Bevan as a founding father of modern Britain; his ideal of the NHS today is not just popular, it defines the country itself.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s far from perfect,\u201d said Alison Ferris, 40, a nurse at a hospital in Canterbury, in southeast England. \u201cBut I do the best that I can for anyone that comes in front of me. I treat every patient like I would treat my loved ones.\u201d",
      "Though the concept remains revered, public satisfaction in the NHS in practice cratered to 52% in 2023 from a high of 70% in 2010, according to the King\u2019s Fund, a top think tank tracking British health care.",
      "\u201cWe have to fight for the NHS, the same as the NHS was fought for when it was created,\u201d said Ferris\u2019 mother, Caroline Heggie, 70, a hospital union representative, who like her daughter had come to see the last night of \u201cNye\u201d at the National Theater last month. \u201cWe can\u2019t go the way of privatization, we can\u2019t go the way of America. That\u2019s what we\u2019re up against.\u201d",
      "Like Bevan, Sheen is a Welsh firebrand unafraid to wear his leftist politics. But he also lived for 14 years in Los Angeles, so knows too well what life is like without socialized health care.",
      "\u201cThe idea of this health care system that we have here, just seemed so alien to them over there,\u201d Sheen, who now lives back in his Welsh hometown of Port Talbot, says of his former American hosts. He says that \u201cseeing people go into hospitals with serious injuries or illnesses, and being asked to produce their checkbook before they can be treated\u201d would shock most Britons.",
      "The crisis at the NHS coincides with an uptick in hostility toward immigrants \u2014 even though they are often people\u2019s doctors, nurses and hospital cleaners. Almost 20% of NHS staff have a non-British nationality, with Indians, Filipinos, Nigerians, Irish and Poles making up most of their number.",
      "Nigel Farage, the leader of the hard-right Reform U.K. party and an ally and friend of President Donald Trump, is leading some polls to become Britain\u2019s next prime minister. He has become the first prospective leader to question the funding model of using taxes to fund the NHS \u2014 historically taboo.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work \u2014 it\u2019s not working,\u201d Farage told NBC News\u2019 British partner Sky News in May. \u201cWe\u2019re getting worse bang for the buck than any other country, particularly out of those European neighbors.\u201d",
      "Opposing Farage\u2019s proposal, however, leaves open the specter of privatization, which many say has been creeping up even before the Health and Social Care Act 2012 opened up the NHS to bids from private contractors.",
      "Farage isn\u2019t the only person dissatisfied. Indeed, the NHS has slipped from being a world leader on many metrics.",
      "\u201cCorridor care\u201d is now a year-round crisis, and the number of people waiting 12 hours or more to be admitted into an emergency room rose from 47 in summer 2015 to 74,150 this summer. Targets have lagged for years in everything from ambulance attendance times to cancer diagnoses. Meanwhile, a 7 million-strong waiting list means many people feel abandoned for months, in pain, before getting hip or knee replacement and other types of surgery.",
      "There is ample evidence to suggest that economic austerity policies imposed during 14 years of Conservative Party rule are at least partly to blame, according to Max Warner, a senior research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a London research group.",
      "\u201cIt is true that a lot of NHS performance measures over the 2010s were broadly getting worse, having started off relatively well,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s worth saying that productivity did grow, so it\u2019s a nuanced picture and causality is difficult.\u201d",
      "The Conservatives argued that they kept NHS spending up, protecting it from the brutal cuts that crushed almost every other government department at the time. But this 2% yearly growth still fell well short of the 3.8% yearly average since the 1980s, and, according to critics, was insufficient to cope with an aging population and the rising prices of cutting-edge drugs.",
      "Far from the envy of the world, Britain has been scrimping by spending 37 billion pounds ($53 billion) on the health services each year, well below Germany, France and Australia, a landmark review found last year.",
      "The current Labour government has outlined plans to raise spending to around 3% \u2014 an improvement but still short of what many advocates had hoped. At his annual Labour Party conference this week, Starmer announced that a digital overhaul named NHS Online would launch in 2027, describing it as \u201ca new chapter in the story of our NHS.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, whatever the model, cash is key, according to Roy Lilley, who ran an NHS hospital in the 1990s as chairman of Homewood NHS Trust in Surrey, west of London.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how you pay for your health care,\u201d said Lilley, today a consultant whose newsletter hits 300,000 inboxes. \u201cWhether you take it out of your pocket marked \u2018insurance,\u2019 or you take it out of your pocket marked \u2018taxes,\u2019 it\u2019s still your trousers.\u201d",
      "He remains optimistic, however, pointing to some waiting metrics improving and a general recovery from the hammerblow of the pandemic, which drained resources and mentally scarred doctors.",
      "Still, Sheen \u2014 never shy to mix acting with activism \u2014 believes it\u2019s no coincidence that the NHS is in crisis just when its origin story begins to vanish from living memory.",
      "\u201cThe crisis that we seem to be experiencing makes it all the more important to go back to the beginning and to look at what was behind the founding of the NHS, and what the principles were,\u201d he said. \u201cIt becomes incredibly important to tell the story of it and to remind people of what it was actually like, so that we don\u2019t forget.\u201d"

      "The humble soybean is the latest flashpoint in the Trump administration\u2019s campaign to reshape global trade.",
      "Used in everything from animal feed to fuel, soybeans regularly rank among the most valuable U.S. agricultural exports, towering over higher-profile crops like corn and cotton.",
      "More than $30 billion worth of American soybean products were exported in fiscal year 2024, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "For American soybean farmers, their top overseas market has long been China, which bought around a third of the export crop \u2014 approximately $12 billion worth of American soybean products \u2014 in the last calendar year, USDA data shows.",
      "But not anymore.",
      "As President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war leaves U.S.-China relations somewhere between frosty and openly hostile, America\u2019s soybean farmers appear to be an early casualty.",
      "An embargo in all but name",
      "So far, China has not purchased any U.S. soybeans during this year\u2019s main harvest period, with sales falling to zero in May.",
      "This has pushed many American farmers reliant on soybeans nearly to the breaking point.",
      "It has also complicated the Trump administration\u2019s plans to provide billions in foreign economic aid to Argentina.",
      "Buenos Aires recently sold more than 2.5 million metric tons of soybeans to Beijing, after briefly suspending its export tax on the soy products.",
      "U.S. officials blame China for the looming crisis facing American soybean producers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate the Chinese leadership has decided to use the American farmers, soybean farmers in particular, as a hostage or pawn in the trade negotiations,\u201d Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Thursday on CNBC.",
      "Farmers view the situation differently, however. They want Trump to reach a trade deal with China that ends the unofficial embargo on soybeans. But instead, what they see is the White House preparing to bail out one of their chief rivals for the Chinese export market.",
      "\u201cThe frustration is overwhelming,\u201d American Soybean Association President Caleb Ragland said in a recent statement.",
      "Meanwhile, China \u2014 the world\u2019s biggest buyer of soybeans \u2014indicated last week that it won\u2019t resume U.S. purchases unless more Trump tariffs are lifted.",
      "\u201cAs for soybean trade, the U.S. side should take proactive steps to remove relevant unreasonable tariffs, create conditions for expanding bilateral trade, and inject more stability and certainty into global economic development,\u201d Commerce Ministry spokesperson He Yadong told reporters in Beijing.",
      "Emergency relief is coming",
      "The Trump administration will announce new support for farmers, \u201cespecially the soybean farmers,\u201d on Tuesday, Bessent said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re also going to be working with the Farm Credit Bureau to make sure that the farmers have what they need for the next planting season,\u201d he added.",
      "Bessent personally owns as much as $25 million worth of farmland in North Dakota that produces corn and soybeans, according to his recent financial disclosures.",
      "He said soybeans would be a topic of discussion at the upcoming meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum later this month.",
      "Trump is also aware of the impact his trade policies are having on American farmers, starting with soybean growers.",
      "\u201cThe Soybean Farmers of our Country are being hurt because China is, for \u2018negotiating\u2019 reasons only, not buying,\u201d the president posted Wednesday on Truth Social.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve made so much money on Tariffs, that we are going to take a small portion of that money, and help our Farmers,\u201d Trump added.",
      "The question is whether this aid will come soon enough to save this year\u2019s massive harvest of soybeans.",
      "At the center of the firestorm is Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, who warned this week that \u201cthis moment of uncertainty in the farm economy is real.\u201d Speaking on Fox Business Network, she emphasized that Trump has long supported U.S. farmers.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump and Secretary Rollins are always in touch about the needs of our farmers, who played a crucial role in the President\u2019s November victory,\u201d the White House said in a statement Thursday. \u201cHe has made clear his intention to use tariff revenue to help our agricultural sector, but no final decisions on the contours of this plan have been made.\u201d",
      "The Argentina factor",
      "The current U.S.-China stalemate over soybean exports is also complicating another American foreign policy conundrum: what to do about Argentina\u2019s faltering economy.",
      "As U.S. soybean exports to China screech to a halt, Argentina\u2019s farmers jumped at the opportunity to sell China their own soybeans.",
      "From their perspective, a potential U.S. economic aid package has nothing to do with their soybean exports, and everything to do with the personal and political alliance between Trump and libertarian President Javier Milei.",
      "Milei was the first foreign leader to visit Trump after his 2024 election victory, and he has become a familiar face at U.S. political events attended by the president\u2019s MAGA supporters.",
      "At a Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington, D.C. in February, Milei gifted then-Department of Government Efficiency chief Elon Musk a red chainsaw.",
      "Musk then waved it around onstage, calling it \u201cthe chainsaw for bureaucracy.\u201d",
      "Eight months later, Milei\u2019s popularity with voters has plunged, raising doubts about the future of his market-friendly economic reforms and strict austerity measures.",
      "Local elections in early September dealt a blow to Milei\u2019s party, triggering massive turmoil in Argentina\u2019s stock and currency markets.",
      "A few weeks after the market plunge, Bessent announced on social media that the U.S. was prepared to deploy billions of dollars to support the South American country.",
      "A presidential delegation from Buenos Aires is expected to visit the White House next week to finalize the U.S. foreign aid deal.",
      "This has infuriated the soybean farmers.",
      "\u201cU.S. soybean prices are falling, harvest is underway, and farmers read headlines not about securing a trade agreement with China, but that the U.S. government is extending $20 billion in economic support to Argentina while that country drops its soybean export taxes to sell 20 shiploads of Argentine soybeans to China in just two days,\u201d Ragland said.",
      "Meanwhile, Milei has also secured a currency swap line for Argentina from China, a situation that gives pause to some in Washington.",
      "In response, Milei has said Argentina will maintain its mutually beneficial trade and economic relationship with China.",
      "Tensions inside the Trump administration over China, Argentina and the soybean farmers broke into the open last week.",
      "While attending the U.N. General Assembly, Bessent received a text message from a contact labeled \u201cBR.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe bailed out Argentina yesterday \u2026 and in return, the Argentine\u2019s removed their export tariff on grains, reducing their price, and sold a bunch of soybeans to China at a time when we would normally be selling to China,\u201d read the message, widely presumed to come from Rollins.",
      "\u201cSoy prices are dropping further because of it. This gives China more leverage on us,\u201d the message concluded.",
      "Spokespeople for Bessent and Rollins did not respond to questions about the text message exchange."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump likes to enumerate the peace deals he says he forged \u2014 seven at last count.",
      "But two that have eluded him potentially mean the most to his legacy and his dogged pursuit of the Nobel Peace Prize.",
      "The first is the Russia-Ukraine war, which is no closer to ending now than when Trump took office in January. The other is Israel\u2019s conflict with Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Here, he may have just achieved a breakthrough.",
      "Up against a Sunday deadline that Trump had set, Hamas said Friday that it would meet a major condition that the president laid out in his 20-point plan for the war\u2019s end: releasing all the hostages, living or dead. Hamas\u2019 caveat was that \u201cthe field conditions for the exchange are met.\u201d",
      "Hamas also said it was prepared to enter into negotiations and turn over administrative control of Gaza to a Palestinian body of technocrats.",
      "Trump had been waiting on an answer from Hamas since Monday, when he released his peace plan at the White House alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He took Hamas\u2019 announcement as a good sign.",
      "\u201cBased on the Statement just issued by Hamas, I believe they are ready for a lasting PEACE,\u201d he wrote on his social media site. \u201cIsrael must immediately stop the bombing of Gaza, so that we can get the Hostages out safely and quickly!\u201d",
      "Ruby Chen, a hostage family member and a leading advocate, told NBC News: \u201cIt\u2019s a positive \u2014 we have cautious optimism. We know the president cares a lot about the hostages, so let\u2019s hope this is our time.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not done. There are still a lot of missing pieces, but it\u2019s positive,\u201d he added.",
      "Trump posted a video on Truth Social on Friday night in response to Hamas\u2019 announcement, saying: \u201cThis is a big day. We\u2019ll see how it all turns out. We have to get the final word down in concrete.\u201d",
      "The Middle East is a part of the world where conflict seems eternal, peace sporadic. Since President Harry Truman recognized the Jewish state in 1948, many presidents have tried to usher in peaceful relations between Israel and its Arab neighbors, only to see conflict erupt again and again.",
      "Like Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and others before him, Trump is working to negotiate an accord among longtime combatants \u2014 an effort that dovetails with the White House\u2019s public campaign to get him the Nobel Peace Prize.",
      "\u201cIf not now, when?\u201d said Richard Goldberg, who served on the National Security Council staff in Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "Even some of Trump\u2019s detractors said that Hamas\u2019 new position could be an encouraging step toward ending the war.",
      "\u201cLike the rest of the world, I\u2019m hoping this news means imminent return of the hostages and action addressing the Gaza humanitarian crisis, along with a ceasefire and path to peace and normalizing relations in the region,\u201d Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told NBC News.",
      "Some were more skeptical, questioning whether Hamas can be trusted to follow through on its commitments.",
      "Brian Katulis, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute think tank, said, \u201cI\u2019d be a bit more cautious given that Hamas is a terrorist organization with a track record of saying one thing and doing another.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis may be the beginning of the end, but there is still more work to do,\u201d said a former Western diplomat with experience in the Middle East. \u201cHamas has not accepted key elements of the plan nor the timeframe for hostage releases. Trump\u2019s call on Israel to halt strikes will call Hamas\u2019 bluff over the coming days. It\u2019s now up to Hamas. We either see hostages coming out this week or the war will restart.\u201d",
      "A European diplomat who has been closely engaged in the process said the situation remained extremely urgent: \u201cGet the hostages home. Worry about the details next.\u201d",
      "The diplomat acknowledged that as with any deal of this kind, the details and terms need to be worked out as the process moves forward.",
      "Even if Trump succeeds where his predecessors failed and creates conditions for Palestinians and Israelis to live together peacefully, a Nobel Peace Prize would still be a long shot.",
      "Lawmakers from both parties have criticized the Trump administration for launching deadly attacks on alleged foreign drug boats. Though he has embraced the title \u201cPresident of Peace,\u201d Trump just rebranded the Defense Department as the \u201cDepartment of War.\u201d",
      "The prize is awarded each year by five appointees of Norway\u2019s parliament. During Trump\u2019s first term, one member of parliament, Christian Tybring-Gjedde, was at the hairdresser waiting for his wife when his cellphone rang.",

      "\u201cWhen Hamas confirms, the Ceasefire will be IMMEDIATELY effective,\u201d he said on Truth Social."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that ongoing negotiations between Hamas and Israel are not yet the end of the war and that setting up a group to govern Gaza would take \u201csome time,\u201d but emphasized that there was a plan to do so.",
      "It comes as Israel and Hamas appear to be inching closer to implementing a 20-point peace plan proposed by President Donald Trump.",
      "Asked by moderator Kristen Welker whether the peace negotiations mark the end of the war in Gaza, Rubio said, \u201cNot yet.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s some work that remains to be done,\u201d he said, pointing to ongoing meetings to determine the logistics of implementing a peace plan.",
      "\u201cEveryone has agreed, including Israel, that eventually, at some point here as this process plays out, Gaza will be governed by a Palestinian technocratic group that\u2019s not Hamas, that are not terrorists, with the help and the assistance and the guidance of an international consortium like the board of peace,\u201d Rubio said, echoing the language of the proposed peace plan.",
      "At the same time, Rubio said, \u201cYou can\u2019t set up a governance structure in Gaza that\u2019s not Hamas in three days.\u201d",
      "\u201cI mean, it takes some time,\u201d he said.",
      "The peace plan stipulates that Gaza would \u201cbe governed under the temporary transitional governance of a technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee.\u201d The plan also provides that Hamas, which currently governs Gaza, would not have any role in governing in the future.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly backed the peace plan, which includes the release of all Israeli hostages by Hamas, during a visit to the White House last week.",
      "Hamas has expressed a willingness to release all hostages, alive or dead, and plans to send a team on Sunday to Cairo, where more in-depth negotiations are slated to begin on Monday. Trump administration special envoy Steve Witkoff and the president\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner plan to attend on behalf of the U.S.",
      "The parties now need to determine, first, how hostages are released, and, second, how to create new Palestinian leadership.",
      "\u201cHow do you create this Palestinian technocratic leadership that\u2019s not Hamas, that\u2019s not terrorists, and with the help of the international community?\u201d Rubio said, laying out ongoing issues. \u201cHow do you disarm any sort of terrorist groups that are going to be building tunnels and conducting attacks against Israel?\u201d",
      "There are ongoing talks to determine logistically how hostages could be released, he said.",
      "\u201cYou have to make sure the Red Cross can get there, what time they\u2019re going to be there, where they\u2019re going to be,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cAll that has to be worked through.\u201d",
      "Asked whether hostages could be released as early as this week, Rubio said, \u201cWe want it to be as soon as possible.\u201d",
      "Trump has said that Israel agreed to withdraw to an initial line cutting through Gaza in order for the hostage deal to move forward. The initial withdrawal line, marked by a yellow line in a graphic posted by Trump, would withdraw the Israeli military to the outskirts of several major cities.",
      "Before Israel withdraws further, Rubio noted that the parties had to determine who would take control of the territory.",
      "\u201cWhen we ask Israel, \u2018OK, you\u2019re at the yellow line, now everything behind it you have to turn it over,\u2019 You have to have somebody to turn it over to,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cSo, I mean, let\u2019s be realistic here. You can\u2019t just set up a sort of new governance structure inside of Gaza in 72 hours.\u201d"

      "LONDON \u2014 An Israeli minister has clashed with the U.K.\u2019s leading Jewish organizations after lauding a leader of the English far right and inviting him to visit the country.",
      "Tommy Robinson, a convicted fraudster with a violent criminal record who is well known for inspiring rallies of mostly white, mostly male followers shouting soccer-style chants against Islam and immigration, accepted the invitation from Amichai Chikli, Israel\u2019s minister for the diaspora and combating antisemitism.",
      "Chikli called Robinson \u2014 whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon \u2014 a \u201ccourageous leader on the front line against radical Islam.\u201d",
      "Writing on X Friday, Chilki said he would be \u201cproud to host\u201d Robinson \u201con behalf of the State of Israel,\u201d saying the British activist would visit in mid-October.",
      "The Jewish Leadership Council (JLC), which represents the largest Jewish organizations in the United Kingdom, and the Board of Deputies, called Robinson a \u201cthug\u201d who \u201crepresents the very worst of Britain,\u201d and criticized the invitation in the wake of a deadly terrorist attack at a synagogue in Manchester.",
      "\u201cIn our darkest hour,\u201d both groups posted on X Saturday, Chikli has \u201cignored the views of the vast majority of British Jews, who utterly and consistently reject Robinson and everything he stands for.\u201d",
      "There has been a rise in anti-Jewish hostility in Britain, predating the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza that started two years ago, according to community groups and the people suffering the firsthand effects in the United Kingdom.",
      "Robinson\u2019s invitation to Israel \u201cundermines those genuinely working to tackle Islamist extremism and foster community cohesion,\u201d the two groups added. \u201cMinister Chikli has proven himself to be a Diaspora Minister in name only.\u201d",
      "Chikli, who has clashed repeatedly with Jewish groups abroad, said the Board of Deputies had \u201cregrettably, become first and foremost a political organization \u2014 openly aligned with left-wing, woke, pro-Palestinian parties.\u201d",
      "The Board of Deputies says it is committed to fighting antisemitism, tackling extremism and standing for security in Israel and the Middle East.",
      "Neither Israel\u2019s prime minister\u2019s office nor the Ministry for Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism immediately responded to NBC News\u2019 request for comment.",
      "Robinson said he had accepted the invitation and that he would travel to Israel \u201cimmediately following my October 13th trial.\u201d",
      "The 42-year-old recently served an 18-month jail sentence for contempt of court, a charge stemming from a libelous video in which he falsely claimed a Syrian refugee teenager was a violent thug.",
      "Elon Musk called for Robinson to be freed while he was imprisoned, and has since thrown his support behind the activist, most recently at far-right rally in London where the billionaire entrepreneur appeared by video link and railed against \u201cuncontrolled immigration.\u201d",
      "Robinson was first jailed in 2005 for assaulting an off-duty police officer and ordered to do community service in 2011 for leading a brawl involving more than 100 soccer fans. He was imprisoned again in 2013 for traveling to the United States on another person\u2019s passport, then again a year later for mortgage fraud.",
      "Robinson, who took his pseudonym from a soccer hooligan, was also given a five-year stalking protection order in October 2021 after he shouted abuse outside the home of a journalist, having learned she was planning a story about him.",
      "During that time, he co-founded the English Defence League, or EDL, which rose out of a disparate network of far-right groups and whose virulently Islamophobic views were praised by Norwegian mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik, who killed 77 people in Norway\u2019s worst peacetime atrocity in July 2011 and has frequently made Nazi salutes when attending court.",
      "In 2023, organizers of a march against antisemitism in London demanded that the far-right leader Stephen Yaxley-Lennon stay away from their demonstration."

      "Leo, the first U.S. pope, told thousands of pilgrims celebrating Mass in St. Peter\u2019s Square that immigrants should not be treated with \u201cthe coldness of indifference or the stigma of discrimination.\u201d",

      "'New missionary age'",
      "Leo had criticized the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies on September 30, questioning whether they were in line with the Catholic Church\u2019s pro-life teachings, in comments that drew heated backlash from some prominent conservative Catholics.",
      "On Sunday, the pope said the global Church was experiencing \u201ca new missionary age\u201d in which it was tasked with offering \u201chospitality and welcome, compassion and solidarity\u201d to migrants fleeing violence or searching for a safe place to live.",
      "\u201cIn the communities of ancient Christian tradition, such as those of the West, the presence of many brothers and sisters from the world\u2019s South should be welcomed as an opportunity, through an exchange that renews the face of the Church,\u201d he said.",
      "Elected in May to replace the late Pope Francis, Leo has shown a much more reserved style than his predecessor, who frequently criticized the Trump administration and often spoke in surprise, off-the-cuff remarks.",
      "Leo spoke on Sunday from a prepared text. He was addressing a weekend event during the Catholic Church\u2019s ongoing holy year that was specially organised for migrants, which the Vatican said had attracted more than 10,000 pilgrims from some 95 countries."
