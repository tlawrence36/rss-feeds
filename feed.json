      "LOS ANGELES -- Netflix's first attempt at handling a live sports event did not receive a passing grade.",
      "The fight Friday night between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul experienced streaming problems according to many viewers on social media. Many viewers took to Twitter/X and Bluesky to express their frustrations with streaming and buffering problems before and during the fight.",
      "According to the website Down Detector, nearly 85,000 viewers logged problems with outages or streaming leading up to the fight.",
      "The bout was scheduled for eight two-minute rounds, as opposed to the normal three minutes and 10 or 12 rounds for most pro fights.",
      "Paul won the fight by unanimous decision.",
      "Netflix representatives had no comment via e-mails to The Associated Press on the streaming problems viewers experienced leading up to or during the fight.",
      "Netflix said Saturday that the bout was watched by a worldwide audience of 60 million and peaked at 65 million concurrent streams. It said nearly 50 million households were turned in for the co-main event between Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano in which Taylor kept her undisputed super lightweight championship with another disputed decision. Netflix said it would provide additional viewership information, including total viewers, this coming week.",
      "The bout between the YouTuber-turned-boxer Paul, and Tyson, 58-year-old former heavyweight champion, from AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, was Netflix's biggest live sports event to date, and an opportunity to make sure it can handle audience demand with the NFL and WWE on the horizon. It streamed globally to Netflix\u2019s 280 million subscribers at no additional cost.",
      "Netflix will broadcast two NFL games on Christmas Day and will begin streaming WWE \u201cRaw\u201d on Jan. 6.",
      "The streaming delays weren't the only problems Netflix experienced leading up to the fight.",
      "Viewers saw Tyson's bare butt in only a jockstrap when he walked away at the end of a pre-fight interview in his locker room.",
      "For some reason, Netflix chose to make light of the faux pas.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Many of Hollywood\u2019s biggest stars are set to gather in Los Angeles Sunday night for the annual Governors Awards.",
      "The event, put on by the film academy\u2019s board of governors, is honoring the late Quincy Jones, James Bond producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, filmmaker Richard Curtis and casting director Juliet Taylor. It's also a de-facto campaign stop for Oscar hopefuls as awards season gets underway.",
      "Broccoli and her brother Wilson are following in her father\u2019s footsteps receiving the rarely given Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award, celebrating the work of producers. Albert \u201cCubby\u201d Broccoli accepted his own trophy (then a bust of Thalberg) at the 1982 Academy Awards as they looked on from the audience.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very humbling,\u201d Broccoli told The Associated Press. \u201cI think of so many people who have come before us, so many people I wish had been given the honor who aren\u2019t with us anymore.\u201d",
      "Curtis, a writer and director known for his contributions to romantic comedies like \u201cLove, Actually,\u201d \u201cNotting Hill\u201d and \u201cFour Weddings and a Funeral\u201d is being recognized for a lifetime of charitable work with the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award.

Starting with films released in 2025, the film academy will give a new competitive Oscar to casting directors.",
      "The Governors Awards are often an emotional affair. With no television cameras or band there to play you off during a speech, it\u2019s a night where friends and colleagues get to pay tribute to that year\u2019s honorary Oscar recipients, many of whom are later in life. But this 15th event took on an added sadness when Jones earlier this month. There are still plans to honor Jones on Sunday with a tribute to his life, work and legacy."

      "Walk into any supermarket and you can usually buy a banana for less than $1",
      "NEW YORK -- Walk into any supermarket and you can generally buy a banana for less than $1. But a banana duct-taped to a wall? That might sell for more than $1 million at an upcoming auction at Sotheby\u2019s in New York.",
      "The yellow banana fixed to the white wall with silver duct tape is a work entitled \u201cComedian,\u201d by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan. It first debuted in 2019 as an edition of three fruits at the Art Basel Miami Beach fair, where it became a much-discussed sensation.",
      "Was it a prank? A commentary on the state of the art world? Another artist took the banana off the wall and ate it. A backup banana was brought in. Selfie-seeking crowds became so thick, \u201cComedian\u201d was withdrawn from view, but three editions of it sold for between $120,000 and $150,000, according to Perrotin gallery.",
      "Now, the conceptual artwork has an estimated value of between $1 million and $1.5 million at Sotheby's auction on Nov. 20. Sotheby's head of contemporary art, David Galperin, calls it profound and provocative.",
      "\u201cWhat Cattelan is really doing is turning a mirror to the contemporary art world and asking questions, provoking thought about how we ascribe value to artworks, what we define as an artwork,\" Galperin said.",
      "Bidders won't be buying the same fruit that was on display in Miami. Those bananas are long gone. Sotheby\u2019s says the fruit always was meant to be replaced regularly, along with the tape.",
      "\u201cWhat you buy when you buy Cattelan\u2019s \u2018Comedian\u2019 is not the banana itself, but a certificate of authenticity that grants the owner the permission and authority to reproduce this banana and duct tape on their wall as an original artwork by Maurizio Cattelan,\u201d Galperin said.",
      "The very title of the piece suggests Cattelan himself likely didn't intend for it to be taken seriously. But Chlo\u00e9 Cooper Jones, an assistant professor at the Columbia University School of the Arts, said it is worth thinking about the context.",
      "Cattelan premiered the work at an art fair, visited by well-off art collectors, where \u201cComedian\u201d was sure to get a lot of attention on social media. That might mean the art constituted a dare, of sorts, to the collectors to invest in something absurd, she said.",
      "If \u201cComedian\u201d is just a tool for understanding the insular, capitalist, art-collecting world, Cooper Jones said, \u201cit\u2019s not that interesting of an idea.\u201d",
      "But she thinks it might go beyond poking fun at rich people.",
      "Cattelan is often thought of a \u201ctrickster artist,\u201d she said. \u201cBut his work is often at the intersection of the sort of humor and the deeply macabre. He\u2019s quite often looking at ways of provoking us, not just for the sake of provocation, but to ask us to look into some of the sort of darkest parts of history and of ourselves.\u201d",
      "And there is a dark side to the banana, a fruit with a history entangled with imperialism, labor exploitation and corporate power.",
      "\u201cIt would be hard to come up with a better, simple symbol of global trade and all of its exploitations than the banana,\u201d Cooper Jones said. If \u201cComedian\u201d is about making people think about their moral complicity in the production of objects they take for granted, then it's \u201cat least a more useful tool or it\u2019s at least an additional sort of place to go in terms of the questions that this work could be asking,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cComedian\u201d hits the block around the same time that Sotheby's is also auctioning one of the famed paintings in the \u201cWater Lilies\u201d series by the French impressionist Claude Monet, with an expected value of around $60 million.",
      "When asked to compare Cattelan's banana to a classic like Monet's \u201cNymph\u00e9as,\" Galperin says impressionism was not considered art when the movement began.",
      "\u201cNo important, profound, meaningful artwork of the past 100 years or 200 years, or our history for that matter, did not provoke some kind of discomfort when it was first unveiled,\u201d Galperin said.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s not because I\u2019m a woman, but perhaps they did not like my politics,\u201d Goldberg continued. \"But that\u2019s OK because you know what?

      "The 18-carat Tiffany & Co. watch was given by three women survivors to Capt. Arthur Rostron for diverting his passenger ship, the RMS Carpathia, to save them and others after the Titanic struck an iceberg and sank in the north Atlantic on its maiden voyage in 1912.",

      "Head, winner of the 11th season of NBC's \u201cThe Voice\u201d in 2016, was leaning into his vehicle to grab his .22 caliber pistol when it fell out of its holster and onto the exterior of the vehicle and fired off a shot that hit Head in the stomach, his agent, Trey Newman said in an email.",

      "Prosecutors say Sean \u2018Diddy\u2019 Combs has tried to reach out to prospective witnesses and influence public opinion from jail in a bid to affect potential jurors for his upcoming sex trafficking trial",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Sean \u2018Diddy\u2019 Combs has tried to reach out to prospective witnesses and influence public opinion from jail in a bid to affect potential jurors for his upcoming sex trafficking trial, prosecutors claimed in a court filing urging a judge to reject his latest bail request.",
      "The government accusations were made in a Manhattan federal court filing late Friday that opposes the music mogul\u2019s latest $50 million bail proposal. A bail hearing is scheduled for next week.",
      "Prosecutors wrote that a review of recorded jail calls made by Combs shows he has asked family members to reach out to potential victims and witnesses and has urged them to create \u201cnarratives\u201d to influence the jury pool. They say he also has encouraged marketing strategies to sway public opinion.",
      "\u201cThe defendant has shown repeatedly \u2014 even while in custody \u2014 that he will flagrantly and repeatedly flout rules in order to improperly impact the outcome of his case. The defendant has shown, in other words, that he cannot be trusted to abide by rules or conditions,\u201d prosecutors wrote in a submission that contained redactions.",
      "Prosecutors wrote that it could be inferred from his behavior that Combs wants to blackmail victims and witnesses into silence or into providing testimony helpful to his defense.",
      "Lawyers for Combs did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Prosecutors said Combs, 55, began breaking rules almost as soon as he was detained at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn after his September arrest.",
      "He has pleaded not guilty to charges that he coerced and abused women for years with the aid of a network of associates and employees, while silencing victims through blackmail and violence, including kidnapping, arson and physical beatings.",
      "Two judges have concluded he is a danger to the community and a risk to flee.",
      "His lawyers recently made a third request for bail after the rejection of two previous attempts, including a $50 million bail proposal.",
      "In the request, they cited changed circumstances, including new evidence, which they said made it sensible to release Combs so he can better prepare for his May 5 trial.",
      "But prosecutors said defense lawyers created their latest bail proposal using some evidence prosecutors turned over to them and the new material was already known to defense lawyers when they made previous bail applications.",
      "In their submission to a judge, prosecutors said Combs' behavior in jail shows he must remain locked up.",
      "For instance, they said, Combs has enlisted family members to plan and carry out a social media campaign around his birthday \u201cwith the intention of influencing the potential jury in this criminal proceeding.\u201d",
      "He encouraged his children to post a video to their social media accounts showing them gathered to celebrate his birthday, they said.",
      "Afterward, he monitored the analytics, including audience engagement, from the jail and \u201cexplicitly discussed with his family how to ensure that the video had his desired effect on potential jury members in this case,\" they said.",
      "The government also alleged Combs during other calls made clear his intention to anonymously publish information that he thought would help his defense against the charges.",
      "\u201cThe defendant\u2019s efforts to obstruct the integrity of this proceeding also includes relentless efforts to contact potential witnesses, including victims of his abuse who could provide powerful testimony against him,\u201d prosecutors wrote."

    "story": [
      "The big budget, star-driven action comedy \u201cRed One\u201d is topping the North American box office charts",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Moviegoers were not exactly feeling the Christmas spirit this weekend, or at least not based on their attendance at \u201cRed One\u201d showings.",
      "The big budget, star-driven action comedy with Dwayne Johnson and Chris Evans sold $34.1 million in tickets in its first weekend in theaters, according to studio estimates Sunday. It easily topped a box office populated mostly by holdovers.",
      "For traditional studios, a $34.1 million debut against a $200 million-plus production budget would be a clear indication of a flop. Some even peg the budget closer to $250 million. But \u201cRed One\u201d is an Amazon MGM Studios release with the luxury of playing the long game rather than relying solely on global box office where Johnson tentpoles often overperform. The film may have a life on Prime Video for years to come.",
      "\u201cRed One,\u201d in which Johnson plays Santa\u2019s bodyguard, was originally built to go straight-to-streaming. It was greenlit prior to Amazon's acquisition of MGM. One interpretation of its lifecycle is that the theatrical earnings are not only just a bonus, but an additive gesture toward struggling theaters looking for a consistent stream of new films.",
      "\u201cAmazon has 250 million plus worldwide subscribers to the platform. It\u2019s similar to the way Netflix, I think, looks at stuff for their platform,\u201d said Kevin Wilson, head of distribution for Amazon MGM Studios. \u201cThere\u2019s a there\u2019s a massive value for a movie like this in terms of how many eyeballs you\u2019re going to get.\u201d",
      "The first major studio holiday release since 2018, \u201cRed One\u201d opened on 4,032 screens, including IMAX and other large formats, on an otherwise quiet weekend for major releases.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really happy with the results,\" Wilson said. \u201cI think when you look at the theatrical marketplace that's sometimes unforgiving, especially for original films, this is a good result for us.\u201d",
      "Since 2020, only seven films that weren't sequels or based on another piece of intellectual property have opened over $30 million (including \u201cOppenheimer\u201d and \u201cNope.\u201d)",
      "Warner Bros. is handling the overseas release, where it has made an estimated $50 million in two weekends from 75 territories and 14,783 screens.",
      "Still, it\u2019s certainly not a theatrical hit in North America. Even \u201cJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux\u201d made slightly more in its first weekend. \u201cRed One,\u201d directed by Jake Kasdan and produced by Johnson\u2019s Seven Bucks, was roundly rejected by critics, with a dismal 33% Rotten Tomatoes score. Jake Coyle, in his review for The Associated Press, wrote that it \u201cfeels like an unwanted high-priced Christmas present.\u201d",
      "Audiences were kinder than they were to \u201cJoker 2,\u201d giving it an A- CinemaScore, suggesting, perhaps, that the idea of it becoming a perennial holiday favorite is not so off-base.",
      "\u201cRed One\u201d is also overperforming in the middle of the country, Wilson said, and perhaps will have a nice holdover over Thanksgiving as a different option to the behemoths on the way.",
      "Sony's \u201cVenom: The Last Dance\u201d added $7.4 million this weekend's box office to take second place, bringing its domestic total to $127.6 million. Globally, its total stands at $436.1 million.",
      "Lionsgate's \u201cThe Best Christmas Pageant Ever\u201d landed in third with $5.4 million. That much more modestly budgeted Christmas movie has already nearly doubled its $10 million production budget in two weeks. Fourth place went to A24\u2019s Hugh Grant horror \u201cHeretic,\u201d with $5.2 million, bumping its total gross to $20.4 million.",
      "Universal and DreamWorks Animation\u2019s \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d rounded out the top five in its eighth weekend in theaters with an additional $4.3 million. The animated film surpassed $300 million worldwide.",
      "This weekend is a bit of a stopover before the Thanksgiving tentpoles arrive. Next week, \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cGladiator II\u201d face off in theaters with \u201cMoana 2\u201d, which also stars Johnson, sailing in the Wednesday before the holiday.",
      "\u201cGladiator II\u201d also got a bit of a head start internationally, where it opened in 63 markets this weekend to gross $87 million. That's a record for filmmaker Ridley Scott and for an R-rated international release from Paramount. It opens in the U.S. and Canada on Nov. 22.",
      "Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore, said that the \u201cRed One\u201d is helping set into motion a momentum leading into the Thanksgiving corridor.",
      "The upcoming releases, he said, \u201cwill finally bring some excitement to what has been a somewhat quiet post-Labor Day moviegoing marketplace.\u201d",
      "Dergarabedian added that it could be \u201cone of the biggest revenue generating Thanksgiving periods in box office history.\u201d",
      "Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore:",

      "Jake Paul believes he can fight for a championship belt within two years",
      "ARLINGTON, Texas -- Jake Paul believes he can fight for a championship belt within two years.",
      "Mike Tyson might be finished in the ring after the 58-year-old former heavyweight champion's first sanctioned pro bout since 2005.",
      "An event hyped like a prize fight turned into a glorified sparring session, the eight-round bout won by Paul in a lopsided unanimous decision at the home of the NFL's Dallas Cowboys on Friday night.",
      "There will continue to be questions for Paul over when he will fight a contender in his prime, as opposed to aging former champs, mixed martial artists or journeymen boxers.",
      "The 27-year-old YouTuber-turned-boxer's answers have been consistent, and now he has a timeline.",
      "\u201cI think it could happen in the next 24 months,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI truly, truly believe in my skills and my ability and my power. And the cruiserweight division is seemingly open for the taking on that timeline.\u201d",
      "Tyson, whose last fight before retiring was a loss to Kevin McBride 19 years ago, said he was confident in taking on Paul because of an entertaining exhibition against Roy Jones Jr. in front of no fans during the pandemic in 2020.",
      "A shorter fight (instead of 10 or 12 rounds) with shorter rounds (two minutes instead of three) and heavier gloves fell far short of entertaining.",
      "The International Boxing Hall of Famer came at Paul hard in the opening seconds, and briefly again to start the second round. Otherwise, he mostly let Paul come to him, and Paul said he thought Tyson was too fatigued to be a threat beyond the third round.",
      "Still, Tyson wouldn't say immediately afterward it was his last fight after the officially recorded loss dropped his record to 50-7 with 44 knockouts.",
      "\u201cIt depends on the situation,\u201d Tyson said before suggesting a fight with Paul's older brother, Logan Paul, who was standing near him in the ring.",
      "\u201cI'll kill you, Mike,\u201d Logan Paul shot back, using an expletive for emphasis.",
      "But Tyson said he had gone in the ring \u201cone last time\u201d in a social media post Saturday that provided details about the health scare he faced that forced the postponement from the fight's original date this summer.",
      "\u201cI almost died in June,\u201d Tyson wrote on X. \u201cHad 8 blood transfusions. Lost half my blood and 25lbs in hospital and had to fight to get healthy to fight so I won.\u201d",
      "There's no question the younger Paul will be back in the ring. The former social media influencer started boxing about 4 1/2 years ago and has always said he wants to be a championship fighter.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a very good fighter,\u201d said Tyson, the undisputed heavyweight champ from 1987-90, after Paul won 80-72 on one judge's scorecard and 79-73 on the other two.",
      "Paul still has plenty to prove, though. He is 11-1 with seven knockouts, the only loss to Tommy Fury, the less-accomplished brother of former heavyweight champion Tyson Fury.",
      "The former Disney Channel star has proven he can create hype for just about any fight.",
      "The first live sports event on Netflix was viewed in 60 million households, the streaming company said Saturday. Netflix said further details on viewership would be available next week.",
      "According to reports, Paul\u2019s payday was $40 million, compared with $20 million for Tyson. Paul mentioned his number during a promotional event over the summer.",
      "Organizers estimated the AT&T Stadium crowd at 72,000, and it appeared to be a legitimate number.",
      "\u201cThere may never be another moment like this in boxing, but I believe we can find something,\u201d Paul said. \u201cAnd I think there are a few names out there that make sense, that the events will be just as big.\u201d",
      "In the days before his fight with Tyson, Paul mentioned super middleweight champion Canelo Alvarez, considered one of the best boxers in the world.",
      "An opponent of that magnitude is probably at least several fights away for Paul, and it might not be long before age becomes an issue for the 34-year-old Alvarez.",
      "Paul's camp will never question its ability to put on a show.",
      "\u201cBoxing is ebbs and flows, ups and downs, big events, small events, medium-size events,\u201d said Nakisa Bidarian, Paul's promoter. \u201cOur philosophy is it\u2019s not about what is the decision that happens in the ring. It\u2019s about the attitude that you have and the product you create and how you entertain the fans. And there\u2019s no more entertaining of an athlete than Jake Paul.\u201d",

And it is amplified by a number of inventive samples \u2014 like Frankie Ruiz's \u201cT\u00fa Con \u00c9l\u201d \u2014 and all-star collaborators: Pharrell Williams, Bad Bunny and Feid among them.",
      "Alejandro's created a kind of character for the release, whom he calls \u201cRa\u00fal Alejandro,\u201d a nod to his father and the early migration of Puerto Ricans to New York, which he explored in an interview conducted in Spanish and English ahead of the 2024 Latin Grammys. It has been translated and edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "ALEJANDRO: I'm really happy. I think it's a different stage of my career. More elevated as a music producer, writer, artist in general. I've also grown a lot as a person. I feel more mature in every part of my life. This feels like the whole experience of my career in one whole project.",
      "ALEJANDRO: Puerto Rico is in every part of the books, in history. We're in every part of the world. You mentioned hip-hop, Puerto Ricans were involved in that as well. But before that, you see a salsa world \u2014 the Fania All-Stars. New York in the '70s was a lot of jazz, soul. It's just a lot of music from New York and Puerto Ricans have always been there. Reggaeton comes from Carolina, Puerto Rico. It's the birthplace. It's special. I feel really proud to be a Puerto Rican.",
      "In this new era, I went to New York and found great inspiration for my music but kept my essence. I keep the island at the forefront of everything that I do. I'm thinking about what it means to be Puerto Rican, our culture.",
      "ALEJANDRO: Of course, definitely. Salsa was a world that I had yet to explore. When I'm doing new projects, I try to look back at what I've accomplished and what I have yet to do. I try to analyze my whole career and see what's going to be next with Rauw, what's going to be new; I take my time at the studio, at home, studying, analyzing.",
      "This project has a lot of salsa influence, a lot of African influence. I'm using the live instruments (for) the first time. Instruments traditional to Puerto Rico like the cuatro, puertorrique\u00f1o guitar, maraca, el guiro, la conga, all mixed with the digital sounds. And, you know, it sounds fresh. It sounds rich and perfect for dancing.",
      "ALEJANDRO: We started working in New York and we finished in Paris. We have a few other records at the studio, but \u201cCommitted,\u201d this song is really special. He was the one that wrote that, the hook. And he was like, \u201cRauw, you have to sing it in English.\u201d And I was like, \u201cI've never done this before. It's new.\u201d It was challenge for me, you know, singing a whole hook in English. I told him, \u201cOK, but I\u2019ll do the verse in Spanish.\u201d I like to write my own verses and wanted to make it my own. We fused our ideas together.",
      "He understood the whole concept of the project. He's a legend, a mentor. You're going to hear more music from Pharrell and Rauw.",
      "ALEJANDRO: I always liked the classic stuff, and being really elegant, since I was a kid. I always like to be in a suit and tie. I found excuses to be really dressed up. And I think this character borrows that from Rauw Alejandro. I'm 31. I feel like a young spirt with an old soul, living in New York, the city's vibes, the musical influence of the '60s, the long coats ... the swag of Puerto Rico. I can't deny it. I think the way that you dress is the way you express yourself and your art.",
      "ALEJANDRO: I'm from Puerto Rico, that's my island. As a civilian, I'm always going to fight for my rights and give my opinion, share a positive message, be an example for the next generation and try to find the best solutions for my island. I think Benito (Bad Bunny) and Rene (Residente) have always done the same. I think everyone expresses themselves in different ways, but as an artist, the people can always count on me to share a message.",

      "It seemed like bad satire, or yet another conspiracy theory",
      "Headlines from the satirical website the Onion on Thursday: \u201cNew Dating Site Suggests People You Already Know But Thought You Were Too Good For.\u201d \u201cTrump Boys Have Slap Fight Over Who Gets to Run Foreign Policy Meetings.\u201d \u201cHere's Why I Decided to Buy Infowars.\u201d",
      "Only one has the ring of truth. Sort of.",
      "The bylined author of the Infowars article, Bryce P. Tetraeder, doesn't actually exist. And the Onion doesn't plan to invest in business school scholarships for promising cult leaders.",
      "But the Onion's purchase of Alex Jones' conspiracy-theory-saturated media empire at a bankruptcy auction tied to lawsuits by the families of Sandy Hook shooting victims is very real \u2014 an effort to fight falsehoods with funny and a who'd-have-thunk-it development in an already somewhat unbelievable year. An element of doubt was added late Thursday when the judge in Jones' bankruptcy case ordered a hearing for next week on how the auction was conducted.",
      "On Thursday, The Onion immediately shut down Infowars and said it plans to relaunch it in January as a parody of conspiracy theorists.",
      "\u201cOur goal in a couple of years is for people to think of Infowars as the funniest and dumbest website that exists,\u201d said Ben Collins, the Onion's CEO. \u201cIt was previously the dumbest website that exists.\u201d",
      "The purchase, for an undisclosed sum, was backed by Sandy Hook families, who were awarded nearly $1.5 billion in lawsuits against Jones for his false claims that the 2012 shootings at a Connecticut elementary school werex a hoax.",
      "The new Infowars will be a satire of theories Jones advanced, which themselves were so absurd that they could have seemed satirical if they hadn't caused real-life harm. The development ends one tentacle of a loose network of podcasters, TikTok influencers and others whose content keeps people perpetually provoked and enraged, Collins said. He called Jones one small character in a universe of fear-based media.",
      "\u201cThey've had a free pass to this point and we don't think that's fair,\u201d he said.",
      "At the very least, he said, the Onion hopes to return some fun to the Internet to offset years of doomscrolling.",
      "In Collins, who once covered misinformation for NBC News, the new venture has a leader uniquely suited to what is being attempted, said Dale Beran, who made this year's Netflix documentary, \u201cThe Anti-Social Network,\u201d about the topic.",
      "The Onion, founded as a newspaper in 1988, has gone through several ownership changes and was purchased earlier this year by a group that includes Jeff Lawson, co-founder of the software company Twilio. Since then, Beran said, it \u201cfeels like there is new life breathed into it.\"",
      "Done well, a satirical site on conspiracy theories and those who traffic in them could meet a historical moment much like comedian Stephen Colbert did when his Comedy Central show, \u201cThe Colbert Report,\u201d mocked pompous conservative television talk show hosts a decade and more ago.",
      "And what will happen when some of Jones' casual fans who didn't follow the news of the bankruptcy auction log on to Infowars in a few months only to find the Onion's new creation? Probably not much, said Beran, who suggested it's unlikely there's much overlap between people attracted by conspiracy theories and those who want to mock them.",
      "Indeed, conspiracy theories about the Onion's purchase of Infowars began popping up online only hours after it was announced.",
      "\u201cThere's no chance this outlet which hasn't been relevant in years was able to afford this purchase on their own. Who was really behind this?\u201d the website Zeee Media, which bills itself as \u201cone of the most trusted, uncensored sources of information in Australia,\u201d posted on X.",
      "Jones himself hurriedly posted a video aimed at his fans on Thursday. \u201cThis is a total attack on free speech,\u201d he said. \u201cThe deep state is completely out of control.\u201d",
      "There is an impact any time a prominent website that traffics in misinformation is shut down. Still, the business model of reaching people who want to be enraged is still viable, Beran said. Another expert in misinformation suggested Jones will quickly move on, and his fans will move with him.",
      "\u201cAs long as there are people willing to tune in, he will find new outlets,\u201d said Yotam Ophir, head of the Media Effects, Misinformation and Extremism Lab at the University of Buffalo. \u201cIf anything, the Onion trolling and the court cases against him will just make some of his most dedicated fans even more sure of his righteousness, seeing him as a martyr for free speech.\u201d",
      "At the very least, the Onion purchase offered a moment of zen for liberals who have had a pretty rough week or so following Donald Trump's election victory and the GOP sweep in Congress.",
      "\u201cThis is bad karma turned good,\u201d wrote Timothy W. Larson, who describes himself on X as a \u201cunabashed progressive.\" \u201cI love it.\u201d",

      "Most Valuable Promotions is handling the production of Friday's bout while CBS will produce the two NFL games for Netflix. When \u201cRaw\u201d begins airing on Netflix in January, World Wrestling Entertainment handles the production of all its events.",
      "Netflix will carry \u201cRaw\u201d in the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom and Latin America beginning on Jan. 6, with additional countries to be added as contracts expire.

      "Juan Luis Guerra 4.40 took home the album of the year trophy at the 2024 Latin Grammy Awards for his \u201cRadio G\u00fcira,\u201d not long after receiving record of the year for \u201cMambo 23.\u201d",
      "\u201cLet me share this with all the nominees, it is a great privilege to be with you,\" Guerra said onstage, speaking in Spanish. \"I love you, I admire you, and after 40 years of (my) career, I feel joyful to be with you,\u201d said Guerra. \u201cThe idea of \u200b\u200b\u2018Radio G\u00fcira\u2019 was from Jesus, completely from Jesus, he gave us wisdom and he gave us understanding so all the glory and honor goes to him.\u201d",
      "It was the performances that stood out Thursday night, and a tribute to salsa really bringing the house down: Marc Anthony and La India powerfully dueted \u201cVivir Lo Nuestro,\" a vivacious set jumpstarted by \u201cDe M\u00ed Enam\u00f3rate,\u201d as performed by Tito Nieves and Christian Alicea. Make no mistake: the Latin Grammy Awards brought the fun on its 25th anniversary, and from the very beginning.",
      "Like with \u201cSi Si Si\u201d! It's the song that Carlos Vives opened the night with in his medley, and a perfect distillation of the spirit of the event. There was a lot to say \u201cyes\u201d to \u2014 especially when he was joined by fellow Colombian musicians Juanes, Sebasti\u00e1n Yatra and Camilo.",
      "He was honored as the Latin Grammys' Person of the Year at a ceremony the night before, and given his award on stage Thursday night by Jon Bon Jovi. Past winners include Juanes, Laura Pausini, Marco Antonio Sol\u00eds, Rub\u00e9n Blades and more.",

      "\u201cI think any musician or artist dreams of a moment like this,\u201d she said through tears. \u201cI want to thank God because he gave me this dream, to my mother for having believed in me from the beginning\u2026 to all the nominees, this is yours, I admire and respect you very much, to the people who listen to my music, you brought me here, thank you very, very much.\u201d",
      "Song of the year went to Jorge Drexler for his composition, \u201cDerrumbe.\u201d",

      "Pitbull and Jon Bon Jovi teamed up \u201cNow or Never,\u201d a remix song of the latter\u2019s huge hit, \u201cIt\u2019s My Life.\u201d",
      "Anitta brought bossa nova to the awards show, paying tribute to the late great Sergio Mendes, her fellow Brazilian.",
      "Traditional pop vocal album went to Puerto Rican singer-songwriter Kany Garc\u00eda for her album, \u201cGarc\u00eda.\u201d And Draco Rosa won pop/rock album for his 2024 record, \u201cReflejos de Lo Eterno.\u201d",
      "Karol G won m\u00fasica urbana album \u201cMa\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito (Bichota Season).\u201d Pop vocal album went to Luis Fonsi for \u201cEl Viaje.\u201d",
      "It's a big year: the three-hour award show celebrated the Latin Grammys' 25th anniversary, held at the Kaseya Center in Miami, in a time when Latin music genres have never been bigger globally.",
      "Most of the awards at the Latin Grammys were presented a few hours before, at the Latin Grammy Premiere. There, \u00c9dgar Barrera \u2014 the producer and songwriter known for his work with such artists as Madonna, Karol G, Peso Pluma, Shakira, Grupo Frontera and beyond \u2014 who led the nominations for a second year in a row, picked up three trophies. Nathy Peluso did the same.",

      "NEW YORK -- The lawyer for a former cast member of the \u201cReal Housewives of New York\u201d told a federal judge Thursday that the First Amendment cannot shield the show\u2019s creators from a lawsuit alleging that the show\u2019s participants were subjected to a \u201crotted workplace culture.\u201d",
      "Attorney Sarah Matz said the lawsuit brought by Leah McSweeney earlier this year should advance to the stage where evidence can be gathered for trial.",
      "Adam Levin, a lawyer for defendants including entertainer Andy Cohen, one of the show\u2019s producers, and the Bravo channel, told the judge that the lawsuit\u2019s allegations were protected by the First Amendment and that it should be dismissed at a stage in which the judge is required to assume the allegations are true.",
      "The judge did not immediately rule on the future of the lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages for mental, emotional, physical pain along with impairment of life's joys and lost future earnings.",
      "The lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court alleges that McSweeney, who suffers from alcoholism, was pressured to drink booze on the show and was retaliated against when she wanted to stay sober or was denied reasonable accommodations to aid her efforts at sobriety.",
      "It also alleges that the defendants \u201cemployed psychological warfare intentionally weaponized to break Ms. McSweeney's psyche,\u201d particularly when she was intimidated and prevented from visiting her dying grandmother through threats to cut her pay or fire her if she left the filming location.",
      "\u201cThey knew she was trying to be sober,\u201d Matz told the judge. \u201cThe show is not called the \u2018Drunk Housewives of New York City.\u2019\u201d",
      "The judge, who said he had never seen the show, asked each side numerous questions and seemed inclined to, at a minimum, strike some allegations from the lawsuit that pertained to events on camera.",
      "Levin told him the lawsuit should be tossed in its entirety. He said ruling in favor of the claims made in McSweeney's lawsuit \u201cwould kill\u201d some television and Broadway stage shows if the First Amendment did not protect the producers of shows.",
      "Particularly when it comes to a reality television show, the cast member becomes the message of the show and \u201cyou can't separate the person from the speech,\u201d Levin said.",
      "\u201cWhat are the limits a director can do to induce the behavior the director wants?\u201d the judge asked as he questioned whether a director could demand that show participants not sleep for two days before filming or subject themselves to a physical assault just before they go on camera.",
      "Levin said there were limits to First Amendment protection for the creators of a communicative show, but he said they were narrow in scope. McSweeney's lawsuit, he said, did not fall within the narrow exceptions, such as when a producer might commit a criminal felony offense during the production of a show."

      "Juliet Taylor does not give herself credit for Meryl Streep",
      "Juliet Taylor does not give herself credit for Meryl Streep.",
      "In her over 40 years as top casting director behind so many classics, \u201cAnnie Hall,\u201d \u201cHeartburn\u201d and \u201cSleepless in Seattle\u201d to name just a few, she did, technically give Streep her first film role. She gave many stars their big breaks. But Streep, she said, was always going to happen \u2014 the young stage actor was the talk of the town in New York as soon as she came on the scene. Taylor was simply the lucky one who happened to be casting for \u201cJulia,\u201d which didn\u2019t conflict with a play.",
      "Modesty is not antithetical to being a great casting director, though, a profession of observation, negotiation and nuance that operates mostly out of the public eye. It\u2019s why Taylor's a little nervous about Sunday, when she\u2019ll be presented with an honorary Oscar at the film academy\u2019s annual Governors Awards in a room full of Hollywood greats.",
      "Recognition is long overdue for Taylor and her peers. Earlier this year, the film academy announced that it would add a new competitive Oscar for casting directors starting with films released in 2025.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so much people don\u2019t know about casting actors,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cOne thing is we negotiate all the contracts and we cast a movie within a budget.\u201d",
      "Casting wasn\u2019t always the art that it is today. In the studio system, it was more of cattle call, an organizational rather than creative job. But Taylor began her career in 1968 at time of change, mentored by one of the pioneers behind the movement: Marion Dougherty, who scouted talent in off-Broadway plays and turned casting into a more selective, humane process. It was also a profession led by a lot of women. Dougherty used to joke that it\u2019s because they didn\u2019t get paid much.",
      "The first movie Taylor led casting on was \u201cThe Exorcist,\u201d a baptism by fire in many ways. Director William Friedkin had not gotten along with Dougherty on \u201cThe Night They Raided Minsky\u2019s\" and called the office with a strange request.",
      "\u201cHe said, \u2018I hear you have a really good assistant. Would you let her cast my movie?\u2019\u201d Taylor said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he did that as something that was not nice to do. That was terrifying for me. I was scared to death the entire time.\u201d",
      "But she also found her voice on the film, discovering Linda Blair and taking a shot on Jason Miller, a playwright who she had a good feeling about.",
      "\u201cHe had such a great face and he was such an interesting kind of brooding man,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought, \u2018Gee let\u2019s see if he\u2019ll come in and cry.\u2019 He did and he got the part. That was exciting. That\u2019s a casting director\u2019s dream.\u201d",
      "As a New Yorker, Taylor quickly established herself as a go-to casting director for the likes of Woody Allen, for whom she cast over 40 films, Mike Nichols, Nora Ephron and Alan Parker. Among her over 100 credits, she did both \u201cClose Encounters of the Third Kind\u201d and \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d for Steven Spielberg, \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d for Martin Scorsese, \u201cBig\u201d for Penny Marshall and \u201cTerms of Endearment\u201d for James L Brooks.",
      "\u201cSo many of them turned out so well because I worked for such wonderful directors,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m being falsely modest, but I do feel like so many of these people were just so talented you couldn\u2019t miss it.\u201d",
      "Some of her proudest moments were finding real people to fill out movies, like the lounge singer in \u201cBroadway Danny Rose.\u201d There are also the actors who she didn\u2019t give up on.",
      "\u201cI used to drag poor Jeff Daniels in for everything,\u201d she said. \u201cBack then also there were two different communities of actors and there was very little intermingling. New York actors came to New York to be in the theater. If they got a movie, that was thrilling, but they didn\u2019t come thinking they were going to be a star.\u201d",
      "For the most part, she and her longest running filmmaker partners, Allen and Nichols, were able to operate independently.",
      "\u201cWoody made his movies on a very tight budget with the agreement that he wouldn\u2019t be interfered with,\u201d she said. \u201cMike Nichols was so admired that people didn\u2019t bother with him too much at first. But as his movies got more expensive, then you started to see a little bit more interference.\u201d",
      "When \u201cWorking Girl\u201d came along, for instance, the studio had ideas about needing bigger stars. She and Nichols wanted Alec Baldwin as the male lead, but he was too unknown for the studio and Harrison Ford was called in.",
      "Taylor retired a few years ago and doesn't regret it. She\u2019ll still talk to some of her old director friends about projects here and there. But she\u2019s mostly just enjoying going to the theater. And she\u2019s excited that her profession is being celebrated.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019ve been so many people who went before us who really deserved it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very moving for me and the whole community. It\u2019s been too long.\u201d"

      "There\u2019s one exercise group that says you really can keep up with outdoor workouts through the winter",
      "The sun had yet to come up in Edmonton, Alberta, and it was more than 20 degrees below zero. Tanis Smith layered up anyway, ready to run up and down hundreds of stairs among the trees in the Saskatchewan River Valley.",
      "When she arrived at 6 a.m., 10 other people joined her. It wouldn\u2019t be the last time they risked freezing their toes off to get in a workout before the rest of the world wakes up.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re pretty much just putting everything you own on,\u201d said Smith, an accountant. \u201cIf you look at the pictures, you don\u2019t know who you are unless you remember what you were wearing.\u201d",
      "Since that winter of 2013, Smith has rarely missed a workout with the group, called November Project, a network of free outdoor group exercise classes that started in Boston. No matter the month or weather, participants roll out of bed before dawn at least once a week and shield their faces from the blistering cold.",
      "One part intense training and one part abject silliness, the project is a model for how to stay motivated to exercise outside throughout the winter.",
      "It started when a pair of friends challenged each other to exercise every morning for the month of November. By the end of the month, they were recruiting others.",
      "\u201cA party is better when there\u2019s more people around,\u201d said Bojan Mandaric, who created the project with Brogan Graham in 2011. \u201cWe would talk to anybody who would listen.\u201d",
      "Soon, their meetings were attracting a few dozen people, who then brought the idea to other cities when they moved. Now there are 52 chapters in eight countries, including 44 in the United States and Canada.",
      "Workouts, which attract all ages and fitness levels, begin with a \u201cbounce,\u201d a hopping, call-and-response chant to loosen people up physically and mentally. How the classes continue varies on the location and day of the week, but most include running and body weight exercises like squats or burpees.",
      "To promote the idea that exercise can be fun, they also might weave in activities that would be at home during childhood recess in the schoolyard.",
      "In Edmonton, they\u2019ve played an intense version of duck duck goose, gone sledding in winter and done Slip \u2019n\u2019 Slide in summer. One workout in Boston involved a kind of Easter egg hunt, where you search for plastic eggs at a sprint. Crack them open to find commands that could be, walk like a gorilla, do a cartwheel, or grab grass and dump it on Mandaric\u2019s head.",
      "The point is to lower inhibitions, which helps people make connections, said Jason Shaw, co-leader of the Indianapolis chapter.",
      "\u201cNobody\u2019s cool at November Project,\u201d he said. \u201cAt different gyms, especially, you always have the people who just are so cool, or think they\u2019re so cool. We try to nip that in the bud.\u201d",
      "Shaw said chapters mark different milestones, much like Scout merit badges, by spray painting a tag on your shirt for, say, showing up on your first single-digit day.",
      "But they don\u2019t spray when it\u2019s too cold. The paint freezes.",
      "If you don\u2019t have a chapter nearby, many cities offer some kind of running or outdoor exercise group, though many are not free. Otherwise, November Project organizers offered a few suggestions on how to stay motived to keep working through the colder months.",
      "Accountability is a core tenet of the project. Members make a verbal promise to show up, and there is almost a sense of letting down your teammates if you don\u2019t, said Mandaric, who moved to Boston from Serbia to row crew for Northeastern University.",
      "There\u2019s no such thing as bad weather, just bad clothing, Shaw said. At a minimum, buy a moisture-wicking base layer that will help keep you warm and dry. Avoid cotton, which keeps sweat in contact with your body and will make you colder. And add a top jacket with wind-breaking fabric.",
      "Commit to exercising on the same days and times for a month. Creating a predictable routine will help you get into a groove that is easier to maintain, Mandaric said.",
      "One of the things Smith appreciates most about the project is its social aspect. She called it \u201ca chosen family\u201d that was formed partly because they were having fun while exercising.",
      "\u201cFitness doesn\u2019t have to be this hard-nosed, drill-sergeant type thing,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can have fun and get fit.\u201d",

      "Health officials say they have confirmed the first U.S. case of a new form of mpox that was first seen in eastern Congo",
      "NEW YORK -- Health officials said Saturday they have confirmed the first U.S. case of a new form of mpox that was first seen in eastern Congo.",
      "The person had traveled to eastern Africa and was treated in Northern California upon return, according to the California Department of Public Health. Symptoms are improving and the risk to the public is low.",
      "The individual was isolating at home and health workers are reaching out to close contacts as a precaution, the state health department said.",
      "Mpox is a rare disease caused by infection with a virus that\u2019s in the same family as the one that causes smallpox. It is endemic in parts of Africa, where people have been infected through bites from rodents or small animals. Milder symptoms can include fever, chills and body aches. In more serious cases, people can develop lesions on the face, hands, chest and genitals.",
      "Earlier this year, scientists reported the emergence of a new form of mpox in Africa that was spread through close contact including through sex. It was widely transmitted in eastern and central Africa. But in cases that were identified in travelers outside of the continent, spread has been very limited, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "More than 3,100 confirmed cases have been reported just since late September, according to the World Health Organization. The vast majority of them have been in three African countries \u2014 Burundi, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.",
      "Since then, cases of travelers with the new mpox form have been reported in Germany, India, Kenya, Sweden, Thailand, Zimbabwe, and the United Kingdom.",
      "Health officials earlier this month said the situation in Congo appears to be stabilizing. The Africa CDC has estimated Congo needs at least 3 million mpox vaccines to stop the spread, and another 7 million vaccines for the rest of Africa. The spread is mostly through sexual transmission as well as through close contact among children, pregnant women and other vulnerable groups.",
      "The current outbreak is different from the 2022 global outbreak of mpox where gay and bisexual men made up the vast majority of cases.",

Most of the infected people live in New York, Minnesota and Washington, followed by California and Oregon, although infections have been reported in states throughout the country, according to the CDC.",
      "There have been several E. coli outbreaks in recent months. In October, more than 100 McDonald\u2019s customers were sickened by an E. coli outbreak in the U.S. linked to slivered onions. In the U.K., one person died in an E. coli outbreak in June linked to lettuce that sickened at least 275 people. Organic walnuts sickened consumers in 19 states with E. coli infections in April.",
      "Despite the number of recent outbreaks, experts say the food supply is generally safe, although there hasn't been much progress in curbing infections caused by E. coli.",
      "The recalled organic baby carrots have best-by dates ranging from Sept. 11 through Nov. 12, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.",
      "Symptoms of E. coli infection usually start three to four days after eating the bacteria and include severe stomach cramps, diarrhea, which is often bloody, and vomiting. People with severe symptoms of an E. coli infection should seek medical attention and tell the provider what they ate, the CDC said.",

      "\u201cThe role we play is to increase the pressure,\u201d she said of the action. \u201cWe know we\u2019re not going to get the results that the world needs in this round of negotiations, but at least to bring us many steps closer is our hope, is our aim.\u201d",
      "She added: \u201cI think we have no option but to keep fighting ... It\u2019s the instinctive response that anyone, any living being, living creatures will have, which is to fight for life and fight for survival.\u201d",
      "Tasneem Essop said she was inspired by the action, which was challenging to organize. \u201cTo be able to pull off something where people feel their own power, exercise their own power and get inspired in this creative way, I\u2019m super excited about this,\u201d she said.",
      "Essop says she\u2019s \u201cnot very\u201d optimistic about an outcome on finance, but knows next week will be pivotal. \u201cWe can\u2019t end up with a bad deal for the peoples of the world, those who are already suffering the impacts of climate change, those who need to adapt to an increasing and escalating crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cWe fight until the end.\u201d",
      "Activists in Baku were joined by protests big and small around the world.",
      "In London, hundreds of protesters marched from the British Museum to the offices of Socar, the Azerbaijan-owned oil company, before heading to the residence and office of Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",

      "Negotiators at COP29, as the talks are known, are working on a deal that might be worth hundreds of billions of dollars to poorer nations. Many are in the Global South and already suffering the costly impacts of weather disasters fueled by climate change. Several experts have said $1 trillion a year or more is needed both to compensate for such damages and to pay for a clean-energy transition that most countries can't afford on their own.",
      "Samir Bejanov, deputy lead negotiator of this year's climate talks said in a press conference that the climate finance talks were moving too slowly.",

      "Environmental advocates released reports Friday decrying fossil fuel industry influence at these climate talks in Baku, Azerbaijan, called COP29",
      "BAKU, Azerbaijan -- Good or bad, the United Nations climate negotiations process itself became the focus of the international talks that aim to curb warming from coal, oil and natural gas.",
      "Environmental advocates released reports Friday decrying fossil fuel industry influence at the climate talks called COP29. At the same time, a letter signed by a former United Nations secretary-general and ex-top climate negotiators called for dramatic reform. And the conference's chief negotiator said current talks \u2014 aimed at striking a deal worth hundreds of billions of dollars to help finance a transition to clean energy and adapting to climate change \u2014 were going too slowly.",
      "All that put the focus on process \u2014 not results.",
      "\u201cWe consider COP29 as a litmus test for the global climate architecture,\" conference lead negotiator Yalchin Rafiyev said at a Friday news conference.",
      "A letter signed by former U.N. chief Ban Ki-Moon, former U.N. climate secretary Christiana Figueres and former Ireland President Mary Robinson called for \u201ca fundamental overhaul of the COP.\"",
      "\"We need a shift from negotiation to implementation,\u201d it said.",
      "Two signees \u2014 Figueres and Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research \u2014 said the letter was being badly misinterpreted as criticism of the climate talks. They said the letter was intended to show support for the process, which they said has worked and just needs to shift into a new mode.",
      "Instead of spending so much effort negotiating new deals in annual conferences that can attract 70,000 people, the process should be smaller and more frequent and aimed at putting what was already agreed upon into action, Rockstrom said.",
      "\u201cIt's about strengthening the COP,\" Rockstrom said. \u201cIt's about recognizing we\u2019ve accomplished so much that we have what we need. ... We really need to get serious about delivery.\"",
      "Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare said he had issues with some of the suggestions in the letter and personally considers the COP process broken. His analysis this week showed that after the 2015 Paris agreement projected future warming dropped, but in the past three years, warming projections \u2014 based on negotiations, promises and policies \u2014 for the future have stayed the same or even gone up slightly.",
      "An analysis from the Kick Big Polluters Out coalition said Friday that the official attendance list of the talks featured at least 1,770 people connected to fossil fuel interests.",
      "Catherine Abreu, director of the International Climate Politics Hub, suggested that there should be a \u201cfirewall\u201d between fossil fuel lobbyists, U.N. climate bodies and negotiators from countries. \u201cWe know over 1,700 fossil fuel lobbyists are here at COP29. That is not acceptable,\u201d she said.",
      "Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, who on Friday presented new data on carbon pollution sites, said \u201cit\u2019s unfortunate that the fossil fuel industry and the petrostates have seized control of the COP process to an unhealthy degree.\"",
      "For his part, COP29 negotiator Rafiyev defended the process.",
      "\u201cThe process has already delivered, the COP process so far by reducing projected warming, delivering finance to those in need,\" Rafiev said. \u201cIt\u2019s better than any alternative.\u201d",
      "One key benefit of the U.N. climate talks process is it's the only place where vulnerable small island nations have an equal seat at the table, United Nations Environment Programme Executive Director Inger Andersen told The Associated Press. But the process has its limits because \u201cthe rules of the game are set by member states,\u201d she said.",
      "At a press conference, Alliance of Small Islands States Chair Cedric Schuster said the negotiating bloc felt the need to remind everyone else why the talks matter.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re here to defend the Paris agreement,\u201d Schuster said, referring to the climate deal in 2015 to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned that countries are forgetting that protecting the world\u2019s most vulnerable is at the core of this framework.\u201d",
      "Also at the talks Friday, new data from an organization co-founded by Gore that combines observations and artificial intelligence found that cities in Asia and the United States emit the most heat-trapping gas, with Shanghai the most polluting.",
      "Using observations and artificial intelligence, Climate Trace quantifies heat-trapping carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, as well as other traditional air pollutants worldwide, including for the first time in more than 9,000 urban areas.",
      "Seven states or provinces spew more than 1 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases, all of them in China, except Texas, which ranks sixth.",
      "Earth's total carbon dioxide and methane pollution grew 0.7% to 61.2 billion metric tons with the short-lived but extra potent methane rising 0.2%. The figures are higher than other datasets \u201cbecause we have such comprehensive coverage and we have observed more emissions in more sectors than are typically available,\u201d said Gavin McCormick, Climate Trace's co-founder.",
      "Shanghai's 256 million metric tons of greenhouse gases led all cities and exceeded those from the nations of Colombia or Norway. Tokyo's 250 million metric tons would rank in the top 40 of nations if it were a country, while New York City's 160 million metric tons and Houston's 150 million metric tons would be in the top 50 of countrywide emissions. Seoul, South Korea, ranks fifth among cities at 142 million metric tons.",
      "\u201cOne of the sites in the Permian Basin in Texas is by far the No. 1 worst polluting site in the entire world,\u201d Gore said. \u201cAnd maybe I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised by that, but I think of how dirty some of these sites are in Russia and China and so forth. But Permian Basin is putting them all in the shade.\u201d",
      "China, India, Iran, Indonesia and Russia had the biggest increases in emissions from 2022 to 2023, while Venezuela, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States had the biggest decreases in pollution.",
      "The dataset \u2014 maintained by scientists and analysts from various groups \u2014 also looked at traditional pollutants such as carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds, ammonia, sulfur dioxide and other chemicals associated with dirty air. Burning fossil fuels releases both types of pollution, Gore said.",
      "This \u201crepresents the single biggest health threat facing humanity,\u201d Gore said.",

      "The world has already warmed 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. That's near the 1.5-degree (2.7 F) limit that countries agreed to at 2015 climate talks in Paris.

      "Climate Action Tracker does projections under several different scenarios, and in some cases, those are going up slightly.",

      "NEW YORK -- President-elect Donald Trump announced Thursday he will nominate anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, putting a man whose views public health officials have decried as dangerous in charge of a massive agency that oversees everything from drug, vaccine and food safety to medical research, Medicare and Medicaid.",
      "\u201cFor too long, Americans have been crushed by the industrial food complex and drug companies who have engaged in deception, misinformation, and disinformation when it comes to Public Health,\u201d Trump said Thursday in a post on his Truth Social site announcing the appointment. Kennedy, he said, would \u201cend the Chronic Disease epidemic\" and \u201cMake America Great and Healthy Again!\u201d",
      "Trump said Kennedy would target drugs, food additives and chemicals.",
      "As one of the most prominent anti-vaccine activists in the world, Kennedy's nomination immediately alarmed some public health officials.",
      "Dr. Mandy Cohen, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told The Associated Press, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go backwards and see children or adults suffer or lose their lives to remind us that vaccines work, and so I am concerned.\u201d",
      "Trump also announced Thursday that he has chosen Doug Collins, a former congressman from Georgia, to run the Department of Veterans Affairs. Collins is a chaplain in the U.S. Air Force Reserve Command. The Republican served in Congress from 2013 to 2021, and he helped defend Trump during his first impeachment process.",
      "Later Thursday, Trump said he was nominating North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum to lead the Department of the Interior. After ending his own presidential campaign in December 2023, Burgum endorsed Trump and became an outspoken supporter, appearing on TV news shows and at rallies and other events. He was on Trump's short list of potential running mates.",
      "Kennedy hails from one of the nation\u2019s most storied political families and is the son of the late Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and the nephew of President John F. Kennedy. He first challenged President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination last year. He then ran as an independent but abandoned his bid this summer after striking a deal to endorse Trump in exchange for a promise to serve in a health policy role during a second Trump administration.",
      "He and the president-elect have since become good friends. The two campaigned together extensively during the race\u2019s final stretch, and Trump made clear he intended to give Kennedy a major public health role.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to let him go wild on health,\u201d Trump said at a rally last month.",
      "During the campaign, Kennedy told NewsNation that Trump had asked him to \u201creorganize\u201d agencies including the CDC, the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "Kennedy has pushed against processed foods and the use of herbicides like Roundup weed killer. He has long criticized the large commercial farms and animal feeding operations that dominate the industry.",
      "But he is perhaps best known for his criticism of childhood vaccines.",
      "Again and again, Kennedy has made his opposition to vaccines clear. In July, he said in a podcast interview that \u201cThere\u2019s no vaccine that is safe and effective\u201d and told FOX News that he still believes in the long-ago debunked idea that vaccines can cause autism.",
      "In a 2021 podcast he urged people to \u201cresist\u201d CDC guidelines that advise when kids should receive routine vaccinations.",
      "\u201cI see somebody on a hiking trail carrying a little baby and I say to him, \u2018Better not get them vaccinated,\u2019\u201d Kennedy said.",
      "Repeated scientific studies in the U.S. and abroad have found no link between vaccines and autism. Vaccines have been proven safe and effective in laboratory testing and in real world use in hundreds of millions of people over decades. The World Health Organization credits childhood vaccines with preventing as many as 5 million deaths a year.",
      "Trump during his first term launched Operation Warp Speed, an effort to speed the production and distribution of a vaccine to combat COVID-19. The resulting vaccines were widely credited, including by Trump himself, with saving lives.",
      "Kennedy has also worked to shore up support among young mothers in particular, on a message of ridding the U.S. of unhealthy ingredients in foods, promising to model regulations after those imposed in Europe. His claims that the U.S. obesity epidemic, as well as a rise in chronic diseases like diabetes, are the result of processed and unhealthy foods has resonated on social media among fitness gurus and mom influencers alike.",
      "It remains unclear how that will square with Trump\u2019s history of deregulation of big industries, including food. Trump has pushed for fewer inspections of the meat industry, for example.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s stance on vaccines raises question about his ability to get confirmed, even in a GOP-controlled Senate. He also has said he would make a controversial recommendation to remove fluoride from drinking water, although fluoride levels are mandated by state and local governments. The addition of the mineral has been cited as leading to improved dental health and is considered safe at low levels.",
      "Incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune would not comment on Trump's pick of Kennedy or any other potential nominee. \u201cI\u2019m not going to make any judgments about any of these folks at this point,\u201d he said.",
      "But Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, R-MO, praised the HHS pick, posting on X: \u201cBad day for Big Pharma! @RobertKennedyJr.\"",
      "Several Democrats quickly condemned the selection.",
      "Washington Sen. Patty Murray, the No. 3 Democrat, said that Kennedy\u2019s confirmation would be \u201cnothing short of a disaster for the health of millions of families.\u201d",
      "But not every Democrat recoiled from the news. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said he was \u201cexcited\u201d for Kennedy to lead HHS. Polis said he wants to see Kennedy take on \u201cbig pharma\u201d and hopes he will \u201clean into personal choice\u201d on vaccines.",
      "That idea is concerning to former New York Public Health Commissioner Dr. Ashwin Vasan, who said that if people opt against vaccines, deadly viruses could run wild. He points to an uptick in measles outbreaks \u2014 16 have occurred so far this year compared to four last year. \u201cThat\u2019s going to continue if we have someone at the top of our health system that is saying, \u2018I\u2019m not so sure about the science here,\u2019\u201d Vasan said.",
      "FDA could have one of the biggest shakeups, with Kennedy's promises of more regulations \u2014 action that would buck the moves that previous Republican administrations have made. He has promised a crackdown on food dyes and preservatives. And with pharmaceutical companies, he's suggested that drugmakers be barred from advertising on TV, a multibillion-dollar enterprise that accounts for most of the industry\u2019s marketing dollars.

      "Kennedy also will focus on ending the \u201crevolving door\u201d of employees who have previously worked for pharmaceutical companies or leave government service to work for that industry, his former campaign communications manager, Del Bigtree, told the AP last month.",
      "This past weekend, Kennedy said he wanted to fire 600 employees at NIH, which oversees vaccine research and replace them with 600 new people.

      "A U.S. military watchdog says Navy officials lacked sufficient understanding of the risks of maintaining massive fuel storage tanks on top of a drinking water well at Pearl Harbor where spilled jet fuel poisoned more than 6,000 people",
      "HONOLULU -- Navy officials \u201clacked sufficient understanding\u201d of the risks of maintaining massive fuel storage tanks on top of a drinking water well at Pearl Harbor where spilled jet fuel poisoned more than 6,000 people in 2021, a U.S. military watchdog said Thursday.",
      "That lack of awareness came even though officials had engineering drawings and environmental studies that described the risks, the U.S. Department of Defense\u2019s inspector general said.",
      "The finding was among a long list of Navy failures identified by the inspector general in two reports that follow a yearslong investigation into the fuel leak at the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility. Investigators said it was imperative for the Navy to address its management of fuel and water systems at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam and recommended that the military assess leak detection systems at other Navy fuel facilities.",
      "\"The DoD must take this action, and others, to ensure that tragedies like the one in November of 2021 are not allowed to repeat,\u201d Inspector General Robert P. Storch said in a statement.",
      "The military built the Red Hill fuel tanks into the side of a mountain in the early 1940s to protect them from aerial attack. There were 20 tanks in all, each about the height of a 25-story building with the capacity to hold 12.5 million gallons (47.3 million liters.) The site was in the hills above Pearl Harbor and on top of an aquifer equipped with wells that provided drinking water to the Navy and to Honolulu's municipal water system.",
      "Fuel leaks at Red Hill had occurred before, including in 2014, prompting the Sierra Club of Hawaii and the Honolulu Board of Water Supply to ask the military to move the tanks to a place where they wouldn't threaten Oahu's water. But the Navy refused, saying the island's water was safe.",
      "The 2021 spill gushed from a ruptured pipe in May of that year. Most of it flowed into a fire suppression drain system, where it sat unnoticed for six months until a cart rammed a sagging line holding the liquid. Crews believed they mopped up most of this fuel but they failed to get about 5,000 gallons (19,000 liters.) Around Thanksgiving, the fuel flowed into a drain and drinking water well that supplied water to 90,000 people at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam.",
      "The inspector general's report noted 4,000 families had to move out of their homes for months because they couldn't drink or bathe in their water. The military spent more than $220 million housing residents in hotels and responding to the spill. Congress appropriated $2.1 billion more, some of which is helping the Navy close the Red Hill facility in compliance with an order from Hawaii regulators.",
      "Among the inspector general's other findings:",
      "1. The Navy never told the state Department of Health, which regulates underground fuel tanks, about the missing fuel after the May 2021 spill. 2. The Navy missed four separate opportunities in November 2021 to activate emergency response plans to respond to the water contamination. That includes on Nov. 20, when fuel was released from the drainage pipe, and on Nov. 28, when residents called base authorities to report chemical and fuel smells emanating from their water. 3. The Navy issued news releases on Nov. 21 and 22 saying \u201cthe drinking water was safe\u201d but did so without conducting any laboratory analysis to confirm that was the case.4. The Navy didn't assume contamination from the spill had spread throughout Pearl Harbor's drinking water system, as required by the water system emergency response plan. The report said some residents may have continued to cook and shower with their tap water as a result.",

      "Hawaii's congressional delegation, which called for the investigation in 2021, issued a joint statement saying the reports made clear the Navy and the military failed to manage fuel and water operations at Red Hill and Pearl Harbor to a standard that protects the health and safety of the people of Hawaii.",
      "\u201cIt's outrageous and unacceptable,\u201d said the statement from U.S. Sens. Mazie Hirono and Brian Schatz and U.S. Reps. Ed Case and Jill Tokuda, all Democrats.",
      "They called on the Navy to take \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for its failures and immediately implement the inspector general's recommendations.",
      "A Navy spokesperson said in a statement that the inspector general's findings align with previous evaluations and support corrective actions the Navy is implementing.",
      "\u201cWe are committed to constant improvement to ensure the highest standards of operation, maintenance, safety, and oversight at all of our facilities at all times,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The Navy last year issued written reprimands to three retired military officers for their roles in the fuel spill in a move the Sierra Club called \u201cslaps on the wrist.\u201d",
      "Hawaii Gov. Josh Green said he welcomed the inspector general's findings, which he said underscored what environmental advocates had long alleged.",
      "\"We will continue to insist on transparency and accountability surrounding the issue of Red Hill, as all people who live in Hawai\u02bbi deserve pure, clean drinking water,\u201d Green said in a statement."

    "summary": "Deep breathing can be a simple and effective way to reduce stress",
    "story": [
      "Deep breathing can be a simple and effective way to reduce stress",
      "NEW YORK -- A simple, uncommon ritual starts each staff meeting at Myosin Marketing. When everyone is gathered on Zoom, and before they get to the meat of the agenda, CEO Sean Clayton leads his team through a deep-breathing exercise.",
      "The practice sets the tone for the meeting, and helps his employees, most of whom work remotely, to feel safe, grounded and willing to take creative risks, he said.",
      "\u201cAt first they thought it was really weird, like, \u2018What are we doing?\u2019\u201d Clayton said. \u201cThere were a lot of cameras off and I\u2019m sure a lot of people were like, \u2018This is awkward.\u2019\" But after a couple of weeks, there was a shift. Employees of the Austin, Texas company were saying, 'This feels good,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "Deep breathing can be an effective way to reduce stress at work, studies show. But on the job, many people don\u2019t think about how they\u2019re inhaling and exhaling.",
      "Desk workers sitting a computer tend to take shallow breaths as their shoulders creep up. Workers who spend the day on their feet in retail or health care may be too busy to focus on breathing.",
      "But there's good reason to remember to pause to take deep breaths. Chronic, unmanaged stress, which increases the risk of heart disease and stroke, can be as harmful to our health as secondhand smoke, according to the American Heart Association. Research suggests deep-breathing exercises can lower a person's blood pressure and reduce anxiety.",
      "Other benefits: deep breathing is free, can be done anywhere and doesn't require taking a half-hour to meditate. Spending just a minute or two breathing deeply can help calm racing thoughts, experts say.",
      "\u201cIt relaxes my mind. It makes my mind so full of ease,\u201d Lisa Marie Deleveaux, a marketing professional and mother of five, said. \u201cIt brings you back to the present moment.\u201d",
      "Deleveaux was laid off several months ago and has struggled to find a new job. She wakes most mornings at 4 or 5 a.m., before the children, to do breathing exercises. One is a technique known as alternate nostril breathing, a yoga exercise that involves inhaling through one nostril and out through another, using a thumb or forefinger to hold one nostril closed at a time.",
      "\u201cIf you set a priority for yourself ... you can make the time,\u201d Deleveaux said.",
      "Focusing on breathing for one to five minutes \"can help you clear the slate and wipe all these things out of your mind...and allow you to get back to focusing on the one thing you want to accomplish,\u201d said cardiologist Glenn Levine, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. \u201cThe best analogy is turning your computer off when you have 37 programs (open) and it freezes.\u201d",
      "A good way to do deep breathing exercises is while sitting on a bench outside, Levine said. If that\u2019s not an option, doing it at a desk works.",
      "\u201cEither turn off your screen or just put something blank on the screen so people think you\u2019re still working,\" Levine said. \u201cInstead of focusing on the screen or work, just focus on your breathing. If possible, close your eyes.\u201d",
      "There are other ways to fit in breathing exercises. To get ahead of anxiety before starting a day of cold calls, sales development representative Lindsay Carlisle does breathing exercises with her 7-year-old daughter during the drive to school. They breathe in for seven counts, hold their breath for five, breathe out for seven counts, and then repeat the cycle several times.",
      "\u201cThroughout that process, my shoulders start to drop on their own, and it really is calming,\u201d Carlisle, who lives in Flint, Michigan, said. \u201cI\u2019m not a yoga instructor. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing, but it works.\u201d",
      "Suze Yalof Schwartz was an overworked fashion editor when her mother-in-law taught her a three-minute meditation technique that she says changed her life. She gave up her fashion career and founded Unplug Meditation, a Santa Monica, California, company with a meditation studio, an app and programs for corporate clients.",
      "\u201cWhen we slow down our breath, we send a signal to our brain that everything\u2019s OK, even when it\u2019s not,\" she said.",
      "A 16-second breathing technique she's taught to firefighters, police officers, doctors and others is called the box breathing technique. You breathe in for four counts, hold for four, breathe out for four counts and hold for four.",
      "\u201cIt is the best thing that you can do at work before you have a meeting, before you send out an email that you wish you didn\u2019t send, before you have a difficult conversation, because it just calms you down, gets rid of your negative energy,\" Yalof Schwartz said.",
      "Employers such as Coca-Cola, Mattel and Netflix have hired Unplug Meditation to teach breathing or meditation.",
      "It's not always easy for workers to find space for deep breathing exercises. For example, in retail jobs, workers often mix with customers. Yalof Schwartz recommends doing breathing exercises when ringing up a sale or folding clothes. You can also take a deep breath right before walking through a door.",
      "Office workers can set a timer on their phones to remind themselves to breathe deeply. That's what Carlisle, the sales representative, does. She also keeps a Post-it note on her monitor that says \u201cBreathe.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe anxiety is always going to be there,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cBut at least I know I have one small tool. ... It sounds so simple and silly, but it works.\u201d",

      "President-elect Donald Trump 's plan to appoint Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to lead the Health and Human Services Department will put a prominent vaccine skeptic at the helm of the nation's sprawling public health apparatus.",
      "A scion of a famous Democratic dynasty, Kennedy made a name in his own right as an environmental attorney who successfully took on large corporations including DuPont and Monsanto.",
      "But over the past two decades, he's increasingly devoted his energy to promoting claims about vaccines that contradict the overwhelming consensus of scientists.",
      "Trump would have Kennedy lead a massive Cabinet agency that oversees everything from drug, vaccine and food safety to medical research and the social safety net programs Medicare and Medicaid. He said before the election he would give Kennedy free rein over health policy.",
      "Here's a look at Kennedy and the agency he'll be tasked with leading:",
      "He took over the anti-vaccine group Children's Health Defense and built it into a juggernaut during the pandemic. His activism helped him build a loyal following that he's leveraged in his political pursuits.",
      "Kennedy insists he is not anti-vaccine and claims he has never told the public to avoid vaccination. But he has repeatedly made his opposition to vaccines clear. He said on a podcast \u201cthere\u2019s no vaccine that is safe and effective\u201d and has urged people to resist CDC guidelines on when kids should get vaccinated.",
      "While there are rare instances when people have severe reactions to vaccines, the billions of doses administered globally provide real-world evidence that they are safe. The World Health Organization says vaccines prevent as many as 5 million deaths each year.",
      "He wants to eliminate liability protections for drug companies.",
      "Even before Trump was elected, Kennedy said he would recommend water agencies stop adding fluoride to drinking water. Fluoride strengthens teeth and is viewed as one of the biggest public health successes of the past century.",
      "He made a variety of other claims not backed by science, such as questioning whether HIV causes AIDS and suggesting antidepressants lead to school shootings.",
      "Children\u2019s Health Defense, currently has a lawsuit pending against a number of news organizations, among them The Associated Press, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy took leave from the group when he announced his run for president but is listed as one of its attorneys in the lawsuit.",
      "Kennedy has promised to take a serious look at those who work for HHS and its agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "He is especially focused on putting an end to the \u201crevolving door\u201d of employees who have previous history working for pharmaceutical companies or leave government service to work for that industry, his campaign communications manager Del Bigtree told the AP last month. Bigtree is also an anti-vaccine organizer.",
      "He said he wants to fire 600 employees at the National Institutes of Health, which oversees vaccine research, and replace them with 600 new employees.",
      "Many of the scientists and researchers who work at the NIH are not political appointees, which makes firing them abruptly more difficult. Nevertheless, Kennedy made the promise at the Genius Network Annual Event in Scottsdale, Arizona, according to a video first obtained by ABC News.",
      "\u201cWe need to act fast, and we want to have those people in place on Jan. 20, so that on Jan. 21, 600 people are going to walk into offices at NIH and 600 people are going to leave,\u201d Kennedy said, according to a video of his remarks posted on YouTube.",
      "He says the public health establishment is too focused on infectious diseases and wants to redirect resources toward panoply of problems he characterizes as the chronic disease epidemic, including obesity, diabetes, autism and mental illnesses. He blames them on greedy corporations including drug companies that worry healthy Americans would be bad for their bottom line and food producers using harmful pesticides and additives.",
      "Kennedy's father was Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, brother of President John F. Kennedy. Both men were assassinated.",
      "Kennedy originally ran in the Democratic primary against President Joe Biden before deciding to launch an independent bid. He then suspended that campaign earlier this year and endorsed Trump, who has repeatedly praised Kennedy, promised him influence in a future administration, and vowed to \u201cMake America Healthy Again.\u201d",
      "The GOP base has eagerly welcomed Kennedy since he joined forces with Trump, an embrace Kennedy never received from the Democratic Party. His anti-vaccine activism has alienated him from much of his famous family.",
      "Doctors found a dead parasitic worm in Kennedy's brain and high levels of mercury that he said caused brain fog and memory problems.",
      "He once retrieved a bear that was killed by a motorist and left it in New York\u2019s Central Park with a bicycle on top, sparking a mystery that consumed the city in 2014. A photo showed Kennedy with his fingers in the bear\u2019s bloodied mouth, a mock grimace on his face and an apparent bloodstain on his pantleg.",
      "He denied eating a dog after a friend shared a photo with Vanity Fair showing Kennedy dramatically preparing to take a bite of a charred animal; Kennedy said it was a goat.",
      "And a federal law enforcement agency opened an investigation after Kennedy allegedly cut off the head of a dead whale and took it home two decades ago. The National Marine Fisheries Service ended the probe a short time later.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s nomination is certain to be opposed by the pharmaceutical lobby in Washington, which relies on the predictability of FDA\u2019s science-based rules to bring new medicines to market.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s proposals for the agency bear little resemblance to those of prior Republican administrations, which have typically favored cutting regulations to speed up product approvals.",
      "Instead, Kennedy has suggested barring drugmakers from advertising on TV, a multibillion-dollar enterprise that accounts for most of the industry\u2019s marketing dollars. He\u2019s also proposed eliminating fees that drugmakers pay the FDA to review their products, allowing the agency to hire extra scientists to speed up their work. Replacing those funds would require billions in new appropriations from the federal budget.",
      "In a post last month to the social media platform X, Kennedy vowed to end FDA\u2019s \u201caggressive suppression\u201d of a host of unsubstantiated therapies, including psychedelics and stem cells as well as discredited COVID-era drugs like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine.",
      "In recent interviews, Kennedy has also suggested clearing out \u201centire departments\u201d at FDA, including the one responsible for nutrition standards.",

      "The Texas Supreme Court has ruled against a legislative subpoena that lawmakers used to stave off the execution of Robert Roberson",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- A Texas Supreme Court ruling has again cleared the way for the execution of Robert Roberson, who would become the first person in the U.S. to be put to death over a murder conviction tied to a case of shaken baby syndrome, a diagnosis that some medical experts have questioned.",
      "Roberson was convicted of killing his 2-year-old daughter in 2003 and had been slated to die by lethal injection on Oct. 17. But the execution was halted after a bipartisan group of Texas lawmakers, including some who believe Roberson is innocent, issued a last-ditch subpoena ordering Roberson to testify at the Capitol days after his execution date.",
      "The unusual tactic created a legal conundrum that successfully temporarily held off Roberson's execution. However, the Texas Supreme Court on Friday ruled that a legislative subpoena cannot stop an execution, reopening a path for the execution to proceed unless Republican Gov. Greg Abbott grants a 30-day reprieve. A new date hasn't been set yet.",
      "Here's a timeline of the case:",

      "September 2024: A group of nearly 90 Republican and Democratic lawmakers file a clemency petition to the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles urging it to spare Roberson's life because they believe his daughter died of severe pneumonia, not abuse. The former lead detective on the case, several medical experts, civil rights advocates and best-selling author John Grisham also signed the petition.",
      "Oct. 16: The parole board votes unanimously, 6-0, to not recommend to grant clemency. Abbott can only grant clemency after receiving a recommendation from the board. With the execution appearing imminent, a Texas House committee ordered Roberson to testify at a hearing scheduled after his execution date.",

      "New rules require drugmakers to be clearer about explaining the risks and side effects of prescription drugs",
      "WASHINGTON -- Those ever-present TV drug ads showing patients hiking, biking or enjoying a day at the beach could soon have a different look: New rules require drugmakers to be clearer and more direct when explaining their medications' risks and side effects.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration spent more than 15 years crafting the guidelines, which are designed to do away with industry practices that downplay or distract viewers from risk information.",
      "Many companies have already adopted the rules, which become binding Nov. 20. But while regulators were drafting them, a new trend emerged: thousands of pharma influencers pushing drugs online with little oversight. A new bill in Congress would compel the FDA to more aggressively police such promotions on social media platforms.",
      "\u201cSome people become very attached to social media influencers and ascribe to them credibility that, in some cases, they don\u2019t deserve,\u201d said Tony Cox, professor emeritus of marketing at Indiana University.",
      "Still, TV remains the industry's primary advertising format, with over $4 billion spent in the past year, led by blockbuster drugs like weight-loss treatment Wegovy, according to ispot.tv, which tracks ads.",
      "The new rules, which cover both TV and radio, instruct drugmakers to use simple, consumer-friendly language when describing their drugs, without medical jargon, distracting visuals or audio effects. A 2007 law directed the FDA to ensure that drug risk information appears \u201cin a clear, conspicuous and neutral manner.\u201d",
      "FDA has always required that ads give a balanced picture of both benefits and risks, a requirement that gave rise to those long, rapid-fire lists of side effects parodied on shows like \u201c Saturday Night Live.\u201d",
      "But in the early 2000s, researchers began showing how companies could manipulate images and audio to de-emphasize safety information. In one example, a Duke University professor found that ads for the allergy drug Nasonex, which featured a buzzing bee voiced by Antonio Banderas, distracted viewers from listening to side effect information, making it harder to remember.",
      "Such overt tactics have largely disappeared from drug ads.",
      "\u201cIn general, I would say the ads have gotten more complete and transparent,\u201d says Ruth Day, director of the medical cognition lab at Duke University and author of the Nasonex study.",
      "The new rules are \u201csignificant steps forward,\u201d Day said, but certain requirements could also open the door to new ways of downplaying risks.",
      "One requirement instructs companies to show on-screen text about side effects while the audio information plays. A 2011 FDA study found that combining text with audio increased recall and understanding.",
      "But the agency leaves it to companies to decide whether to display a few keywords or a full transcript.",

      "Long before the COVID-19 pandemic, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was building up a following with his anti-vaccine nonprofit group, Children\u2019s Health Defense, and becoming one of the world\u2019s most influential spreaders of fear and distrust around vaccines.",
      "Now, President-elect Donald Trump says he will nominate Kennedy to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, which regulates vaccines.",
      "Kennedy has long advanced the debunked idea that vaccines cause autism. He has also pushed other conspiracy theories, such as that COVID-19 could have been \u201cethnically targeted\u201d to spare Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people, comments he later said were taken out of context. He has repeatedly brought up the Holocaust when discussing vaccines and public health mandates.",
      "No medical intervention is risk-free. But doctors and researchers have proven that risks from disease are generally far greater than the risks from vaccines.",
      "Vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective in laboratory testing and in real world use in hundreds of millions of people over decades \u2014 they are considered among the most effective public health measures in history.",
      "Kennedy has insisted that he is not anti-vaccine, saying he only wants vaccines to be rigorously tested, but he also has shown opposition to a wide range of immunizations. Kennedy said in a 2023 podcast interview that \u201cThere\u2019s no vaccine that is safe and effective\u201d and told Fox News that he still believes in the long-ago debunked idea that vaccines can cause autism. In a 2021 podcast he urged people to \u201cresist\u201d CDC guidelines on when kids should get vaccines.",
      "\u201cI see somebody on a hiking trail carrying a little baby and I say to him, better not get them vaccinated,\u201d Kennedy said.",
      "That same year, in a video promoting an anti-vaccine sticker campaign by his nonprofit, Kennedy appeared onscreen next to one sticker that declared \u201cIF YOU\u2019RE NOT AN ANTI-VAXXER YOU AREN\u2019T PAYING ATTENTION.\u201d",
      "The World Health Organization has estimated that global immunization efforts have saved at least 154 million lives in the past 50 years.",
      "In a study of verified Twitter accounts from 2021, researchers found Kennedy\u2019s personal Twitter account was the top \u201csuperspreader\u201d of vaccine misinformation on Twitter, responsible for 13% of all reshares of misinformation, more than three times the second most-retweeted account.",
      "He has traveled to states including Connecticut, California and New York to lobby or sue over vaccine policies and has traveled the world to meet with anti-vaccine activists.",
      "Kennedy has also aligned himself with businesses and special interests groups such as anti-vaccine chiropractors, who saw profit in slicing off a small portion of the larger health care market while spreading false or dubious health information.",
      "An Associated Press investigation found one chiropractic group in California had donated $500,000 to Kennedy\u2019s Children\u2019s Health Defense, about one-sixth of the group\u2019s fundraising that year. Another AP investigation found he was listed as an affiliate for an anti-vaccine video series, where he was ranked among the Top 10 for the series\u2019 \u201cOverall Sales Leaderboard.\u201d",
      "His group has co-published a number of anti-vaccine books that have been debunked. One, called \u201cCause Unknown,\u201d is built on the false premise that sudden deaths of young, healthy people are spiking due to mass administration of COVID-19 vaccines. Experts say these rare medical emergencies are not new and have not become more prevalent.",
      "An AP review of the book found dozens of individuals included in it died of known causes not related to vaccines, including suicide, choking while intoxicated, overdose and allergic reaction. One person died in 2019.",
      "Children\u2019s Health Defense currently has a lawsuit pending against a number of news organizations, among them The Associated Press, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy took leave from the group when he announced his run for president but is listed as one of its attorneys in the lawsuit."

      "\u201cWe as a government have not and will not protect anyone from criminal prosecution if they are suspected of committing criminal acts, regardless of who that may be or which duty they have,\u201d Plenkovi\u0107 said.",

      "Croatia has had severe problems with systemic and political corruption. Among the 27 European Union member countries, it is generally ranked by international anti-graft groups as one of the most corrupt states.",
      "The EPPO statement said that five of the suspects between June 2022 and Nov. 2024 \u201cteamed up\u201d to secure undue financial gains for two companies by promising and giving monetary rewards to relevant stakeholders.",
      "\u201cTheir goal was to ensure that one of the companies was allowed to sell medical robotic devices for several hospitals in Croatia,\u201d the statement added. The group was also suspected of offering bribes to manipulate the public procurement process and exclude market competition in favor of that company.",
      "\u201cOther suspects offered and handed over bribes to several relevant stakeholders in the public health system, including the minister of health and the directors of two hospitals, to gain their support for different contracts\" funded by the EU or Croatia's national budget, said the EPPO statement.",
      "This was attempted on at least four occasions but didn't work in the case of an EU-funded project in the coastal town of Split, where the responsible person refused the offered bribe, the prosecutors said.",
      "In the other three cases in various hospitals in Zagreb, the statement said the health minister allegedly approved the purchase of microscopes at prices that were increased by 619,583 euros ($654,000) in exchange of a bribe.",
      "The EPPO is the independent public prosecutors' office of the European Union. It\u202fis responsible for investigating, prosecuting and bringing to judgment crimes against the financial interests of the EU.",
      "Croatia's State Attorney Ivan Turudi\u0107 criticized the EU prosecutors for allegedly not informing Croatia's anti-graft authorities that they are also investigating Bero\u0161 and the others. He said that he will decide who is responsible for the entire case.",

      "RICHMOND, Va. -- Democrats who control both chambers of the Virginia legislature are hoping to make good on promises made on the campaign trail, including becoming the first Southern state to expand constitutional protections for abortion access.",
      "The House Privileges and Elections Committee advanced three proposed constitutional amendments Wednesday, including a measure to protect reproductive rights. Its members also discussed measures to repeal a now-defunct state constitutional ban on same-sex marriage and ways to revise Virginia's process to restore voting rights for people who served time for felony crimes.",
      "\u201cThis meeting was an important next step considering the moment in history we find ourselves in,\u201d Democratic Del. Cia Price, the committee chair, said during a news conference. \u201cWe have urgent threats to our freedoms that could impact constituents in all of the districts we serve.\u201d",
      "The at-times raucous meeting will pave the way for the House and Senate to take up the resolutions early next year after lawmakers tabled the measures last January. Democrats previously said the move was standard practice, given that amendments are typically introduced in odd-numbered years. But Republican Minority Leader Todd Gilbert said Wednesday the committee should not have delved into the amendments before next year's legislative session. He said the resolutions, particularly the abortion amendment, need further vetting.",
      "\u201cNo one who is still serving remembers it being done in this way ever,\u201d Gilbert said after the meeting. \u201cCertainly not for something this important. This is as big and weighty an issue as it gets.\u201d",
      "The Democrats' legislative lineup comes after Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin, to the dismay of voting-rights advocates, rolled back a process to restore people's civil rights after they completed sentences for felonies. Virginia is the only state that permanently bans anyone convicted of a felony from voting unless a governor restores their rights.",
      "\u201cThis amendment creates a process that is bounded by transparent rules and criteria that will apply to everybody \u2014 it's not left to the discretion of a single individual,\u201d Del. Elizabeth Bennett-Parker, the patron of the voting rights resolution, which passed along party lines, said at the news conference.",
      "Though Democrats have sparred with the governor over their legislative agenda, constitutional amendments put forth by lawmakers do not require his signature, allowing the Democrat-led House and Senate to bypass Youngkin's blessing.",
      "Instead, the General Assembly must pass proposed amendments twice in at least two years, with a legislative election sandwiched between each statehouse session. After that, the public can vote by referendum on the issues. The cumbersome process will likely hinge upon the success of all three amendments on Democrats' ability to preserve their edge in the House and Senate, where they hold razor-thin majorities.",
      "It's not the first time lawmakers have attempted to champion the three amendments. Republicans in a House subcommittee killed a constitutional amendment to restore voting rights in 2022, a year after the measure passed in a Democrat-led House. The same subcommittee also struck down legislation supporting a constitutional amendment to repeal an amendment from 2006 banning marriage equality.",
      "On Wednesday, a bipartisan group of lawmakers voted 16-5 in favor of legislation protecting same-sex marriage, with four Republicans supporting the resolution.",
      "\u201cTo say the least, voters enacted this (amendment) in 2006, and we have had 100,000 voters a year become of voting age since then,\u201d said Del. Mark Sickles, who sponsored the amendment as one of the first openly gay men serving in the General Assembly. \u201cMany people have changed their opinions of this as the years have passed.\u201d",
      "A constitutional amendment protecting abortion previously passed the Senate in 2023 but died in a Republican-led House. On Wednesday, the amendment passed on party lines.",
      "If successful, the resolution proposed by House Majority Leader Charniele Herring would be part of a growing trend of reproductive rights-related ballot questions given to voters. Since 2022, 18 questions have gone before voters across the U.S., and they have sided with abortion rights advocates 14 times.",
      "The voters have approved constitutional amendments ensuring the right to abortion until fetal viability in nine states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Ohio and Vermont. Voters also passed a right-to-abortion measure in Nevada in 2024, but it must be passed again in 2026 to be added to the state constitution.",
      "As lawmakers debated the measure, roughly 18 members spoke. Mercedes Perkins, at 38 weeks pregnant, described the importance of women making decisions about their own bodies. Rhea Simon, another Virginia resident, anecdotally described how reproductive health care shaped her life.",
      "Then all at once, more than 50 people lined up to speak against the abortion amendment.",
      "\u201cLet's do the compassionate thing and care for mothers and all unborn children,\u201d resident Sheila Furey said.",

That suit was initially dismissed by a judge in August but the group has since filed an appeal to the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals.",
      "Do No Harm is now targeting Tennessee's Board of Medical Examiners, which requires the governor to appoint at least one Black member, and Board of Chiropractic Examiners, which requires one racial minority member.",

      "\u201cWhile citizens may serve on a wide array of boards and commissions, an individual\u2019s candidacy often depends on factors outside his or her control, like age or race,\" the lawsuit states. \"Sadly, for more than thirty-five years, Tennessee governors have been required to consider an individual\u2019s race when making appointments to the state\u2019s boards, commissions, and committees.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the both the medical and chiropractic boards did not immediately return a request for comment on Thursday. Gov.

      "More than 35 years ago, the Tennessee Legislature adopted legislation directing the governor to \u201cstrive to ensure\" that at least one member on state advisory boards are ages 60 or older and at least one member who is a \u201cmember of a racial minority.\u201d",
      "Do No Harm's lawsuit does not seek overturn the age requirement in Tennessee law.",

      "Do No Harm was founded by Dr. Stanley Goldfarb, a kidney specialist and a professor emeritus and former associate dean at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s medical school. He retired in 2021 and incorporated Do No Harm \u2014 a phrase included in Hippocratic oath taken by all new physician receiving a medical degree \u2014 in 2022.",

      "The latest restructuring efforts were announced by 23andMe on Monday.

      "The restructuring arrives during a period of turmoil at California-based 23andMe, which has recently included a high-profile data breach, several rounds of previous layoffs and piling losses that plunged the company's stock over recent years.",
      "Back in September, all of 23andMe\u2019s independent directors also resigned from its board \u2014 in a rare move that followed drawn-out negotiations with Wojcicki, who has been trying to take the company private. The seven resigning directors said they had yet to receive an adequate transaction proposal from the chief executive and cited a \u201cclear\u201d difference of opinion on 23andMe\u2019s future.",
      "At the time, Wojcicki said she was \u201csurprised and disappointed\u201d by the resignations but maintained that taking 23andMe private and \u201coutside of the short-term pressures of the public markets\u201d would be best for the company long term.",

The company reported a net loss of $667 million for its last fiscal year, more than double the loss of $312 million for the year prior.",
      "23andMe posted another loss in quarterly earnings released Tuesday, although with less of a dent than in previous quarters. The company reported a net loss of $59.1 million for the 2025 fiscal year's second quarter, compared to a loss of $75.3 million for the same year prior.",
      "Revenue, however, totaled at $44.1 million for the second quarter \u2014 down from $50 million from the year prior. The company cited lower testing kit sales and telehealth orders, as well as a decrease in research revenue, but said that was partially offset by a growth in membership services.",
      "23andMe anticipates the job cuts and other restructuring efforts announced Monday to reduce its operating expenses and save the company more than $35 million annually. 23andMe also expects to incur up to $12 million in costs, primarily related to one-time severance and other termination-related expenses.",
      "23andMe ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $127 million, compared with $216 million as of March 31, 2024.",
      "Last month, 23andMe completed a 1-for-20 reverse stock split. Shares were down nearly 4% by midday Tuesday, sitting at around $4.43."

      "There is growing evidence of the value of service dogs for veterans with PTSD. A small study published in JAMA Network Open in June looked at a program operated by K9s For Warriors. Service dogs in the program are taught to pick up a veteran\u2019s physical signs of distress and can interrupt panic attacks and nightmares with a loving nudge.",
      "Researchers compared 81 veterans who received service dogs with 75 veterans on the waiting list for a trained dog. After three months, PTSD symptoms improved in both groups, but the veterans with dogs saw a bigger improvement on average.",
      "O'Brien, 40, recalled that the camp where she worked in Iraq sometimes had over 20,000 detainees. Violence and rioting were common and it left her with severe anxiety.",
      "\u201cWhen I got out of the military, I just assumed that you\u2019re supposed to be on edge all the time as a veteran,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.",
      "O\u2019Brien\u2019s mother spotted the frisky lab-poodle mix on Facebook and convinced her daughter to adopt the dog she named Albus. Months later, O'Brien learned about Dogs 4 Valor, and the pair joined the program in October 2023.",
      "O\u2019Brien says she can now go out in public again \u2014 she even went on vacation to Branson, Missouri, \u201cthings that I never would have thought I would do really, probably ever again.\u201d",
      "Mark Atkinson, 38, served in Afghanistan as a corporal in the Marine Corps. He returned home with PTSD and major depressive disorder, causing sleeplessness and anxiety. He adopted Lexi, now 5, in 2020.",
      "Lexi, a muscular cane corso breed, needed Atkinson as much as he needed her. Her previous owner had kept Lexi in chains before surrendering her. Since joining Dogs 4 Valor, the two can get out together and enjoy life.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t really like leaving the house because I\u2019m safe there, you know?\" Atkinson said. \u201cAnd having Lexi has just made me get out to be more social.\u201d",
      "Having a group of fellow veterans facing the same challenges has also helped, Atkinson said.",
      "\u201cWe come from the same backgrounds, different branches,\u201d Atkinson said. \u201cSame issues. You know, PTSD or traumatic brain injuries. And they\u2019re all very welcoming, as well. There\u2019s no judgment.\u201d",
      "O\u2019Brien compared living with Albus to a relationship with a sometimes pushy best friend who often wants to go out.",
      "\u201cThe best friend constantly wants to make you do things that make you nervous,\u201d O\u2019Brien laughed, acknowledging that it is ultimately up to her.",
      "\u201cI have to decide to walk out and just deal with life,\" O'Brien said. \"And so that has been hard. And it still is hard from time to time, but it\u2019s it\u2019s getting manageable.\u201d",
      "Some veterans said their family relationships have improved since they started the program.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m able to talk, not fly off the handle and just get along with people and not be as stressed, not have as much anxiety,\u201d Atkinson said. \u201cOr even if I do, she (Lexi) is right there with me.\u201d",
      "Timothy Siebenmorgen, 61, said his relationships also are better with help from his 1-year-old American bulldog, Rosie, and Dogs 4 Valor, which he joined in July. He served in both the Marines and the Army, deploying 18 times.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re in the military, kind of taught not to show weakness,\" Siebenmorgen said. \"So you figure you can tackle everything yourself and you honestly believe that. And then you realize you can\u2019t do it on your own.\u201d",
      "Veterans said the dogs, and the program, have given them new hope and a renewed ability to move forward.",
      "\u201cI got my life back,\u201d O\u2019Brien said."

    "summary": "Doctors say requests for permanent sterilizations and long-term birth control like IUDs have surged across the nation since Donald Trump was elected president last week",
    "story": [
      "Doctors say requests for permanent sterilizations and long-term birth control like IUDs have surged across the nation since Donald Trump was elected president last week",
      "Hours after Donald Trump was elected president for the second time, Dr. Clayton Alfonso had two messages from patients seeking to replace their IUDs. Over the next few days, three women inquired about getting their tubes tied.",
      "All of them said the election was the reason they were making these choices now.",
      "Requests for long-term birth control and permanent sterilizations have surged across the nation since the election, doctors told The Associated Press. And companies that sell emergency contraception and abortion pills say they're seeing significant spikes in requests from people who are stockpiling the medications \u2014 one saw a 966% increase in sales of emergency contraception from the week before in the 60 hours after the election.",
      "\u201cI saw this bump after the Trump election in 2016\" and after Roe vs. Wade was overturned in 2022, said Alfonso, an OB-GYN at Duke University in North Carolina. \u201cBut the patients seem more afraid this time.\u201d",
      "Although anti-abortion advocates are pressing Trump for more restrictions on abortion pills, it's unclear what \u2014 if much \u2014 will be done regarding access to contraceptives of any kind during the second Trump administration. Trump told a Pittsburgh television station in May that he was open to supporting regulations on contraception. But after media reports on the interview, he wrote on his social media platform Truth Social that he \u201chas never and will never\u201d advocate for restricting birth control and other contraceptives.",
      "Alfonso said his patients want to replace still-effective IUDs and \u201crestart\u201d the 3-to-12-year clock on them before the inauguration. He also said the women are particularly concerned about IUDs, which have been attacked by abortion opponents who believe life begins when an egg is fertilized. Experts believe the devices work mostly by blocking fertilization, but also may make it harder for a fertilized egg to implant in the womb.",
      "A patient who requested a tubal ligation Tuesday told Alfonso she doesn\u2019t want kids and is \u201cjust absolutely terrified of either forced pregnancy or inability to access contraception.\"",
      "Pittsburgh OB-GYN and abortion provider Dr. Grace Ferguson said more of her patients are scheduling IUD insertions or stockpiling emergency contraception, telling her upfront that it\u2019s \u201cbecause of the upcoming administration change.\u201d",
      "One patient, Mara Zupko, said she wants prescription emergency contraception since she\u2019s on the cusp of the weight limit for Plan B, the most well-known over-the-counter type. Her husband is getting a vasectomy.",
      "\u201cWe always kind of teetered on whether we wanted children or not,\u201d said Zupko, 27. \u201dBut as the world has become scarier and scarier, we realized we didn\u2019t want to bring a child into that environment. And I also have several health risks.\u201d",
      "Women are also turning to companies that sell emergency contraception online or offer abortion pills mifepristone and misoprostol through telehealth \u2014 something that's been happening even before the election, but that some companies say has accelerated.",
      "A study earlier this year showed the abortion pill supplier Aid Access received about 48,400 requests from across the U.S. for so-called \u201cadvance provision\u201d pills from September 2021 through April 2023 \u2014 with requests highest right after news leaked about Roe being overturned but before the formal announcement. Other research found that more women had their tubes tied post-Roe, with the biggest increases in states that ban abortion.",
      "Mifepristone has a shelf life of about five years and misoprostol around two years, according to Plan C, an organization that provides information about medical abortions. Plan B typically has a shelf life of four years.",
      "Telehealth company Wisp saw orders for abortion pills spike 600% between Election Day and the following day. And between Nov. 6 and 11, the company saw a 460% increase in sales of its emergency contraception and birth control offerings.",
      "At Gen Z-focused Winx Health, which sells emergency contraception called Restart, company leaders saw a 966% increase in sales in the 60 hours following the election compared with the week before. Sales of \u201cvalue packs\u201d of Restart \u2014 four doses instead of one \u2014 were up more than 7,000% in the past week.",
      "\"Morning after pills\u201d are legal in all states, but Winx co-founder Cynthia Plotch said many people seem confused about what emergency contraception is compared to abortion pills. In a 2023 poll by the health policy research organization KFF, a majority of responders said they know these two things aren't the same, but only 27% reported knowing emergency contraceptive pills cannot end a pregnancy.",
      "Doctors agree confusion around morning after pills may explain some of the stockpiling. But Alfonso at Duke suspects most people are doing this for the same reason they are seeking longer-term methods of birth control: to avoid abortion by preventing pregnancy in the first place.",
      "Alfonso predicts the birth control and abortion pill surge may level out like it did in 2016 and 2022. If the new administration \u201cis not focused on health care right away,\" he said, \"then I think it\u2019ll go to the back of people\u2019s minds until it picks up in the media.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- Cases of mpox in the region of Congo where a new and more infectious variant was first detected appear to be \u201cplateauing,\u201d the World Health Organization said on Monday, even as the virus continues to increase in other areas of the country, as well as in Burundi and Uganda.",
      "A report by the U.N. health agency said the number of mpox infections \u201cshows a general rising trend,\u201d but that they may have plateaued in South Kivu, where the more infectious form of mpox was first identified to be spreading earlier this year among sex workers and miners in the gold mining town of Kamituga.",
      "WHO acknowledged that testing is still not widespread, making it difficult to understand how exactly the virus is spreading.",
      "According to data from last week, Congo reported fewer than 100 laboratory-confirmed mpox cases, down from nearly 400 in July. In recent weeks, experts say that infections appear to be stabilizing, offering a chance for health authorities to definitively stamp out the outbreak.",
      "So far, about 50,000 people in Congo have been immunized against mpox. The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 3 million vaccines are needed to stop the outbreak.",
      "Last week, Africa CDC's director Dr. Jean Kaseya said the continent was \u201cstill in the acute phase\u201d of the mpox epidemic, with 19 countries affected. He warned that without more resources, the virus could become a global threat.",
      "WHO said the Burundi outbreak is also being driven by the newer variant, which causes less severe symptoms \u2014 meaning people who are infectious may not realize they are spreading it. In the last two weeks, Burundi has reported more than 200 new mpox cases every week, mostly in children and young adults.",
      "In Uganda, which reported 100 new cases last week, WHO said the virus is spreading mostly through sex, with the vast majority of cases in adults.",
      "Mpox -- previously known as monkeypox because it was first seen in research monkeys \u2014 is spread primarily through close skin-to-skin contact with infected people or their soiled clothes or bedsheets. It often causes visible skin lesions that could make people less likely to be in close contact with others.",
      "In August, WHO declared the rapid spread of mpox in Congo and elsewhere in Africa to be a global health emergency. To date, Africa has reported more than 46,000 suspected cases, including 1,081 deaths.",
      "WHO said it would convene an expert meeting on Nov. 22 to determine if mpox still constitutes an international emergency.",
      "Last week, Britain announced the first instance of the more infectious kind of mpox spreading beyond Africa. It identified mpox in a person who had recently traveled to Africa and in three of their household contacts. All the individuals are currently being treated in two London hospitals.",

    "story": [
      "Seven-year-old Halima Abou Yassine was brought to Lebanon from Gaza for treatment after an Israeli strike left her near death with a gaping wound in her skull",
      "BEIRUT -- When Zarifa Nawfal\u2019s family arrived in Beirut for her wounded daughter\u2019s surgery, one of the first things she wanted to do was go to the sea. The Mediterranean had been a constant companion at their home in Gaza before the war.",
      "\u201cThe moment I smelled the sea, I felt at peace inside \u2014 as if I were in Gaza,\u201d she said.",
      "But soon their place of refuge reminded her of home in far more distressing ways.",
      "Nawfal\u2019s 7-year-old daughter, Halima Abou Yassine, is one of a dozen severely wounded Palestinian children brought to Lebanon this year for treatment through a program launched by a British-Palestinian surgeon, Dr. Ghassan Abu Sitta.",
      "But months after their arrival, Lebanon is itself embroiled in a war some fear will end in Gaza-like destruction.",
      "In February, Nawfal was staying with her five children and her mother in an apartment in central Gaza. They had been displaced from their home in the north and Nawfal\u2019s husband was missing, likely dead.",
      "The children were filling water containers outside when two missiles struck, Nawfal said. She rushed outside and found Halima, the youngest, lying in the street, her skull cracked open, her brain exposed.",
      "Through her shock, Nawfal said, \u201cI was relieved that her body was in one piece.\u201d In Gaza, blasts often ripped people apart, leaving their loved ones without even a body to bury.",
      "Halima\u2019s brother was unconscious next to her. He was quickly revived at the hospital. But staff at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital confirmed Nawfal\u2019s fears, she said: Halima was dead. Her small body was placed in the morgue.",
      "But as the family was preparing to bury her, the little girl\u2019s uncle noticed faint signs of life, the family said.",
      "Officials at Al-Aqsa hospital could not be reached to confirm the account. But Abu Sitta, who has worked in several Gaza hospitals during the war, said in the chaotic situation it was not uncommon for patients to be misidentified as dead because normal protocols for emergency room examinations were often abandoned.",
      "\u201cBecause of the sheer number of cases that would come in with each air raid ... the ambulance staff would take to the morgue immediately those who they thought were dead,\" he said.",
      "In the days after her daughter was determined to be alive, Nawfal stayed with her, manually pumping oxygen into her lungs. After a week, the little girl began to breathe on her own. Finally, she woke up.",
      "\u201cSome of the doctors cried and said this is a miracle,\u201d Nawfal said.",
      "But they were unable to do more than keep the little girl alive. Her skull was still gaping open, a shard of bone missing. Her brain was beset by infection.",
      "The family was evacuated to Egypt in May. In July, they boarded a plane for Lebanon.",
      "The first of the wounded Palestinian children arrived in Lebanon in May. Five-year-old Adam Afana had nearly lost his left arm in a blast that killed his father and sister. His arm was paralyzed and he needed a complex surgery to correct the nerve damage.",
      "At the time, Lebanon was already embroiled in a low-simmering conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.",
      "The Lebanese militant group began firing rockets across the border into Israel in support of its ally, Hamas, on Oct. 8, 2023, a day after Palestinian militants staged the deadly surprise incursion into southern Israel that sparked the ongoing war in Gaza. Israel responded with shelling and airstrikes.",
      "For months, the conflict in Lebanon was mainly confined to the border area, far from Beirut.",
      "Abu Sitta said he chose Lebanon for the wounded children's treatment because the Mediterranean country has specialists with wide experience treating war injuries.",
      "Lebanon has been through its share of conflicts, including a 15-year civil war that ended in 1990 and a brutal monthlong war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006, as well as spillover effects from other regional conflicts.",
      "\u201cEven after the end of the wars (in Lebanon), the wounded from Iraq and Syria would come here for that kind of complex and multistage treatment,\u201d Abu Sitta said.",
      "In July, Halima underwent successful surgery to repair her skull at the American University of Beirut Medical Center.",
      "Nawfal said her daughter has lingering memory problems but is improving with therapy. A chipper, happy-go-lucky child, Halima thrived in Beirut. She swam in the hotel pool, loved to color and played with the other children from Gaza. She walked with her siblings to pick out fruit at the neighborhood produce stand, a straw hat covering the scar on the back of her head.",
      "In mid-September, Israel launched an offensive against Hezbollah. It pummeled wide swathes of Lebanon with airstrikes, including Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs and some sites within the city center.",
      "The children quickly snapped back into wartime habits. They cracked open the balcony's sliding glass doors to prevent the glass shattering from the pressure of a blast and began sleeping in the central sitting room in the family\u2019s hotel suite, away from windows.",
      "Nawfal said some organizations offered to evacuate the family from Lebanon to continue treatment elsewhere, but she \u201ccompletely refused.\u201d",
      "\u201cLebanon isn\u2019t just another Arab country or a country we came to for treatment \u2014 Lebanon is a sister to Gaza,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are like two souls in one body. ... We live or die together.\u201d",
      "Adam Afana's uncle, Eid Afana, said the escalation in Lebanon \u201creminds us of the beginning of the war in Gaza.\u201d Afana said the sound of airstrikes frightened Adam, who felt the war was pursuing them.",
      "\u201cWhat we hope for Lebanon is that what happened in Gaza won\u2019t happen here \u2014 that the beginning and the ending won\u2019t both be the same,\u201d Afana said.",
      "The Ghassan Abu Sitta Fund halted bringing wounded Palestinian children to Lebanon but continues to treat the existing patients \u2014 with some challenges.",
      "Since arriving in Beirut, Adam has undergone a procedure to clear infection from his bones, a neurosurgery and regular physiotherapy sessions. With effort, he can now slightly clench his hand.",
      "But the final operation \u2014 a muscle transfer and surgery to repair the damaged nerves to his arm \u2014 is on hold.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just a handful of people who specialize in this globally, and we were expecting one of them to come to Lebanon,\u201d Abu Sitta said. The trip has been delayed by the escalation in Lebanon.",
      "When he first launched the program, Abu Sitta hoped to treat 50 Palestinian children from Gaza at any given time. Unable to bring more patients in, the team is turning its resources to treating Lebanese children.",
      "The numbers of wounded Lebanese children are still far lower than in Gaza. As of last week, Lebanon\u2019s Ministry of Public Health said 192 children had been killed and at least 1,255 wounded since October 2023. In Gaza, more than 13,000 children have been killed and thousands more have been wounded, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.",
      "Abu Sitta said the wounds of children in Lebanon are \u201cidentical to the injuries of Palestinian children from Gaza.\u201d Most were wounded while at home. They suffered \u201ccrush injuries to the limbs, blast injuries to the face\u201d and often \u201cmultiple members of the family killed at the same time,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cAs in Gaza, this war takes its toll on children,\u201d he said. \u201cAll wars are waged on children.\u201d"

      "Four women suing over Idaho\u2019s strict abortion ban told a judge Tuesday how excitement over their pregnancies turned to grief and fear after they learned their fetuses were not likely to survive to birth \u2014 and how they had to leave the state to get abor...",
      "BOISE, Idaho -- Four women suing over Idaho's strict abortion bans told a judge Tuesday how excitement over their pregnancies turned to grief and fear after they learned their fetuses were not likely to survive to birth \u2014 and how they had to leave the state to get abortions amid fears that pregnancy complications would put their own health in danger.",
      "\u201cWe felt like we were being made refugees, medical refugees,\u201d said Jennifer Adkins, one of the plaintiffs in the case.",
      "The women, represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights, aren't asking for the state's abortion ban to be overturned. Instead, they want the judge to clarify and expand the exceptions to the strict ban so that people facing serious pregnancy complications can receive abortions before they are at death's door.",
      "Currently, the state's near-total ban makes performing an abortion a felony at any stage of pregnancy unless it is \u201cnecessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.\u201d",
      "Adkins' fetus had a severe medical condition that meant it would not survive the pregnancy. The illness also put Adkins at risk of developing \u201cmirror syndrome,\u201d a dangerous syndrome that can cause fatally high blood pressure and other issues, she said.",
      "Adkins and her husband decided to seek an abortion, and learned they would have to go out of state to get one after another ultrasound showed the fetus still had a heartbeat.",
      "\u201cNo parent wants to wish that when they look at an ultrasound they don't see their baby's heartbeat, yet here I was hoping that I wouldn't,\u201d Adkins said. \u201cI wanted the decision to be made for us, and I wanted to end her suffering, so it was really hard to see that and know that we had the challenges ahead of us that we did.\u201d",
      "Kayla Smith cried as she told the judge how she found out she was pregnant for a second time on Mother's Day of 2022, and how she and her husband chose the name \u201cBrooks\u201d for their son. She was around 18 or 20 weeks along in her pregnancy when the sonographer grew quiet during a routine anatomy scan, Smith said.",
      "Brooks' heart had fatal anomalies, and the young family could not find a pediatric cardiologist willing to attempt an operation. The veins supplying Brooks' lungs were also abnormal, Smith said, and he would not survive birth.",
      "Smith had developed dangerously high blood pressure during a previous pregnancy, and she was at risk of developing the condition called preeclampsia again.",
      "\u201cIf I were to continue pregnancy not only would I risk my life with preeclampsia, I was not willing to watch my son suffer and potentially gasp for air,\u201d Smith said, crying.",
      "Idaho's abortion ban went into effect two days before Brooks' diagnosis, she said, making it impossible for her to get an abortion in her home state.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to meet our son \u2014 that was really important to us \u2014 so we needed to do it in a hospital,\u201d she said. They took out a loan to cover the estimated $16,000 to $20,000 out-of-network cost and drove more than eight hours to a hospital where doctors induced labor.",
      "\u201cAll four of these women were overjoyed to be pregnant with their second child and all four of them received the worst news a mother can imagine,\u201d attorney Gail Deady, with the Center for Reproductive Rights, told 4th District Judge Jason D. Scott during opening arguments. All of them sought abortions \u201cto protect their health, to spare their babies from pain and suffering, and to remain alive and healthy to protect their young children.\u201d",
      "James Craig, a division chief with the Idaho Attorney General\u2019s office, said the women and their attorneys are relying on hypotheticals rather than concrete facts to make their case. Under their proposal, a pregnant woman could receive her abortion for something as minor as stepping on a rusty nail \u2014 even though the risk of infection in that scenario could be easily treated by receiving a tetanus booster shot, Craig said.",
      "\u201cUnborn children have a fundamental right to life, and protecting the lives of children is a legitimate and fundamental government interest,\u201d Craig said.",
      "The state also has the same interest in protecting the lives of women, Craig said \u2014 and the abortion ban laws do both, he contended.",
      "In the \u201crare circumstances where abortion is necessary\u201d to prevent the death of the mother, Idaho law allows that to occur, Craig said. The women suing are trying to \u201cusurp the role of the Legislature\u201d by asking the judge to rewrite the law, he said, and that is not the proper role of the court.",
      "Dr. Emily Corrigan, an ob-gyn who works in emergency medicine at Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center who is also a plaintiff in the case, told the judge how Idaho\u2019s multiple abortion bans have created confusion for physicians and made it difficult to treat pregnant patients who need emergency care.",
      "Doctors have had to \u201cbasically guess which pregnancy conditions would fall under the state medical exception,\u201d Corrigan said.",
      "\u201cI have had other hospital staff refuse to participate in the care of my patients because of the lack of understanding of the laws, and this has caused patient care delays,\u201d she said. \u201cI have personally cared for several patients who have been denied stabilizing abortion care at other hospitals in Idaho. By the time they arrive at my institution, their conditions have deteriorated and have lead to increased complications that I need to manage.\u201d",
      "Several conditions can put the health of pregnant people at risk, she said. Some are caused by pregnancy like preeclampsia, and others \u2014 including some chronic illnesses and cancers \u2014 can be made worse by pregnancy, she said. In those cases, delaying an abortion might not cause immediate death but can cause a shortened life span or have dramatic effects on a person's health, Corrigan said.",
      "\u201cWe are not trained to wait until things become urgent or emergent. We are trained to prevent harm to our patients,\u201d she said."

      "Opposition protesters in Georgia's breakaway province of Abkhazia have refused to cede control of key government buildings seized during rallies on Friday during which at least 14 people were injured in clashes with police",
      "TBILISI, Georgia -- Opposition protesters in Georgia's breakaway province of Abkhazia have refused to cede control of key government buildings that demonstrators stormed to protest new measures allowing Russians to buy property in the area.",
      "Abkhazian President Aslan Bzhania announced Saturday that he would step down and hold early elections if demonstrators vacated the region's parliament building. But crowds that gathered in the Abkhazian capital, Sukhumi, rejected the deal and opposition leaders said they would only accept Bzhania's unconditional resignation.",
      "\u201cNone of us have come here for the sake of seats (in parliament),\u201d former Abkhazian Prime Minister Valery Bganba told the crowd in a video livestreamed on social media. \u201cWe came here to save our people, our country.\u201d",

      "Lawmakers had gathered at the region\u2019s parliament building to discuss ratifying measures allowing Russian citizens to buy property in the breakaway state. However, the session was postponed as demonstrators broke down the gate to the building\u2019s grounds with a truck and streamed inside. Some threw rocks at police, who responded with tear gas.",
      "Most of Abkhazia broke away from Georgia in fighting that ended in 1993, and Georgia lost control of the rest of the territory in the short war with Russia in 2008. Russia recognizes Abkhazia as an independent country, but many Abkhazians are concerned that the region of about 245,000 people is a client state of Moscow.",
      "Opponents of the property agreement say it will drive up prices of apartments and boost Moscow\u2019s dominance in the region. Abkhazia\u2019s mountains and Black Sea beaches make it a popular destination for Russian tourists and the demand for holiday homes could be strong.",

    "story": [
      "When Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the conventional wisdom was that the capital, Kyiv, would soon fall and the rest of the country wouldn\u2019t last long against a much larger enemy",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- When Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine in February 2022, the conventional wisdom was that the capital, Kyiv, would soon fall and the rest of the country wouldn\u2019t last long against a much larger enemy.",
      "Instead, it was that narrative that quickly collapsed. The Ukrainian army proved it could slow the advance of Russia\u2019s forces and, if not drive them out completely, then \u2013 with enough support from the West \u2013 at least forestall defeat.",
      "But nearly three years later, the outlook is again grim. Russia is expending huge amounts of weaponry and human life to make small-but-steady territorial gains to the nearly one-fifth of Ukraine it already controls. Ukraine, meanwhile, is struggling to minimize losses, maintain morale and convince allies that, with more military aid, it can turn the tide.",
      "As this brutal war of attrition grinds toward its 1,000th day, neither side seems eager to negotiate. President-elect Donald Trump has said he could quickly end the war, though it is unclear how or in whose favor he might tip the scales.",
      "This backdrop appears to be driving Russia\u2019s strategy in eastern Ukraine, according to Phillips O\u2019Brien, a professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews, Scotland. Trump could try to force an end to the war by halting the supply of weapons to Ukraine, he said.",
      "\u201cIf Trump cuts aid to Ukraine and a cease-fire leads to a frozen conflict, Russia wants to secure as much territory as it can now,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.",
      "For Ukraine, the key to any cease-fire would be guarantees from the West that it won't allow Russia to re-invade in the future. Otherwise, O'Brien said, \u201ca cease-fire is a recipe for constant instability in Europe.\u201d",
      "In the war's first year, Ukraine lost huge amounts of territory \u2014 but it also achieved notable victories. It resisted a much larger adversary with superior air power to survive as an independent country, and it reclaimed some land through gutsy counteroffensives, giving the underdog \u2014 and its wealthy allies \u2014 the confidence to stay in the fight.",
      "In the second year, which was punctuated by Ukraine's devastating loss of Bakhmut and its failed counteroffensive, the armies essentially fought to a standstill along a 1,000 kilometer (620 mile) front line. Toward the end of that year, the U.S. Congress delayed the approval of a $61 billion package of aid for weapons, and economic and humanitarian assistance.",
      "With Ukraine's ammunition dwindling, its outlook deteriorated significantly as the war\u2019s third year began. In February 2024, the town of Avdiivka fell after months of airstrikes by Russia, which used highly destructive Soviet-era bombs retrofitted with navigation systems.",
      "The fall of Avdiivka created a major breach in Ukraine\u2019s defenses. When Russia later mounted an assault on the northeastern city of Kharkiv, Ukrainian troops were stretched further.",
      "A bright spot for Ukraine came in August, when it launched a surprise incursion into Russia. It took \u2014 and still holds \u2014 hundreds of square kilometers in the Kursk region. While this could be an important chip in any cease-fire negotiations, it hasn't stopped Russian forces from taking more land in Ukraine's east.",
      "\u201cThe Russians have paid a very high price to keep advancing, but they\u2019re willing to pay that price in lives to gain a few more meters of territory each day,\u201d said Justin Crump, head of the British strategic advisory firm Sibylline.",
      "Tens of thousands of soldiers from both countries have been killed since the start of the war in 2022, according to estimates, and the U.N. says at least 11,700 Ukrainian civilians have been killed.",
      "While the amount of land Russia has gained in 2024 \u2014 about 2,455 square kilometers (948 square miles)\u2014 is equal to less than 1% of Ukraine\u2019s pre-war territory, it is having a psychological impact.",
      "With Ukraine in retreat, \u201cwe\u2019ve now returned to a period reminiscent of the (war's) first months,\u201d said Mykola Bielieskov, an analyst at CBA Initiatives Center in Kyiv. \u201cThis strengthens Russia\u2019s position \u2014 not so much militarily, but in terms of morale.\u201d",
      "To keep its war machine going, Russia \u2014 like Ukraine \u2014 has turned to allies for help.",
      "Iran supplies Russia with drones and possibly missiles, and North Korea has sent ammunition \u2014 and even troops, who have been deployed to Russia's Kursk region.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed this year that 700,000 of his troops are fighting in Ukraine. Analysts say Putin would need a much larger force to accelerate Russia\u2019s advance, but that he is unlikely to mobilize more troops because it could stoke internal discontent.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s foothold in Kursk is another complicating factor for Putin, and it could be used as a bargaining chip in any future cease-fire negotiations.",
      "Captain Yevhen Karas, a Ukrainian commander in Kursk, said the fighting inside Russia is highly dynamic, but he believes it will prove effective in diverting Russia's attention and resources.",
      "\u201cEven a creeping, retreating front exhausts the enemy significantly,\u201d Karas said.",
      "Ukraine has asked the West for longer range missiles and its blessing to fire at air bases deep inside Russia. But its allies have so far resisted, wary of escalating tensions with a nuclear-armed Russia.",
      "The U.S. has provided more than $64 billion in military aid to Ukraine since the war began 1,000 days ago. Soldiers worry about what would happen without sustained American support.",
      "\u201cBravery, heroism, and spirit alone are not enough,\u201d said a Ukrainian soldier in the eastern Donetsk region who spoke on condition of anonymity, in line with military rules.",
      "The soldier estimated that where he is stationed Russian infantry outnumber Ukrainian troops 10 to 1. As the war drags on and the death toll rises, it has become increasingly difficult for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to keep replacing troops.",
      "What direction the war takes next will depend in large part on how the incoming Trump administration plays its hand.",
      "Trump, who has touted his good relationship with President Vladimir Putin and called the Russian leader \u201cpretty smart\u201d for invading Ukraine, has repeatedly criticized American backing of Ukraine.",
      "During his only campaign debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump twice refused to directly answer a question about whether he wanted Ukraine to win \u2014 raising concerns that Kyiv could be forced to accept unfavorable terms in any negotiations.",
      "Without security guarantees from the West, Ukraine could find itself vulnerable to future Russian aggression. Analysts say a cease-fire based on the current state of the battlefield would set a dangerous precedent, implying that Europe's borders are up for grabs through military action \u2014 something that hasn\u2019t happened since World War II.",
      "\u201cThis would also have a lot of traction in countries like China, India, and elsewhere,\u201d said Richard Connolly, a Russia expert at the Royal United Services Institute in London. \u201cThey could present that as a strategic defeat not only for Ukraine, but also for the West.\u201d",
      "As another winter of war approaches, Ukrainian soldiers say they remain resolute.",
      "\u201cWe are standing strong, giving it our all, and we won\u2019t surrender,\u201d said a battalion chief of staff in the southern region of Zaporizhzhia. \u201cThe most important thing now is not to lose more land.\u201d",

The thermobaric warheads create a vortex of high pressure and heat that can penetrate thick walls.

The idea was to launch armed drones along with dozens of decoys, sometimes stuffed with rags or foam, and indistinguishable on radar from those carrying real bombs. Ukrainian forces must make split-second decisions about how to expend scarce resources to save lives and preserve critical infrastructure.",
      "\u201cThe idea was to make a drone which would create a feeling of complete uncertainty for the enemy. So he doesn\u2019t know whether it\u2019s really a deadly weapon ... or essentially a foam toy,\u201d the person said. With the thermobarics, there is now a \u201chuge risk\u201d an armed drone could deviate from its course and end up in a residential area where the \u201cdamage will be simply terrifying,\u201d he said.",
      "In recent weeks, decoys have filled Ukraine\u2019s skies by the dozens, each one appearing as an indistinguishable blip on military radar screens. During the first weekend of November, the Kyiv region spent 20 hours under air alert, and the sound of buzzing drones mingled with the boom of air defenses and rifle shots.",
      "Unarmed decoys now make up more than half the drones targeting Ukraine, according to the person and Serhii Beskrestnov, a Ukrainian electronics expert whose black military van is kitted out with electronic jammers to down drones.",
      "Both the unarmed decoys and the armed Iranian-designed Shahed drones are being built at a factory in Russia\u2019s Alabuga Special Economic Zone, an industrial complex set up in 2006 about 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) east of Moscow to attract businesses and investment to Tatarstan. It expanded after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine and some sectors switched to military production,  adding new buildings and renovating existing sites, according to satellite images analyzed by The Associated Press.",
      "In social media videos, the factory promotes itself as an innovation hub. But David Albright of the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security said Alabuga\u2019s current purpose is purely to produce and sell drones to Russia\u2018s Ministry of Defense. The videos and other promotional media were taken down after an AP investigation found that many of the African women recruited to fill labor shortages there complained they were duped into taking jobs at the plant.",
      "Russia and Iran signed a $1.7 billion deal for the Shaheds in 2022, after President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, and Moscow began using Iranian imports of the unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs, in battle later that year. Soon after the deal was signed, production started in Alabuga.",
      "In October, Moscow attacked with at least 1,889 drones \u2013 80% more than in August, according to an AP analysis tracking the drones for months. On Saturday, Russia launched 145 drones across Ukraine, just days after the re-election of Donald Trump threw into doubt U.S. support for the country.",
      "Since summer, most drones crash, are shot down or are diverted by electronic jamming, according to an AP analysis of Ukrainian military briefings. Less than 6% hit a discernible target, according to the data analyzed by AP since the end of July. But the sheer numbers mean a handful can slip through every day \u2013 and that is enough to be deadly.",
      "The swarms have become a demoralizing fact of life for Ukrainians.",
      "Russian drone tactics continue to evolve. Now, more powerful missiles often follow close behind as air defenses are exhausted by the drones. The most destructive are the ballistic and cruise missiles that fly many times faster than the drones, which buzz loudly and can be tracked by the naked eye.",
      "Even the decoys can be useful to Russia. One decoy with a live-feed camera allows the aircraft to geolocate Ukraine\u2019s air defenses and relay the information to Russia in the final moments of its mechanical life.",
      "Night after night, Ukrainian sharpshooters spring into action to down the drones with portable surface-to-air missiles.",
      "One sharpshooter, who like most Ukrainian soldiers asked to be identified by his call-sign Rosmaryn, said he\u2019s shot down perhaps a dozen drones in all over nearly two years and saw one that was stuffed with rags and foam. Rosmaryn sees his adversary in almost human terms, describing the aircraft\u2019s quest to outwit his small unit.",
      "\u201cIt was part of a swarm, flying as one of the last ones,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s in the sky, we can\u2019t tell what kind it is, because everything is inside the drone. We only find out after it\u2019s shot down.\u201d",
      "Many fly at 2,000 to 3,000 meters (6,500 feet to around 10,000 feet) before dropping to lower altitudes on their final approach, Rosmaryn said. Leaked videos suggest Ukraine is now using helicopters to shoot down the high-altitude drones.",
      "Three decoys of Russian origin have crashed in Moldova in the past week, authorities there said.",
      "Thanks to optical trickery, radar can\u2019t distinguish a drone armed with a Shahed\u2019s usual 50-kilogram payload of explosives or with a thermobaric weapon \u2013 also known as a vacuum bomb \u2013 from those without a warhead or topped with live-feed surveillance cameras. There are also other even rougher-quality drones, armed and unarmed, but in fewer quantities than the Shahed-style unmanned aircraft.",
      "That\u2019s why, even knowing that decoys now make up most of an incoming swarm, Ukraine can\u2019t afford to let anything through.",
      "\u201cFor us, it\u2019s just a point on the radar \u2026 It has speed, direction, and altitude,\u201d said Col. Yurii Ihnat, an Air Force spokesman. \u201cWe have no way of identifying the exact target during flight, so we have to either jam them with electronic warfare or use firepower to neutralize them. The enemy uses these to scatter our attention.\u201d",
      "The engines and electronics for the armed Shaheds and decoys are a mix of Chinese and Western imports, according to fragments seen by The Associated Press at a Ukrainian military lab. Without them, the drones can\u2019t fly. Despite nearly three years of sanctions, Moscow can still source the parts \u2013 largely from China and via third countries in Central Asia and the Middle East.",
      "Halfway through the series of air alerts on Nov. 2, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the swarms of Shaheds, which he put at 2,000 for the month of October alone, were made possible by Western technology slipping through sanctions.",
      "\u201cIncluded in this many Shaheds are more than 170,000 components that should have been blocked for delivery to Russia. Microcircuits, microcontrollers, processors, many different parts, without which this terror would simply be impossible,\u201d Zelenskyy said.",
      "The joint manufacturing of the drones \u2014 some to carry bombs, others to divert attention \u2014 is saving Russia's military money. Production of the decoys started earlier this year and now the plant turns out about 40 of the cheaper unarmed drones a day and around 10 armed ones, which cost an estimated $50,000 and take longer to produce, according to the person with knowledge of Russian drone production.",
      "The Russian news outlet Izvestia in late October said the aim of the decoy is to \u201dweaken\u201d the enemy by forcing it to waste ammunition before sending in armed Shaheds.",
      "Both Beskrestnov and the person familiar with Russian drone production said engineers at Alabuga are also constantly experimenting, putting Moscow at the cutting edge of drone production. To make electronic interference harder, they add Ukrainian SIM cards, roaming SIMS, Starlinks, fiberoptics \u2013 and can sometimes receive real-time feedback before the drones are jammed, downed or run out of fuel. Sometimes they attach a silver-painted foam ball to make the drone seem larger on a radar.",
      "But the latest thermobaric variant is causing new anguish in Ukraine.",
      "From a military point of view, thermobarics are ideal for going after targets that are either inside fortified buildings or deep underground.",
      "Alabuga\u2019s thermobaric drones are particularly destructive when they strike buildings, because they are also loaded with ball bearings to cause maximum damage even beyond the superheated blast, said Albright.",
      "Beskrestnov, who is more widely known as Flash and whose black military van is kitted out with electronic jammers to down drones, said the thermobarics were first used over the summer and estimated they now make up between 3% and 5% of all drones.",
      "\u201cThis type of warhead has the possibility to destroy a huge building, especially block flats. And it\u2019s very effective if the Russian Federation tries to attack our power plants,\u201d he said.",
      "They have a fearsome reputation because of the physical effects even on people caught outside the initial blast site, said Arthur van Coller, an expert in international humanitarian law at South Africa\u2019s University of Fort Hare.",
      "\u201cWith a thermobaric explosion, because of the cloud it would create, everything in its radius would be affected,\u201d he said. \u201cIt creates massive fear in the civilian population. Thermobaric weapons have created this idea that they are really horrible weapons and that creates fear.\u201d",

      "Some women who fled the war in Sudan say they face sexual exploitation as refugees in Chad",
      "ADRE, Chad -- Crossing into Chad, the 27-year-old thought she'd left the horrors of Sudan's war behind: the bodies she ran over while fleeing, the screams of girls being raped, the disappearance of her husband when gunmen attacked. But now she says she has faced more suffering \u2014 being forced as a refugee to have sex to get by.",
      "She cradled her 7-week-old son, who she asserted was the child of an aid worker who promised her money in exchange for sex.",
      "\u201cThe children were crying. We ran out of food,\" she said of her four other children. \u201cHe abused my situation.\u201d She and other women who spoke to The Associated Press requested anonymity because they feared retribution.",
      "Some Sudanese women and girls assert that men, including those meant to protect them such as humanitarian workers and local security forces, have sexually exploited them in Chad's displacement sites, offering money, easier access to assistance and jobs. Such sexual exploitation in Chad is a crime.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of people, most of them women, have streamed into Chad to escape Sudan's civil war, which has killed over 20,000 people. Aid groups struggle to support them in growing displacement sites.",
      "Three women spoke with the AP in the town of Adre near the Sudanese border. A Sudanese psychologist shared the accounts of seven other women and girls who either refused to speak directly with a reporter or were no longer in touch with her. The AP could not confirm their accounts.",
      "Daral-Salam Omar, the psychologist, said all the seven told her they went along with the offers of benefits in exchange for sex out of necessity. Some sought her help because they became pregnant and couldn't seek an abortion at a clinic for fear of being shunned by their community, she said.",
      "\u201cThey were psychologically destroyed. Imagine a woman getting pregnant without a husband amid this situation,\u201d Omar said.",
      "Sexual exploitation during large humanitarian crises is not uncommon, especially in displacement sites. Aid groups have long struggled to combat the issue. They cite a lack of reporting by women, not enough funds to respond and a focus on first providing basic necessities.",
      "The U.N. refugee agency said it doesn't publish data on cases, citing the confidentiality and safety of victims.",
      "People seeking protection should never have to make choices driven by survival, experts said. Nidhi Kapur, who works on preventing sexual exploitation and abuse in emergency contexts, said exploitation represents a deep failure by the aid community.",
      "Yewande Odia, the United Nations Population\u2019s Fund representative in Chad, said sexual exploitation is a serious violation. U.N. agencies said displacement camps have \u201csafe spaces\u201d where women can gather, along with awareness sessions, a free hotline and feedback boxes to report abuse anonymously.",
      "Yet many of the Sudanese women said they weren\u2019t aware of the hotline, and some said using the boxes would draw unwanted attention.",
      "The Sudanese woman with the newborn said she was afraid to report the aid worker for fear he'd turn her in to police.",
      "She said she approached the aid worker, a Sudanese man, after searching for jobs to buy basic necessities like soap. She asked him for money. He said he'd give her cash but only in exchange for sex.",
      "They slept together for months, she said, and he paid the equivalent of about $12 each time. After she had the baby, he gave her a one-time payment of approximately $65 but denied it was his, she said.",
      "The man was a Sudanese laborer for Doctors Without Borders, known by its French acronym MSF, she said.",
      "Two other Sudanese women said Chadian men working at MSF sites\u2014 one wearing MSF clothing \u2014 solicited them after they applied for work with the organization. The men took their phone numbers and repeatedly called, saying they'd give them jobs for sex. Both women said they refused.",
      "Christopher Lockyear, MSF's secretary general, said the organization was not aware of the allegations and wanted to investigate. \u201cAsking for money or sex in exchange for access to care or a job is a clear violation of our behavioral commitments,\" he said.",
      "MSF would not say how many such cases had been reported among Sudanese refugees in Chad. Last year, out of 714 complaints made about MSF staff behavior where it works globally, 264 were confirmed to be cases of abuse or inappropriate behavior including sexual exploitation, abuse of power and bullying, Lockyear said.",
      "Lockyear said MSF is creating a pool of investigators at the global level to enhance its ability to pursue allegations.",
      "One woman told the AP that a man with another aid group also exploited her, but she was unable to identify the organization. Omar, the psychologist, said several of the women told her they were exploited by aid workers, local and international. She gave no evidence to back up the claims.",
      "Another woman, one of the two who alleged they were approached after seeking work with MSF, said she also refused a local policeman who approached her and promised an extra food ration card if she went to his house.",
      "Ali Mahamat Sebey, the head official for Adre, said police are not allowed inside the camps and asserted that allegations against them of exploitation were false. With the growing influx of people, however, it's hard to protect everyone, he said.",
      "The women said they just want to feel safe, adding that access to jobs would lessen their vulnerability.",
      "After most of her family was killed or abducted in Sudan's Darfur region last year, one 19-year-old sought refuge in Chad. She didn't have enough money to support the nieces and nephews in her care. She got a job at a restaurant in the camp but when she asked her Sudanese boss for a raise, he agreed on the condition of sex.",
      "The money he paid was more than six times her salary. But when she got pregnant with his child, the man fled, she asserted. She rubbed her growing belly.",

      "Joe Biden toured the shrinking waters of the Rio Negro as the first sitting American president to set foot in the Amazon rainforest",
      "MANAUS, Brazil -- MANAUS, Brazil (AP) \u2014 Joe Biden toured the drought-shrunken waters of the Amazon River\u2019s greatest tributary Sunday as the first sitting American president to set foot in the legendary rainforest, while the incoming Trump administration seems poised to scale back the U.S. commitment to combating climate change.",
      "The massive Amazon region, which is about the size of Australia, stores huge amounts of the world\u2019s carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that drives climate change when it's released into the atmosphere. But development is rapidly depleting the world's largest tropical rainforest, and rivers are drying up.",
      "Flying over a stretch of the Amazon in a helicopter, Biden saw severe erosion, ships grounded in the Negro River tributary, and fire damage. He also passed over a wildlife refuge and the expansive waters where the Negro River joins the Amazon. He was joined by Carlos Nobre, a Nobel Prize-winning scientist and expert on how climate change is harming the Amazon.",
      "Biden met indigenous leaders \u2014 introducing his daughter and granddaughter to them \u2014 and visited a museum at the gateway to the Amazon as he looks to highlight his commitment to the preservation of the region. Three indigenous women shook maracas as part of a welcoming ceremony.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m proud to become the first sitting president to visit the Amazon,\u201d Biden said before he signing a U.S. proclamation designating Nov. 17 as International Conservation Day.",
      "His administration announced plans last year for a $500 million contribution to the Amazon Fund, the most significant international cooperation effort to preserve the rainforest, primarily financed by Norway.",
      "So far, the U.S. government said it has provided $50 million, and the White House announced Sunday an additional $50 million contribution to the fund.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s significant for a sitting president to visit the Amazon. ... This shows a personal commitment from the president,\u201d said Suely Ara\u00fajo, former head of the Brazilian environmental protection agency and public policy coordinator with the nonprofit Climate Observatory. \u201cThat said, we can\u2019t expect concrete results from this visit.\"",
      "She doubts that a \u201csingle penny\u201d will go to the Amazon Fund once Donald Trump is back in the White House.",
      "The incoming Trump administration is highly unlikely to prioritize the Amazon or anything related to climate change. The Republican president-elect already said he would again pull out of the Paris agreement, a global pact forged to avert the threat of catastrophic climate change, after Biden recommitted to the accord.",
      "Trump has cast climate change as a \u201choax\u201d and said he will eliminate energy efficiency regulations by the Biden administration.",
      "Still, the Biden White House on Sunday announced a series of new efforts aimed at bolstering the Amazon and stemming the impact of climate change.",
      "Among the actions is the launch of a finance coalition that looks to spur at least $10 billion in public and private investment for land restoration and eco-friendly economic projects by 2030, and a $37.5 million loan to an organization to support the large-scale planting of native tree species on degraded grasslands in Brazil.",
      "Biden also plans to highlight that the U.S. is on track to reach $11 billion in spending on international climate financing in 2024, a sixfold increase from when he started his term.",
      "The Amazon is home to Indigenous communities and 10% of Earth\u2019s biodiversity. It also regulates moisture across South America. About two-thirds of the Amazon lies within Brazil, and scientists say its devastation poses a catastrophic threat to the planet.",
      "The forest has been suffering two years of historic drought that have dried up waterways, isolated thousands of riverine communities and hindered riverine dwellers\u2019 ability to fish. It's also made way for wildfires that have burned an area larger than Switzerland and choked cities near and far with smoke.",
      "When Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva took office last year, he signaled a shift in environmental policy from his predecessor, far-right Jair Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro prioritized agribusiness expansion over forest protection and weakened environmental agencies, prompting deforestation to surge to a 15-year high.",
      "Lula has pledged \u201czero deforestation\u201d by 2030, though his term runs through the end of 2026. Forest loss in Brazil\u2019s Amazon dropped by 30.6% in the 12 months through July from a year earlier, bringing deforestation to its lowest level in nine years, according to official data released last week.",
      "In that 12-month span, the Amazon lost 6,288 square kilometers (2,428 square miles), roughly the size of the U.S. state of Delaware. But that data fails to capture the surge of destruction this year, which will only be included in next year\u2019s reading.",
      "Despite the success in curbing Amazon deforestation, Lula\u2019s government has been criticized by environmentalists for backing projects that could harm the region, such as paving a highway that cuts from an old-growth area and could encourage logging, oil drilling near the mouth of the Amazon River and building a railway to transport soy to Amazonian ports.",
      "While Biden is the first sitting president in the Amazon, former President Theodore Roosevelt traveled to the region with the help of the American Museum of Natural History following his 1912 loss to Woodrow Wilson. Roosevelt, joined by his son and naturalists, traversed roughly 15,000 miles, when the former president fell ill with malaria and suffered a serious leg infection after a boat accident.",
      "Biden is making the Amazon visit as part of a six-day trip to South America, the first to the continent of his presidency. He traveled from Lima, Peru, where he took part in the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit and met with Chinese President Xi Jinping.",
      "After his stop in Manaus, he was heading to Rio de Janeiro for this year's Group of 20 leaders summit.",

      "The decision allowing Ukraine to use the Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMs, for attacks farther into Russia comes as thousands of North Korean troops have been sent into a region along Ukraine's northern border to help Russia retake ground and as President-elect Donald Trump has said he would bring about a swift end to the war, expressing skepticism over continued support by the United States.",

The official and the people familiar with the matter were not authorized to discuss the decision publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and many of his Western supporters have been pressing Biden for months to allow Ukraine to strike military targets deeper inside Russia with Western-supplied missiles, saying the U.S. ban had made it impossible for Ukraine to try to stop Russian attacks on its cities and electrical grids.",
      "Some supporters have argued that this and other U.S. constraints could cost Ukraine the war. The debate has become a source of disagreement among Ukraine\u2019s NATO allies.",
      "Biden had remained opposed, determined to hold the line against any escalation that he felt could draw the U.S. and other NATO members into direct conflict with Russia.",
      "But North Korea has deployed thousands of troops to Russia to help Moscow try to claw back land in the Kursk border region that Ukraine seized this year. The introduction of North Korean troops to the conflict comes as Moscow has seen a favorable shift in momentum. Trump has signaled that he could push Ukraine to agree to give up some land seized by Russia to find an end to the conflict.",
      "As many as 12,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia, according to U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian assessments. U.S. and South Korean intelligence officials say North Korea also has provided Russia with significant amounts of munitions to replenish its dwindling weapons stockpiles.",
      "Trump, who takes office in January, spoke for months as a candidate about wanting Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine to be over, but he mostly ducked questions about whether he wanted U.S. ally Ukraine to win.",
      "He also repeatedly slammed the Biden administration for giving Kyiv tens of billions of dollars in aid. His election victory has Ukraine\u2019s international backers worrying that any rushed settlement would mostly benefit Putin.",
      "America is Ukraine\u2019s most valuable ally in the war, providing more than $56.2 billion in security assistance since Russian forces invaded in February 2022.",
      "Worried about Russia\u2019s response, however, the Biden administration repeatedly has delayed providing some specific advanced weapons sought by Ukraine, only agreeing under pressure from Ukraine and in consultation with allies, after long denying such a request.",
      "That includes initially refusing Zelenskyy\u2019s pleas for advanced tanks, Patriot air defense systems, F-16 fighter jets, among other systems.",
      "The White House agreed in May to allow Ukraine to use ATACMS for limited strikes just across the border with Russia.",

      "DAKAR, Senegal -- Polls closed in Senegal on Sunday for a parliamentary election set to determine whether the country\u2019s newly elected president can carry out ambitious reforms.",
      "More than 7 million registered voters in the West African country were choosing 165 lawmakers in the National Assembly, where the party of President Bassirou Diomaye Faye does not hold a majority.",
      "Faye, who was elected in March on an anti-establishment platform, says that has blocked him from implementing the reforms he pledged during his campaign, including fighting corruption, reviewing fishing permits for foreign companies, and securing a bigger share from the country\u2019s natural resources for the population.",
      "In September, he dissolved the opposition-led parliament, paving the way for a snap legislative election. His party is facing the Takku Wallu opposition platform led by former President Macky Sall, alongside 39 other registered parties and coalitions.",
      "Polls opened at 8 a.m. and closed at 6 p.m. local time. The first provisional results were expected by Monday morning, but the final count will only be published later in the week.",
      "Faye\u2019s political party, PASTEF, needs at least 83 seats in order to gain a majority in the assembly.",
      "Analysts say it has a high chance of securing that, given its popularity and Faye's margin of victory in the March presidential election.",
      "Faye, 44, was elected with 54% in the first round, becoming Africa\u2019s youngest elected leader, less than two weeks after he was released from prison. His rise has reflected widespread frustration among Senegal\u2019s youth with the country\u2019s direction \u2014 a common sentiment across Africa, which has the world\u2019s youngest population and a number of leaders accused of clinging to power for decades.",
      "Over 60% of Senegalese are under age 25 and 90% work in informal jobs. Senegal has been hit by skyrocketing inflation in recent years, making it difficult for them to get by.",
      "The country is also a major source of irregular migration to Europe, with thousands leaving every year on rickety, artisanal fishing boats in search of economic opportunities.",
      "The campaign for the legislative election was marked by sporadic clashes between supporters of different parties. The headquarters of an opposition party were set on fire in the capital, Dakar, and clashes have erupted between supporters in central Senegal in recent weeks, the interior ministry said Monday,",
      "On Tuesday, Ousmane Sonko, the country\u2019s prime minister who helped catapult Faye to victory, denounced attacks against supporters of PASTEF in Dakar and other cities.",
      "\u201cMay each patriot they have attacked and injured be proportionally avenged. We will exercise our legitimate right to respond,\u201d he wrote on X, before back-pedaling and asking his supporters to remain peaceful in a speech later that day.",
      "Last month, Sonko\u2019s vehicle was attacked with stones as clashes broke out between his supporters and unidentified attackers while he was campaigning in Koungueul, in the center of the country. The leader of an allied party, former minister Malick Gackou, had his arm broken in the incident, according to local media.",
      "Faye called for peace and urged his supporters to respect the results of the election regardless of the outcome.",
      "\u201cThere will be winners and losers but in the end, it is the people that win,\u201d Faye said after casting his vote in his native town of Ndiaganiao, more than 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Dakar.",
      "\u201cWe have an obligation to preserve the international community\u2019s view of our democracy. We are an exception and we must continue to protect that,\" he added, referring to Senegal\u2019s reputation as a stable democracy in West Africa, a region rocked in recent years by coups and attempted coups.",
      "The presidential election in March had tested this reputation. Both Faye and Sonko had been imprisoned on charges that were largely seen as political, leading to months of protests that were unprecedented in Senegal. Rights groups said dozens of people were killed and about 1,000 people were jailed.",
      "Opposition supporters also had been concerned that Sall would seek a third term in office despite being prevented from doing so by the constitution.",
      "After a bid to delay the election was blocked by the courts, the government released hundreds of political prisoners, including Faye and Sonko, less than two weeks before the vote. Faye was catapulted into the presidency when Sonko \u2014 who was barred from running due to a previous conviction \u2014 put his backing behind the political novice and Faye easily beat the candidate backed by Sall.",

      "A young woman who was injured in a deadly roof collapse in Serbia this month has died, bringing the death toll to 15",
      "BELGRADE, Serbia -- A young woman who was injured in a deadly roof collapse in Serbia this month has died, bringing the death toll to 15, doctors said on Sunday.",
      "The concrete outer roof on a railway station building in the northern city of Novi Sad suddenly fell on Nov. 1, crashing on the people sitting or standing below. Initially 14 people died and three were severely injured.",
      "The fatal incident has triggered a wave of protests against the populist authorities. Many in Serbia believe rampant corruption led to sloppy renovation work and consequently to the roof collapse.",
      "The station was originally built in 1964 and renovated twice in recent years as part of a wider agreement with Chinese state companies.",
      "Protesters in Novi Sad on Sunday blocked an intersection outside the railway station for several hours, saying they won't give up until those responsible for the tragedy are punished. Activists put up a huge poster of a bleeding white dove and red handprints \u2014 a message to the populist authorities that they have blood on their hands.",
      "\u201cPeople died because of corruption, because you (the government) are irresponsible, because you won't take responsibility,\u201d actress and activist Jelena Stupljanin told the crowd, who chanted \u201cjail\u201d in response. \u201cWe will not be silenced.\u201d",
      "Protesters are also demanding the release of several activists who were detained at a previous rally in Novi Sad. That rally earlier this month turned violent after masked hooligans threw flares and rocks at the Novi Sad City Hall building. Opposition activists said the riots were staged to discredit peaceful protest marches.",
      "The authorities have promised a thorough investigation and Serbia's construction minister has resigned but no one has been arrested and no charges have been raised."

    "story": [
      "A high-tech factory in central Russia has created a new, deadly force to attack Ukraine: A small number of highly destructive thermobaric drones surrounded by huge swarms of cheap foam decoys",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- A high-tech factory in central Russia has created a new, deadly force to attack Ukraine: a small number of highly destructive thermobaric drones surrounded by huge swarms of cheap foam decoys.",
      "The plan, which Russia dubbed Operation False Target, is intended to force Ukraine to expend scarce resources to save lives and preserve critical infrastructure, including by using expensive air defense munitions, according to a person familiar with Russia\u2019s production and a Ukrainian electronics expert who hunts them from his specially outfitted van.",
      "Neither radar, sharpshooters nor even electronics experts can tell which drones are deadly in the skies.",
      "Here's what to know from AP's investigation:",
      "Unarmed decoys now make up more than half the drones targeting Ukraine and as much as 75% of the new drones coming out of the factory in Russia\u2019s Alabuga Special Economic Zone, according to the person familiar with Russia\u2019s production, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the industry is highly sensitive, and the Ukrainian electronics expert.",
      "The same factory produces a particularly deadly variant of the Shahed unmanned aircraft armed with thermobaric warheads, the person said.",
      "During the first weekend of November, the Kyiv region spent 20 hours under air alert, and the sound of buzzing drones mingled with the boom of air defenses and rifle shots. In October, Moscow attacked with at least 1,889 drones \u2013 80% more than in August, according to an AP analysis tracking the drones for months.",
      "On Saturday, Russia launched 145 drones across Ukraine, just days after the re-election of Donald Trump threw into doubt U.S. support for the country.",
      "Since summer, most drones crash, are shot down or are diverted by electronic jamming, according to an AP analysis of the Ukrainian military briefings. Less than 6% hit a discernible target, according to the data analyzed by AP since the end of July. But the sheer numbers mean a handful can slip through every day \u2013 and that is enough to be deadly.",
      "Tatarstan\u2019s Alabuga zone, an industrial complex about 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) east of Moscow, is a laboratory for Russian drone production. Originally set up in 2006 to attract businesses and investment to Tatarstan, it expanded after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine and some sectors switched to military production, adding new buildings and renovating existing sites, according to satellite images analyzed by The Associated Press.",
      "In social media videos, the factory promoted itself as an innovation hub. But David Albright of the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security said Alabuga\u2019s current purpose is purely to produce and sell drones to Russia\u2018s Ministry of Defense. The videos and other promotional media were taken down after an AP investigation found that many of the African women recruited to fill labor shortages there complained they were duped into taking jobs at the plant.",
      "Russia and Iran \u202fsigned a $1.7 billion deal for the Shaheds in 2022, after President Vladimir Putin invaded neighboring Ukraine, and Moscow began using Iranian imports of the unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs, in battle later that year. Soon after the deal was signed, production started in Alabuga.",
      "The most fearsome Shahed adaptation so far designed at the plant is armed with thermobarics, also known as vacuum bombs, the person with knowledge of Russian drone production said.",
      "The plan to develop unarmed decoy drones at Alabuga was developed in late 2022, according to the person with knowledge of Russian drone production. Production of the decoys started earlier this year, said the person, who agreed to speak only on condition of anonymity. Now the plant turns out about 40 of the unarmed drones a day and around 10 armed ones, which are more expensive and take longer to produce.",
      "From a military point of view, thermobarics are ideal for going after targets that are either inside fortified buildings or deep underground. They create a vortex of high pressure and heat that penetrates the thickest walls and, at the same time, sucks out all the oxygen in their path.",
      "Alabuga\u2019s thermobaric drones are particularly destructive when they strike buildings, because they are also loaded with ball bearings to cause maximum damage even beyond the superheated blast.",
      "Serhii Beskrestnov, a Ukrainian electronics expert and more widely known as Flash whose black military van is kitted out with electronic jammers to down drones, said the thermobarics were first used over the summer and estimated they now make up between 3% and 5% of all drones.",
      "They have a fearsome reputation because of the physical effects even on people caught outside the initial blast site: Collapsed lungs, crushed eyeballs, brain damage, according to Arthur van Coller, an expert in international humanitarian law at South Africa\u2019s University of Fort Hare.",
      "For Russia, the benefits are huge.",
      "An unarmed drone costs considerably less than the estimated $50,000 for an armed Shahed drone and a tiny fraction of the cost of even a relatively inexpensive air defense missile. One decoy with a live-feed camera allows the aircraft to geolocate Ukraine\u2019s air defenses and relay the information to Russia in the final moments of its mechanical life. And the swarms have become a demoralizing fact of life for Ukrainians.",

      "ATHENS, GREECE -- Former Greek Prime Minister and lawmaker Antonis Samaras was expelled from the ruling New Democracy party over his persistent criticism of government policies.",
      "Samaras, 73, a hard-line nationalist, has criticized Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis\u2019 approach to negotiations with Turkey, which he has likened to appeasement. He also strongly disapproved of government policy that he considered too \u201ccentrist\u201d or \u201cwoke,\u201d especially the decision to legislate in favor of same-sex marriage earlier this year.",
      "The government appeared particularly irked by a Samaras interview to be published in Sunday newspaper To Vima in which he called for the ouster of Foreign Minister George Gerapetritis over his conduct of negotiations with Turkey.",
      "\u201cMr. Samaras ... did not just express opinions. He expressed his complete disagreement with all governing policies. Moreover, he adopted extreme lies (about the foreign minister) in an unbecoming and provocative manner,\u201d said government spokesman Pavlos Marinakis in announcing Samaras\u2019 expulsion Saturday afternoon.",
      "Samaras responded in a lengthy statement, saying, \u201cArrogance and loss of nerve explain Mitsotakis' move. Cut off from the party base, he is leading a party that scarcely resembles New Democracy.\u201d",
      "It is not the first time that Samaras has clashed with a Mitsotakis. In 1992, then-Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis, father of the current premier, dismissed Samaras as foreign minister over policy differences regarding the name dispute with what was then the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the present North Macedonia.",
      "In 1993, Samaras and a few like-minded lawmakers left New Democracy, bringing down the Mitsotakis government and ushering in more than 10 years of socialist rule. Samaras founded his own short-lived party, Political Spring.",
      "Samaras succeeded former Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis as head of the conservatives in 2009, but left the post after an electoral defeat in 2015.",
      "\u201cThis time, history will not repeat itself. The government majority continues its course, without Mr. Samaras,\u201d said the governent spokesman. \u201cNo one has the right to mess with the country\u2019s stability in these troubled times,\u201d said Marinakis.",
      "The ruling conservatives have a slight majority in Parliament, with 155 lawmakers out of 300. But Samaras has a number of supporters among that group, as does the now retired Karamanlis.",
      "In the interview, Samaras proposed Karamanlis should replace President Katerina Sakellaropoulou, a left-of-center former judge whose five-year term ends in early 2025. She had been elected by Parliament with Mitsotakis' backing."

      "MANILA, Philippines -- A powerful typhoon wrecked houses, caused towering tidal surges and forced hundreds of thousands of people to flee to emergency shelters as it cut across the northern Philippines on Sunday in the sixth major storm to hit the country in less than a month.",
      "Typhoon Man-yi slammed into the eastern island province of Catanduanes on Saturday night with sustained winds of up to 195 kilometers (125 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 240 kph (149 mph). The country\u2019s weather agency warned of a \u201cpotentially catastrophic and life-threatening situation\u201d in provinces along its path.",
      "There were no immediate reports of casualties from the typhoon, which was forecast to blow northwestward on Sunday across northern Luzon, the archipelago's most populous region. The capital region of metropolitan Manila would likely be spared from a direct hit but was placed, along with outlying regions, under storm alerts and warned of dangerous coastal storm surges.",
      "\u201cThe rain was minimal, but the wind was very strong and had this eerie howling sound,\u201d Roberto Monterola, a disaster-mitigation officer in Catanduanes, told The Associated Press by telephone. \u201cAlong a main boulevard here, the tidal surges went up to more than 7 meters (23 feet) near the seaside houses. It looked really scary.\u201d",
      "The entire province of Catanduanes had no power after the typhoon knocked down trees and electricity posts, and disaster-response teams were checking how many more houses were damaged in addition to those impacted by previous storms, he said.",
      "\"We need tin roofs and other construction materials, aside from food. Villagers tell us here that they still haven\u2019t gotten up from the past storm and were pinned down again by this typhoon,\u201d Monterola said. Nearly half of the island province\u2019s 80,000 people were sheltering in evacuation centers.",
      "Catanduanes officials were so concerned as the typhoon approached that they threatened vulnerable villagers with arrest if they did not follow orders to evacuate to safer grounds. More than 750,000 people took refuge in emergency shelters, including churches and a shopping mall, due to Man-yi and two previous storms mostly in the northern Philippines, Assistant Secretary Cesar Idio of the Official of Civil Defense and other provincial officials said.",
      "The rare number of back-to-back storms and typhoons that lashed Luzon in just three weeks left more than 160 people dead, affected 9 million people and caused such extensive damage to residential communities, infrastructure and farmlands that the Philippines may have to import more rice, a staple food for most Filipinos. In an emergency meeting as Man-yi approached, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. asked his Cabinet and provincial officials to brace for \u201cthe worst-case scenario.\"",

      "The usual suspects abstained from voting on a seemingly uncontroversial United Nations resolution that denounced violence against women and girls on Thursday \u2014 Iran, Russia, North Korea",
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- The usual suspects abstained from voting on a seemingly uncontroversial United Nations resolution that denounced violence against women and girls on Thursday \u2014 Iran, Russia, North Korea.",
      "But the country casting the sole vote against the nonbinding resolution, drafted by France and the Netherlands, took the world by surprise. It was Argentina, long considered one of Latin America\u2019s most socially progressive countries.",
      "Unleashing an avalanche of criticism across the political spectrum on Friday, the \u2018no\u2019 vote by Buenos Aires marked the latest in a series of dramatic foreign policy shifts under President Javier Milei, the most right-wing leader in Argentina's 41 years of democracy.",
      "It comes just days after Milei, an outspoken climate change skeptic, abruptly called Argentina's negotiators home from the U.N. climate summit in Baku, Azerbaijan, stirring concerns that the radical economist might seek to emulate former U.S. President Donald Trump in withdrawing Argentina entirely from the 2015 Paris climate agreement.",
      "Not only has Milei transformed Argentine foreign policy in line with the United States and Israel, his government has also taken fringe positions on the global stage that fly in the face of the liberal, rules-based international order.",
      "\u201cIt's a big break with standard Argentine foreign policy, which has long been oriented toward making Argentina an integrated part of the Global South,\u201d said Richard Sanders, a global fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and former State Department official in the region. \u201cIt\u2019s a definitely a significant change in how Argentina relates internationally.\u201d",
      "Argentina's vote at the U.N. Thursday recalled a similar clash last month when Argentina became the only member of all the Group of 20 nations to sign onto a statement adopting language about gender equality.",
      "\u201cArgentina votes alone, against the rest of humanity,\u201d the conservative party of former President Mauricio Macri, an ally of Milei\u2019s government, wrote on social media platform X Friday.",
      "Another centrist party, the Uni\u00f3n C\u00edvica Radical, joined the chorus of local condemnation.",
      "\u201cBy fighting imaginary cultural battles we end up isolated from the world,\u201d said Senator Mart\u00edn Lousteau, president of the centrist party.",
      "Lousteau denounced Argentina\u2019s U.N. vote opposing an end to gender violence as a \u201cdisgrace.\u201d Top official Guillermo Francos defended the decision, saying \u201cneither commitments nor treaties will solve the issue of gender violence.\u201d",
      "Nearly a year into his presidency, the former Argentine TV pundit remains erratic and idiosyncratic in the global spotlight, in striking similarity to Trump. Milei became the first foreign leader since the U.S. election to meet Trump, albeit informally, late Thursday at the president-elect's private Mar-a-Lago club in Florida.",
      "In a congratulatory phone call with Trump earlier this week, Miei's spokesperson reported that Trump told the Argentine leader: \u201cYou're my favorite president.\" Trump has not confirmed the claim.",
      "The Argentine presidency on Friday proudly released a stream of photos from Mar-a-Lago featuring Milei in a sharp suit beaming alongside Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk, with whom Milei has also publicly cultivated a bromance over their shared contempt for \u201cwokeness,\" gender issues and socialism.",
      "In November 2023, an angry Argentine electorate fed up with sky-high inflation, debt defaults and bank runs handed the outsider a sweeping mandate to carry out an overhaul of Argentina's crisis-stricken economy.",
      "But along with Milei's libertarian crusade has come a series of cultural battles \u2014 both at home, where the president eliminated Argentina's women\u2019s and environment ministries and scrapped the national anti-discrimination institute, as well as abroad, where Milei has sought to fashion himself as a far-right icon, raising the hackles of key allies like Braziland Spain.",
      "\u201cMilei got into the presidency on the basis of his clearly stated libertarian views, it was all about the economy,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cBut these other views are nothing he kept hidden.\u201d",
      "Tensions over Milei's culture war escalated this month. When Argentina voted at the U.N. in favor of ending the American economic embargo against Cuba on Oct. 30, Milei fired then-Foreign Minister Diana Mondino over what he called her \u201cunforgivable mistake\u201d and swiftly replaced her with Gerardo Werthein, a wealthy businessman who had been Buenos Aires\u2019 ambassador to the U.S.",
      "This weekend, Milei and Werthein plan to meet Trump again at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, Florida.",
      "Experts say that Milei hopes to cash in on his friendship with Trump to help crisis-stricken Argentina secure a much-needed infusion cash infusion from the International Monetary Fund, to which Argentina owes over $44 billion. The U.S. is the fund\u2019s largest shareholder.",
      "In recent weeks, Milei's shock dismissal of Argentina's top diplomat \u2014 a polished political performer who frequently worked to mend diplomatic relations strained by Milei\u2019s profanity-laden fights with traditional allies \u2014 has sent shivers through Argentina's diplomatic ranks.",
      "Milei has vowed to purge his foreign ministry of so-called \u201ctraitors to the country\u201d who have strayed from his stance, which includes rejecting the \u201cPact for the Future\u201d adopted by the U.N. in September that promotes climate action, female empowerment and the regulation of artificial intelligence.",
      "Local media has reported the forced resignations of at least seven diplomats in recent weeks who were perceived as critical of the president's Trump-like attacks on the collective philosophy of the U.N. Milei accuses such multilateral forums of restricting members\u2019 freedom.",
      "Argentina's left-leaning Peronist movement \u2014 which has dominated the country's politics for decades \u2014 was seething Friday, with lawmakers aghast at what they saw as the unraveling of hard-won social gains like Argentina's breakthrough legalization of abortion in 2020 and recent efforts to curb fossil fuels.",
      "\u201cFor you, freedom is violence,\u201d said Mayra Mendoza, a prominent Peronist politician on Friday, addressing Milei.",
      "The libertarian has called abortion \u201cmurder,\" climate change a \u201csocialist lie\" and the U.N. a \u201cleviathan with multiple tentacles.\u201d",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- The U.S. antitrust watchdogs that pounced on Big Tech and deterred corporate deal making throughout President Joe Biden's administration may be kept on a shorter leash by Donald Trump after he returns to the White House next year.",
      "Although regulators began cracking down on tech powerhouses such as Google and Facebook during Trump's first term as president, most experts expect his second administration to ease up on antitrust enforcement and be more receptive to mergers and deal-making after years of hypervigilance under Biden's watch.",
      "One of the biggest reasons underlying the anticipated pivot stems from the widespread belief that the chief architects of the Biden administration's get-tougher stance \u2014 Lina Khan of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department's Jonathan Kanter \u2014 won't be part of the Trump regime.",
      "Both the Justice Department and FTC didn't respond to request for comment.",
      "Trump's announcement of billionaire Elon Musk, who once anointed himself as \u201cTechnoking,\u201d to oversee an advisory effort focused on slashing government spending could end up reducing the staffs and regulators trying to rein in deep-pocketed companies.",
      "And Trump's nomination of combative supporter Matt Gaetz to be U.S. Attorney General has thrown even more uncertainty into the game. Gaetz has previously lashed out at social media platforms' policies he claims suppress conservative views, and has, at times, joined in on calls to break up Big Tech. He also has a track record of supporting causes trumpeted by Trump.",
      "\u201cThere are going to be some profound changes\" in antitrust policies, predicts John Kwoka, an economics professor at Northeastern University that has periodically worked on antitrust issues with the FTC and Justice Department. \u201cElon Musk could end up having a larger-than-life influence on policy, and that isn't something we have seen before, where a single person whispers in the ear of the President.\"",
      "Other experts interviewed by The Associated Press mostly agree with Kwoka's sentiments. But they also believe it's highly unlikely the anticipated shift will result in regulators abandoning existing antitrust cases against Big Tech firms, partly because those legal showdowns coalesce with populist worries about the industry's increasing power and influence on people's lives.",
      "\u201cWe are in uncharted territory, but the idea of going up against Big Tech still has legs to it,\u201d said Rebecca Allensworth, a Vanderbilt University law professor who tracks antitrust issues.",
      "But the changing of the guard may open a door for Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook to avert prolonged court battles and negotiate settlements under a president that relishes in deal making.",
      "\u201cMaybe Big Tech should buy a copy of \u2018The Art of The Deal\u2019 to figure out how to best negotiate with this administration,\u201d suggested Paul Swanson, an antitrust attorney for the law firm Holland & Hart. \u201cI won\u2019t be surprised if they find ways to reach some accommodations and we end up seeing more negotiated resolutions and consent decrees.\u201d",
      "While the fate of existing antitrust cases remains in a realm of pure speculation, almost everyone is betting the Trump administration will be more receptive to mergers that typically come with a promise of lower costs and other benefits for consumers.",
      "The stage is set for \u201ca golden era for deal flow among public and private tech players over the next 12 to 18 months,\u201d Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote in a research note after Trump's reelection.",
      "It's a belief widely shared by most investors, which helped fuel a run up in the overall stock market since Election Day and boosted shares in companies trying to close deals announced during the Biden administration. One such example involves Capital One Financial and Discover, who aim to consummate their merger in a stock swap next year. Capital One's market value has increased by 11% while Discover's market value has climbed 16%.",
      "The change in administration could also sway a proposed merger between the country's two biggest supermarket chains, Kroger and Albertsons, which forged a $24.6 billion deal to combine in 2022. But the FTC filed a lawsuit in federal court earlier this year to block the merger, claiming the deal would eliminate competition, leading to higher prices and lower wages for workers. But the two companies say a merger would help them lower prices and compete against bigger rivals like Walmart.",
      "Given grocery prices remain a hot-button issue among consumers still feeling shell shocked from post-pandemic inflationary spikes, Allensworth believes the Trump administration is less likely to \u201cabandon or soft pedal\" the FTC's challenge to the Kroger-Albertsons merger.",
      "In another case that has been cheered by hordes of consumers, the Justice Department is seeking to break up Ticketmaster and its corporate parent Live Nation in a lawsuit claiming their practices are driving up the cost of concerts and other entertainment.",
      "Despite the grassroots support for that case, Live Nation executives are signaling they think they can preserve the current system under a Trump presidency.",
      "\u201cWe are hopeful that we\u2019ll see a return to the more traditional antitrust approach, where the agencies have generally tried to find ways to solve problems they see with targeted remedies that minimize government intervention in the marketplace,\u201d Live Nation President Joe Berchtold said during a conference call with investors shortly after the election.",
      "Deals that got torpedoed by the Biden administration could find new life with Trump in command. American and JetBlue are already considering resurrecting a partnership after an earlier proposal got torpedoed by a legal challenge by Biden's antitrust team \u2014 a decision that was recently upheld by a Boston appeals court.",
      "\u201cWe are still taking a look at it,\u201d American Airlines CEO Robert Isom said shortly after the election. \u201cWe will take everything that the court has fed back, and we\u2019ll put that into consideration.\"",
      "Similar conversations are likely taking place among other executives re-examining deals that seemed off-limits during the Biden administration, said Colin Kass, an antitrust attorney at the law firm Proskauer Rose,",
      "\u201cIt's almost certain there were deals that people put the brakes on because of antitrust concerns and those will be revisited to decide whether they still make economic sense,\u201d Kass said. \u201cIf so, they will present it to the DOJ. And if there needs to be a fix, it\u2019s more likely to get fixed than blocked outright. So it\u2019s worth taking a chance at getting these deals done.\u201d",
      "As for the efforts to dismantle Big Tech monopolies, the first case brought by the Trump administration against Google is now in the hands of a federal judge who ruled in August that the company's dominant search engine is an illegal monopoly. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington, D.C. is now weighing what kind of punishment to impose on Google. A decision is expected by August next year.",

      "PALM BEACH, Fla. -- President-elect Donald Trump has selected Chris Wright, a campaign donor and fossil fuel executive, to serve as energy secretary in his upcoming, second administration.",
      "CEO of Denver-based Liberty Energy, Wright is a vocal advocate of oil and gas development, including fracking, a key pillar of Trump\u2019s quest to achieve U.S. \u201cenergy dominance\u201d in the global market.",
      "Wright has been one of the industry\u2019s loudest voices against efforts to fight climate change, and could give fossil fuels a boost, including quick action to end a year-long pause on natural gas export approvals by the Biden administration.",
      "Frequently criticizing what he calls a \u201ctop-down\u201d approach to climate by liberal and left-wing groups, Wright has argued that the climate movement around the world is \u201ccollapsing under its own weight.\u201d He has never served in government, but has written that more fossil fuel production is needed around the globe to lift people out of poverty.",
      "Consideration of Wright to head the administration's energy department won support from influential conservatives, including oil and gas tycoon Harold Hamm.",
      "Hamm, executive chairman of Oklahoma-based Continental Resources, a major shale oil company, is a longtime Trump supporter and adviser who played a key role on energy issues in Trump\u2019s first term. Hamm helped organize an event at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in April where Trump reportedly asked industry leaders and lobbyists to donate $1 billion to Trump\u2019s campaign, with the expectation that Trump would curtail environmental regulations if reelected.",

      "\u201cThe Energy Department should be doing all it can to develop and expand the energy sources of the 21st century, not trying to promote the dirty fuels of the last century,\" Wong said. \u201cGiven the devastating impacts of climate-fueled disasters, DOE\u2019s core mission of researching and promoting cleaner energy solutions is more important now than ever.\"",
      "The Energy Department is responsible for advancing energy, environmental and nuclear security of the United States. The agency is in charge of maintaining the country\u2019s nuclear weapons, oversees 17 national research laboratories and approves natural gas exports, as well as ensuring environmental cleanup of the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons complex. It also promotes scientific and technological research.",
      "Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, who is expected to become chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said Trump promised bold choices for his Cabinet, and Wright\u2019s nomination delivers.",

After four years of America last energy policy, our country is desperate for a secretary who understands how important American energy is to our economy and our national security,\u2033 Barrasso said.",
      "If confirmed, Wright will join North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Trump's choice to be interior secretary, as a key player on energy policy in a second Trump term. Wright will be a member of a new National Energy Council that Burgum will chair. The new panel will seek to establish U.S. \u201cenergy dominance\u201d around the world, Trump said.",
      "Thomas Pyle, president of the American Energy Alliance, a conservative group that supports fossil fuels, said Wright would be \u201can excellent choice\u201d for energy secretary. Pyle led Trump\u2019s Energy Department\u2019s transition team in 2016.",
      "Liberty is a major energy industry service provider, with a focus on technology. Wright, who grew up in Colorado, earned undergraduate degree at MIT and did graduate work in electrical engineering at the University of California-Berkeley and MIT. In 1992, he founded Pinnacle Technologies, which helped launch commercial shale gas production through hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.",
      "He later served as chairman of Stroud Energy, an early shale gas producer, before founding Liberty Resources in 2010.",
      "The announcement of Wright's selection came hours after a key Trump ally, billionaire Elon Musk, called for more direct public input into the decision-making process for another top post that the president-elect is still mulling, the head of his new administration's Treasury Department.",
      "\u201cWould be interesting to hear more people weigh in on this for @realDonaldTrump to consider feedback,\u201d Musk, who Trump has already tapped to co-lead a commission tasked with increasing government spending efficiency, posted Saturday on the X social media platform he owns.",

      "The Boston-based law foundation stated in its Thursday notice that it was suing Cooke in a Maine federal court to bring the company into compliance. It states that the company discharges pollutants such as fish feces, dead fish and trash into Maine's coastal waters.",
      "\u201cThese enormous salmon cages are like sewage pipes to the marine environment,\u201d said Heather Govern, vice president for the foundation's clean air and water program. \u201cTheir solid waste smothers plants and ocean life while disease outbreaks and sea lice threaten nearby endangered wild salmon.\"",

      "The 21 leaders from economies bordering the Pacific, including President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping, had descended on Peru for the annual gathering at a time when America\u2019s President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to withdraw the United States from its leadership of a global free trade agenda.",

Additionally, Black athletes who did not present in traditionally feminine ways \u201creceive the least amount of media attention, while white athletes have the freedom to express their gender in a variety of ways and still capture media interest.\u201d",
      "Media attention matters because it shapes athletes\u2019 perceived advertising value for brand deals, and is especially important for WNBA players since their salaries are much lower than NBA players and they instead depend on endorsements and playing abroad offseason despite safety concerns to pay the bills, Isard said.",
      "But brands are missing the mark when they overlook Black LGBTQ+ women, said University of Massachusetts Amherst sport management professor Ajhanai Keaton, who studies the intersection of race and gender identity.",
      "Like some of its players, the WNBA\u2019s fan base also holds fluid gender identities, plus companies may underestimate how much consumers with different identities admire and relate to LGBTQ+ players, Keaton said. \u201cSponsors and brands are way behind the curve on this.\u201d",
      "Nonetheless, there has been progress, including in other women's sports like soccer.",
      "Briana Scurry, goalkeeper for the legendary squad that won the 1999 World Cup, was one of the only openly gay \u201cout\u201d players of her time. Scurry, a two-time Olympic Gold medalist, said sponsorship opportunities in women\u2019s soccer have improved significantly since her time playing.",
      "After making a crucial penalty kick save that helped clinch her team's World Cup win, Scurry said she \u201cthought for sure that I would have a landslide of sponsorship deals,\" but \"I just didn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "At first she thought it was because she was a goalkeeper. \u201cAnd then it dawned on me, sadly, that it may have to do with my color and/or my sexual orientation,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any other explanation for it.\u201d",
      "Today, women\u2019s soccer \u201chas come a long way,\u201d according to the former Washington Spirit assistant coach. When Scurry played, she was the only player of color with a starting role. Now, Sophia Smith, Trinity Rodman, and Mallory Swanson make up the U.S. Olympic team\u2019s formidable front three, and Scurry said she saw several advertising and marketing campaigns reflect that star power.",
      "\u201cThat made me very happy,\u201d she said.",
      "And endorsement opportunities that evaded Scurry 25 years ago? They're now beginning to surface.",
      "\u201cI am having quite a bit of success now that I didn\u2019t have then,\" she said, which makes her hopeful that sponsorship opportunities for Black LGBTQ+ female athletes also will continue to grow.",
      "\u201cWomen\u2019s sports is now seen as a business proposition,\u201d Scurry said. \u201cNo longer is it a charity.\u201d",
      "For anyone who questions the marketing potential and social capital of Black LGBTQ+ athletes, Keaton added, they need only glance at the comment sections of their Instagram posts, which are filled with fire emojis, heart eyes emojis, and, \u201c\u2018Where\u2019d you get those shoes?\u2019\u201d",

In the U.K., one person died in an E. coli outbreak in June linked to lettuce that sickened at least 275 people. Organic walnuts sickened consumers in 19 states with E. coli infections in April.",

      "Symptoms of E. coli infection usually start three to four days after eating the bacteria and include severe stomach cramps, diarrhea, which is often bloody, and vomiting.

      "HAINES CITY, Fla. -- Not long ago, Polk County\u2019s biggest draw was citrus instead of people. Located between Tampa and Orlando, Florida\u2019s citrus capital produces more boxes of citrus than any other county in the state and has devoted tens of thousands of acres to growing millions of trees.",
      "But last year, more people moved to the county than to any other in the United States, almost 30,000.",
      "Bulldozed citrus groves in recent years made way for housing and big box stores that could one day merge the two metropolitan areas into what has half-jokingly been dubbed, \u201cOrlampa.\u201d",

      "\u201cI love my job. I love what I do, but then I love coming back home, and it\u2019s more tranquil,\u201d Ortega said.",
      "The rapid growth of far-flung exurbs is an after-effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the Census Bureau, as rising housing costs drove people further from cities and remote working allowed many to do their jobs from home at least part of the week.",
      "Polk County\u2019s Hispanic population has grown from one-fifth to more than one-quarter of the overall population over the past five years, driven by Puerto Rican migration from the island after 2017\u2019s Hurricane Maria and then from New York during the pandemic.",
      "The county has grown more diverse with the share of non-Hispanic white residents dropping from 61% to 54%, and it has also gotten more educated and wealthier, according to the Census Bureau. Despite the influx of new people, the county\u2019s Republican leanings have remained relatively unchanged.",
      "Yeseria Suero and her family moved from New York to Polk County at the start of the decade after falling in love with the pace of life and affordability during a visit. Still, there were some cultural adjustments: restaurants closing early, barbecue and boiled peanuts everywhere, strangers chatting with her at the grocery store. Suero is now involved with the tight-knit Hispanic community and her two boys are active in sports leagues.",
      "\u201cMy kids now say, \u2018Yes, ma\u2019am,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "Recent hurricanes and citrus diseases in Florida also have made it more attractive for some Polk County growers to sell their citrus groves to developers who build new residences or stores.",
      "Over the past decade, citrus-growing there declined from 81,800 acres (33,103 hectares) and almost 10 million trees in 2014 to 58,500 acres (23,674 hectares) and 8.5 million trees in 2024, according to federal agricultural statistics.",
      "\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been a precipitous conversion of citrus land for growth,\u201d said Matt Joyner, CEO of Florida Citrus Mutual, a grower\u2019s group. \u201cBut certainly you see it in northern, northeastern Polk.\u201d",
      "Anna, Texas, more than 45 miles (72 kilometers) north of downtown Dallas, is seeing the same kind of migration.",
      "It was the fourth-fastest growing city in the U.S. last year and its population has increased by a third during the 2020s to 27,500 residents. Like Polk County, Anna has gotten a little older, richer and more racially diverse. Close to 3 in 5 households have moved into their homes since 2020, according to the Census Bureau.",
      "Schuyler Crouch, 29, and his wife wanted to buy a house in a closer-in exurb like Frisco, where he grew up, so they could settle down and start a family. But prices there have skyrocketed because of population growth.",
      "In Anna, they fell in love last year with a house that was more reasonably priced. They both work in Frisco, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) away, and it has become their go-to for eating out or entertainment instead of downtown Dallas, even though not long ago Frisco itself was considered a far-flung outpost of the metro area.",
      "Still, Crouch said he has noticed the exurbs keep getting pushed further north as breakneck growth makes affordable housing out of reach in neighborhoods once considered on the fringes of the metro area.",

      "But the Senate has a jam-packed schedule in the remaining weeks of the year, with government funding, disaster relief and an annual must-pass defense bill likely to eat up considerable floor time.",
      "If passed by the Senate, the bill would go to President Joe Biden. If the bill is signed into law, the changes would be effective for benefits payable after December 2023.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Disgruntled X users are again flocking to Bluesky, a newer social media platform that grew out of the former Twitter before billionaire Elon Musk took it over in 2022. While it remains small compared to established online spaces such as X, it has emerged as an alternative for those looking for a different mood, lighter and friendlier and less influenced by Musk.",
      "Championed by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Bluesky was an invitation-only space until it opened to the public in February. That invite-only period gave the site time to build out moderation tools and other features. The platform resembles Musk\u2019s X, with a \u201cdiscover\u201d feed and a chronological feed for accounts that users follow. Users can send direct messages and pin posts, as well as find \u201cstarter packs\u201d that provide a curated list of people and custom feeds to follow.",

The post-election uptick in users isn\u2019t the first time Bluesky has benefited from people leaving X. The platform gained 2.6 million users in the week after X was banned in Brazil in August \u2014 85% of them from Brazil, the company said. About 500,000 new users signed up in one day in October, when X signaled that blocked accounts would be able to see a user\u2019s public posts.",

      "Bluesky, though, has bigger ambitions than to supplant X. Beyond the platform itself, it is building a technical foundation \u2014 what it calls \u201ca protocol for public conversation\u201d \u2014 that could make social networks work across different platforms \u2014 also known as interoperability \u2014 like email, blogs or phone numbers.",

    "summary": "Political leaders in Alaska have welcomed President-elect Donald Trump's pledges to expand oil production",
    "story": [
      "Political leaders in Alaska have welcomed President-elect Donald Trump's pledges to expand oil production",
      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- President-elect Donald Trump promised repeatedly during his campaign to expand oil drilling in the U.S., which is good news for political leaders in Alaska, where oil is the economic lifeblood and many felt the Biden administration has obstructed efforts to boost the state's diminished production.",
      "A debate over drilling on federal lands on Alaska's petroleum-rich North Slope will likely be revived in the coming months, particularly in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which environmentalists have long sought to protect as one of the country's last wild places.",
      "On Saturday, Trump named Chris Wright \u2014 a campaign donor, fossil fuel executive and vocal advocate of oil and gas development \u2014 to serve as energy secretary in his second administration.",
      "The question of drilling on the refuge's coastal plain, as Trump sought to do during his first term, also divides Alaska Native communities. Some welcome the potential new revenue while others worry about how it will impact wildlife in an area they consider sacred.",
      "The largest wildlife refuge in the country covers an area of northeast Alaska roughly the size of South Carolina. It boasts a diverse landscape of mountains and glaciers, tundra plains, rivers and boreal forest, and is home to a variety of wildlife including polar bears, caribou, musk ox and birds.",
      "The fight over whether to drill in the refuge's coastal plain along the Beaufort Sea goes back decades. Drilling advocates say development could create thousands of jobs, generate billions of dollars in revenue, and spur U.S. oil production.",
      "While the U.S. Bureau of Land Management has said the coastal plain could contain 4.25 billion to 11.8 billion barrels of recoverable oil, there is limited information about the amount and quality of oil. And it's unclear whether companies will want to risk pursuing projects that could become mired in litigation. Environmentalists and climate scientists have pushed for a phase-out of fossil fuels to avert the worst consequences of climate change.",
      "The refuge is east of the oil fields in Prudhoe Bay and the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, where the Biden administration approved the controversial Willow oil project but also made about half the petroleum reserve off-limits to oil and gas leasing.",
      "An exploration well was drilled in the 1980s on lands where Alaska Native corporations held rights, but little information has been released about the results.",
      "Still, opening the coastal plain to drilling has been a longtime goal for members of Alaska's congressional delegation. In 2017, they added language to a tax bill mandating two oil and gas lease sales by late 2024.",
      "The first sale took place in the waning days of the last Trump administration, but President Joe Biden quickly called on Interior Secretary Deb Haaland to review the leasing program.",
      "That led to the cancelation of seven leases that had been acquired by the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, a state corporation. Smaller companies gave up two other leases. Litigation is pending over the canceled leases.",
      "The Biden administration recently released a new environmental review, ahead of the deadline for the second required sale. It proposes offering what the Bureau of Land Management said would be the minimum acreage the 2017 law allows \u2014 a proposal Alaska\u2019s Republican U.S. senators cast as a mockery of the law meant to encourage exploration.",
      "There are sharp divisions.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 09:14:21 -0500",
    "summary": "Wholesale prices in the United States rose last month, remaining low but suggesting that the American economy has yet to completely vanquish inflationary pressure",
    "story": [
      "Wholesale prices in the United States rose last month, remaining low but suggesting that the American economy has yet to completely vanquish inflationary pressure",
      "WASHINGTON -- Wholesale prices in the United States rose last month, remaining low but suggesting that the American economy has yet to completely vanquish inflationary pressure.",
      "Thursday's report from the Labor Department showed that its producer price index \u2014 which tracks inflation before it hits consumers \u2014 rose 0.2% from September to October, up from a 0.1% gain the month before. Compared with a year earlier, wholesale prices were up 2.4%, accelerating from a year-over-year gain of 1.9% in September.",
      "A 0.3% increase in services prices drove the October increase. Wholesale goods prices edged up 0.1% after falling the previous two months. Excluding food and energy prices, which tend to bounce around from month to month, so-called core wholesale prices rose 0.3 from September and 3.1% from a year earlier. The readings were about what economists had expected.",
      "Since peaking in mid-2022, inflation has fallen more or less steadily. But average prices are still nearly 20% higher than they were three years ago \u2014 a persistent source of public exasperation that led to Donald Trump's defeat of Vice President Kamala Harris in last week's presidential election and the return of Senate control to Republicans.",
      "The October report on producer prices comes a day after the Labor Department reported that consumer prices rose 2.6% last month from a year earlier, a sign that inflation at the consumer level might be leveling off after having slowed in September to its slowest pace since 2021. Most economists, though, say they think inflation will eventually resume its slowdown.",
      "Inflation has been moving toward the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% year-over-year target, and the central bank\u2019s inflation fighters have been satisfied enough with the improvement to cut their benchmark interest rate twice since September \u2014 a reversal in policy after they raised rates 11 times in 2022 and 2023.",
      "Trump\u2019s election victory has raised doubts about the future path of inflation and whether the Fed will continue to cut rates. In September, the Fed all but declared victory over inflation and slashed its benchmark interest rate by an unusually steep half-percentage point, its first rate cut since March 2020, when the pandemic was hammering the economy. Last week, the central bank announced a second rate cut, a more typical quarter-point reduction.",
      "Though Trump has vowed to force prices down, in part by encouraging oil and gas drilling, some of his other campaign vows \u2014 to impose massive taxes on imports and to deport millions of immigrants working illegally in the United States \u2014 are seen as inflationary by mainstream economists. Still, Wall Street traders see an 82% likelihood of a third rate cut when the Fed next meets in December, according to the CME FedWatch tool.",
      "The producer price index released Thursday can offer an early look at where consumer inflation might be headed. Economists also watch it because some of its components, notably healthcare and financial services, flow into the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge \u2014 the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, index.",
      "Stephen Brown at Capital Economics wrote in a commentary that higher wholesale airfares, investment fees and healthcare prices in October would push core PCE prices higher than the Fed would like to see. But he said the increase wouldn\u2019t be enough \u201cto justify a pause (in rate cuts) by the Fed at its next meeting in December.\u2033",
      "Inflation began surging in 2021 as the economy accelerated with surprising speed out of the pandemic recession, causing severe shortages of goods and labor. The Fed raised its benchmark interest rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023 to a 23-year high. The resulting much higher borrowing costs were expected to tip the United States into recession. It didn\u2019t happen. The economy kept growing, and employers kept hiring. And, for the most part, inflation has kept slowing.",

      "One of the nation\u2019s largest meat processors has agreed to pay $2 million to resolve allegations of child labor violations at a plant in Minnesota",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- Smithfield Foods, one of the nation\u2019s largest meat processors, has agreed to pay $2 million to resolve allegations of child labor violations at a plant in Minnesota, officials announced Thursday.",
      "An investigation by the Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry found that the Smithfield Packaged Meats subsidiary employed at least 11 children at its plant in St. James ages 14 to 17 from April 2021 through April 2023, the agency said. Three of them began working for the company when they were 14, it said. Smithfield let nine of them work after allowable hours and had all 11 perform potentially dangerous work, the agency alleged.",
      "As part of the settlement, Smithfield also agreed to steps to ensure future compliance with child labor laws. U.S. law prohibits companies from employing people younger than 18 to work in meat processing plants because of hazards.",
      "State Labor Commissioner Nicole Blissenbach said the agreement \"sends a strong message to employers, including in the meat processing industry, that child labor violations will not be tolerated in Minnesota.\u201d",
      "The Smithfield, Virginia-based company said in a statement that it denies knowingly hiring anyone under age 18 to work at the St. James plant, and that it did not admit liability under the settlement. The company said all 11 passed the federal E-Verify employment eligibility system by using false identification. Smithfield also said it takes a long list of proactive steps to enforce its policy prohibiting the employment of minors.",
      "\u201cSmithfield is committed to maintaining a safe workplace and complying with all applicable employment laws and regulations,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe wholeheartedly agree that individuals under the age of 18 have no place working in meatpacking or processing facilities.\u201d",
      "The state agency said the $2 million administrative penalty is the largest it has recovered in a child labor enforcement action. It also ranks among the larger recent child labor settlements nationwide. It follows a $300,000 agreement that Minnesota reached last year with another meat processer, Tony Downs Food Co., after the agency's investigation found it employed children as young as 13 at its plant in Madelia.",
      "Also last year, the U.S. Department of Labor levied over $1.5 million in civil penalties against one of the country\u2019s largest cleaning services for food processing companies, Packers Sanitation Services Inc., after finding it employed more than 100 children in dangerous jobs at 13 meatpacking plants across the country.",
      "After that investigation, the Biden administration urged U.S. meat processors to make sure they aren't illegally hiring children for dangerous jobs. The call, in a letter by Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack to the 18 largest meat and poultry producers, was part of a broader crackdown on child labor. The Labor Department then reported a 69% increase since 2018 in the number of children being employed illegally in the U.S.",
      "In other recent settlements, a Mississippi processing plant, Mar-Jac Poultry, agreed in August to a $165,000 settlement with the U.S. Department of Labor following the death of a 16-year-old boy. In May 2023, a Tennessee-based sanitation company, Fayette Janitorial Service LLC, agreed to pay nearly $650,000 in civil penalties after a federal investigation found it illegally hired at least two dozen children to clean dangerous meat processing facilities in Iowa and Virginia.",

      "A New York judge has rejected an effort by state regulators to shutter a bitcoin mine over concerns about its greenhouse gas emissions",
      "NEW YORK -- A cryptocurrency plant in central New York can continue operating after a court rejected the state\u2019s effort to shutter the facility over concerns about its climate impact.",
      "The decision was hailed as a victory by Greenidge Generation, a large-scale crypto mine in the Finger Lakes region that has drawn the ire of environmental groups and watchdogs since it began mining bitcoin four years ago.",
      "Like other large-scale crypto-mining operations, Greenidge relies on thousands of electricity-guzzling computer servers that generate bitcoin by solving complex equations. To power those servers, Greenidge uses a former coal-burning plant that was converted to natural gas in 2017 after years of disuse.",
      "In 2022, the New York Department of Environmental Conservation denied a required air permit to the plant on the grounds that its greenhouse gas emissions ran afoul of the state\u2019s ambitious climate goals.",
      "In response to a lawsuit by the corporation, State Supreme Court Justice Vincent M. Dinolfo ruled Thursday that the agency had failed to give Greenidge an opportunity to justify its alleged violation, an \u201cinterpretative error\u201d under the law.",
      "\u201cTransparent political bias lost today,\u201d Greenidge said in a prepared statement. \u201cThe ruling ensures our facility will continue operating and our local employees will not have their careers ripped away by politically motivated governmental overreach that had no basis in law from the first day it began.\u201d",
      "A coalition of environmental groups, meanwhile, allege Greenidge is pumping millions of pounds of carbon dioxide into the air, while contaminating the nearby Seneca Lake with daily discharges of heated water required to run the plant.",
      "\u201cThe Finger Lakes community has been sounding the alarm on the disastrous impacts of this facility on their water, air, and climate,\u201d said Mandy DeRoche, a deputy managing attorney in the Clean Energy Program at Earthjustice. \u201cWe will continue our fight until Greenidge shuts down for good,\u201d",
      "In rejecting the permit, the DEC said the plant had misled regulators about the true purpose of the conversion. \u201cInstead of helping to meet the current electricity needs of the state as originally described, the facility is operating primarily to meet its own significant new energy load,\u201d the agency said in its letter to the company.",
      "A spokesperson for the DEC did not respond to a request for comment about the decision.",
      "Greenidge has said it is in compliance with its permits and that the plant is 100% carbon neutral, thanks to the purchase of carbon offsets such as forestry programs and projects that capture methane from landfills.",
      "Yvonne Taylor, a vice president at Seneca Lake Guardian, said the facility was a test case for the state\u2019s ability to enforce a raft of climate laws. She worried the recent election of Donald Trump, who received billions of dollars from the crypto industry, would further weaken efforts to enforce those protections.",
      "\u201cGreenidge being permitted to continue operating flies in the face of our state climate goals and what we\u2019ve spent generations working for in our community,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIt\u2019s not serving any public purpose or benefit other than making a few people who are already rich, richer.\u201d"

      "Here's a look at the bankruptcy auction and what could happen next:",
      "Jones declared personal bankruptcy in late 2022 after he was ordered to pay nearly $1.5 billion to families of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut who sued him for defamation for repeatedly calling the massacre a hoax aimed at increasing gun control.",
      "Relatives of some of the 20 first graders and six educators who were killed in the 2012 shooting said Jones' followers harassed and threatened them as a result of his lies. Jones has since acknowledged the shooting was \u201c100% real.\u201d",
      "As part of the bankruptcy, Jones' personal assets and Infowars' parent company, the Jones-owned Free Speech Systems, were to be sold at auction, with the Sandy Hook families and Jones' other creditors getting the proceeds.",
      "The bankruptcy trustee overseeing the sale chose from sealed bids. He received two.",
      "One was from the Jones-affiliated First United American Companies, which offered $3.5 million, the trustee revealed in court Thursday. The other, from The Onion, was lower but contained an incentive by some of the Sandy Hook families to forgo a portion of the sale proceeds and give it to other Jones' creditors, the trustee, Christopher Murray, said.",
      "Murray said he determined The Onion's offer, although unusual, was better overall, because it would provide more money to Jones' creditors than the other bid. But he also said he could not yet put a dollar figure on The Onion\u2019s bid when the families\u2019 offer was factored in.",
      "Judge Lopez indicated that he had expected prospective buyers would be given a chance to outbid each other after the bids were unsealed.",
      "His 20-page order on the sale procedures in September, however, made such a bidding round optional. And it gave broad authority to Murray to conduct the sale, including the power to reject any bid, no matter how high, that was \u201ccontrary to the best interests\u201d of Jones, his company and their creditors.",
      "Murray had Infowars' website and studio shut down Thursday as he began the process of securing assets, a lawyer for the trustee said in court Thursday. But on Friday, Infowars and its websites were back up and running.",
      "On his show, Jones told listeners that Murray had told him it was wrong to shut down Infowars before the sale was finalized. Murray and his lawyer did not immediately return phone messages and emails seeking comment.",
      "The judge said he had concerns about the auction process and transparency. Both sides are expected to present evidence at next week's hearing.",
      "Jones and a lawyer for First United American Companies allege Murray improperly selected The Onion\u2019s bid and unexpectedly changed the sale process Monday after the sealed bids were submitted, by deciding not to hold a round of bidding on Wednesday. They also questioned the legality of The Onion's bid.",
      "Murray said denied doing anything improper and said he followed the judge\u2019s auction rules.",
      "Lopez would rule on whether the trustee properly ran the auction and selected The Onion as the winning bidder. If not, the possibilities include reopening the sale and holding an auction where potential buyers could outbid each other. The judge has the ultimate authority to accept or reject any sale of Infowars.",
      "An exact date for the hearing had not yet been scheduled by Friday afternoon.",
      "The Onion \u2014 which carries the banner of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Finest News Source\u201d on its masthead \u2014 was founded in the 1980s and for decades has skewered politics and pop culture. It hopes to reopen the Infowars website in January as a parody of Jones and other conspiracy theorists.",
      "\"Our goal in a couple of years is for people to think of Infowars as the funniest and dumbest website that exists,\u201d Ben Collins, the Onion\u2019s CEO, told The Associated Press. \u201cIt was previously the dumbest website that exists.\u201d"

    "summary": "Chair Jerome Powell says the Federal Reserve will likely cut its key interest rate slowly and deliberately in the coming months, in part because inflation has shown signs of persistence and the Fed&rsquo;s officials want to see where it heads next",

      "Chair Jerome Powell says the Federal Reserve will likely cut its key interest rate slowly and deliberately in the coming months, in part because inflation has shown signs of persistence and the Fed\u2019s officials want to see where it heads next",
      "WASHINGTON -- Chair Jerome Powell said Thursday that the Federal Reserve will likely cut its key interest rate slowly and deliberately in the coming months, in part because inflation has shown signs of persistence and the Fed's officials want to see where it heads next.",
      "Powell, speaking in Dallas, said that inflation is edging closer to the central bank's 2% target, \u201cbut it is not there yet.\"",
      "At the same time, he said, the economy is strong, and the policymakers can take time to monitor the path of inflation.",
      "\u201cThe economy is not sending any signals that we need to be in a hurry to lower rates,\u201d the Fed chair said. \u201cThe strength we are currently seeing in the economy gives us the ability to approach our decisions carefully.\u201d",
      "Economists expect the Fed to announce another quarter-point rate cut in December, after a quarter-point reduction last week and half-point cut in September.",
      "But the Fed's steps after that are much less clear. In September, the central bank's officials collectively signaled that they envisioned cutting their key rate four times in 2025. Wall Street traders, though, now expect just two rate reductions, according to futures pricing tracked by CME FedWatch. And after Powell's cautious remarks Thursday, traders estimated the likelihood of a Fed rate cut in December at just below 59%, down from 83% a day earlier.",
      "The Fed's benchmark interest rate tends to influence borrowing rates across the economy, including for mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. Other factors, though, can also push up longer-term rates, notably expectations for inflation and economic growth.",
      "For example, Donald Trump's presidential election victory has sent yields on Treasury securities higher. It is a sign that investors expect faster growth next year as well as potentially larger budget deficits and even higher inflation should Trump impose widespread tariffs and mass deportations of migrants as he has promised.",
      "In his remarks Thursday, Powell suggested that inflation may remain stuck somewhat above the Fed's target in the coming months. But he reiterated that inflation should eventually decline further, \u201calbeit on a sometimes bumpy path.\u201d",
      "Under questioning, Powell also explained why he considers the Fed's role as an independent federal agency to be crucial to its ability to fight inflation. During his first term, Trump threatened to try to fire Powell for not cutting interest rates. And during this year\u2019s election campaign, Trump asserted that as president, he should have a \u201csay\u201d on the Fed's rate policies.",
      "Powell said Thursday that the Fed's independence from political concerns has made the public confident that the policymakers will keep inflation low over time. That confidence, in turn, has helped reduce inflation after it had spiked in the wake of the pandemic. When consumers and businesses expect inflation to slow, they act in ways that help hold it down \u2014 by, for example, not demanding high cost-of-living raises.",
      "\u201cThe public,\" Powell said, \"believed that we would get inflation down, that we would restore price stability. And that\u2019s ultimately the key to it.\u201d",
      "Powell declined to comment on other political topics, including the potential impacts of Trump's proposals to impose sweeping tariffs and implement mass deport",
      "Other Fed officials have also recently expressed uncertainty about how much more they can cut rates, given the economy\u2019s steady growth and the apparent stickiness of inflation.",
      "As measured by the central bank\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, so-called core prices, which exclude volatile food and energy costs, have been stuck in the high 2% range for five months.",
      "On Wednesday, Lorie Logan, president of the Fed\u2019s Dallas branch, said it was not clear how much more the Fed should cut its key short-term rate.",
      "\u201cIf we cut too far ... inflation could reaccelerate and the (Fed) could need to reverse direction,\u201d Logan said. \u201cI believe it\u2019s best to proceed with caution.\u201d"

      "ST. LOUIS -- Tim Weah is back with the United States for the first time since his red card for punching Panama defender Roderick Miller on the head contributed to a first-round elimination at the Copa America and the decision to replace coach Gregg Berhalter with Mauricio Pochettino.",
      "The U.S. was ahead 1-0 at the time but played a man short following Weah's ejection and lost 2-1. Weah was suspended for two games, missing the 1-0 loss to Uruguay in the group-stage finale and Thursday's 1-0 win at Jamaica in the first leg of a CONCACAF Nations League quarterfinal. The 24-year-old winger will be available for the second leg of the total-goal series on Monday night.",
      "\u201cEverything that needed to be said was said straight after that Panama game,\" said defender Tim Ream, at 37 the oldest player in camp and the captain thus far under Pochettino. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not even dressing him down and yelling at him or telling him that he\u2019s messed up. He knew that himself. And that\u2019s the sign of somebody who understands their role. It\u2019s the sign of a good group, of a good team, that we didn\u2019t have to. You could see it on his face from the minute we walked inside from that game.\u201d",
      "A 24-year-old son of former FIFA Player of the Year and former Liberia President George Weah, Tim Weah has four goals in eight Serie A matches this season for Juventus.",
      "\"He's a very good player, very aggressive with the ball, fast, good legs,\" Pochettino said Sunday. \u201cHe's young, but it's normal. He can make a mistake. We need to help him, for him to evolve and to learn. But I think he's a very clever player. Always smiling. He brought very good energy to the group.\u201d",
      "Weah missed Pochettino's first games, October friendlies against Panama and Mexico, because of an ankle injury that sidelined him between Sept. 21 and Oct. 19.",
      "\u201cI played a few games against his father and I want to see if he has the same character, because his father was amazing,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cEvery time that I play against, always suffered. It was difficult to sleep the night before.\u201d",
      "Weah has six goals in 41 appearances for the U.S. and started all four matches at the 2022 World Cup, scoring in the opening 1-1 draw against Wales.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s probably been harder for him being away from the last two camps than anything,\u201d Ream said. \u201cTo have him back, he\u2019s the same to me. He\u2019s not overthinking anything and just going out there and playing with a smile on his face and training hard and working hard.\u201d",
      "The quarterfinal winner advances to a semifinal on March 20 at Inglewood, California. The U.S. has won the first three editions of the tournament.",
      "Pochettino is encouraging players not getting sufficient playing time with their European clubs to consider MLS during the January transfer window, pointing out that the league is good enough for Lionel Messi. He does a January training camp mostly with MLS players.",
      "\u201cWe were talking with them to say that we need them (to) be involved in the competition in their clubs,\u201d he said. \u201cSome players ask me about if the MLS is a good platform for them to compete.\u201d",

      "Fritz was attempting to become the event\u2019s first American champion since Pete Sampras beat Andre Agassi in the title match 25 years ago.",
      "Still, Fritz will rise to a career-high No. 4 in the rankings on Monday after beating No. 2 Alexander Zverev in a third-set tiebreaker in the semifinals on Saturday. That will make him the highest-ranked American man since Andy Roddick was No. 4 in August 2007.",
      "It\u2019s the latest in a series of achievements for Fritz, whose run in New York made him the first American man to reach a Grand Slam singles final since Roddick lost to Roger Federer at Wimbledon in 2009.",
      "\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve gone up a level and I\u2019m much more confident in my game,\u201d Fritz said.",
      "At the start of the week, Fritz told The Associated Press that his \u201ccareer has always been a very steady progression and just improving a little bit each year.\u201d",
      "Both Sinner and Fritz will conclude their seasons representing defending champion Italy and the United States, respectively, in the Davis Cup finals, which start Tuesday in Malaga, Spain.",

      "Rafael Nadal's impending retirement will loom over the Davis Cup Final 8 when play begins Tuesday in Malaga, Spain",
      "MALAGA, Spain -- Rafael Nadal's impending retirement will loom over the Davis Cup Final 8 from the moment it begins Tuesday in southern Spain.",
      "If that weren't already obvious, just glance at the banner measuring 28,000 square feet (2,600 square meters) \u2014 about half the size of a football field \u2014 that wraps around the soccer stadium across the street from the arena hosting the tennis. The blue sign, visible from the highway leaving Malaga's airport, is marked with large white letters that read, \u201cGRACIAS, RAFA.\u201d Between those two words is an image of Nadal toting a tennis racket in his left hand while wearing one of his trademark sleeveless shirts and his just-as-ever-present headband.",
      "He is shown with his back to the world, walking away, symbolizing the 38-year-old Spaniard's goodbye to the sport after a remarkable career.",
      "\u201cIt's going to be very exciting for everyone,\u201d said tournament director Feliciano Lopez, a former player who faced Nadal 14 times on tour as an opponent in singles and also was his Davis Cup teammate. \u201cVery emotional, at the same time.\u201d",
      "That sentiment likely applies to Nadal\u2019s fans, other players, his family \u2014 his wife and their son have attended practice \u2014 and, quite understandably, the 22-time Grand Slam champion himself as Tuesday approaches. That's when Spain faces the Netherlands on an indoor hard court at the Palacio de Deportes Jose Maria Martin Carpena.",
      "\u201cIt's amazing that it might be the last match that Nadal plays,\u201d Dutch captain Paul Haarhuis said Sunday, \u201cand we hope to give him a nice \u2018Adios.\u2019\u201d",
      "Nadal had hip surgery in June 2023 and missed nearly all of that season. He dealt with a new hip muscle problem this year and an abdominal injury, part of a long series of issues that contributed to his body feeling like what he described as \u201ca jungle\u201d in May after losing in the first round of the French Open, the clay-court Slam he's won a record 14 times.",
      "That was his only Grand Slam appearance all year; Nadal played a total of just 23 official singles matches over the past two seasons combined. That includes going 12-7 in 2024. His last real matches came at the Olympics in early August, when he lost in the second round of singles to Novak Djokovic and in the quarterfinals of doubles alongside Carlos Alcaraz.",
      "Spain's captain, David Ferrer, the 2013 French Open runner-up to Nadal, has not yet told the world how he will employ the star in Malaga.",
      "Could be for singles, although Nadal said he'll step aside if he doesn't think he can win. Could be in doubles with his 21-year-old heir apparent, Alcaraz, in a renewal of their \u201cNadalcaraz\u201d partnership. Could be both. If Spain gets past the Netherlands, it would face Germany or Canada in the semifinals on Friday.",
      "\u201cI really want him to retire with a title,\u201d Alcaraz said.",
      "Thursday's quarterfinals feature the United States against Australia, and defending champion Italy \u2014 whose roster features No. 1-ranked Jannik Sinner \u2014 against Argentina. The winners of those matchups will meet in the semifinals on Saturday; the championship will be decided Sunday.",
      "When Nadal explained last month that the Davis Cup would be it for him, he spoke in happy terms about his more than two decades in the sport.",
      "\u201cReally, everything I have experienced has been a dream come true,\u201d he said.",
      "He becomes the second member of the so-called Big Three of men\u2019s tennis to retire.",
      "Roger Federer announced his departure in 2022 \u2014 teaming with Nadal in doubles at the Laver Cup, then crying alongside his longtime rival and, eventually, friend \u2014 while Djokovic is still near the top of the game.",
      "Djokovic's Serbia did not qualify for the Davis Cup quarterfinals, but he wrote on social media that he would be on hand in Malaga. Who knows who else might show up in the sellout crowd of 9,200 on Tuesday, not just from the world of tennis, and not just athletes from other sports, but other celebrities, as well?",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to have seats for everyone,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cEveryone wants to be there for his farewell.\u201d",
      "There will be plenty of folks tuning in on TV from afar, including other tennis players, of course.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to watch it. I\u2019m going to enjoy it,\u201d said 2021 U.S. Open champion Daniil Medvedev, who lost to Nadal in two Grand Slam finals. \u201cIt\u2019s a big moment for the sport, because he did so much for the sport.\u201d",

      "Rory McIlroy has capped off a tumultuous year with another win in Dubai and another title as Europe's No. 1 player",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Rory McIlroy ended a tumultuous year packed with emotion on and off the golf course with a pair of trophies and plenty of tears.",
      "McIlroy broke a tie with Rasmus Hojgaard by hitting wedge to a foot for birdie on the 16th hole, and he closed with a 3-under 69 for a two-shot victory Sunday in the World Tour Championship. He also captured his sixth title as Europe's No. 1 player.",
      "And then the 35-year-old from Northern Ireland couldn't speak, choked up with emotion as he contemplated the wins and losses, and everything else in between.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been through a lot this year, professionally and personally,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cIt feels like the fitting end to 2024. I\u2019ve persevered this year a lot.\u201d",
      "He won four times \u2014 two of them on the PGA Tour, one of those with close friend Shane Lowry in a team event \u2014 and tied the late Seve Ballesteros with his sixth title in the Race to Dubai, formerly the Order of Merit. Two more and he can match Colin Montgomerie for the record.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve really made it a priority of my schedule over the last few years to give myself the best chance coming into the end of the year to win the Race to Dubai. I don\u2019t see that being any different for the foreseeable future,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cGoing for my seventh next year and try to chase Monty down.\u201d",
      "He also threw away a chance at the U.S. Open by missing two short putts over the last three holes at Pinehurst No. 2, finishing one behind Bryson DeChambeau. He was on the verge of finally winning on home soil until Hojgaard stunned him with a late charge in the Irish Open at Royal Country Down.",
      "McIlroy revealed in May that he had filed for divorce, and equally stunning was word a month later that the divorce proceedings had been scrapped and they would try to work it out. His wife, Erica, and 4-year-old daughter Poppy were in Dubai cheering his latest victory.",
      "It was a lot for McIlroy, and the emotions when it was over bore that out.",
      "\u201cTo finish the year like this, it's a dream come true,\u201d McIlroy said at the closing ceremony, where he hoisted the enormous World Tour Championship trophy and the Harry Vardon Trophy for winning the season points title.",
      "\u201cIt's been hard at times,\u201d he said. \u201cHad a lot of close calls. To finish the year off the way I did today means the world to me.\u201d",
      "McIlroy ran off four straight birdies from the second hole to build a three-shot lead over the Dane, whose twin brother Nicolai won the tournament last year. Hojgaard pecked away with a birdie on the seventh, and McIlroy dropping shots on the ninth and 13th holes.",
      "McIlroy seized control with his wedge to the 16th, which dropped from the blue sky to a foot in front of the hole. Hojgaard failed to match that birdie and never caught up. He closed with a 71, making nothing but par over the last 11 holes.",
      "McIlroy, who finished on 15-under 273, won $5 million \u2014 $3 million from the tournament prize fund, and a $2 million bonus for the Race to Dubai.",
      "Antoine Rozner of France, who started the final round tied for the lead with McIlroy and Hojgaard, led by two after a birdie on the opening hole. His round fell apart with a three-putt double bogey on the ninth hole. He shot 73 and tied for third with Adam Scott and Shane Lowry, each with 68.",
      "Rozner was among 10 players who earned PGA Tour cards for 2025, a group led by Hojgaard, who finished second in the Race to Dubai. He will be joining his twin brother on the U.S. tour.",
      "The final spot went to Tom McKibbin of Northern Ireland, who boldly cleared the water on the 18th to set up a two-putt birdie. That was just enough to beat out Jordan Smith for the 10th and final PGA Tour card.",
      "McIlroy won for the 37th time worldwide as he bids to take his place among European greats. The mention of Ballesteros made him emotional for all the Spaniard has meant to the development of the European tour.",
      "\u201cI think everyone knows what Seve means to European golf and to Ryder Cup players. (In the) European Ryder Cup locker room, all we have are quotes of Seve. We had a changing room with Seve\u2019s shirt from \u201995, the last Ryder Cup he played,\u201d McIlroy said as he wiped away more tears.",
      "\u201cAnd for me to be mentioned in the same breath, I\u2019m very proud.\u201d",

      "Jon Jones sent Stipe Miocic into retirement with a stunning back kick to the ribs and used a series of blows to the head in the third round to retain the UFC heavyweight championship in front of President-elect Donald Trump in the main event of UFC 309...",
      "NEW YORK -- Jon Jones had just knocked the breath out of the heavyweight challenger he pummeled into retirement when UFC's greatest fighter broke out a herky-jerky dance inside the cage and dedicated the groove to President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "As a defeated Stipe Miocic gamely tried to recover on all fours, Jones posed and played to the packed crowd on top of the cage, and even had a gift for his favorite fan in the front row \u2014 Trump for a few moments clutched the UFC heavyweight title.",
      "Jones and Trump shook hands and capped a fight night charged with politics as much as punches inside a raucous Madison Square Garden where \u201cUSA!\u201d chants echoed through the arena.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m proud to be a great American champion,\u201d Jones said inside the cage.",
      "Jones finished Miocic in the fight \u2014 and for good \u2014 with a stunning spinning back kick to the ribs and used a series of blows to the head in the third round to get the TKO win and retain the UFC heavyweight championship in front of Trump and a slew of potential administration members that helped fill the Garden.",
      "Jones dominated at UFC's fourth-highest grossing event of all time \u2014 topping $16.6 million \u2014 with Elon Musk, picked by Trump to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency, and Robert Kennedy Jr., Trump\u2019s choice to lead the Department of Health and Human Services in his incoming administration also in the house.",
      "\u201cI want to say a big, big thank you to President Donald Trump for being here tonight,\u201d Jones said to a roaring ovation that bled into a \u201cUSA! USA!\u201d chant.",
      "Hours earlier, Trump walked out to a rousing ovation in front of 20,200 fans just before the start of the pay-per-view card and seemed to bask in the thrill of the fighters who throughout the night gave him props \u2014 including Jones.",
      "Widely considered the best fighter in the world, Jones (28-1-0; 1 NC) was the aggressor from the start and landed a series of shots to Miocic's head in the first round. Jones bloodied Miocic under his right eye and showed he had plenty of fight left in the tank.",
      "British heavyweight Tom Aspinall looms as the next challenger for Jones. Aspinall won a fight for the interim heavyweight title last November in the Garden. UFC CEO Dana White had promised Aspinall, who chatted with Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray, would challenge the winner of the main event in a unification bout.",
      "\u201cAs far as my future in the octagon, I decided that maybe I will not retire,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI know that we have options.\u201d",
      "The 42-year-old Miocic (20-5) failed in his bid to win the heavyweight crown for a third time and the Ohio firefighter who fought for the first time since March 2021 immediately announced his retirement.",

      "His last fight was in front of the next president.",
      "White captioned a photo he posted on social media \u201cthe boys\u201d that featured him with Trump, Kid Rock and Musk. Trump pumped a fist during an occasional outbreak of \u201cUSA! USA!\u201d chants. He was flanked in his front-row seat by White on his right and Musk on his left and politely applauded the fight winners.",
      "UFC fans wore red Trump hats and some waved flags emblazoned with his image during breaks in the action.",
      "In a lightweight bout that made every fan from Kid Rock to Jordan Knight to Anthony Kiedis go wild at the finish in the fifth round, Charles Oliveira beat Michael Chandler via unanimous decision. The fight was a rematch of their May 2021 fight when Charles Oliveira topped Chandler to win the lightweight title. Oliveira staked his claim to another title fight with the win",
      "The fifth round was about as good as it gets inside the octagon highlighted by Chandler dropping Oliveira twice on his back. The 38-year-old Chandler stepped inside the cage for the first time in two years, in large part because he waited for a fight that never materialized with Conor McGregor.",
      "\u201cWe've been wondering where you've been, Conor,\u201d Chandler bellowed in the cage. \u201cCome back and beat me if you can.\u201d",
      "McGregor has been sued by a woman who accused him of sexually assaulting her in a Dublin hotel in 2018.",
      "Trump is tight with White, a relationship that dates to UFC\u2019s formative years before its rise into a billion-dollar promotion. New Jersey was one of the first states that embraced UFC and White has long credited fights at the Trump Taj Mahal for helping the company grow into a heavyweight in the sports world. White both spoke at Trump\u2019s request at the Republican National Convention and appeared on stage at the election party.",
      "UFC fighters spoke this week in New York with excitement about earning the chance to fight in front of Trump.",
      "\u201cTo see Dana up on stage at the election, I feel like that moment just elevated the whole sport,\u201d Jones said. \u201cAmericans, people from around the world were like, who\u2019s the bald-headed dude talking? That represents all of us.\u201d",
      "Bo Nickal topped Paul Craig by unanimous decision in a welterweight fight, then crouched to speak to Trump.",
      "\u201cI showed him my golf swing, asked him how it looked,\u201d Nickal said. \u201cHe said it needs work.\u201d",
      "Trump threw his arms open when he spotted UFC broadcaster Joe Rogan. Trump and Rogan embraced and shared a few words before the opening bout of the main card.",
      "Trump sat ahead of the election for a three-hour interview on Rogan's podcast. Rogan helped encourage on the podcast some of Trump's false claims about voting, election fraud and his loss in the 2020 presidential election.",

    "story": [
      "Texas A&M University is set to mark the anniversary of the campus bonfire tragedy that killed 12 people and injured dozens more 25 years ago",
      "The first, ominous sounds came from deep within the massive stack of logs in the darkest hours of the Texas night. Witnesses described hearing the stack of thousands of logs moan and creak before the crack of the center pole as it snapped, then collapsed.",
      "More than a million pounds (450,000 kilograms) of timber tumbled. In an instant, 12 people were killed, dozens more were injured and a university campus rooted in traditions carried across generations of students was permanently scarred.",
      "Texas A&M University is set to mark 25 years since the log stack collapsed in the early hours of Nov. 18, 1999. It was being built in preparation for the annual bonfire ahead of the Texas A&M-Texas rivalry football game in College Station.",
      "The school will hold a Bonfire Remembrance ceremony at the site of the tragedy on Monday at 2:42 a.m., about the time the stack collapsed.",
      "\u201cYear after year, Texas A&M students have worked to ensure that we never forget those members of the Aggie Family who were taken from us 25 years ago,\" school President Mark Welsh III said.",
      "The \u201cFightin' Texas Aggie Bonfire\u201d ranked among the most revered traditions in college football and symbolized the school's \u201cburning desire\u201d to beat the University of Texas Longhorns in football. The first bonfire in 1907 was a scrap heap that was set ablaze. By 1909, it was a campus event and the bonfire stack kept growing as railroad lines were used to ship in in carloads of scrap lumber, railroad ties and other flammable materials, according to the school.",
      "It reached a record height of 105 feet (32 meters) in 1969 before administrators, concerned about a fire hazard, imposed a 55-foot (17-meter) limit. Over the years, the stack evolved from a teepee-style mound into the vertical timber formation, a shape similar to a tiered wedding cake, that collapsed in 1999.",
      "The annual bonfire attracted crowds of up to 70,000 and burned every year through 1998. The only exception was in 1963, after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.",
      "The stack of more than 5,000, 18-foot (5.5-meter) logs toppled a week before it was scheduled to burn. The 12 who were killed included five freshmen, four sophomores, a junior, a senior and a recent graduate. Several were members of the Corps of Cadets, Texas A&M's student-led, military-style organization that played a large role in its construction.",
      "Rescuers, including members of the Texas A&M football team, raced to remove the logs that had trapped and crushed some of the victims. At rival Texas, Longhorns players organized a blood drive to assist the survivors.",
      "An investigative report cited multiple causes for the collapse, from flawed construction techniques to a lack of supervision by the university over the students building the bonfire stack. The lowest level of the pile did not have proper support wiring, and excessive stress on the bottom level was compounded by wedging logs into gaps.",
      "In 2003, the school dedicated a memorial on the spot where the stack fell. It includes a \u201cSpirit Ring\u201d with 12 portals representing those who were killed. Each portal contains an engraved portrait and signature of a victim and points toward their hometown. By stepping into the open archway, the visitor symbolically fills the void left by the deceased.",
      "The annual Aggie bonfire was discontinued as an official school event after the deadly collapse.",
      "The school considered reviving the tradition this year to coincide with the renewal of the Texas-Texas A&M football rivalry on Nov. 30. The rivalry split in 2012 when Texas A&M left the Big 12 Conference for the Southeastern Conference, but has resumed this year as Texas joined the SEC.",
      "A special committee recommended resuming the bonfire, but only if the log stack was designed and built by professional engineers and contractors. Some members of the public said it should not come back if it was not organized and built by students, according to tradition.",
      "Welsh ultimately decided the bonfire would not return to campus.",
      "\"Bonfire, both a wonderful and tragic part of Aggie history, should remain in our treasured past,\u201d the president said in June when he announced his decision.",
      "Students have continued to organize and build unofficial off-campus bonfires over the years and plan to burn this year's edition on Nov. 29, the night before the Texas A&M-Texas football game."

      "ATHENS, Ga. -- On a raucous Saturday night between the hedges, Carson Beck once again looked like a quarterback who could lead Georgia to another national title.",
      "Showing off his arm and his legs, Beck silenced his critics by throwing for two touchdowns and running for another, leading the No. 11 Bulldogs to a 31-17 victory over No. 6 Tennessee that gave a huge boost to their College Football Playoff hopes.",
      "Georgia (8-2, 6-2 Southeastern Conference, No. 12 CFP) bounced back from a 28-10 loss at Ole Miss that left the Bulldogs just outside the provisional 12-team postseason field.",
      "Now, they are positioned for a likely playoff berth \u2014 and a shot at winning their third national championship in four years \u2014 if they can close out the regular season with wins over UMass and Georgia Tech.",
      "\u201cThe way we were able to bounce back from last week, I'm just so proud of these guys,\u201d Beck said. \u201cThe word that really identifies us is resilient. We stay so composed in high-pressure moments. Although it might not look perfect, it might not look pretty, we're gonna get the job done.\u201d",
      "Tennessee (8-2, 5-2, No. 7 CFP) could have moved a big step closer to a berth in the SEC championship game, but the Vols' postseason prospects are now a whole lot murkier after what had all the makings of a playoff elimination game.",
      "Tennessee coach Josh Heupel said he has \u201cno idea\u201d where his team stands now in the playoff picture.",
      "\u201cAll I know is this league is college football as good as it gets,\u201d he said. \"It\u2019s hard to win in this league. It\u2019s a good football team that we just played. ... We\u2019re a good football team, too.\u201d",
      "In the midst of a disappointing season, Beck came up huge for the Bulldogs when they needed him most, guiding them to a 29th straight home victory in an FBS-leading streak that dates to 2019.",
      "Beck connected on a pair of touchdown passes to tight end Oscar Delp in the first half and scrambled for the go-ahead score in the third quarter, darting 10 yards to the end zone for his first rushing TD of the season.",
      "Georgia sealed the victory with a 92-yard drive \u2014 its longest of the season \u2014 in the closing minutes. Freshman Nate Frazier finished it off with a 2-yard touchdown run with 2:26 remaining.",
      "\u201cA week ago, we were dead and gone,\u201d Georgia coach Kirby Smart said. \u201cPeople had written us off.\u201d",
      "Beck, who had thrown 12 interceptions in the previous six games, didn't have any picks against the Volunteers. He completed 25 of 40 passes for 347 yards.",
      "With quarterback Nico Iamaleava cleared to play after going through concussion protocol, Tennessee jumped to a 10-0 lead on Miles Kitselman\u2019s 1-yard dive and Max Gilbert\u2019s 52-yard field goal, dampening the mood of more than 93,000 at Sanford Stadium.",
      "But the Bulldogs, after a sluggish start that has become their trademark, grabbed the lead as Beck connected with Delp on similar-looking scoring passes of 19 and 4 yards in the back of the end zone.",
      "Dylan Sampson put the Vols back in front with his 21st rushing touchdown of the season, a 27-yard scamper through a huge hole right up the middle.",
      "Beck guided the Bulldogs into position for Peyton Woodring\u2019s 36-yard field goal with five seconds remaining in the half, sending the teams to the locker room tied at 17.",
      "The Georgia quarterback isn't known as much of a runner, but he posted a career-high 32 yards on three carries \u2014 all of them huge plays for the Bulldogs.",
      "A bruising 14-yard run set up his first touchdown pass to Delp, an 8-yard run on third down extended the drive that led to Woodring's field goal near the end of the first half and the touchdown run came on third-and-7 from the 10.",
      "\u201cHe's a good athlete,\u201d Smart said. \u201cHe can make plays with his feet.\u201d",
      "Tennessee: The Vols defense had not allowed more than 19 points all season, but they couldn't contain the Beck-led offense. Georgia piled up 453 yards and 24 first downs while converting eight of 13 third-down opportunities. Tennessee just doesn't have an answer for the Bulldogs, who have dominated the series with eight straight victories \u2014 all of them by margins of at least two touchdowns.",
      "Georgia: The Bulldogs played without top running back Trevor Etienne, who was sidelined by a rib issue, and the offense took another blow when receiver Dillon Bell went out with an ankle injury sustained on a hit along the sideline late in the first half. But Frazier, the first true freshman to start at tailback for the Bulldogs since 2014, rushed for 68 yards and London Humphreys stepped up to make three huge catches for 63 yards. Big kudos, as well, to the offensive line, which did not give up a sack after Beck was dumped five times the previous week by Ole Miss.",
      "Tennessee: The Vols return home next Saturday to take on UTEP before wrapping up the regular season with a short trip to Nashville to face Vanderbilt on Nov. 30.",
      "Georgia: With their SEC schedule complete, the Bulldogs close out the regular season with two nonconference games at home. UMass (2-8) shouldn't present much of a problem next Saturday.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Disgruntled X users are again flocking to Bluesky, a newer social media platform that grew out of the former Twitter before billionaire Elon Musk took it over in 2022. While it remains small compared to established online spaces such as X, it has emerged as an alternative for those looking for a different mood, lighter and friendlier and less influenced by Musk.",
      "Championed by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Bluesky was an invitation-only space until it opened to the public in February. That invite-only period gave the site time to build out moderation tools and other features. The platform resembles Musk\u2019s X, with a \u201cdiscover\u201d feed and a chronological feed for accounts that users follow. Users can send direct messages and pin posts, as well as find \u201cstarter packs\u201d that provide a curated list of people and custom feeds to follow.",
      "Bluesky said in mid-November that its total users surged to 15 million, up from roughly 13 million at the end of October, as some X users look for an alternative platform to post their thoughts and talk to others online. The post-election uptick in users isn\u2019t the first time Bluesky has benefited from people leaving X. The platform gained 2.6 million users in the week after X was banned in Brazil in August \u2014 85% of them from Brazil, the company said. About 500,000 new users signed up in one day in October, when X signaled that blocked accounts would be able to see a user\u2019s public posts.",
      "Across the platform, new users \u2014 among them journalists, left-leaning politicians and celebrities \u2014 have posted memes and shared that they were looking forward to using a space free from advertisements and hate speech. Some said it reminded them of the early days of Twitter more than a decade ago.",
      "Despite Bluesky\u2019s growth, X posted after the election that it had \u201cdominated the global conversation on the U.S. election\u201d and had set new records.",
      "Bluesky, though, has bigger ambitions than to supplant X. Beyond the platform itself, it is building a technical foundation \u2014 what it calls \u201ca protocol for public conversation\u201d \u2014 that could make social networks work across different platforms \u2014 also known as interoperability \u2014 like email, blogs or phone numbers.",
      "Currently, you can\u2019t cross between social platforms to leave a comment on someone\u2019s account. Twitter users must stay on Twitter and TikTok users must stay on TikTok if they want to interact with accounts on those services. Big Tech companies have largely built moats around their online properties, which helps serve their advertising-focused business models.",
      "Bluesky is trying to reimagine all of this and working toward interoperability."

      "The refugee organization, the International Rescue Committee, is testing some artificial intelligence tools to try to increase the number of displaced people they can reach with critical information",
      "NEW YORK -- As the International Rescue Committee copes with dramatic increases in displaced people in recent years, the refugee aid organization has looked for efficiencies wherever it can \u2014 including using artificial intelligence.",
      "Since 2015, the IRC has invested in Signpost \u2014 a portfolio of mobile apps and social media channels that answer questions in different languages for people in dangerous situations. The Signpost project, which includes many other organizations, has reached 18 million people so far, but IRC wants to significantly increase its reach by using AI tools \u2014 if they can do so safely.",
      "Conflict, climate emergencies and economic hardship have driven up demand for humanitarian assistance, with more than 117 million people forcibly displaced in 2024, according to the United Nations refugee agency. The turn to artificial intelligence technologies is in part driven by the massive gap between needs and resources.",
      "To meet its goal of reaching half of displaced people within three years, the IRC is testing a network of AI chatbots to see if they can increase the capacity of their humanitarian officers and the local organizations that directly serve people through Signpost. For now, the pilot project operates in El Salvador, Kenya, Greece and Italy and responds in 11 languages. It draws on a combination of large language models from some of the biggest technology companies, including OpenAI, Anthropic and Google.",
      "The chatbot response system also uses customer service software from Zendesk and receives other support from Google and Cisco Systems.",
      "If they decide the tools work, the IRC wants to extend the technical infrastructure to other nonprofit humanitarian organizations at no cost. They hope to create shared technology resources that less technically focused organizations could use without having to negotiate directly with tech companies or manage the risks of deployment.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to really be clear about where the legitimate concerns are but lean into the optimism of the opportunities and not also allow the populations we serve to be left behind in solutions that have the potential to scale in a way that human to human or other technology can\u2019t,\" said Jeannie Annan, International Rescue Committee\u2019s Chief Research and Innovation Officer.",
      "The responses and information that Signpost chatbots deliver are vetted by local organizations to be up to date and sensitive to the precarious circumstances people could be in. An example query that IRC shared is of a woman from El Salvador traveling through Mexico to the United States with her son who is looking for shelter and for services for her child. The bot provides a list of providers in the area where she is.",
      "More complex or sensitive queries are escalated for humans to respond.",
      "The most important potential downside of these tools would be that they don't work. For example, what if the situation on the ground changes and the chatbot doesn\u2019t know? It could provide information that's not just wrong, but dangerous.",
      "A second issue is that these tools can amass a valuable honeypot of data about vulnerable people that hostile actors could target. What if a hacker succeeds in accessing data with personal information or if that data is accidentally shared with an oppressive government?",
      "IRC said it's agreed with the tech providers that none of their AI models will be trained on the data that the IRC, the local organizations or the people they are serving are generating. They've also worked to anonymize the data, including removing personal information and location.",
      "As part of the Signpost.AI project, IRC is also testing tools like a digital automated tutor and maps that can integrate many different types of data to help prepare for and respond to crises.",
      "Cathy Petrozzino, who works for the not-for-profit research and development company MITRE, said AI tools do have high potential, but also high risks. To use these tools responsibly, she said, organizations should ask themselves, does the technology work? Is it fair? Are data and privacy protected?",
      "She also emphasized that organizations need to convene a range of people to help govern and design the initiative \u2014 not just technical experts, but people with deep knowledge of the context, legal experts, and representatives from the groups that will use the tools.",
      "\u201cThere are many good models sitting in the AI graveyard,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause they weren\u2019t worked out in conjunction and collaboration with the user community.\u201d",
      "For any system that has potentially life-changing impacts, Petrozzino said, groups should bring in outside experts to independently assess their methodologies. Designers of AI tools need to consider the other systems it will interact with, she said, and they need to plan to monitor the model over time.",
      "Consulting with displaced people or others that humanitarian organizations serve may increase the time and effort needed to design these tools, but not having their input raises many safety and ethical problems, said Helen McElhinney, executive director of CDAC Network. It can also unlock local knowledge.",
      "People receiving services from humanitarian organizations should be told if an AI model will analyze any information they hand over, she said, even if the intention is to help the organization respond better. That requires meaningful and informed consent, she said. They should also know if an AI model is making life-changing decisions about resource allocation and where accountability for those decisions lies, she said.",
      "Degan Ali, CEO of Adeso, a nonprofit in Somalia and Kenya, has long been an advocate for changing the power dynamics in international development to give more money and control to local organizations. She asked how IRC and others pursuing these technologies would overcome access issues, pointing to the week-long power outages caused by Hurricane Helene in the U.S. Chatbots won't help when there's no device, internet or electricity, she said.",
      "Ali also warned that few local organizations have the capacity to attend big humanitarian conferences where the ethics of AI are debated. Few have staff both senior enough and knowledgeable enough to really engage with these discussions, she said, though they understand the potential power and impact these technologies may have.",
      "\u201cWe must be extraordinarily careful not to replicate power imbalances and biases through technology,\u201d Ali said. \u201cThe most complex questions are always going to require local, contextual and lived experience to answer in a meaningful way.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- A computer expert who stole bitcoin worth billions of dollars at current prices \u2014 and then spent years laundering some of the hacked cryptocurrency with help from his wife \u2014 was sentenced on Thursday to five years in prison.",
      "Ilya Lichtenstein masterminded one of the largest-ever thefts from a virtual currency exchange before he and his wife, Heather Rhiannon Morgan, carried out an elaborate scheme to liquidate the stolen funds, according to federal prosecutors.",
      "U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly told Lichtenstein that his theft was \u201cmeticulously planned\u201d and not an impulsive act.",
      "\u201cIt's important to send a message that you can't commit these crimes with impunity, that there are consequences to them,\u201d she said.",
      "Lichtenstein, who gets credit for the two years and nine months that he has spent in jail since his February 2022 arrest, expressed remorse for \u201cwasting my talents on crime instead of a positive contribution to society.\u201d He said he hopes that he can apply his expertise to fight cybercrime when he gets out of prison.",
      "\u201cI want to take full responsibility for my actions and make amends any way I can,\u201d he said.",
      "The judge is scheduled to sentence Morgan on Monday. Lichtenstein pleaded with the judge to spare his wife from prison, blaming himself for her involvement.",
      "In August 2016, Lichtenstein hacked into a virtual currency exchange, Hong Kong-based Bitfinex, and stole approximately 120,000 bitcoin. It was worth approximately $71 million at the time of the hack and would be valued at more than $7.6 billion at current market prices, according to prosecutors.",
      "Several months later, Lichtenstein began moving the stolen bitcoin in a string of complex transactions designed to conceal its path across a series of accounts and platforms. He enlisted his wife\u2019s help in cleaning the stolen funds.",
      "Lichtenstein, an entrepreneur and cryptocurrency investor, is a U.S. citizen who was born in Russia and grew up in a Chicago suburb. Morgan, a business owner and writer, adopted the alter ego \u201c Razzlekhan \u201d for performing rap songs and recording videos for her music.",
      "Lichtenstein and Morgan were living in New York City when they were arrested in February 2022. They had been living in San Francisco around the time of the hack.",
      "Prosecutors recommended a five-year prison sentence for Lichtenstein, who pleaded guilty in August 2023 to one count of money laundering conspiracy. They recommended an 18-month prison sentence for Morgan, who pleaded guilty to the same charge.",
      "\u201cNeither the hack nor the laundering scheme was an impulsive decision. The defendant (Lichtenstein) spent months attempting to gain access to Bitfinex\u2019s infrastructure and get the accesses and permissions he needed in order to orchestrate his hack,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "Lichtenstein told his wife about the hack over three years later, but he initially solicited her help in laundering the proceeds \u201cwithout explaining exactly what he was doing,\u201d according to prosecutors.",
      "Morgan \u201cwas certainly a willing participant and bears full responsibility for her actions, but she was a lower-level participant,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "During family trips to Kazakhstan and Ukraine, Lichtenstein met with couriers who delivered him money that he smuggled back into the U.S.",
      "\u201cOver half a decade, the defendant engaged in what IRS agents described as the most complicated money laundering techniques they had seen to date,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "Bitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, which is digital money that typically isn\u2019t backed by any government or banking institution. Transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain.",
      "The couple successfully laundered about 21 percent of the funds stolen from Bitfinex. The laundered money was worth at least $14 million at 2016 prices. Its value would have exceeded $1 billion at the time of their 2022 arrest.",
      "Authorities seized the remaining funds, collectively valued at over $6 billion at current prices.",
      "\u201cHe became one of the greatest money launderers that the government has encountered in the cryptocurrency space,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "An attorney for Bitfinex said the hack \u201cdevastated\u201d its finances and its reputation with its customers, with the stolen funds accounting for approximately 36% of the company's assets at the time of theft.",
      "\u201cBitfinex had to take unprecedented and immediate action to ensure that any losses from the Hack would ultimately be borne by Bitfinex and its shareholders alone, not its customers,\u201d the lawyer, Barry Berke, wrote in a letter to the judge.",
      "A prosecutor said Lichtenstein immediately began cooperating with federal authorities after his arrest, helping them with other cybercrime investigations.",
      "Over 96% of the stolen funds have been recovered, with help from Lichtenstein, according to defense attorney Samson Enzer. The \u201cvast bulk\u201d of the stolen money was never spent, the lawyer said.",
      "\u201cThis is not an evil person,\u201d Enzer said. \u201cThis is a good person who made some very bad mistakes.\u201d",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A tech consultant charged with murder in Cash App founder Bob Lee\u2019s stabbing death sparred with the lead prosecutor at trial Thursday, interrupting questions asked of him with his own questions as he was grilled on his testimony.",
      "Nima Momeni, 40, had to be told several times by the judge to provide responsive answers.",
      "He broke his public silence after 18 months when he took the witness stand Wednesday to explain how Lee was found staggering on a deserted downtown San Francisco street at 2:30 a.m. on April 4, 2023, dripping a trail of blood and calling for help. He later died at a hospital.",
      "Momeni testified Lee, 43, suddenly pulled a knife on him after he cracked a \u201cbad joke\u201d suggesting Lee should spend his last night in the city with family instead of trying to visit a strip club. He said Lee later walked away, showing no signs he was injured.",
      "His testimony stunned Lee's father, brother and ex-wife, who have been a steadfast presence in the criminal trial. They say Lee was big-hearted and gentle, and close to his two children and ex-wife.",
      "\u201cWhat you have seen is Nima be aggressive on the stand, you\u2019ve seen him just trying to take control of this room, his arrogance and his entitlement are on full display here,\u201d said the victim's brother, Timothy Oliver Lee, speaking with reporters outside the court room Thursday.",
      "\u201cThis is insane,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of this is ridiculous.\u201d",
      "The trial is in its fifth week. Momeni faces 26 years to life if convicted.",
      "Lee\u2019s death stunned the tech community as fellow executives and engineers penned tributes to the charismatic entrepreneur\u2019s generosity and brilliance. He was chief product officer of cryptocurrency platform MobileCoin when he died.",
      "Prosecutors say Momeni planned the April 4 attack after a dispute over his younger sister, Khazar Momeni, with whom Lee was friends. Momeni had picked up his sister from the home of a drug dealer introduced to her by Lee, and she said she may have been sexually assaulted after ingesting a date-rape drug called GHB.",
      "They say Momeni was angry with Lee so he took a knife from his sister\u2019s condo, and after the pair was kicked out of her place at 2 a.m., he drove Lee to a secluded area and stabbed him three times and then fled.",
      "Omid Talai, the assistant district attorney, grilled Momeni on Thursday on details of exactly how the attack unfolded. He asked Momeni why he did not call police after the attack and learning Lee had died, and why he did not respond to his sister's text asking where he had dropped off Lee.",
      "Momeni said he did not learn of Lee\u2019s death until the following day and was puzzled by his sister\u2019s query. He said he thought Lee could have been stabbed by someone else shortly after he saw him walk off, unharmed.",
      "In response to questions, Momeni said he didn't know what the prosecutor was getting at, accused him of misrepresenting his statements and said he had already answered.",
      "At one point, San Francisco Superior Court Judge Alexandra Gordon said that the prosecutor had no obligation to provide him with a printout of the texts he was questioning him about or to put them on the multimedia screen.",
      "\u201cGotcha,\u201d said Momeni, dressed in a blue suit and tie. \u201cThank you for clarifying.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors have video showing Lee and Momeni leaving Khazar Momeni's condo after 2 a.m. and driving off together in Momeni\u2019s BMW. Video also shows the two men getting out of the car in an isolated spot by the Bay Bridge.",
      "Prosecutors say that is where Momeni stabbed Lee, while the defense says that is where Lee attacked Momeni, erratic and aggressive from a multi-day bender of cocaine, ketamine and drinking.",
      "A knife recovered from the area where Lee was stabbed showed Momeni's DNA on the handle, but the defense said the handle should have been tested for fingerprints, namely Lee\u2019s.",
      "Momeni said he and Lee were on friendly terms when they left his sister's condo, but prosecutors say the defendant grilled the entrepreneur earlier in the evening about what might have happened to his sister at the drug dealer's apartment.",
      "The prosecutor pointed out multiple times Thursday that Momeni was questioning him the way he grilled Lee.",
      "Nima Momeni was 14 when his mother, Mahnaz Tayarani, took him and Khazar to the U.S., fleeing Iran and a husband who had inflicted years of abuse and violence on the family, she wrote in a letter submitted to the court in support of her son\u2019s pre-trial release.",

      "BAKU, Azerbaijan -- For the third straight year, efforts to fight climate change haven't lowered projections for how hot the world is likely to get \u2014 even as countries gather for another round of talks to curb warming, according to an analysis Thursday.",
      "At the United Nations climate talks, hosted in Baku, Azerbaijan, nations are trying to set new targets to cut emissions of heat-trapping gases and figure out how much rich nations will pay to help the world with that task.",
      "But Earth remains on a path to be 2.7 degrees Celsius (4.9 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than pre-industrial times, according to Climate Action Tracker, a group of scientists and analysts who study government policies and translate that into projections of warming.",
      "If emissions are still rising and temperature projections are no longer dropping, people should wonder if the United Nations climate negotiations \u2014 known as COP \u2014 are doing any good, said Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an awful lot going on that\u2019s positive here, but on the big picture of actually getting stuff done to reduce emissions ... to me it feels broken,\u201d Hare said.",
      "The world has already warmed 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. That's near the 1.5-degree (2.7 F) limit that countries agreed to at 2015 climate talks in Paris. Climate scientists say the atmospheric warming, mainly from human burning of fossil fuels, is causing ever more extreme and damaging weather including droughts, flooding and dangerous heat.",
      "Climate Action Tracker does projections under several different scenarios, and in some cases, those are going up slightly.",
      "\u201cThis is driven highly by China,\u201d said Sofia Gonzales-Zuniga of Climate Analytics. Even though China's fast-rising emissions are starting to plateau, they are peaking higher than anticipated, she said.",
      "Another upcoming factor not yet in the calculations is the U.S. elections. A Trump administration that rolls back the climate policies in the Inflation Reduction Act, and carries out the conservative blueprint Project 2025, would add 0.04 degree Celsius (0.07 Fahrenheit) to warming projections, Gonzales-Zuniga said. That's not much, but it could be more if other nations use it as an excuse to do less, she said.",
      "\u201cFossil fuels and emissions are not peaking,\u201d said Sherry Rehman, chair of climate and environment committee in Pakistan\u2019s senate. After 29 years of climate talks, Rehman said countries are \u201cstill talking in bumper stickers.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe need a transformative solution. We need strong delivery,\u201d Rehman said.",

      "Negotiations on a grand total and structuring the overall amount have taken \u201ca step back\u201d when a draft of just a few pages that was worked on for a year was rejected and the latest proposal with many options has more than 30 pages, said top European negotiator Veronika Bagi of Hungary. European Commission negotiator Jacob Werksman said there\u2019s a \u201cvery significant gap\u2033 between what rich and poor nations propose.",
      "German climate envoy Jennifer Morgan said \u201cprivate investment has to be brought to the table\u201d in order to fulfill developing countries needs. But Mariana Paoli of Christian Aid said any number that comes out of negotiations that's not based in publicly-financed grants \u201cwill be meaningless.\u201d",
      "Relying on the private sector means climate cash will not be \u201cneeds based, it will be profit-driven,\" she said, adding that crises like the COVID-19 pandemic and bank bailouts proves that public funds are available.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about fairness, it\u2019s about justice,\u201d she said.",
      "Getting climate cash is personal for many activists from vulnerable nations, like Sandra Leticia Guzman Luna, who is from Mexico and the director of the climate finance group for Latin America and the Caribbean. \u201cWe are observing the climate impacts causing a lot of costs, not only economic costs but also human losses,\u201d she said.",

      "The Walt Disney Co. said Thursday that its direct-to-consumer business, which includes Disney+ and Hulu, reported quarterly operating income of $253 million compared with an operating loss of $420 million a year earlier. Revenue rose 15% to $5.78 billion.",
      "The combined streaming businesses, which includes Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, achieved profitability for the first time in the third quarter.",

      "\u201cThe Digital Duty of Care will place the onus on digital platforms to proactively keep Australians safe and better prevent online harms,\u201d Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said in a statement.",
      "The proposed changes to the Online Safety Act were announced before the government next week introduces to Parliament world-first legislation that would ban children younger than 16 from platforms including X, Instagram, Facebook and TikTok.",
      "Critics have argued that removing children from social media reduced incentives for platforms to provide safer online environments.",
      "Social media has been blamed for an increase in children taking their own lives and developing eating disorders due to bulling and exposures to negative body images.",
      "Rowland said making tech companies legally responsible for keeping Australians safe was an approach already adopted by Britain and the European Union.",
      "Digital businesses would be required to take reasonable steps to prevent foreseeable harms on their platforms and services. The duty of care framework would be underpinned by risk assessment and risk mitigation, and informed by safety-by-design principles, the minister said.",
      "Legislating a duty of care would mean services can\u2019t \u201cset and forget.\u201d Instead, their obligations would mean they need to continually identify and mitigate potential risks, as technology and service offerings change and evolve, she said.",
      "The categories of harm in the legislation include harm to young people and mental well-being, promotion of harmful practices and illegal activity.",
      "The government has not said when the duty of care legislation will be introduced to Parliament or outlined the punishment for breaches.",

The opposition party says it would have done the same after winning elections due within months if the government hadn\u2019t moved first.",

      "According to U.N. figures, some 399 people have been killed and 915 wounded from landmines and other munitions since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, equal to the number of casualties reported from 2014-2021. More than 1 in 10 of those casualties have been children.",
      "The economic impact is costing billions to the Ukrainian economy. Landmines and other munitions are preventing the sowing of 5 million hectares, or 10%, of the country\u2019s agricultural land.",
      "Cyprus stepped up to offer its facilities as part of the European Union\u2019s Military Assistance Mission to Ukraine.

      "\u201cWe are committed to continuing this support for as long as it takes,\u201d Gotsis told the Associated Press, adding that the Cyprus government has covered the 250,000 euro ($262,600) training cost.",
      "Cyprus opted to offer such training owing to its own landmine issues dating back five decades when the island nation was ethnically divided when Turkey invaded following a coup that sought union with Greece. The United Nations has removed some 27,000 landmines from a buffer zone that cuts across the island, but minefields remain on either side. The Cypriot government says it has disposed of all anti-personnel mines in line with its obligations under an international treaty that bans the use of such munitions.",
      "In Cyprus, Ukrainians undergo rigorous theoretical and practical training over a five-week Basic Demining and Clearance course that includes instruction on distinguishing and safely handling landmines and other explosive munitions, such as rockets, 155 mm artillery shells, rocket-propelled grenades and mortar shells.",
      "Theoretical training uses inert munitions identical to the actual explosives.",
      "Most of the course is comprised of hands-on training focusing on the on-site destruction of unexploded munitions using explosives, the chief training officer told the Associated Press. The officer spoke on condition of anonymity because he\u2019s not authorized to disclose his identity for security reasons.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re trained on ordnance disposal using real explosives,\u201d the officer said. \u201cThat will be the trainees\u2019 primary task when they return.\u201d",

      "Trainees, divided into groups of eight, are taught how to operate metal detectors and other tools for detecting munitions like prodders \u2014 long, thin rods which are used to gently probe beneath the ground\u2019s surface in search of landmines and other explosive ordnance.",
      "Another tool is a feeler, a rod that\u2019s used to detect booby-trapped munitions. There are many ways to booby-trap such munitions, unlike landmines which require direct pressure to detonate.",
      "\u201cBooby-trapped munitions are a widespread phenomenon in Ukraine,\u201d the chief training officer explained.",
      "Training, primarily conducted by experts from other European Union countries, takes place both in forested and urban areas at different army camps and follows strict safety protocols.",
      "The short, intense training period keeps the Ukrainians focused.",
      "\u201cYou see the interest they show during instruction: they ask questions, they want to know what mistakes they\u2019ve made and the correct way of doing it,\u201d the officer said.",

      "LONDON -- European Union regulators issued their first antitrust fine to Facebook parent Meta on Thursday with a penalty of nearly 800 million euros for what they call \u201cabusive practices\u201d involving its Marketplace online classified ads business.",
      "The European Commission, the 27-nation bloc's executive branch and top antitrust enforcer, issued the 797.72 million euro ($841 million) penalty after its long-running investigation found that the company abused its dominant position and engaged in anti-competitive behavior.",
      "It\u2019s the first time the EU has imposed a fine on the social media giant for breaches of the bloc\u2019s competition law. Brussels has already slapped Big Tech rivals Google and Apple with billions in antitrust penalties.",
      "The commission had accused Meta of distorting competition by tying its online classified ad business to its social network, automatically exposing Facebook users to Marketplace \u201cwhether they want it or not\" and shutting out competitors.",
      "It was also concerned that Meta was imposing unfair trading conditions with terms of service that authorized the company to use ad-related data \u2014 generated from competing classified ad platforms who advertise on Facebook or Instagram \u2014 to benefit Marketplace.",
      "Meta's practices gave it \u201cadvantages that other online classified ads service providers could not match,\u201d Margrethe Vestager, the commission's executive vice-president in charge of competition policy, said in a press release \u201cThis is illegal under EU antitrust rules. Meta must now stop this behaviour.\u201d",
      "Meta said in a statement that the decision fails to prove any \u201ccompetitive harm\u201d to rivals or consumers and \u201cignores the realities of the thriving European market for online classified listing services.\u201d",
      "The company said the Commission's case ignores the fact that Facebook users can choose to \u201dengage with Marketplace, and many don't.\" It said online marketplaces, including global sites like eBay, Europe-wide platforms like Vinted, and national services are continuing to grow.",
      "Meta said it would comply with the Commission's order to end the offending conduct and not repeat it, but also vowed to appeal.",
      "The case dates back to 2021, when European Union regulators and their counterparts in Britain opened dual investigations into the classified business. The British regulator wrapped up its investigation last year after Meta made concessions.",
      "The company continues to face EU scrutiny on other fronts, including investigations into whether Facebook and Instagram child safety and election integrity measures comply with the bloc\u2019s digital rulebook. Meta has previously been hit with a series of fines for breaches of the EU\u2019s stringent privacy laws, including a record 1.2 billion euro penalty last year.",

      "Environmental advocates released reports Friday decrying fossil fuel industry influence at these climate talks in Baku, Azerbaijan, called COP29",
      "BAKU, Azerbaijan -- Good or bad, the United Nations climate negotiations process itself became the focus of the international talks that aim to curb warming from coal, oil and natural gas.",
      "Environmental advocates released reports Friday decrying fossil fuel industry influence at the climate talks called COP29. At the same time, a letter signed by a former United Nations secretary-general and ex-top climate negotiators called for dramatic reform. And the conference's chief negotiator said current talks \u2014 aimed at striking a deal worth hundreds of billions of dollars to help finance a transition to clean energy and adapting to climate change \u2014 were going too slowly.",
      "All that put the focus on process \u2014 not results.",
      "\u201cWe consider COP29 as a litmus test for the global climate architecture,\" conference lead negotiator Yalchin Rafiyev said at a Friday news conference.",
      "A letter signed by former U.N. chief Ban Ki-Moon, former U.N. climate secretary Christiana Figueres and former Ireland President Mary Robinson called for \u201ca fundamental overhaul of the COP.\"",
      "\"We need a shift from negotiation to implementation,\u201d it said.",
      "Two signees \u2014 Figueres and Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research \u2014 said the letter was being badly misinterpreted as criticism of the climate talks. They said the letter was intended to show support for the process, which they said has worked and just needs to shift into a new mode.",
      "Instead of spending so much effort negotiating new deals in annual conferences that can attract 70,000 people, the process should be smaller and more frequent and aimed at putting what was already agreed upon into action, Rockstrom said.",
      "\u201cIt's about strengthening the COP,\" Rockstrom said. \u201cIt's about recognizing we\u2019ve accomplished so much that we have what we need. ... We really need to get serious about delivery.\"",
      "Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare said he had issues with some of the suggestions in the letter and personally considers the COP process broken. His analysis this week showed that after the 2015 Paris agreement projected future warming dropped, but in the past three years, warming projections \u2014 based on negotiations, promises and policies \u2014 for the future have stayed the same or even gone up slightly.",
      "An analysis from the Kick Big Polluters Out coalition said Friday that the official attendance list of the talks featured at least 1,770 people connected to fossil fuel interests.",
      "Catherine Abreu, director of the International Climate Politics Hub, suggested that there should be a \u201cfirewall\u201d between fossil fuel lobbyists, U.N. climate bodies and negotiators from countries. \u201cWe know over 1,700 fossil fuel lobbyists are here at COP29. That is not acceptable,\u201d she said.",
      "Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, who on Friday presented new data on carbon pollution sites, said \u201cit\u2019s unfortunate that the fossil fuel industry and the petrostates have seized control of the COP process to an unhealthy degree.\"",
      "For his part, COP29 negotiator Rafiyev defended the process.",
      "\u201cThe process has already delivered, the COP process so far by reducing projected warming, delivering finance to those in need,\" Rafiev said. \u201cIt\u2019s better than any alternative.\u201d",
      "One key benefit of the U.N. climate talks process is it's the only place where vulnerable small island nations have an equal seat at the table, United Nations Environment Programme Executive Director Inger Andersen told The Associated Press. But the process has its limits because \u201cthe rules of the game are set by member states,\u201d she said.",
      "At a press conference, Alliance of Small Islands States Chair Cedric Schuster said the negotiating bloc felt the need to remind everyone else why the talks matter.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re here to defend the Paris agreement,\u201d Schuster said, referring to the climate deal in 2015 to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned that countries are forgetting that protecting the world\u2019s most vulnerable is at the core of this framework.\u201d",
      "Also at the talks Friday, new data from an organization co-founded by Gore that combines observations and artificial intelligence found that cities in Asia and the United States emit the most heat-trapping gas, with Shanghai the most polluting.",
      "Using observations and artificial intelligence, Climate Trace quantifies heat-trapping carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, as well as other traditional air pollutants worldwide, including for the first time in more than 9,000 urban areas.",
      "Seven states or provinces spew more than 1 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases, all of them in China, except Texas, which ranks sixth.",
      "Earth's total carbon dioxide and methane pollution grew 0.7% to 61.2 billion metric tons with the short-lived but extra potent methane rising 0.2%. The figures are higher than other datasets \u201cbecause we have such comprehensive coverage and we have observed more emissions in more sectors than are typically available,\u201d said Gavin McCormick, Climate Trace's co-founder.",
      "Shanghai's 256 million metric tons of greenhouse gases led all cities and exceeded those from the nations of Colombia or Norway. Tokyo's 250 million metric tons would rank in the top 40 of nations if it were a country, while New York City's 160 million metric tons and Houston's 150 million metric tons would be in the top 50 of countrywide emissions. Seoul, South Korea, ranks fifth among cities at 142 million metric tons.",
      "\u201cOne of the sites in the Permian Basin in Texas is by far the No. 1 worst polluting site in the entire world,\u201d Gore said. \u201cAnd maybe I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised by that, but I think of how dirty some of these sites are in Russia and China and so forth. But Permian Basin is putting them all in the shade.\u201d",
      "China, India, Iran, Indonesia and Russia had the biggest increases in emissions from 2022 to 2023, while Venezuela, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States had the biggest decreases in pollution.",
      "The dataset \u2014 maintained by scientists and analysts from various groups \u2014 also looked at traditional pollutants such as carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds, ammonia, sulfur dioxide and other chemicals associated with dirty air. Burning fossil fuels releases both types of pollution, Gore said.",
      "This \u201crepresents the single biggest health threat facing humanity,\u201d Gore said.",

Now, anyone with the Waymo One smartphone app will be able to request a ride around an 80-square-mile (129-square-kilometer) territory spanning the second largest U.S. city.",

      "The private auction was being held as part of Jones' personal bankruptcy, which resulted from the nearly $1.5 billion in defamation lawsuit judgments a judge and jurors ordered the bombastic internet show and radio host to pay to families of victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting for repeatedly telling his audience that the Connecticut massacre of 20 children and six adults was a hoax staged by crisis actors. Jones, who has since acknowledged that the shooting did happen, is appealing the defamation verdicts.",

      "Everything from Jones\u2019 studio desk to Infowars\u2019 name, video archive, social media accounts, and product trademarks and inventory were up for sale. Buyers could even purchase an armored truck and video cameras. . Any unsold items will be auctioned off next month.",
      "Many of Jones\u2019 personal assets, including real estate as well as guns and other personal belongings, also are being sold as part of the bankruptcy.",
      "Prospective buyers submitted sealed bids and confidentiality agreements by last Friday. The bankruptcy trustee, attorney Christopher Murray, appointed by the Justice Department, could have held new rounds of bidding Wednesday to boost prices above the sealed bids.",
      "Jones said Murray decided to choose from among the sealed bids. Jones said he was frustrated with that decision and learned about changes to the auction process only on Monday. A judge's order in September gave the trustee wide authority and said new bidding rounds on Wednesday were optional.",
      "Murray also could reject bids, even the highest ones, if he deemed them \u201ccontrary to the best interests of the Debtor\u2019s estate, FSS (Infowars parent company Free Speech Systems) and their creditors.\u201d",
      "Families sued Jones and his company for defamation and emotional distress for repeatedly saying on his show that the shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, was a hoax staged by crisis actors to spur more gun control. Parents and children of many of the victims testified that they were traumatized by Jones\u2019 conspiracies and threats by his followers."

    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 19:46:25 -0500",
    "summary": "After a tumultuous year filled with anxiety and a legal fight about its future in the U.S., TikTok may have just been thrown a lifeline by the man who was once its biggest foe",

      "After a tumultuous year filled with anxiety and a legal fight about its future in the U.S., TikTok may have just been thrown a lifeline by the man who was once its biggest foe",
      "After a tumultuous year filled with anxiety and a legal battle about its future in the U.S., TikTok may have just been thrown a lifeline by the man who was once its biggest foe: Donald Trump.",
      "President-elect Trump, who tried to ban the social media platform the last time he was in the White House, has repeatedly pledged during his most recent campaign to oppose a ban on the short-form video app, which could happen as soon as mid-January if the company loses a court case that\u2019s currently underway in Washington.",
      "For months, TikTok, and its China-based parent company ByteDance, have been embroiled in a legal battle with the U.S. over a federal law that forces them to cut ties for national security reasons or stop operating in one of their biggest markets in the world. The measure, signed by President Joe Biden in April, gives ByteDance nine months to divest its stakes, with a possible three-month extension if a sale was in progress. If that happens, the deadline could be extended into the first 100 days of Trump\u2019s presidency.",
      "The companies have claimed that divestiture is not possible, and the law, if upheld, would force them to shut down by Jan. 19, just a day before Trump\u2019s second inauguration. Attorneys for both sides have asked a federal appeals court reviewing the case to issue a ruling by Dec. 6. The losing side is expected to appeal to the Supreme Court, which has a conservative majority and could decide to take up the case, potentially dragging out the process even longer.",
      "When reached for comment, the Trump transition team did not offer details on how Trump plans to carry out his pledge to \u201csave TikTok,\u201d as he said on a Truth Social post in September while encouraging people who care about the platform to vote for him. But Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for the transition team, indicated in a statement that he plans to see it through.",
      "\ufeff\u201cThe American people re-elected President Trump by a resounding margin giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cHe will deliver.\u201d",
      "During a March interview with CNBC, Trump said he still believed TikTok posed a national security risk but opposed banning it because doing so would help its rival, Facebook, which he has continued to lambast over his 2020 election loss. He also denied changing his mind on the issue because of Republican megadonor Jeff Yass, a ByteDance investor that Trump, at the time, said that he had only met \u201cvery briefly.\u201d He said Yass \u201cnever mentioned TikTok\u201d during their meeting.",
      "Still, ByteDance \u2013 and groups connected to Yass \u2013 have been attempting to exert their influence. Lobbying disclosure reports show that this year, ByteDance paid veteran lobbyist and former Trump campaign aide David Urban $150,000 to lobby lawmakers in Washington in favor of TikTok. The company has also spent more than $8 million on in-house lobbyists and another $1.4 million on other lobbying firms, according to Open Secrets.",
      "Meanwhile, in March, Politico reported Kellyanne Conway, a former senior Trump aide, was being paid by the Yass-funded conservative group Club for Growth to advocate for TikTok in Congress. A spokesperson for the organization said Conway was hired as a consultant to conduct polling. Conway and Urban did not respond to requests for comment. TikTok, which has long denied it\u2019s a national security risk, declined to comment.",
      "If the courts uphold the law, it would fall on Trump\u2019s Justice Department to enforce it and punish any potential violations with fines. The fines would apply to app stores that would be prohibited from offering TikTok, and internet hosting services who would be barred from supporting it. Leah Plunkett, a lecturer at Harvard Law School, said from her reading of the statute, the attorney general has to investigate violations but can decide whether or not to drag such companies to court and force them to comply.",
      "Trump could do other things to prevent TikTok from disappearing.",
      "He could issue an executive order to nullify the ban \u2014 which Plunkett believes would not be lawful \u2014 or urge Congress to repeal the law. That would require support from Congressional Republicans who have aligned themselves with Trump but have also supported the prospects of getting TikTok out of the hands of a Chinese company.",
      "In a statement sent to the AP after the election, Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on China, said Trump\u2019s \u201clong-standing concerns\u201d about TikTok align with the law\u2019s requirement for divestment.",
      "\u201cThe Trump Administration will have a unique opportunity to broker an American takeover of the platform,\u201d he said.",
      "ByteDance, though, has previously said it has no intention to sell the platform despite interest from some investors, including Trump\u2019s former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Analysts say the company is even less likely to sell the proprietary algorithm that fuels what users see on the app. That means even if TikTok is sold to a qualified buyer, it is likely to be a shell of its current self and would need to be rebuilt with new technology.",
      "Sarah Kreps, director of Cornell University\u2019s Tech Policy Institute, said it\u2019s also possible that Trump could take the issue back to the drawing board and direct his administration to negotiate a new deal with TikTok.",
      "TikTok said in 2022, it presented the Biden administration with a draft agreement that would bolster protections for users and provide it more oversight over the company\u2019s U.S. operations. But the administration has argued in court documents in recent months that it would be challenging to enforce the agreement due to the size and the technical complexity of the platform.",
      "Trump hasn\u2019t been privy to new intelligence material on the matter for a few years and it's possible he could change his mind - and abandon his campaign promise - once he does, Kreps said.",
      "Plunkett, the Harvard Law faculty and author of \u201cSharenthood: Why We Should Think before We Talk about Our Kids Online,\u201d said if she were counseling TikTok, she would advise them to come up with a divesture plan that is compliant with the law and as favorable to them as possible.",
      "\u201cThere is too much uncertainty about what a Trump administration is likely to do,\u201d she said."

      "Tim Parlatore, a lawyer for the Fox News star, said in the statement that Hegseth settled in December 2020 only because he feared his career would suffer if her allegations were made public. Parlatore said Hegseth was the victim of \"blackmail\" and \"false claims of sexual assault\" by an unidentified woman after a Republican women's convention in California on Oct. 7, 2017.",
      "\"Knowing that it was the height of the MeToo movement and any public accusation would result in his immediate termination from Fox, Mr. Hegseth ultimately decided to enter into a settlement for a significantly reduced amount,\" according to the statement.",
      "In Parlatore's telling, Hegseth met the woman an event afterparty, where he became \"visibly intoxicated.\" The woman \"led him by the arm to his hotel room\" where the two engaged in a \"consensual sexual encounter.\"",
      "\"The complainant was the aggressor in initiating sexual activity,\" Parlatore wrote.",
      "As ABC News has previously reported, the woman filed a police report days later but no charges were filed. Two years later, according to Parlatore, the woman \"began to make noise about filing a lawsuit against Mr. Hegseth.\" Her co-workers \"warned us of the threat,\" prompting Hegseth and his legal team to send her a cease-and-desist letter.",
      "Parlatore did not reveal the amount of the settlement.",
      "According to The Washington Post, Parlatore's statement -- which was first reported  by the newspaper -- came after a friend of the alleged victim sent a memo to Trump transition officials last week drawing their attention to the incident.",
      "The memo, which ABC News has not obtained or reviewed, reportedly said that the woman -- who was described by the Post as a then-30-year-old conservative group staffer -- was responsible for ensuring that Hegseth made it back to his hotel room at the end of the night.",
      "In a post on X [linked], Trump\u2019s team said the president-elect is standing by Hegseth.",
      "\u201cMr. Hegseth has vigorously denied any and all accusations, and no charges were filed,\u201d Stephen Cheung, Trump\u2019s communications director, said. \u201cWe look forward to his confirmation as United States Secretary of Defense.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s team has not replied to ABC News\u2019 request for comment. The person who sent the memo to the transition team did not respond to requests for comment from The Post.",
      "According to the memo, two other women summoned her over when Hegseth became \"pushy about his interest in taking them upstairs to his room.\"",
      "After the two other women left, the woman \"didn't remember anything until she was in Hegseth's hotel room and then stumbling to find her hotel room.\" The next day, she \"had a moment of hazy memory of being raped the night before, and had a panic attack,\" the memo read.",
      "The woman then went to an emergency room where a rape-kit examination \u201cwas positive for semen,\u201d the Post reported the memo said.",
      "Monterey city officials said in a statement that police investigated a \"sexual assault\" that allegedly occurred in the early morning hours of Oct. 8, 2017, at a Hyatt Regency. The incident did not involve a weapon, but the victim allegedly suffered \"contusions to right thigh.\"",
      "Hegseth is not identified in the city's statement as the alleged assailant. The victim\u2019s name and age are listed as \"confidential.\"",
      "A police report was filed days later, on Oct. 12. A Monterey Superior Court spokesperson told ABC News on Thursday there no records on file with Hegseth\u2019s name as a party.",

      "All red flag warnings, which signal critical fire weather conditions like strong winds and low relative humidity, were lifted throughout the Northeast Saturday evening as conditions improved following days of wildfires that broke out across New Jersey, New York, Connecticut and Massachusets.",
      "The biggest wildfire in the Northeast remains the Jennings Creek Fire, burning on the border of New York's Orange County and New Jersey's Passaic County. The fire, which has burned more than 5,000 acres, prompted hundreds of voluntary evacuations Saturday night when it jumped a containment line near Greenwood Lake and threatened homes in the private beach community of Wah-ta-Wah Park, according to New York State Parks Department spokesperson Jeff Wernick.",
      "On Sunday morning, Orange County fire officials said \"efforts overnight to protect structures were successful and no structures are in danger.\"",

      "The Jennings Creek Fire was 88% contained on the New York side and 90% contained on the New Jersey side, officials said.",
      "The blaze broke out Nov. 9 and burned drought-parched wildland stretching from West Milford in Passaic County, New Jersey, to the Sterling Forest State Park in New York's Orange County, and on both the New York and New Jersey sides of Greenwood Lake, officials said.",
      "The cause of the Jennings Creek Fire remains under investigation.",
      "A New York State Parks and Recreation employee was killed earlier this month while helping the battle the Jennings Creek Fire, officials said. The deceased parks employee was identified by the New York State Police as 18-year-old Dariel Vasquez.",
      "Wind gusts, which have helped fan the fire, are forecast to be lighter on Sunday, peaking at 15 to 25 mph, and relative humidity is expected to be slightly higher, allowing for some relief for firefighters. Temperatures will also top out around 10 to 20 degrees above average on Sunday and Monday, with temperatures rising to the low to mid 60s.",
      "But the prolonged period of dry weather is expected to persist with no measurable rainfall expected in the Northeast until possibly Wednesday or Thursday. While any rain is beneficial, there is an increasing chance for an inch or more of rain from the upcoming storm, with some higher-elevation snow also possible in New England late in the week.",

      "At one point last week, the National Weather Service had issued numerous red flag fire danger warnings throughout New Jersey and New York. At least 15 New York counties were under red flag warnings last week, including New York City and all of Long Island.",
      "Multiple wildfires broke out across the Northeast, including some in New York City, where one ignited in the Inwood neighborhood of upper Manhattan and another scorched wooded land in Brooklyn's Prospect Park.",
      "Due to the high fire danger, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul issued a statewide ban on outdoor fires.",

      "Tucker said the task force will involve a dedicated team of fire marshals, fire protection inspectors and tactical drone units that will \"help ensure rapid and effective responses to brush fires, conduct comprehensive investigations to help determine the cause and origin of each fire, and enhance data and information sharing to prevent fires from occurring.\"",
      "\"By creating this task force, we are taking real action to prevent brush fires from occurring, putting protocols in place to keep our members safe while they are in the field, and working to identify the causes of these fires after they happen to keep New Yorkers safe in the future,\" Tucker said in a statement. \"I also want to urge New Yorkers to follow our important safety tips and help us reduce the chances of a brush fire occurring.\"",

      "\"You know, if we're going after the guy that's picking tomatoes or the nurse at the local hospital and we're not going after the convicted criminal, then our government has failed us,\" Gonzales told ABC News' Martha Raddatz in an interview on \"This Week.\"",
      "Trump has promised a mass deportation operation beginning on \"day one\" of his second term, saying he would carry out these plans with the help of local law enforcement and the national guard.

    "story": [
      "Wright is an outspoken critic of policies aimed at curbing climate change.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump announced Saturday that he has nominated Chris Wright, an executive of a fracking company who has fiercely criticized the existence of a climate crisis and the transition to renewable energy sources, to run the Department of Energy.",
      "\"As Secretary of Energy, Chris will be a key leader, driving innovation, cutting red tape, and ushering in a new 'Golden Age of American Prosperity and Global Peace,'\" Trump said in a Truth Social post.",
      "The Senate must approve Wright before he can assume his role.",
      "He has had a long history in the energy industry and has been outspoken about fracking.",
      "After earning a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering and a master's degree in electrical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the 80s, Wright worked for several energy companies, many of which focused on gas production, according to his LinkedIn page.",
      "Wright, who has never worked in a government position, founded the publicly traded oilfield services firm Liberty Energy in 2010, which fracks 20% of the onshore wells nationally. The $3 billion company is involved in nearly 10% of the United States' total energy production, according to Wright.",
      "Wright has made several public comments chastising efforts to fight climate change with unproven claims.",
      "\"There is no climate crisis, and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either,\" Wright said in a video posted to LinkedIn last year.",
      "\"The only thing resembling a crisis with respect to climate change is the regressive opportunity squelching policies justified in the name of climate change,\" he added.",

      "\"There is no such thing as clean energy or dirty energy,\" Wright said last year.",
      "However, the  Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy  says clean energy, like solar and wind, create little or no carbon emissions, the greenhouse gases responsible for human-amplified global warming.",
      "While Wright does not dispute the existence of climate change, he has argued that policies aimed at reducing the impact of climate change are misguided and alarmist, describing the terms climate crisis, energy transition, carbon pollution, clean energy and dirty energy as \"destructive deceptions\" and \"nonsense.\"",
      "Wright claims that any negative impacts of climate change are \"clearly overwhelmed by the benefits of increasing energy consumption\" and believes that extreme weather events like hurricanes, tornadoes and floods have not increased because of climate change.",
      "His claims are contrary to the real-world data and research on these natural disasters.",
      "\"It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land,\" a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)  said.",
      "The U.S. Fifth National Climate Assessment found that human-amplified climate change is causing extreme rainfall events and extreme heat events to become more frequent and more intense.",
      "In his LinkedIn profile, Wright says he is \"all in on energy\" \u2013 including oil, natural gas, nuclear, solar, and geothermal sources \u2013 though he's sharply critical of solar or wind energy advocates who suggest those sources are better for the environment, citing the amount of energy for wind or solar farm construction.",
      "\"It would be hard to call wind or solar clean or low environmental impact with a straight face,\" Wright said last year.",
      "The World Resources Institute has said that \"renewables generate more energy than is used in their production and produce fewer emissions than other power sources over their lifetime.\"",
      "Wright also led a charge against some of the Biden administration's climate policies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission's rule requiring companies to disclose climate-related risks. Liberty Energy successfully convinced a federal appeals court to pause the rule shortly after it was finalized earlier this year.",
      "Wright has frequently donated to Republican candidates and political action committees, including donating $228,390 to Trump's joint fundraising committee earlier this summer. Last year, Wright's total compensation as the CEO of Liberty Energy was $5.6 million, according to a recent SEC filing.",
      "Wright suggested in an interview on Bloomberg TV in July that the Trump administration would expand drilling on federal lands and make it easier to permit infrastructure like pipelines. Asked about how the Biden administration has overseen record oil production, Wright insisted that the United States needs to do more for oil and gas production.",
      "In 2023, during the Biden administration, the United States broke a record for domestic oil production. The U.S. produced more crude oil than any other country in history -- an average of 12.9 million barrels per day, according to the  U.S, Energy Information Administration .",
      "Wright has vowed to decrease energy costs for the U.S., aligning with a promise Trump frequently made on the campaign trail.",
      "\"I make this pledge to the great people of America, I will end the devastating inflation crisis immediately, bring down interest rates and lower the cost of energy,\" Trump told the Republican National Convention. \"We will drill, baby, drill.\"",

      "Existing regulations may prove difficult to overcome, experts told ABC News.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump has ambitious plans to utilize U.S. federal lands for the extraction of natural resources.",
      "But Trump \u2013 who promised at the Republican National Convention in July to \"drill, baby, drill\" if he were to be reelected \u2013 may not be able to accomplish the vast majority of his plans due to existing protections and the way federal lands are defined, environmental law experts told ABC News.",
      "Trump won't be able to \"just turn on the spigot\" for new oil and gas drilling on day one of his administration, Athan Manuel, director of the Sierra Club's Lands Protection Program, told ABC News.",
      "\"Every administration gets to the place where they have to differentiate between the rhetoric that they use in the campaign and the actual challenges when it comes to actually governing,\" Stan Meiburg, executive director of Wake Forest University's Sabin Family Center for Environment and Sustainability, told ABC News.",
      "National parks, wilderness areas, wildlife refuges, military reservations and public-domain lands are owned and managed by the federal government.",
      "Public land is intended to be used for public benefit, but for the last century or so, that definition has sometimes been conflated to also include the extraction of natural resources, such as oil, gas, minerals and timber, according to Peter Colohan, director of federal strategies at the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Federal lands are \"for the benefit and enjoyment of all people,\" Colohan told ABC News, evoking the famous phrase by former President Teddy Roosevelt that's inscribed on the arch at north entrance of Yellowstone National Park.",
      "Trump carried out what environmentalists widely regarded as an anti-environmental policy regime during his first term, withdrawing from the Paris Agreement to address climate change upon taking office in 2016 \u2013 which he has said he plans to do again, reversing President Biden's Jan. 20, 2021 action to rejoin the agreement \u2013 removing clean water and air pollution protections, and fast-tracking environmental reviews of dozens of major energy and infrastructure projects, such as drilling and fuel pipelines, which Trump has said would help boost American energy production and the economy.",
      "During his next term, Trump also has promised to drastically increase fossil fuels production in the U.S., despite the U.S. already producing and exporting a record amount of crude oil under the Biden administration.",
      "\"I think it's an absolute certainty that Trump is going to push to open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, 19.3 million acres in northeastern Alaska that provides critical habitat to several species, to unfettered oil drilling, as well as areas outside of the refuge along the Alaska coast,\" Kier\u00e1n Suckling, executive director for the Center for Biological Diversity, told ABC News. \"He's been gunning for that for years.\"",
      "The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to an ABC News request for comment on this story.",
      "Regulatory challenges",
      "The president and the executive branch may have a \"great deal of discretion\" over control of public lands and monuments, but existing laws to protect lands like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge will be difficult to overturn, Suckling said.",
      "Since the 1970s, a slew of environment regulations have been put in place to protect the U.S. landscape, such as the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970, followed by the Clean Water Act in 1972 and the Endangered Species Act in 1973. The Clean Air Act was established in 1963 and has been amended several times since, the first time in 1970.",
      "Because of this legal environmental infrastructure, it would be virtually impossible for Trump to easily or unilaterally change these protections, the experts said. In order for the Trump administration to overturn regulations against use of protected lands for energy production, he would have to present evidence to demonstrate that the proposed actions would not violate existing environmental laws, Suckling said.",
      "\"You have to use the best science available and if the science does not support your policy, the law is not going to permit you to do it,\" Suckling said.",
      "The day after Trump won reelection, President Joe Biden moved to narrow the scope of the lease in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, signed by Trump in 2017, to limit oil drilling. The Biden administration found \"legal deficiencies\" in the leases that would have made it possible for the Trump administration to expand fossil fuel production, Colohan said.",
      "The biggest roadblock to Trump's plans to drill on federally protected lands is whether or not those areas are actually economically competitive, compared to places where people are drilling on private land using hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, Meiburg said.",
      "However, most federal lands are not protected, Drew Caputo, vice president of litigation at Earthjustice, told ABC News. For such unprotected lands, it's possible for Trump to issue an executive order to lease them for energy production. Even so, whenever a decision is being made to lease public land, \"there will be a legal battle for sure,\" Colohan said, adding that executive orders are \"more reversible\" than an existing statutory regulation.",
      "Environmental activist resistance",
      "In order for Trump to open federal land for leasing, his administration is required by law to notify the public, with environmental lawyers certain to be ready to challenge him.",
      "\"Environmental laws are carefully designed to produce a stable, democratic, scientific outcome,\" Suckling said. \"You can't just get in and jump around and do whatever you want, and that's why the United States has one of the best-protected environments \u2013 one of the cleanest, healthiest environments of any nation on earth,\"",
      "During Trump's first term, the Biological Center for Diversity sued his administration 266 times and won about 90% of those actions, Suckling said. Earthjustice filed about 200 lawsuits against the Trump administration and won about 85% of them, according to Caputo.",
      "\"We're going to have to sue their pants off every chance we get,\" the Sierra Club's Manuel said.",
      "The Trump administration will likely face opposition from other stakeholders as well, such as Native American tribes, which could be impacted should federal land be leased for energy extraction, Meiburg said.",
      "Trump's loss in the 2020 election may have been the speed bump needed to thwart his agenda for federal lands, some experts also said. Now that he's been reelected four years later, he's essentially a one-term president and many of his proposed actions could be tied up in litigation for years, Suckling said.",
      "Conversely, had Trump had eight consecutive years in office, it may have afforded him the continuity to enact more sweeping changes regarding use of federal lands, Caputo said. Should the House or Senate flip to Democratic control after the midterm elections, Trump's agenda would likely be blunted even more, Manuel said.",
      "However, it's also challenging for land managers and environmental agencies when there's constant turnover in the regulatory environment because it can slow progress for environmental protections, Colohan said.",
      "All land is under pressure \u2013 whether for development, extraction of resources, agricultural use, climate change or biodiversity loss, Colohan said. But federal lands carry the ideal of conservation for the public benefit, recreation, cultural purposes, and for climate mitigation and resilience, he added.",
      "\"Those things are the better, the longer-term benefits that come from conservation,\" Colohan said. \"And so that's really a choice that's made by every administration.\"",

      "Smith asked to hold the appeal in abeyance and push the next filing deadline until Dec. 2 \"to afford the Government time to assess this unprecedented circumstance and determine the appropriate course going forward consistent with Department of Justice policy.\"",
      "Trump pleaded not guilty last year to 40 criminal counts related to his handling of classified materials after leaving the White House, after prosecutors said he repeatedly refused to return hundreds of documents containing classified information and took steps to thwart the government's efforts to get the documents back.",
      "Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, dismissed the case against Trump and his co-defendants this summer, ruling that Smith's appointment as special counsel was unconstitutional because he was not appointed by the president or confirmed by Congress.",

      "Lawmakers running for reelection loathe tough votes. And for senators up in purple states in two years, those tough votes are coming early.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump is moving at a lightning pace to stock up his administration, mixing in conventional picks like Florida Sen. Marco Rubio for secretary of state with controversial moves like putting up Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz as attorney general and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. for health and human services secretary. For frontline senators who hold the key to the next Senate majority, navigating their confirmations will be a minefield.",
      "Republicans will be defending the seats of North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis and Maine Sen. Susan Collins, while Democrats will be working to protect Georgia Sen. Jon Ossoff and Michigan Sen. Gary Peters. Their confirmation votes for Trump's Cabinet picks offer a chance to prove bipartisan bona fides, but backing a nominee who is too controversial risks opening them up to attack in races that could be decided by razor-thin margins.",
      "\"If they're smart, then it's a major factor. The midterms are still a ways off. Generally, voters have short attention spans, and so it's debatable how much of this stuff they're going to remember. But I think it's uniquely important for people who may take heat from the right,\" said one GOP strategist.",
      "Some of Trump's nominees are not anticipated to run into significant roadblocks.",
      "Rubio has already received praise from some Democratic senators, and members of the chamber are often given some degree of deference when facing confirmation to Cabinet positions. Waltz and Ratcliffe may face tighter margins than Rubio but are also considered to be among Trump's more conventional picks.",
      "But Gaetz and Kennedy, along with Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's pick to be director of national intelligence, and Fox News host Pete Hegseth, named to run the Pentagon, will likely enjoy no Democratic support at all. With Republicans winning a maximum of 53 Senate seats this month, that leaves their margin for error small if they hope to be confirmed.",
      "Already, Collins and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski have sounded skeptical notes about some of Trump's choices, and other Republicans, including Tillis, have remained noncommittal.",
      "The pressure will be on for Republicans, though.",
      "Trump won a comprehensive victory, and before he announced his more controversial cabinet picks, Republicans on Capitol Hill were touting the need for unity as they prepared to take over a unified government in January.",
      "Collins is considered to be in a league of her own, sources said. A senior Republican who's likely one of the few candidates, if not the only one, who can win her state, she's expected to have especially wide latitude to oppose a candidate she deems unfit.",
      "And with a base in such lockstep with Trump, any defiance from other GOP lawmakers could trigger outrage from the famously mercurial president-elect -- fury that could in turn result in a primary challenge, and not just for swing-staters like Tillis.",
      "At the same time, supporting a controversial nominee who pushes the envelope too far once confirmed risks becoming a general election issue.",
      "\"There will be Trump voters who remember how Republican senators handle these nominations. And so, I do think that for senators who are up this cycle, the base is watching how they handle Trump's nominees,\" the Republican strategist said.",
      "\"Any of these other safe-state Republicans who are in cycle, it's within Trump's power to cause problems for them on the right, if he chooses to,\" the person added.",
      "Still, underscoring the catch-22, any votes for nominees deemed too controversial could end up in ads from their ultimate Democratic opponents labeling them a \"rubber stamp\" for Trump, the source warned.",
      "The pressure is on for House members, too.",
      "House members will not have a vote in the confirmation process, but they will inevitably field a slate of questions about nominees like Gaetz. Those running in purple districts could opt to punt, noting their lack of a vote, or they could knock the more controversial contenders, also risking blowback from Trump.",
      "\"I would try and push it to the Senate first and see if you get away with that. And if you don't get away with that, then I would strongly advise to stand by your principles and not to end up going down a path for someone else that you didn't choose for yourself,\" said William O'Reilly, a GOP strategist in New York, home to many endangered House Republicans. \"Loyalty goes so far, the public is looking for legislators that have a little bit of backbone and common sense.\"",
      "Democrats are also in a pickle of their own.",
      "Ossoff and Peters are Senate Democrats' top frontline members up in 2026. Offering support to some of Trump's picks like Rubio, Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla., for national security adviser and former Rep. John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, for CIA director, could bolster their bipartisan bona fides. But going too far risks turning off Democrats, a major risk when they'll need every single supporter energized in states Trump won this month.",
      "\"Waltz, Ratcliffe and Rubio, if you're Ossoff and you vote for them, independent voters see you're a straight shooter, and he can claim he's bipartisan, because he was,\" said one Georgia Democratic strategist. \"And then he says, 'look, I voted for everybody except Gabbard on his national security team.'\"",
      "To be certain, there are several other factors at play across the key midterm races. Incumbents' opponents are far from finalized, the midterms will take place almost two years after confirmation votes start in January, and some nominees might not even make it to a vote.",
      "But already, the knives are out.",

    "title": "Woman told House Ethics panel she witnessed Gaetz having sex with minor, lawyer says",
    "published": "Sat, 16 Nov 2024 13:47:01 -0500",
    "summary": "An attorney tells ABC News that one of his clients told the House Ethics Committee that she witnessed then-Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz having sex with a minor.",
    "story": [
      "Matt Gaetz resigned from Congress Wednesday after Trump picked him for AG.",
      "An attorney representing two women who were witnesses in the House Ethics Committee's investigation into now-former Rep. Matt Gaetz is calling for the release of the committee's report, telling ABC News that one of his clients testified that she witnessed the Florida congressman having sex with a minor.",
      "\"My client testified to the House Ethics Committee that she witnessed Matt Gaetz having sex with a minor,\" Florida attorney Joel Leppard told ABC News.",
      "\"As the Senate considers former Rep. Gaetz's nomination for attorney general, several questions demand answers,\" Leppard said. \"What if multiple credible witnesses provided evidence of behavior that would constitute serious criminal violations?\"",
      "\"Democracy demands transparency. Release the Gaetz Ethics report,\" said Leppard, who represents two women who sat for closed-door testimony with the committee over the summer.",
      "Gaetz, who President-elect Donald Trump selected this week to serve as his attorney general, has long denied any wrongdoing, including have an inappropriate relationship with a minor. The Justice Department declined to charge Gaetz last year after a yearslong investigation into the allegations.",
      "In a statement issued in response to Leppard's claim, a spokesperson for Gaetz said, \"Merrick Garland's DOJ cleared Matt Gaetz and didn't charge him. Are you alleging Garland is part of a cover up?\"",
      "The two witnesses, who ABC News is not naming, both allegedly attended parties with the congressman. Gaetz's one-time friend Joel Greenberg is currently serving an 11-year prison sentence after reaching a deal with prosecutors in May 2021 in which he pleaded guilty to multiple federal crimes including sex trafficking of the woman when she was a minor and introducing her to other \"adult men\" who also had sex with her when she was underage.",
      "According to Greenberg's plea deal, the woman, who ABC News is not identifying, met Greenberg online in 2017 and began meeting him in hotels and houses in the Middle District of Florida, where he \"introduced the Minor to other adult men, who engaged in commercial sex acts with the Minor in the Middle District of Florida,\" court documents said.",
      "At the time, the minor \"represented that she was an adult\" on the website where she met Greenberg -- and according to his plea agreement, he acknowledges that he \"acted in reckless disregard of the fact that the Minor was less than 18 years old when he engaged in commercial sex acts\" and had a \"reasonable opportunity to observe\" that she was underage.",
      "Leppard's statement comes after attorney John Clune, who represents the former minor at the center of the probe, called for the release of the Ethics Committee's report on Thursday.",
      "\"Mr. Gaetz's likely nomination as Attorney General is a perverse development in a truly dark series of events. We would support the House Ethics Committee immediately releasing their report. She was a high school student and there were witnesses,\" Clune said in a statement.",
      "The woman, who is now in her 20s, testified to the House Ethics Committee that the now-former Florida congressman had sex with her when she was 17 years old and he was in Congress, ABC News previously reported.",
      "In a statement responding to that reporting, Gaetz said, \"These allegations are invented and would constitute false testimony to Congress. This false smear following a three year criminal investigation should be viewed with great skepticism.\"",
      "The Justice Department spent years investigating the allegations against Gaetz, including allegations of obstruction of justice, before informing Gaetz last year that it would not bring charges.",
      "Gaetz has long vehemently denied any wrongdoing related to the Justice Department probe. In September, he released a detailed response to questions sent to him by the House Ethics Committee, which was investigating allegations of alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use.",
      "\"Your correspondence of September 4 asks whether I have engaged in sexual activity with any individual under 18. The answer to this question is unequivocally NO. You can apply this response to every version of this question, in every forum,\" Gaetz said in a statement posted to his social media account.",
      "Gaetz resigned from the House this week after being selected to lead Trump's Justice Department, which ended the House Ethics Committee's probe that sources tell ABC News had been entering its final stages. Prior to Gaetz's resignation, the committee had planned to meet this week to discuss whether to release their report on the investigation -- leaving it unclear if the report will ever see the light of day.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson said on Friday that he does not think the House Ethics Committee should release the findings of its investigation into Gaetz, now that the Florida Republican is no longer a member of Congress.",
      "\"I believe it is very important to maintain the House's tradition of not issuing ethics reports on people who are no longer members of Congress. I think it would open a Pandora's box,\" he said.",
      "Leppard told ABC News he supports the release of the report.",
      "\"What if sworn testimony detailed conduct that would disqualify anyone from serving as our nation's chief law enforcement officer?\" the attorney said in his statement to ABC News.",

      "\"I know he's gonna have an uphill battle,\" Republican Sen. Joni Ernst told reporters.",
      "Senate Republicans can only afford to lose four votes to confirm Trump's nominees in the new Congress next year. Republicans are expected to hold 53 seats in the new Congress.",
      "Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer said he has concerns with Gaetz's attorney general nomination and thinks the former Florida congressman likely wouldn't be confirmed if the vote took place imminently.",
      "\"There are concerns he can't get across the finish line and we're going to spend a lot of political capital -- I say 'we' -- a lot of people will spend a lot of political capital on something that even if it got done, you have to wonder if it's worth it,\" Cramer said.",
      "Earlier this week, Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal -- who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which oversees the attorney general confirmation process -- told reporters that he knew of at least five to 10 senators who currently disapproved of Gaetz as the nominee.",

      "Cornyn said he would \"absolutely\" want to see the House Ethics Committee's report on Gaetz during his confirmation process.",
      "Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Dick Durbin, called for the report to be released on Thursday.",
      "\"In light of Donald Trump's selection of former congressman Matt Gaetz to be attorney general, I'm calling on the House Ethics Committee to preserve and share the report and all relevant documentation on Mr. Gates with the Senate Judiciary Committee,\" Durbin, a Democrat, said.",
      "On Thursday, Durbin and Senate Democrats sent a letter officially asking for the House Ethics Committee to release its report on Matt Gaetz, including all other relevant documentation.",

    "summary": "Doctors are worried Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will tout anti-vaccine views after he was picked to lead the Department of Health and Human Services by Trump.",
    "story": [
      "Kennedy has previously falsely claimed that vaccines cause autism.",
      "With the recent pick of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, the environmental attorney's views on vaccines have been thrust back into the spotlight.",
      "Kennedy has been a prominent vaccine skeptic, arguing that more research of vaccines is needed, although he has claimed in interviews that he has \"never been anti-vaccine.\"",
      "Vaccine researchers tell ABC News that his recent comments don't align with his past campaigns and that, if confirmed, he could convince vaccine-hesitant parents to not vaccinate their children.",
      "\"He's really not a vaccine skeptic; I'm a vaccine skeptic,\" Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center, an attending physician in the division of infectious diseases at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the Food and Drug Administration's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, told ABC News.",
      "\"Everybody who sits around the table at the FDA vaccine advisory committee is a vaccine skeptic, right? Show us the data, prove that this vaccine is safe, prove that it's effective, because then and only then will we authorize it, or recommend authorization or licensure,\" he said.",
      "Offit argued that Kennedy is a \"vaccine cynic,\" adding, \"He thinks that we're not getting the right information, that there's an unholy alliance between the pharmaceutical industry and the FDA with the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] to hide the real data, and he's going to find the real data, which is utter nonsense.\"",
      "Claims that vaccines cause autism",
      "Kennedy has previously claimed that the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine -- a myth that was born out of a now-debunked paper from the U.K. in 1998.",
      "The fraudulent paper has since been discredited by health experts, retracted from the journal in which it was published, and its primary author, Andrew Wakefield, lost his medical license. More than a dozen high-quality studies have since found no evidence of a link between childhood vaccines and autism.",
      "Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Texas Children's Hospital Center for Vaccine Development and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, said he's worried that COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy has spilled over into hesitancy towards childhood vaccines.",
      "There have been more measles outbreaks this year than last year and a five-fold increase in whooping cough cases this year from the year before, according to CDC data, which Hotez says is a sign that more parents may be increasingly vaccine-hesitant.",
      "According to the CDC, there have been a total of 277 measles cases reported in 30 states in 2024 -- more than four times the amount last year -- with 16 outbreaks this year compared to four outbreaks in 2023. An estimated 96% of measles cases this year were not fully vaccinated. Additionally, whooping cough cases are at the highest levels this year since 2014, according to CDC data.",
      "This comes as vaccinations among kindergarteners dipped in the 2023-2024 school year for the fourth year in a row \u2013 failing to meet the 95% threshold goal aimed to prevent a single infection from sparking an outbreak. The last time that threshold was met was pre-pandemic, during the 2019-2020 school year.",
      "\"Now you put someone like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nation's most prominent, well-known anti-vaccine activist at the top of the food chain, at the top of Health and Human Services,\" Hotez said. \"I don't see how these things improve any. If anything, they could start to decline even further. \u2026So, I worry about further erosion in the number of kids getting vaccinated in the U.S.\"",
      "Claims about the COVID-19 vaccine",
      "Kennedy also spread vaccine misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic including claims that Dr. Anthony Fauci, former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation were trying to profit off a COVID-19 vaccine.",
      "During a December 2021 Louisiana House of Representatives meeting discussing a proposal to require schoolchildren to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, Kennedy falsely called the vaccine the \"deadliest vaccine ever made.\"",
      "Health officials say COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective following clinical trials that involved tens of thousands of people, and have since helped save millions of lives.",
      "Offit says he is worried that, as the head of the HHS, Kennedy would help select directors of the CDC, FDA and the National Institutes of Health who are not qualified, and could similarly espouse vaccine-skeptic views.",
      "\"My worry is that he is not going to pick technically competent people,\" he said. \"My worry is he's going to have a role in selecting ideologues who are not well-educated about infectious diseases or vaccines, and maybe who lack government experience as well.\"",
      "Both Offit and Hotez said it will be important over the next four years for doctors to have conversations with vaccine-hesitant parents to educate them on the importance of vaccinating their children in case they are swayed by vaccine-skeptic rhetoric from Kennedy.",
      "Offit said he is already getting emails from pediatricians about parents who are hesitant to vaccinate their children because of Kennedy's past comments.",
      "\"Over the last few days, I've gotten emails from pediatricians, one particularly in Connecticut that comes to mind, where they're saying, 'Parents are coming in, and they're saying they don't want to get vaccines, in part because of what [Kennedy] said. What should we do?'\" Offit said. \"So, I think that's where the rubber meets the road. It's certainly a lot more work for clinicians than it used to be.\"",

      "Democrats fell short again in wresting away swing-state prize North Carolina from Republicans in the presidential election",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- Democrats fell short again in wresting away swing-state prize North Carolina from Republicans in the presidential election, but scored significant downballot victories, giving them hope as they look to the future.",
      "Despite Donald Trump's more than 3-percentage point win over Vice President Kamala Harris in North Carolina, Democrats celebrated Election Day victories in races for governor, attorney general and the legislature in a closely divided state where conservatives have recently dominated the General Assembly and the courts.",
      "In an election with few bright spots for Democrats nationally, the ticket-splitting tendencies of Tar Heel state voters offered some of that good news.",
      "\u201cI think we had quality candidates running for office against right-wing extremists, and the people of North Carolina made the right choices,\u201d said Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, a Harris surrogate who was once considered her potential running mate, of the downballot races.",
      "Attorney General Josh Stein, a Democrat, easily defeated Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson to succeed Cooper, who was ineligible to run again because of term limits. The campaign was dominated by Stein\u2019s fundraising prowess and by ads and social media targeting Robinson\u2019s history of inflammatory statements on issues such as abortion and LGBTQ+ rights.",
      "Democrats have now won eight of the past nine gubernatorial elections in North Carolina. In contrast, Republicans have won the state in 11 of the 12 past presidential elections, with Barack Obama in 2008 the lone exception.",
      "In the race to succeed Stein as attorney general, U.S. Rep. Jeff Jackson extended a Democratic election winning streak from 1900 by defeating U.S. Rep. Dan Bishop. Democrats flipped both the lieutenant governor\u2019s office and the state school superintendent\u2019s job \u2014 defeating, in the latter race, a Republican who attended the Jan. 6, 2021, rally in Washington before the attack on the U.S. Capitol and who called public schools liberal \u201cindoctrination centers.\u201d",
      "State Democratic Party Chair Anderson Clayton, the youngest in the country at 26, is learning to embrace the positives while coping with the headwinds Harris faced at the top of the ticket.",
      "\u201cEverybody keeps calling us a bright spot,\" she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, \u2018We still lost the presidential race.\u2019\u201d",
      "State Republicans can hang their hats for 2024 success on Trump\u2019s third consecutive electoral victory and the pickup of three additional congressional seats \u2014 the result of 2023 redistricting that led Democratic incumbents not to seek reelection. Those flips were key to national Republicans' efforts to maintain U.S. House control.",
      "But in the state's lone toss-up congressional race, first-term Democratic Rep. Don Davis won narrowly. While the GOP retained a veto-proof majority in the state Senate, it will likely fall short of keeping one in the House by a single seat, giving Stein a more robust veto stamp to turn back Republican legislation.",
      "Ticket-splitting in North Carolina has gone on for decades. Voters have long been comfortable with Democrats running state agencies but less at ease with the liberal wing of the national Democratic Party.",
      "\u201cPeople are unhappy and want to see change at the federal level. They\u2019re not quite as comfortable with that idea of change for change\u2019s sake at the state level,\u201d said David McLennan, a political science professor at Meredith College in Raleigh.",
      "State Republican leaders say their party still is doing well. They point to winning five of the 10 statewide executive branch positions, retaining General Assembly control and continuing recent dominance in statewide appellate court races. A pending state Supreme Court race, however, seems likely to go to a recount.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of talk about North Carolina being a purple state. You\u2019ve all heard me say this before: North Carolina is a default Republican state,\" state Senate leader Phil Berger told reporters after the election.",
      "Still, 2024 will be marked by missed GOP opportunities that some critics place at Robinson's feet.",
      "What was billed after the March primaries as the nation's most competitive gubernatorial race never materialized; Stein won by almost 15 percentage points. Robinson's bid was overwhelmed by Stein's 4-to-1 spending advantage through mid-October and a CNN report that said Robinson posted graphic sexual and racist statements on a porn website message board more than a decade ago.",
      "Robinson denied writing the messages and ultimately sued CNN. The case is pending. But the Republican Governors Association stopped running ads supporting him, most of his campaign staff quit and Republicans distanced themselves. That included Trump, who had endorsed Robinson before the March primaries and called him \u201cMartin Luther King on steroids\" but stopped appearing with him when Trump passed through North Carolina.",
      "Stein's campaign was comfortable enough to send $12 million late to the state Democratic Party that helped other candidates, including General Assembly hopefuls who ran advertisements linking GOP rivals to Robinson.",
      "\u201cIt could have been a historic race for the state of North Carolina, but it didn\u2019t happen,\" state House Majority Leader John Bell said in an interview. While giving credit to Stein for his campaign, Bell added, \u201cour gubernatorial candidate ran a very poor campaign.\u201d",
      "Larry Shaheen, a longtime political consultant who is now a state Republican Party fundraiser, wrote on X that without the work of party leaders \u201cthe damage to candidates due to Robinson would have been huge.\u201d",
      "Some conservatives stuck with Robinson and blamed Republican officials who gave up on him for some poor electoral results. Robinson himself complained during the campaign about politicians on his side of the aisle that \u201cwhen it gets hot in the kitchen and you turn around and look, they\u2019re not there anymore.\u201d",
      "The next major electoral test comes in 2026, when GOP U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis' seat is up for reelection. Robinson hasn\u2019t ruled out a future bid, which could include challenging Tillis in a primary. Among Democrats, Cooper hasn\u2019t publicly rejected a 2026 Senate bid, and outgoing U.S. Rep. Wiley Nickel, a Democrat, has said he was also considering one. Democrats haven\u2019t won a U.S. Senate seat in North Carolina since 2008.",
      "Still, McLennan said, Democrats gave themselves something to build on.",
      "\u201cDemocrats have to feel pretty good,\" he said. \u201cBut they've still got a lot of work to do for 2026 and 2028.\u201d",
      "Clayton, the Democratic chair, said the work starts now. That means recruiting candidates, starting with next year's municipal races, making sure incumbents have the help they need, and checking in with people across the state to lay the groundwork for future elections.",
      "\u201cWe got to get back to basics,\" she said.",

    "summary": "Fmr. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, who ended the Pentagon's ban on women serving in combat units, addressed Hegseth's claim that women shouldn't serve in combat.",
    "story": [
      "Leon Panetta ended the Pentagon's ban on women serving in combat units.",
      "Former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta is among those pushing back on past comments made by President-elect Donald Trump's pick to be the next defense secretary, who was critical of women being allowed to serve in combat units.",
      "\"I'm straight up just saying, we should not have women in combat roles,\" Pete Hegseth, Trump's nominee for defense secretary, said in a recent podcast interview that aired last week.",
      "\"It hasn't made us more effective, hasn't made us more lethal, has made fighting more complicated,\" he said on the \"The Shawn Ryan Show\".",
      "Hegseth's comments have raised concerns among former servicemembers with first-hand experience serving in integrated units, and from the former Defense Secretary Panetta, who in 2013 lifted the Pentagon's ban on women serving in ground combat units.",
      "\"Those kinds of comments come from a past era and I think it's important for him to take the time to really look at how our military is performing in an outstanding fashion,\" Panetta told ABC News in an interview.",
      "\"We've got the best military in the world, and the reason is because we have the best fighting men and women in the world who are part of it,\" he added.",
      "\"I just think that anybody who takes the time to really look at how women are performing in combat will come around and say that that's exactly where they belong,\" he said.",
      "In the podcast interview, Hegseth said that the decision to allow women to serve in ground combat units has lowered the physical standards for those wishing to serve in those units.",
      "Panetta recalled that in the lead-up to his decision, he pushed back on the notion that allowing women to serve in combat units would lower physical standards.",
      "\"We shouldn't lower the standards. We should require that women have to meet exactly the same standards as men do, and that's what they do,\" he says he argued at the time. \"They wouldn't be in those positions if they weren't able to be able to meet the standards that are required.\"",
      "Panetta said, \"The mere fact that that has just not become an issue at all in terms of how the military has performed, is a reflection that the simple reason is because both men and women are living up to the same standards when it comes to fighting for America.\"",
      "Of the more than one million active-duty military personnel, 17.5% are women according to the Pentagon's latest statistics.",
      "The process of integrating women into combat units was a gradual one that began in 1993 when Defense Secretary Les Aspin issued an order that allowed women to fly in combat.",
      "But women were not allowed to serve in ground combat units until 2013, when Panetta rescinded the ban that was subsequently enhanced in 2015 by Defense Secretary Ash Carter who cleared the path for women to serve in the jobs that were still limited to men, including some in special operations.",
      "By 2019, more than 600 female Sailors and Marines were serving in combat arms units previously restricted to men, while more than 650 women held Army combat roles and over 1,000 had accessed Army combat specialties.",
      "Currently more than 2,500 women serve in previously closed ground combat jobs, 152 women have passed the elite Ranger School test, and 10 of them serve as Rangers in the 75th Ranger Regiment, according to a review of military personnel information compiled by Retired Army Col. Ellen Haring, with the Service Women's Action Network.",

      "\"Women have been serving in combat jobs for almost 10 years now and there is absolutely no evidence that women have harmed combat units,\" she told ABC News. \"In fact, many standards had to be established when they were considering admitting women because they had previously been loosely defined.\"",
      "\"Those who claim they have been lowered have no actual knowledge of the training requirements or how women have been held to the exact same requirements,\" she said. \"If they think standards have changed or are different for women then I challenge them to go to Fort Moore today and watch the execution of training.\"",

Look at the women who've graduated from Ranger School, which is so grueling that around half of the men who enter it fail out,\" said Jaslow in a statement issued in her role as the CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America.",
      "\"Those women deserve a Secretary of Defense who is aware of that reality and also ensures that the culture in the military embraces that reality - especially as we still continue to confront a recruitment crisis,\" she added.",

      "\"Women have served in combat arms units, in both command and enlisted positions, and continue to do so and excel,\" he said.",
      "As a former Army officer, Jordan said he is \"well aware of the physical endurance, technical competence, and mental fortitude that it takes to serve in a tank unit and to perform the duties and responsibilities as a soldier in a combat arms branch.\"",
      "Jordan said women in the training classes he commanded \"maintained the standard, just as much as their male counterparts,\" he said.",
      "\"Ultimately, gender does not determine whether or not someone has the physical strength, or competency to serve in these units,\" said Jordan. \"There is a standard, and if soldiers, regardless of gender are meeting it, then they should have the opportunity to serve in these units.\"",

      "ROME -- The ancient Roman Colosseum will be the venue of gladiator fights \u2014 albeit staged \u2014 for the first time in two millennia under a $1.5 million sponsorship deal with Airbnb that aims to promote \u201ca more conscious tourism.\u201d",
      "But some visitors to the monument Thursday, as well as housing activists, were skeptical about the value of the arrangement, citing ongoing controversies in many cities over the role of short-term rental platforms in fueling overtourism and limiting affordable housing for residents and students.",
      "Under the deal announced by Airbnb and the Colosseum on Wednesday, the sponsorship by the short-term rental giant will cover the renewal of an educational program inside the ancient Roman amphitheater covering the history of the structure and gladiators.",
      "Eight of the platform's users and their plus-ones will be able to participate in faux gladiator fights after the Colosseum's closing time on May 7-8, taking the same underground route used by gladiators in ancient Rome to reach the arena. People can apply for the experience on Nov. 27 at no cost, and the \u201cgladiators\u201d will be chosen by lottery.",
      "The superintendent of the Colosseum Archaeological Park, Alfonsina Russo, told The Associated Press that the deal is in conjunction with the release of Ridley Scott's new film \u201cGladiators II,\" which opened in Italy on Thursday.",
      "Russo characterized the sponsorship arrangement as one of the many such deals to help finance projects at the park.",
      "The Italian fashion brand Tod's, for example, has funded a multimillion renovation of the Roman monument, including a cleaning, replacing the locking system of arches with new gates and redoing the subterranean areas.",
      "Alberto Campailla, the coordinator of the Nonna Roma nonprofit organization that focuses on housing and food for the poor, called the campaign with Airbnb \u201ca disgrace,\u201d and a form of \u201ctouristification.\u201d",
      "Airbnb and other platforms offering short-term rentals \u201care literally driving people out of not only the city center, but also the outskirts and suburban neighborhoods,\u201d Campailla said.",
      "Tourists from other European cities grappling with overtourism also took issue with the deal.",
      "\u201cIt seems to me that the purpose of the Colosseum today is to be a tourist attraction, but not to create an amusement park within it,\u201d said Jaime Montero, a tourist visiting from Madrid. \u201cIn the end, tourism eats the essence of the cities, here in Rome, as in other capitals.\u201d",

      "The city of Florence is taking new measures to crack down on overtourism",
      "ROME -- The city of Florence took new measures Tuesday to crack down on overtourism, just as the Italian government hosts the Group of Seven tourism ministers in the Renaissance city and seeks to significantly boost the country\u2019s place as a top visitor destination.",
      "Mayor Sara Funaro\u2019s Cabinet approved a 10-point plan that, among other things, would ban key boxes on buildings in Florence\u2019s historic center as well as the use there of loudspeakers by tour guides, a statement from City Hall said.",
      "The keyboxes \u2014 small boxes with a digital pad that are used by owners of short-term rental apartments to easily leave keys for visitors \u2014 have become something of the symbol of local Florentine anger at tourists, whose numbers have rebounded after COVID-19.",
      "In a recent protest, Florentines taped red Xs over the keyboxes, outraged at the transformation of the city center and its magnificent palazzi and narrow streets into a collection of short-term vacation rentals that have displaced local residents and the long-standing businesses that served them.",
      "According to national statistics bureau ISTAT, 2023 saw the most visitors ever in Italy with 134 million arrivals and 451 million people staying in hotels or other registered lodgings. The number of visitors opting for non-hotel lodging grew nearly 17% compared to 2022, ISTAT said in a June report.",
      "Italy ranks fourth on the U.N. World Tourism Barometer of international tourist destinations, after France, Spain and the United States. The tourism industry contributed some 10.5% of Italy\u2019s gross domestic product in 2023, according to Statista research.",
      "Florence, long run by the center-left, last year announced a ban on new short-term private rentals in the center in hopes of stemming the exodus of locals. It has repeatedly pressed for a special regulation from the national government, currently headed by right-wing Premier Giorgia Meloni, to cap the number of days a property can be rented out at 120.",
      "To date, only Venice has been permitted to limit short-term rentals. The lagoon city has been drowning under overtourism for years and this year began imposing a day-tripper tax to try to regulate tourist flows.",
      "The right-left political divide over Florence and its tourism woes could come to a head precisely as Italy hosts the G7 tourism ministers starting Wednesday in Florence.",
      "At a warm-up event this weekend, Tourism Minister Daniela Santanche acknowledged some art cities were suffering from too many visitors. But she said that overall Italy is hardly taking advantage of its tourism potential and needed 50 million visitors more a year.",
      "Lamenting Italy\u2019s fourth-place position on the list of the world's top destinations, she said Italy needed to sustainably grow its tourism potential with quality offerings.",
      "\u201cWe can grow much more, we can develop much more and the industry of tourism can truly become the leading industry of our nation,\u201d she said.",

      "Disgruntled X users are once again flocking to Bluesky, a newer social media platform that grew out of the former Twitter before billionaire Elon Musk took it over in 2022",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Disgruntled X users are again flocking to Bluesky, a newer social media platform that grew out of the former Twitter before billionaire Elon Musk took it over in 2022. While it remains small compared to established online spaces such as X, it has emerged as an alternative for those looking for a different mood, lighter and friendlier and less influenced by Musk.",
      "Championed by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Bluesky was an invitation-only space until it opened to the public in February. That invite-only period gave the site time to build out moderation tools and other features. The platform resembles Musk\u2019s X, with a \u201cdiscover\u201d feed and a chronological feed for accounts that users follow. Users can send direct messages and pin posts, as well as find \u201cstarter packs\u201d that provide a curated list of people and custom feeds to follow.",
      "Bluesky said in mid-November that its total users surged to 15 million, up from roughly 13 million at the end of October, as some X users look for an alternative platform to post their thoughts and talk to others online. The post-election uptick in users isn\u2019t the first time Bluesky has benefited from people leaving X. The platform gained 2.6 million users in the week after X was banned in Brazil in August \u2014 85% of them from Brazil, the company said. About 500,000 new users signed up in one day in October, when X signaled that blocked accounts would be able to see a user\u2019s public posts.",
      "Across the platform, new users \u2014 among them journalists, left-leaning politicians and celebrities \u2014 have posted memes and shared that they were looking forward to using a space free from advertisements and hate speech. Some said it reminded them of the early days of Twitter more than a decade ago.",
      "Despite Bluesky\u2019s growth, X posted after the election that it had \u201cdominated the global conversation on the U.S. election\u201d and had set new records.",
      "Bluesky, though, has bigger ambitions than to supplant X. Beyond the platform itself, it is building a technical foundation \u2014 what it calls \u201ca protocol for public conversation\u201d \u2014 that could make social networks work across different platforms \u2014 also known as interoperability \u2014 like email, blogs or phone numbers.",
      "Currently, you can\u2019t cross between social platforms to leave a comment on someone\u2019s account. Twitter users must stay on Twitter and TikTok users must stay on TikTok if they want to interact with accounts on those services. Big Tech companies have largely built moats around their online properties, which helps serve their advertising-focused business models.",
      "Bluesky is trying to reimagine all of this and working toward interoperability."

      "BOSTON -- When Massachusetts voters decided to ditch the state's standardized tests as a high school graduation requirement on Election Day, they joined a trend that has steadily chipped away at the use of high-stakes tests over the past two decades.",
      "The vote on the ballot question leaves only seven states with mandated graduation exams, a number that could soon shrink further.",
      "A backlash to standardized tests has been fueled by complaints they take up too much classroom time and questions about how well they measure readiness for college or careers. It has gained steam in recent years with concerns about equity and learning setbacks during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "In Massachusetts, a teachers union led the campaign against the graduation requirement, arguing it was keeping too many students from receiving a diploma and weighing too heavily on choices about school curriculum. The other side received backing from prominent business leaders including former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and state officials including Gov. Maura Healey, a Democrat.",
      "\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have different expectations for students depending on which zip code they live in,\u201d Healey said. \u201cWe should have a uniformity to our expectations and they should be high for our students and our families.\u201d",
      "The Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System tests are given in mathematics, science and technology and English. The ballot question didn't end the tests, which are also used for assessing student progress. But passing them will no longer be required for a diploma.",
      "About 1% of high school seniors in Massachusetts, about 700 students, are denied a diploma each year because they failed the MCAS despite meeting other requirements. Most are English language learners or students with disabilities.",
      "In the mid-2000s, a high of 27 states required students to pass an exam to graduate, according to the National Education Association, the nation\u2019s largest teachers union. The states that still have them, for now, are New York, Florida, Louisiana, Ohio, New Jersey, Texas and Virginia.",
      "In New York, state officials this month proposed a timeline to phase out exit exam requirements as part of an overhaul of graduation standards. Students would still take Regents exams in math, English, science and social studies, but beginning in the 2027-28 school year, passing scores would no longer be required for a diploma. The plan would give students alternatives like community service or capstone projects to demonstrate proficiency.",
      "Earlier this year, the Florida Senate passed a bill that would remove testing requirements for high school graduation, but the push stalled in the House. In New Jersey, a bill to end the state\u2019s graduation exam passed the state Assembly last year but then failed to pass the Senate.",
      "In Ohio, students must pass tests in reading, writing, mathematics, science and social studies to graduate. Louisiana also requires students to pass a test and is the only state without an appeals process. In Texas, students must pass end-of-course assessments in algebra, English, biology and U.S. history.",
      "Harry Feder, executive director of FairTest, which opposes using tests as graduation requirements, said it makes sense to shift away from the tests he calls a \u201ccheap and easy way\u201d to conduct education.",
      "\u201cWhat we want out of high school grads isn\u2019t measured very well by a standardized test,\u201d he said, including whether students are critical thinkers, problem solvers or able to collaborate.",
      "Critics say easing the graduation requirement will result in lower standards.",
      "\u201cThe vote against the MCAS is yet another sign of the overwhelming power of the teachers unions in blue states, and will turn Massachusetts diplomas into nothing but participation trophies,\u201d said Michael Petrilli, president of the right-leaning Fordham Institute.",
      "Financial support for the elimination of the Massachusetts test requirement largely came from teachers unions, including the Massachusetts Teachers Association, which contributed millions in direct and in-kind donations, and the NEA, which donated at least $500,000. On the other side, Bloomberg contributed $2.5 million to the campaign in favor of keeping the requirement.",
      "Massachusetts Teachers Association President Max Page and Vice President Deb McCarthy said teachers have been speaking out against the requirement for more than a decade.",
      "\u201cStudents who were passing their courses were being denied diplomas because of this requirement,\" they said. \u201cEducators were forced to narrow the curriculum in order to teach to the high-stakes test.\u201d",

Last summer, for instance, the Justice Department charged a Pakistani man with ties to Iran in a murder-for-hire plot targeting American officials.",
      "Meanwhile, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing unnamed U.S. officials, that Iran told the Biden administration in a written message delivered on Oct. 14 that it would not try to kill Trump.

      "PORTLAND, Maine -- An environmental organization has served a notice of intent to sue one of the world's largest aquaculture companies for violations of the Clean Water Act in Maine \u2014 allegations the fish farmer ardently denies.",
      "Conservation Law Foundation contends Cooke Aquaculture's salmon farming sites off the Maine coast pollute the state's bays, where lobster fishing is a key industry. The farms consist of pens in the ocean where Atlantic salmon are grown for use as food.",
      "The Boston-based law foundation stated in its Thursday notice that it was suing Cooke in a Maine federal court to bring the company into compliance. It states that the company discharges pollutants such as fish feces, dead fish and trash into Maine's coastal waters.",
      "\u201cThese enormous salmon cages are like sewage pipes to the marine environment,\u201d said Heather Govern, vice president for the foundation's clean air and water program. \u201cTheir solid waste smothers plants and ocean life while disease outbreaks and sea lice threaten nearby endangered wild salmon.\"",
      "Cooke swiftly denied the allegations, and company representatives said the firm fully complies with the laws. The company, based in New Brunswick, Canada, issued a statement that said the farms are \u201croutinely inspected by state regulators and subject to regular monitoring reports\u201d to ensure compliance.",
      "\u201cFinfish aquaculture has coexisted with heritage fisheries, such as lobstering, in Maine waters for more than 40 years. Lobster landings are not negatively affected by Atlantic salmon farms,\u201d the company said in a statement.",
      "Cooke is a global giant in aquaculture and describes itself as the world's largest private family-owned seafood company. It states on its website that it operates in 14 countries.",
      "Some environmental groups, including the Sierra Club, have targeted Cooke over the years with concerns about the sustainability of its operations in Maine and elsewhere. Sebastian Belle, executive director of the Maine Aquaculture Association, said Saturday that the Conservation Law Foundation has worked with salmon farmers to develop environmental standards, and the notice of intent to sue was a surprise.",
      "\"Given the fact that CLF and the other groups associated with the proposed suit have not expressed any of their concerns to the farmers and that all of them stand to financially benefit, one has to wonder why farmers would ever work cooperatively with these groups to address their concerns,\" Belle said."

      "The House has passed legislation that would provide full Social Security benefits to millions of people",
      "WASHINGTON -- The House has passed legislation that would provide full Social Security benefits to millions of people, pushing it one step closer to becoming law.",
      "The Social Security bill on Tuesday won bipartisan support in the House, 327-75, in what is now the lame-duck period for Congress. The bill now heads to the Senate, where passage is not assured despite considerable support.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the legislation and what could happen next.",
      "Decades in the making, the bill would repeal two federal policies \u2014 the Windfall Elimination Provision and the Government Pension Offset \u2014 that currently limit Social Security payouts for roughly 2.8 million people, according to reports from the Congressional Research Service.",
      "The policies broadly reduce payments to two groups of Social Security recipients: people who also receive a pension from a job that is not covered by Social Security and surviving spouses of Social Security recipients who receive a government pension of their own.",
      "People who worked in state, local and federal government jobs have been heavily affected by the policies, as have teachers, firefighters and police officers, according to lawmakers and advocates.",
      "Both provisions would be repealed by the bill, thereby increasing Social Security payments for many.",
      "The budgetary effect of the legislation is considerable, adding an estimated $195 billion to federal deficits over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "That means more fiscal strain on the Social Security Trust funds, which were already estimated to be unable to pay out full benefits beginning in 2035. Some conservatives in the House attempted to block the legislation due to its cost.",
      "Supporters of the bill in the House acknowledged the fiscal impact but said it was a matter of fairness.",
      "\u201cFor more than 40 years, the Social Security trust funds have been artificially propped up by stolen benefits that millions of Americans paid for and that their families deserve,\u201d said Reps. Garret Graves, R-La. and Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., the lead sponsors of the bill in the House.",
      "\u201cThe time to put an end to this theft is now,\u201d they said.",
      "The Social Security bill has 63 sponsors in the Senate \u2014 a significant tally because 60 votes are needed to pass most legislation in the chamber.",
      "Sens. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, and Susan Collins, R-Maine, the lead sponsors, have urged colleagues to take up the bill as soon as possible.",
      "But the Senate has a jam-packed schedule in the remaining weeks of the year, with government funding, disaster relief and an annual must-pass defense bill likely to eat up considerable floor time.",
      "If passed by the Senate, the bill would go to President Joe Biden. If the bill is signed into law, the changes would be effective for benefits payable after December 2023.",
      "But if the bill doesn\u2019t pass the Senate by Jan. 3, when a new session of Congress begins, it would expire and supporters would have to start over."

      "Less than a month after four towering dams on the Klamath River were demolished, hundreds of salmon made it into waters they have been cut off from for decades to spawn in cool creeks",
      "A giant female Chinook salmon flips on her side in the shallow water and wriggles wildly, using her tail to carve out a nest in the riverbed as her body glistens in the sunlight. In another moment, males butt into each other as they jockey for a good position to fertilize eggs.",
      "These are scenes local tribes have dreamed of seeing for decades as they fought to bring down four hydroelectric dams blocking passage for struggling salmon along more than 400 miles (644 kilometers) of the Klamath River and its tributaries along the Oregon-California border.",
      "Now, less than a month after those dams came down in the largest dam removal project in U.S. history, salmon are once more returning to spawn in cool creeks that have been cut off to them for generations. Video shot by the Yurok Tribe show that hundreds of salmon have made it to tributaries between the former Iron Gate and Copco dams, a hopeful sign for the newly freed waterway.",
      "\u201cSeeing salmon spawning above the former dams fills my heart,\u201d said Joseph L. James, chairman of the Yurok Tribe. \u201cOur salmon are coming home. Klamath Basin tribes fought for decades to make this day a reality because our future generations deserve to inherit a healthier river from the headwaters to the sea.\u201d",
      "The Klamath River flows from its headwaters in southern Oregon and across the mountainous forests of northern California before it reaches the Pacific Ocean.",
      "The completion of the hydroelectric dam removal project on Oct. 2 marked a major victory for local tribes. Through protests, testimony and lawsuits, the tribes showcased the environmental devastation caused by the dams, especially to salmon, which were cut off from their historic habitat and dying in alarming numbers because of poor water-quality.",
      "There have been lower concentrations of harmful algae blooms since the dam removal, Toz Soto, fisheries program manager with the Karuk Tribe, said during a press conference after the dams came down. In October, the water temperature during the day was an average of 8 degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit) cooler compared to the same month over the last nine years, according to the Klamath River Renewal Corporation, the nonprofit entity created to oversee the project.",
      "\u201cAll in all, the fish that came up this year were really healthy,\u201d Soto said. \u201cI didn\u2019t see fish with bacterial infections and things like that, so water temperature\u2019s already having an impact on the fishes\u2019 health.\u201d",
      "The number of salmon that have quickly made it into previously inaccessible tributaries has also been encouraging. Experts have counted 42 redds, or salmon egg nests, and have tallied as many as 115 Chinook salmon in one day in Spencer Creek, which is above the former J.C. Boyle dam, the furthest upstream of the four removed dams, said Mark Hereford with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re showing us where the good habitat is; they\u2019re showing us where there\u2019s a lack of habitat,\u201d said Barry McCovey Jr, director of the Yurok Tribal Fisheries department. \u201cSo we can use these fish to inform us as river managers, as scientists, where restoration needs to take place.\u201d",
      "Power company PacifiCorp built the dams to generate electricity between 1918 and 1962. But the structures halted the natural flow of the waterway that was once known as the third-largest salmon-producing river on the West Coast. They disrupted the lifecycle of the region\u2019s salmon, which spend most of their life in the Pacific Ocean but return to the chilly mountain streams to lay eggs.",
      "At the same time, the dams only produced a fraction of PacifiCorp\u2019s energy at full capacity, enough to power about 70,000 homes. They also didn\u2019t provide irrigation, drinking water or flood control, according to Klamath River Renewal Corporation.",
      "McCovey said the return of so many salmon happened faster than he had expected and makes him hopeful for the future of the river.",
      "\u201cOut of all the milestones that we\u2019ve had, this one to me is the most significant,\" he said. \u201cIt feels like catharsis. It feels like the right path.\u201d",

The gangs, now estimated by the U,N, to control 85% of the capital, shut down the country\u2019s main airport there on Monday after shooting a number of planes, wounding one flight attendant.",

It asks U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres \u201cto undertake expeditiously contingency preparations and planning\u201d tor a transformation, which would take many months to accomplish.",

      "The force was supposed to have 2,500 international police but the head of the U.N.\u2019s political mission in Haiti, Maria Isabel Salvador, told the council late last month that just around 430 are deployed -- some 400 from Kenya and the rest from the Bahamas, Belize and Jamaica.",
      "Last month, Kenya\u2019s President William Ruto said another 600-strong contingent would be sent to Haiti in November.",

      "The power of gangs in Haiti has grown since the 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Mo\u00efse. The surge in killings, rapes and kidnappings has led to a violent uprising by civilian vigilante groups.",
      "Haiti\u2019s leaders have asked for a U.N. peacekeeping force, and the U.S. draft resolution notes that the permanent council of the Organization of American States adopted a resolution on Nov. 13 entitled \u201cIn Support of Haiti\u2019s Request for a United States Peacekeeping Operation.\u201d",

      "The fire was burning primarily in Sterling Forest State Park, where the visitor center, the lakefront area at Greenwood Lake and historic furnace area remained open but woodland activities including hunting were halted, Wernick said.",
      "The blaze claimed the life of an 18-year-old New York parks employee who died when a tree fell on him as he helped fight the fire in Sterling Forest on Nov. 9. The fire's cause remains under investigation.",
      "In Massachusetts, which typically has about 15 wildland fires every October, there were about 200 this year. State officials said they were expected to continue because of weather conditions and dry surface fuels.",
      "The National Weather Service in Boston warned Sunday that elevated fire risk continued across southern New England, given the continued gusty winds and dry conditions. Much-needed rain was predicted for Thursday in the region.",
      "Southern New Hampshire was also at risk for fires due to dry conditions and the fire danger risk was \u201cvery high,\u201d state officials said.",
      "The Maine Forest Service said the southern part of the state also faced high fire danger conditions. Most of the state was abnormally dry or facing moderate drought conditions.",
      "Some relief could be in sight in New York. The National Weather Service in Albany, New York, said Sunday that most of the region could see a \u201cwidespread soaking rain\u201d of 0.5 to 1.5 inches beginning Wednesday night."

      "Election certification meetings in Nevada\u2019s two most populous counties have been roiled by voting conspiracies",
      "LAS VEGAS -- Election certification meetings on Friday in Nevada's two most populous counties were roiled by voting conspiracies while local officials in the state's rural counties quietly approved election results that favored President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "Friday was the deadline for counties in the battleground state to finalize election results. All 17 counties met the deadline to forward election results for final approval later this month by Democratic Secretary of State of Cisco Aguilar and the Nevada Supreme Court. Losing candidates have until Nov. 20 to request a recount.",
      "Nevada began certifying results Wednesday.",
      "Trump won Nevada, carrying its 15 rural counties. Officials in those counties unanimously certified Trump's victory over Vice President Kamala Harris in meetings this week where many of the clerks received praise from county officials for running a smooth election.",
      "But in the two counties where Harris prevailed \u2014 Clark, which includes Las Vegas, and Washoe, which includes Reno \u2014 meetings resembled the tumultuous certification period four years ago after Trump\u2019s loss to President Joe Biden.",
      "Washoe, Nevada's swing county, voted 3-1 on Friday to certify its election results after more than two hours of heated public comment that included unsubstantiated claims of unsecure piles of ballots and scanners subject to internet hacking. One woman warned commissioners that \u201cPresident Trump will be coming for you\u201d if they certified the vote.",
      "Commissioner Jeanne Herman cast the lone dissenting vote on Friday but didn\u2019t provide an explanation. Herman has consistently voted against certifying election results since 2020 and tried unsuccessfully after Trump's loss that year to overhaul the county's election processes with a return to paper ballots and hand-counting votes.",
      "Andrew McDonald, Washoe's deputy registrar of voters, told commissioners that there were no clerical errors that would allow for a decision against certifying the vote.",
      "\u201cNo voters were disenfranchised,\" McDonald said. \"We ran a fair, accurate, secure and transparent election.\u201d",
      "At the same time Friday in southern Nevada, Clark County's commissioners were also listening to a wide range of voting conspiracies. In the end, the board voted unanimously to certify election results.",
      "The audience in Las Vegas was mostly packed with people urging the board not to certify the election. Some approached the mic with stacks of paper in their hands that they said contained proof the election was rigged, saying it wasn\u2019t believable that Trump and Sam Brown, the Republican candidate for Senate, lost in the county despite Trump\u2019s victory statewide.",
      "Lorena Portillo, the top election official in Clark County, told commissioners they discovered about 1,600 ballots while preparing for Friday's meeting that had been processed but not counted. The ballots have since been counted and added to the county's election results, but the additional ballots did not affect the outcome of any race, Portillo said.",
      "The secretary of state's office was notified immediately, and Portillo said an audit will be completed alongside state election officials."

HELENS, Ore. -- A school district in northwest Oregon has put its superintendent and high school principal on leave, accepted the school board chair's resignation and temporarily canceled classes in response to an uproar over the arrests of a teacher and former teacher on sexual abuse charges.",
      "The St. Helens Police Department said in a statement that officers this week arrested one current and one retired St. Helens High School teacher on allegations of sexually abusing students. Police said the arrests came after a two-month investigation.",

      "Choir teacher Eric Stearns, 46, is facing seven counts of second-degree sex abuse and one count of third-degree sex abuse involving six students, according to police. Stearns pleaded not guilty to the charges in Columbia County Circuit Court on Wednesday, KATU-TV reported.",

      "The work stoppage launched Friday at Virgin Hotels Las Vegas is the first open-ended strike in 22 years for the Culinary Workers Union, the largest labor union in Nevada, with about 60,000 members. Union members were on the picket line again on Saturday.",
      "Workers at the casino also walked off the job for 48 hours earlier this year as negotiations escalated, hoping to pressure Virgin Hotels to agree to a new five-year deal with increased wages and better benefits.",
      "The strike comes a year after casinos up and down the Strip narrowly avoided tens of thousands of hospitality workers walking off the job on the weekend the city was set to host its first Formula One race on the famous boulevard. But agreements were reached just before the union\u2019s deadline for a strike, giving workers a roughly 32% salary increase over the life of the contract, including a 10% bump in pay in the first year.",
      "After the breakthrough deals last November, the Culinary Union quickly reached similar agreements for the rest of its members at major hotel-casinos on the Strip, downtown and at off-Strip properties \u2014 with the exception of Virgin Hotels. The contracts on the Strip alone cover more than 40,000 workers.",
      "While the union pays striking workers $500 per week for picketing shifts for at least five days, union members at the picket line on Friday said that they were expecting financial pain while being out of work.",

      "\u201cA strike is hurtful to everybody, but it was a last resort for us,\u201d McNamara said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have anything else we could do. The company wasn\u2019t coming our way, and they weren\u2019t seeing it our way and they haven\u2019t really budged much.\"",

      "\u201cWorkers overwhelmingly have chosen a strong Culinary Union contract that guarantees their benefits as the way they want to be protected,\u201d said Bethany Khan, a spokesperson for the union. \u201cHundreds of workers are on strike themselves to win these protections.\u201d",
      "Virgin Hotels Las Vegas said it was committed to protecting the jobs of workers by ensuring the continued operation of the property. It also said the union \u201chas bargained in bad faith \u2013 repeatedly refusing to engage in meaningful negotiations with Virgin Hotels Las Vegas.\u201d Culinary Union members last went on strike in 2002 for 10 days at the Golden Gate hotel-casino in downtown Las Vegas."

      "Reg Murphy, a renowned journalist whose newsgathering career included stints as an editor and top executive at newspapers in Atlanta, San Francisco and Baltimore \u2014 and who found himself the subject of national headlines when he survived a politically motivated kidnapping \u2014 has died at age 90.",
      "Murphy, who lived on St. Simons Island, Georgia, died on Nov. 9.",
      "John Reginald \u201cReg\u201d Murphy was a Georgia native who early in his career covered state politics for the Macon Telegraph. He then worked as a reporter and editor at The Atlanta Constitution amid the civil rights movement. Murphy became editor and publisher of the San Francisco Examiner in 1975, then went on to serve as publisher at the Baltimore Sun.",
      "As an editor, Murphy was inspiring, said Art Harris, a reporter at The Constitution who later followed Murphy to San Francisco, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. \u201cThat was his magic. He inspired people by building them up. He was a gentleman and a gentle persuader. I never heard him raise his voice. Not everyone liked his decisions, but he didn\u2019t let that dissuade him from making them.\u201d",
      "Murphy later served in senior leadership roles at the National Geographic Society, where he helped introduce new media technologies expanding the global reach and impact of its print and video platforms.",
      "His reporting career took him across the globe, including to Russia, China, Japan and the Middle East, Mercer University noted in a 2023 article about Murphy, who attended classes there in the 1950s. In the U.S., Murphy stressed journalism's importance for the health of the country and communities.",
      "\u201cJournalism is, in my mind, sacred,\u201d he said in an interview last year for Mercer University. \u201cIt is a sacred trust to tell the truth and to try to give people enough freedom to be able to find the truth and then to pursue it.\u201d",
      "During his time as editorial page editor at The Atlanta Constitution, Murphy became the focus of a gripping story in 1974, when he was kidnapped and held for a $700,000 ransom. The kidnapper claimed to be part of a militia group wanting to stop \u201cthe lying of leftist newspapers.\u201d",
      "Two days later, Murphy was released in a motel parking lot after the ransom was paid. Within hours of his release, his abductor was arrested at his home and the money was recovered. The man was later convicted and sentenced to 40 years in prison but ultimately served nine.",
      "Murphy continued his long and successful career in journalism. Years later, Murphy gave a firsthand account of that harrowing experience in Golf Digest. It began when a man claiming he needed help donating 300,000 gallons of heating oil persuaded Murphy to ride with him to his lawyer\u2019s office to sign papers. Murphy recounted what happened once he became suspicious.",
      "\u201cHe was steering with his right hand, and with his left he leaned a handgun across his forearm, looked over, and said, \u2018Mr. Murphy, you\u2019ve been kidnapped,\u2019 Murphy wrote. \u201dHe tossed a roll of white adhesive tape onto my lap and told me to cover my eyes. With the gun pointing at me, I did as I was told and applied three strips from temple to temple.\"",
      "A few minutes later, the car stopped and the kidnapper used rope to tie his wrists behind his back and then his ankles, Murphy wrote. Still blindfolded, Murphy was told to get in the truck.",
      "\u201cWhen I was in the trunk, he tied my wrists to my ankles behind me so that my body formed a reverse-C,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis was very uncomfortable for my back. The trunk was shallow -- if I moved my head up even a few inches it hit the roof. I was breathing fast, but I was also trying to control my breath, trying not to panic.\u201d",
      "They drove for hours until he was led into a building, Murphy recounted. Before being shoved between a bed and the wall, he was allowed to speak on the phone to another editor at The Constitution, informing him he'd been kidnapped. It became national news, coming soon after Patty Hearst, the granddaughter of publishing magnate William Randolph Hearst, was kidnapped by a far-left militant group.",
      "Murphy said he lost 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms) during the ordeal and suffered claustrophobia from the hours spent in the trunk. During his captivity, he replayed in his mind rounds of golf he had shot.",
      "Two months later, Murphy said he was on a golf course at a charity event. On almost every hole spectators from the gallery asked for his autograph or to pose for a photo, he recalled. His passion for golf provided a therapeutic release from the kidnapping, his obituary said.",
      "Murphy became an active volunteer with the sport\u2019s governing body, the United States Golf Association, and served as its president in 1994 and 1995.",
      "\u201cLike so many USGA presidents before him, and since, Reg gave his time and expertise to help leave the game of golf even better,\u201d said USGA CEO Mike Whan. \u201cThe USGA, and the people who play and love the game of golf, are better off because of Reg\u2019s commitment, passion and leadership.\u201d",
      "Murphy was the son of Mae and John Lee Murphy, a schoolteacher and a store owner. He remained a strong supporter of Mercer, describing the school as \u201ca place where I learned something about the who, what, where, why and how of journalism.\u201d He served five terms on the Mercer Board of Trustees, his obituary said. Mercer honored his achievements by renaming its Center for Collaborative Journalism as the Reg Murphy Center for Collaborative Journalism."

    "story": [
      "Donald Trump's pick for director of national intelligence is facing scrutiny over her past remarks that supported Kremlin propaganda about Russia's invasion of Ukraine",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard, President-elect Donald Trump's choice to lead the U.S. intelligence services, in 2022 endorsed one of Russia's main justifications for invading Ukraine: the existence of dozens of U.S.-funded biolabs working on some of the world's nastiest pathogens.",
      "Moscow claimed Ukraine was using the labs to create deadly bioweapons similar to COVID-19 that could be used against Russia, and that Russian President Vladimir Putin had no choice but to invade neighboring Ukraine to protect his country.",
      "In fact, the labs are public and part of an international effort to control outbreaks and stop bioweapons.",
      "Gabbard, a military veteran and a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii, later said she wasn't accusing the United States or Ukraine of anything nefarious and was just voicing concerns about protecting the labs.",
      "But to critics in the U.S., including lawmakers in both parties, the comments showed a disturbing willingness to parrot Russian propaganda \u2014 a tendency that has earned Gabbard praise on Russian state TV.",
      "Gabbard's past comments supportive of Russia \u2014 as well as secret meetings with Syria's president, a close ally of Russia and Iran \u2014 are attracting fresh scrutiny from Democrats and national security analysts who fear that as Trump's director of national intelligence she could give Russia a major win, undercut Ukraine, weaken U.S. national security and endanger intelligence ties with allies.",
      "\u201cGabbard, like Gaetz, is like a hand grenade ready to explode,\u201d former Trump national security adviser John Bolton said, speaking of Matt Gaetz, the former Florida congressman who is Trump's pick for attorney general. \u201cRepublicans who throw themselves on those grenades for Donald Trump are risking their own personal reputations and places in history.\u201d",
      "Gabbard says American assistance for Ukraine jeopardizes global security by antagonizing Russia. She has criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as corrupt and has expressed sympathy for Russia\u2019s position, given Ukraine\u2019s desire to join NATO, the Western military alliance.",
      "\u201cThis war and suffering could have easily been avoided if Biden Admin/NATO had simply acknowledged Russia\u2019s legitimate security concerns,\u201d she posted on Twitter at the start of Russia\u2019s invasion in 2022.",
      "Democrats say Gabbard\u2019s comments signify a pro-Russian bent that poses a problem for U.S. national security if she is confirmed by the Senate.",
      "\u201cDo you really want her to have all of the secrets of the United States and our defense intelligence agencies when she has so clearly been in Putin\u2019s pocket?\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said on MSNBC. \u201cThat just has to be a hard no.\u201d",
      "The Office of the Director of National Intelligence was created after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to coordinate the nation's intelligence agencies and act as the president's main intelligence adviser.",
      "Gabbard and the Trump transition team did not respond to questions seeking comment. She has in the past defended her actions and said her military service \u2014 she has served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades and deployed to Iraq and Kuwait \u2014 has made her skeptical about military interventions.",
      "Gabbard also has defended Trump's relationship with autocrats such as Putin, saying it shows Trump has \u201cthe courage to meet with adversaries, dictators, allies and partners alike in the pursuit of peace, seeing war as a last resort.\u201d",
      "Gabbard's own meetings with Syrian President Bashar Assad in 2017 angered many of her then-fellow Democrats. They said her visit helped legitimize a leader accused of war crimes and who has served as a proxy and host for Russia and Iran in the Middle East.",
      "Assad welcomed Russia\u2019s military into Syria in 2015 to crush a popular uprising against him. Russian forces and Iranian-allied militias have remained, using Syria as a base for attacks on American troops and their allies. The U.S. has severed diplomatic relations with Syria and placed Assad under heavy sanctions over the brutality with which he, Russian warplanes and Iranian-allied forces crushed the uprising, leading to 500,000 deaths.",
      "Gabbard ran for president in 2020 before dropping out and endorsing Democrat Joe Biden, who defeated Trump. Two years later, she left the Democratic Party to become an independent, criticizing her former colleagues as an \u201celitist cabal of warmongers\u201d and \u201cwoke\u201d ideologues.",
      "She subsequently campaigned for several high-profile Republicans, became a contributor to Fox News and started a podcast.",
      "Gabbard's remarks about Russia haven't gone unnoticed in Moscow, where state-run media have praised her and even jokingly referred to her as a Russian agent.",
      "An article published Friday in RIA Novosti, a major Russian state-controlled news agency, called Gabbard \u201csuperwoman\" and noted her past appearances on Russian TV, claiming that Ukrainian intelligence views her as \u201cprobably an agent of the Russian special services.\u201d",
      "Gabbard's stance on Russia and Syria is likely to come up during her Senate confirmation.",

Located between Tampa and Orlando, Florida\u2019s citrus capital produces more boxes of citrus than any other county in the state and has devoted tens of thousands of acres to growing millions of trees.",
      "But last year, more people moved to the county than to any other in the United States, almost 30,000.",
      "Bulldozed citrus groves in recent years made way for housing and big box stores that could one day merge the two metropolitan areas into what has half-jokingly been dubbed, \u201cOrlampa.\u201d",

Those communities are primarily in the South, like Anna on the outskirts of the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area; Fort Mill, South Carolina, outside Charlotte, North Carolina; Lebanon outside Nashville; and Polk County\u2019s Haines City.",
      "For some residents, like Marisol Ortega, commuting to work can take up to an hour and a half one-way. But Ortega, who lives in Haines City about 40 miles (64 kilometers) from her job in Orlando, says it\u2019s worth it.",
      "\u201cI love my job. I love what I do, but then I love coming back home, and it\u2019s more tranquil,\u201d Ortega said.",
      "The rapid growth of far-flung exurbs is an after-effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the Census Bureau, as rising housing costs drove people further from cities and remote working allowed many to do their jobs from home at least part of the week.",
      "Polk County\u2019s Hispanic population has grown from one-fifth to more than one-quarter of the overall population over the past five years, driven by Puerto Rican migration from the island after 2017\u2019s Hurricane Maria and then from New York during the pandemic.",
      "The county has grown more diverse with the share of non-Hispanic white residents dropping from 61% to 54%, and it has also gotten more educated and wealthier, according to the Census Bureau. Despite the influx of new people, the county\u2019s Republican leanings have remained relatively unchanged.",
      "Yeseria Suero and her family moved from New York to Polk County at the start of the decade after falling in love with the pace of life and affordability during a visit. Still, there were some cultural adjustments: restaurants closing early, barbecue and boiled peanuts everywhere, strangers chatting with her at the grocery store. Suero is now involved with the tight-knit Hispanic community and her two boys are active in sports leagues.",
      "\u201cMy kids now say, \u2018Yes, ma\u2019am,\u2019\u201d she said.",

      "Over the past decade, citrus-growing there declined from 81,800 acres (33,103 hectares) and almost 10 million trees in 2014 to 58,500 acres (23,674 hectares) and 8.5 million trees in 2024, according to federal agricultural statistics.",
      "\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been a precipitous conversion of citrus land for growth,\u201d said Matt Joyner, CEO of Florida Citrus Mutual, a grower\u2019s group. \u201cBut certainly you see it in northern, northeastern Polk.\u201d",
      "Anna, Texas, more than 45 miles (72 kilometers) north of downtown Dallas, is seeing the same kind of migration.",
      "It was the fourth-fastest growing city in the U.S. last year and its population has increased by a third during the 2020s to 27,500 residents. Like Polk County, Anna has gotten a little older, richer and more racially diverse. Close to 3 in 5 households have moved into their homes since 2020, according to the Census Bureau.",
      "Schuyler Crouch, 29, and his wife wanted to buy a house in a closer-in exurb like Frisco, where he grew up, so they could settle down and start a family. But prices there have skyrocketed because of population growth.",
      "In Anna, they fell in love last year with a house that was more reasonably priced. They both work in Frisco, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) away, and it has become their go-to for eating out or entertainment instead of downtown Dallas, even though not long ago Frisco itself was considered a far-flung outpost of the metro area.",
      "Still, Crouch said he has noticed the exurbs keep getting pushed further north as breakneck growth makes affordable housing out of reach in neighborhoods once considered on the fringes of the metro area.",
      "\u201cThe next exurb we are going to be living in is Oklahoma,\u201d he joked.",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 22:32:19 GMT",
    "summary": "Lenders have been raising the cost of fixed-rate deals creating a headache for buyers and those remortgaging.",
    "story": [
      "Mortgage costs are rising - with the average rate on a two-year fixed deal now at 5.5% - despite a recent cut in interest rates.",
      "A string of lenders, including Barclays, HSBC, NatWest and Nationwide, have increased the rates charged on new fixed deals in recent days.",
      "That has created a headache for borrowers hoping costs were on a consistent downward trend, especially in light of the Bank of England cutting the benchmark interest rate earlier this month.",
      "Recent events, such as the Budget, mean that borrowing costs in general have increased, which may have a knock-on effect for those searching for a home loan.",
      "How mortgage rates affect borrowers",
      "Some tracker and variable rate mortgages move fairly closely in line with the Bank's base rate. However, more than eight in 10 mortgage customers have fixed-rate deals.",
      "The interest rate on this kind of mortgage does not change until the deal expires, usually after two or five years, and a new one is chosen to replace it.",
      "About 800,000 fixed-rate mortgages, currently with an interest rate of 3% or below, are expected to expire every year, on average, until the end of 2027.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of potential first-time buyers also hope to get a place of their own with their first mortgage. All would welcome low mortgage rates.",
      "There have been two significant spikes in the last couple of years, with the average rate peaking at 6.85% in August 2023, according to the financial information service Moneyfacts.",
      "Rates are lower now, but the cost of deals has been moving up either side of the Budget.",
      "The average rate on a two-year deal now stands at 5.5%, and the average on a five-year deal is 5.22%.",
      "Nearly all of the cheapest deals on the market, often for those able to offer a large deposit, have risen back above a rate of 4%.",
      "Why are interest rates down but mortgage rates up?",
      "On 7 November, the Bank of England cut the base rate - which influences the wider cost of borrowing for businesses, individuals and the government - from 5% to 4.75%.",
      "This had been widely expected, so the markets had already factored the cut into their calculations. In other words, it was so widely anticipated that borrowing costs had already been adjusted accordingly.",
      "However, the Bank of England also said that future interest rate cuts may not come as often and as quickly as previously thought.",
      "In the words of one mortgage broker, that was because the Budget delivered by Chancellor Rachel Reeves \"threw a spanner in the works\". Spending pledges risked inflating some prices, something high interest rates are designed to control.",
      "Bank governor Andrew Bailey said rates were likely to \"continue to fall gradually from here\u201d, but cautioned they could not be cut \"too quickly or by too much\u201d.",
      "Lenders price their mortgages not only on where interest rates are at any one time but where they, and the financial markets, expect them to be in the future.",
      "Brokers say the outlook had changed for lenders given the Bank's latest view on interest rates, prompting the most recent mortgage rate moves.",
      "\u201cThe slew of rate changes in recent weeks has continued to push [mortgage] rates higher, reflecting the higher costs for lenders, as the market outlook for rates has edged toward a \u2018higher for longer\u2019 expectation,\" said David Hollingworth, from mortgage broker L&C.",
      "\"Unwelcome as it is for borrowers, it\u2019s important to note that there\u2019s no sign of rates skyrocketing as they have in recent years. The Bank of England base rate is still expected to fall over time, but markets are questioning if the pace will be as rapid.\"",
      "A Treasury spokesman said that the Budget was \"putting the public finances on a sustainable path\" and that was \"essential to ensuring steady mortgage rates for all homeowners\".",
      "What goes up might come down",
      "The general trend of interest rates is expected to be down, but timing can be tough for borrowers.",
      "That is made harder because mortgage deals currently have a relatively short shelf-life, owing to the uncertainty.",
      "\"Any stand out best-buy deals are not lasting very long,\" said Aaron Strutt, from broker Trinity Financial.",
      "\"If your mortgage is due for renewal and you are sticking with your existing lender, you need to keep an eye on the rates because the lenders don\u2019t tend to tell borrowers when they are going up.\"",

      "The number of households on social tariffs has risen by a fifth since last year to a record 1.6 million. Spending on them rose by a quarter, according to CCW data.",
      "It said the increase was down to companies doing more to promote their support schemes, data sharing between the government and councils helping to identify customers in need, and the cost of living leading to more households seeking help.",
      "But there are concerns that support is not the same across the country and that people could be missing out on help simply because of where they live.",

      "Data from the CCW suggests that among the 10 biggest water and sewerage firms, the average bill reduction in 2023-24 ranged from \u00a3287 for people supplied by Welsh Water (D\u0175r Cymru) down to \u00a3110 for customers of Southern Water.",

      "'Postcode lottery'",
      "Andy White, senior leader for the CCW, said it was good that more people than ever were getting help through social tariffs.",

      "Welsh Water, which is not for profit, offers support if someone in the household receives at least one means-tested benefit and has different income thresholds depending on how many people live there.",
      "Social tariffs are not the only form of support on offer. The CCW data also showed an additional \u00a366m went to more than 200,000 accounts on a separate scheme called Watersure, which caps bills for people on meters who claim certain benefits and have a high water use.",

      "The key questions were: what did she know about problems with Horizon, and when did she find out about them?",
      "In the end, we got plenty of tears, as she appeared to repeatedly wilt under probing questioning, but few concrete answers. There was a great deal she claimed she couldn\u2019t remember, and even more she said she had never been told.",

      "Lord Ericht appeared to sum up their position succinctly on Friday, when he suggested it amounted to them asking him to say: \"I accept this decision is unlawful but I give it lawful effect.\"",
      "The campaign groups Greenpeace and Uplift strongly object to any such idea.",
      "They disagree that the decision in Finch could not have been predicted  with one lawyer suggesting the oil companies had simply lost a bet.",
      "Both groups now want the judge to pause work on Rosebank and Jackdaw while the fields' downstream emissions are assessed.",
      "Then, they argue, the Energy Secretary, Ed Miliband, and the government's North Sea Transition Authority (formerly known as the Oil and Gas Authority), could make a fresh decision about the fields\u2019 licences, armed with a fuller understanding of their contribution to climate change.",
      "Even then, there may be a snag. Lawyers for the government, who were also in court, say that in certain circumstances they have doubts that Mr Miliband would have the necessary legal power to revisit the decisions at all.",
      "If Mr Miliband does have the power, and if it does come to the crunch, it is not clear what he would do. In court, the UK government's lawyer was reluctant to be drawn on the matter.",
      "At times he sounded as if ministers very much wished the whole affair would simply go away.",
      "After all, in campaigning against the Tories in the general election this summer, Labour had carefully crafted a policy which appeared designed to minimise controversy, and to avoid becoming dragged into the debate about Rosebank.",
      "It went like this - Labour was committed to tackling climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions but also recognised the importance of the oil and gas industry.",
      "As such it would not grant any new exploration licences in UK waters but it would allow existing projects - including Rosebank and Jackdaw - to continue.",
      "Ministers spoke of domestic energy production as critical for keeping bills down; helping to ensure the nation's energy security; generating taxes; and for assisting with the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy.",
      "Many of those claims are contested by environmentalists.",
      "Tessa Khan, executive director of Uplift, said 80% of the UK's oil was exported.",
      "\"There's no world in which you could have a robust environmental assessment that takes into account those downstream emissions and decide that those environmental impacts are acceptable,\" she told me.",
      "In Aberdeen though, the heart of the UK's energy industry, there is a great deal of nervousness about the potential impact of the decision in this case, and about the wider impact of government policy on the sector.",
      "Just last week, one US oil firm said it would end all North Sea operations by the end of 2029 because of high levels of taxation.",
      "Now, the eyes of climate campaigners, politicians, and oil companies alike are on Lord Ericht.",
      "Perhaps he will find a compromise, for example by allowing the oil firms to proceed with preparatory works - as long as they don\u2019t extract any oil and gas - while at the same time requiring them to provide the government with information on downstream emissions to enable them to revisit the decision.",
      "The companies\u2019 lawyers bridled at the suggestion that they were in the business of gambling but, in such a case, maybe they would have little choice but to bet that the politics of pulling the plug would be too painful for Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s government.",
      "Late on Friday afternoon, the judge retired to consider his decision, a process which could take several weeks or even months.",
      "Thanking the many lawyers for their \"excellent contributions,\" he concluded the hearing by saying: \"It's a very difficult matter and it's a very important matter,\" adding, \"I shall issue my judgment in due course.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 16:37:35 GMT",
    "summary": "Bluesky is picking up one million new users every day at its current rate.",
    "story": [
      "You may have seen the word \"Bluesky\" popping up on your social media pages recently and wondered what people are talking about.",
      "It is an alternative platform to Elon Musk's X and in terms of its colour and logo, it looks quite similar.",
      "Bluesky is growing rapidly and is currently picking up around one million new sign-ups a day.",
      "It had 16.7m users at the time of writing, but that figure will likely be outdated by the time you read this.",
      "So what is it - and why are so many people joining?",
      "What is Bluesky?",
      "Bluesky describes itself as \"social media as it should be\", although it looks similar to other sites.",
      "Visually, a bar to the left of the page shows everything you might expect - search, notifications, a homepage and so on.",
      "People using the platform can post, comment, repost and like their favourite things.",
      "To put it simply, it looks how X, formerly known as Twitter, used to look.",
      "The main difference is Bluesky is decentralised - a complicated term which basically means users can host their data on servers other than those owned by the company.",
      "This means that rather than being limited to having a specific account named after Bluesky, people can (if they like) sign up using an account they themselves own.",
      "But it is worth stating that the vast majority of people don't do that and a new joiner will most likely have a \".bsky.social\" at the end of their username.",
      "Who owns Bluesky?",
      "If you think it feels a lot like X, you won't be surprised to learn why. The former head of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, created it.",
      "He even once said he wanted Bluesky to be a decentralised version of Twitter that no single person or entity owns.",
      "But Mr Dorsey is no longer part of the team behind it, having stepped down from the board in May 2024.",
      "He deleted his account altogether in September.",
      "It is now run and predominantly owned by chief executive Jay Graber as a US public benefit corporation.",
      "Why is it gaining in popularity?",
      "Bluesky has been around since 2019, but it was invitation-only until February of this year.",
      "That let the developers deal with all the kinks behind-the-scenes, to try and stabilise it before opening the doors to the wider public.",
      "The plan has worked, somewhat. But the flurry of new users has been so significant in November that there continue to be issues with outages.",
      "It is no coincidence that the number of new Bluesky users spiked following Donald Trump's success in the US elections in November.",
      "X's owner, Mr Musk, was a big backer of Trump during his campaign, and will be heavily involved in his administration.",
      "Inevitably, this has led to a political division, with some people leaving X in protest.",
      "But others have cited different reasons, such as the Guardian newspaper which has chosen to stop posting there as it called X \"a toxic media platform\".",
      "Meanwhile, Bluesky's app continues to pick up significant downloads worldwide and on Thursday was the top free app in the Apple App Store in the UK.",
      "Several celebrities, from pop singer Lizzo to Taskmaster's Greg Davies, have announced they are joining the platform and limiting their use of - or in some cases leaving altogether - X.",
      "Other names you might recognise include Ben Stiller, Jamie Lee Curtis and Patton Oswalt.",
      "But this growth, while significant, will have to continue for a long time before Bluesky is able to mount a true challenge to its microblogging rival.",
      "X does not share its total user numbers but it is understood to be measured in the hundreds of millions, with Elon Musk previously saying the platform had 250 million users each day.",
      "How does Bluesky make money?",
      "It is the million dollar question, quite literally.",
      "Bluesky started off with funding from investors and venture capital firms and has raised tens of millions of dollars through these means.",
      "But with so many new users, it is going to have to find a way to pay the bills.",
      "Back in Twitter's heyday, the site made the vast majority of its money through advertising.",
      "Bluesky has said it wants to avoid this. Instead, it said it will continue to look into paid services, such as having people pay for custom domains in their username.",
      "That sounds complicated but it basically comes down to a person's username being even more personalised.",
      "For example, it may mean my username - @twgerken.bsky.social - could in the future be more official-sounding, such as @twgerken.bbc.co.uk.",
      "Proponents of this idea say it doubles-up as a form of verification as the organisation which owns the website would have to clear its use.",
      "If Bluesky's owners continue to avoid advertising, they may inevitably have to look to other broader options, such as subscription features, as a way of keeping the lights on.",
      "But if it is not making very much money, that would not be unusual for tech startups.",
      "In fact, Twitter, before it was purchased by Mr Musk in 2022, only made a profit twice in its eight years of being publicly traded.",
      "And we all know how that ended - a massive payday for investors when the world's richest man paid $44bn (\u00a334.7bn) for the privilege of owning it.",
      "For now, the future of Bluesky remains unknown, but if its growth continues, anything is possible.",

      "Trump won the US presidential election on a platform that promised tariffs as high as 60% on Chinese-made goods. Further south, though, a new China-backed megaport has the potential to create whole new trade routes that will bypass North America entirely.",
      "President Xi Jinping himself attended the inauguration of the Chancay port on the Peruvian coast this week, an indication of just how seriously China takes the development.",
      "Xi was in Peru for the annual meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation Forum (Apec). But all eyes were on Chancay and what it says about China's growing assertiveness in a region that the US has traditionally seen as its sphere of influence.",
      "As seasoned observers see it, Washington is now paying the price for years of indifference towards its neighbours and their needs.",
      "\"The US has been absent from Latin America for so long, and China has moved in so rapidly, that things have really reconfigured in the past decade,\" says Monica de Bolle, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.",
      "\"You have got the backyard of America engaging directly with China,\" she tells the BBC. \"That's going to be problematic.\"",
      "Even before it opened, the $3.5bn (\u00a32.75bn) project, masterminded by China's state-owned Cosco Shipping, had already turned a once-sleepy Peruvian fishing town into a logistical powerhouse set to transform the country's economy.",
      "China's official Communist Party newspaper, the People's Daily, called it \"a vindication of China-Peru win-win co-operation\".",

      "Of course, Latin America is not the only part of the world targeted by the BRI. Since 2023, China's unprecedented infrastructure splurge has pumped money into nearly 150 countries worldwide.",

      "Ms de Bolle says the US is right to feel threatened by this turn of events, since Beijing has now established \"a very strong foothold\" in the region at a time when president-elect Trump wants to \"rein in\" China.",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 09:00:29 GMT",
    "summary": "Governor Andrew Bailey delivers his strongest comments yet on the UK's departure from the EU.",
    "story": [
      "The UK must \"rebuild relations\" with the EU \"while respecting the decision of the British people\" who voted to leave in 2016, the Bank of England's governor has said.",
      "Andrew Bailey's Mansion House speech to investors marked some of his strongest comments yet on Brexit, saying one of its consequences has been weaker trade.",
      "He has previously avoided commenting on the topic because of the Bank's independence from Westminster politics.",
      "Mr Bailey said the changed relationship with the EU has \"weighed\" on the economy.",
      "\"As a public official, I take no position on Brexit per se,\" he said. \"But I do have to point out consequences.\"",
      "He went on: \"The impact on trade seems to be more in goods than services... But it underlines why we must be alert to and welcome opportunities to rebuild relations while respecting that very important decision of the British people.\"",
      "The government remains opposed to rejoining the EU, but Chancellor Rachel Reeves also said in her Mansion House speech there could be a closer relationship.",
      "\"Our biggest trading partner is the European Union. We will not be reversing Brexit, or re-entering the single market or customs union. But we must reset our relationship,\" she said.",
      "Mr Bailey said that the UK should not focus \"just on the effects of Brexit\", warning about \"geopolitical shocks and the broader fragmentation of the global economy\".",
      "He made a similar comment last week when asked about US President-elect Donald  Trump and his threat to impose tariffs of up to 20% on imports.",
      "Vicky Pryce, chief economic adviser to the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said if that were to happen, \"it is actually quite questionable whether the UK could have a special relationship with the US when it still trades quite substantially with Europe\".",
      "'A better deal'",
      "Assessing the impact of the UK's decision to leave the EU on the economy has been tricky given the multiple economic shocks in recent years.",
      "The Office for Budget Responsibility and other independent analysts estimate the economy will take a 4% hit over 15 years as a result.",
      "Goods trade, especially in food and farm exports, has been especially hit by the imposition of new trade barriers. Trade in services, such as banking, has done better than expected, however.",
      "Some politicians have said there could be a better relationship between the UK and the EU.",
      "\"We need to be positive here and optimistic that a better deal can be actually closed on that front,\" Spain\u2019s Finance Minister Carlos Cuerpo told the BBC.",
      "Meanwhile, Sir John Gieve, former deputy governor of the Bank of England, said the UK could negotiate \"some deals around the edges which reduce the barriers to trade\".",
      "He too ruled out rejoining the single market or customs union, but told the BBC's Today programme: \"If we could, in due course, get close to joining the customs union I think that would be a major help.\"",
      "He added it would mean \"people would invest in Britain... in the knowledge they could freely export into Europe, as they did before Brexit\".",
      "Reeves also reiterated her plans to shake up the UK pension system in a bid for growth.",
      "She wants council pension pots to be merged so they can make bigger investments to generate higher returns, a move criticised as risky by some.",
      "\u201cThe UK has been regulating for risk, but not regulating for growth,\u201d she said.",
      "The annual event took place against a backdrop of businesses criticising the government for holding back growth through tax rises, which Reeves has said are necessary to \"properly fund\" public services.",
      "'Crown jewel'",
      "In her speech, Reeves said that regulations brought in after the 2008 global financial crisis \"resulted in a system which sought to eliminate risk-taking\", adding that has now \"gone too far\".",
      "She said financial services in the UK were \"the crown jewel in our economy\" but added \"we cannot take the UK's status as a global financial centre for granted\".",
      "The government will publish a financial services strategy in the spring, focusing on fintech, sustainable finance, asset management, insurance and capital markets, \"laying the foundations for more private investment\", Reeves said.",
      "What is Rachel Reeves' plan for pension funds?",
      "Brexit deal impact in UK is worsening, warn economists",
      "Mr Bailey's speech went on to address the wider UK economy and its lack of growth.",

      "He said the UK is not alone in having this problem, which he said also affects other parts of Europe, but noted that the US has \"a better story to tell\".",
      "Mr Bailey also echoed Reeves' concern that the UK pension system is \"fragmented\" and requires \"heavy lifting\" to fix it.",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said the Conservatives would \"study the detail of these reforms, many of which follow on from those we were pursuing in government\".",
      "But he added that reforms \"aimed at increasing growth will be significantly undermined by Labour's Budget, which sent precisely the wrong signal to investors and wealth creators\".",

    "story": [
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves is planning what she calls the \"biggest pension reform in decades\" in an attempt to boost economic growth.",
      "The government wants to merge the UK's 86 council pension schemes into a handful of \"pension megafunds\".",
      "It is hoped the changes will lead to billions of pounds being invested in the UK in areas such as energy infrastructure, tech start-ups and public services.",
      "Reeves told the BBC that UK public sector pension funds in their current form were not big enough to generate good returns for British savers, but some argue the changes are not without risk.",
      "What will it mean for my pension?",
      "Workers in local government schemes have a pension based on salary and service length - known as a defined benefit pension - and they will not see any change to their payments as a result of the plans.",
      "Most private sector workers are in schemes where they pay into a savings pot each month, and their eventual pension depends upon the size of this when they retire.",
      "The government is considering setting a minimum size requirement for these defined contributions schemes. It is hoped that larger funds will be more efficient to run and generate greater returns, which could mean people's pension savings grow faster.",
      "Will Rachel Reeves' public sector pension plans work?",
      "Reeves told the BBC ahead of her first speech as chancellor at the annual Mansion House gathering of investors in London that she wants the UK's pension schemes to be more like Canada and Australia.",
      "In those countries, pensions of local government workers, such as teachers and civil servants, are pooled into a handful of funds which are able to make big investments around the world.",
      "\"They probably have the best pension funds anywhere in the world,\" Reeves said.",
      "The pension reforms are part of Reeves' plan to boost growth and come after many businesses have criticised the rise in employer National Insurance contributions in the Budget.",
      "She told the BBC that she is \"not immune to those criticisms, but it was necessary to increase taxes\u201d to get the state finances in shape and \u201cproperly fund\u201d public services.",
      "The government plans to merge the 86 council pension funds - which include \u00a3354bn in investments and are run by local government officials - into \"megafunds\" run by fund managers.",
      "The Prime Minister\u2019s spokesperson has acknowledged that new pension \u201cmega funds\u201d will not be obliged to invest in UK businesses or infrastructure.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t looking at mandating of investment, this is about bringing forward the reforms necessary to create scale in our pension funds.\u201d",
      "The government also wants to set a minimum size limit on defined contribution schemes in the private sector, which manage around \u00a3800bn of investments, to encourage the consolidation of the around 60 different multi-employer schemes.",
      "The government says its changes could \"unlock\" \u00a380bn worth of investment into the UK.",
      "\"Our pension funds in Britain are too small to be making the investments that get a good return for people saving for retirement and to help our economy to grow,\" Reeves said.",
      "Iain McGill, chief executive of UK biotech firm Quell Therapeutics, told the BBC the proposed changes could help firms like his.",
      "He says there comes a point when access to \"significant\" funds is needed for biotech companies to expand.",

      "How much is the state pension going up?",
      "What is NI and how much do workers and employers pay?",
      "Cutting costs",
      "The UK's pension fund market is \"incredibly fragmented\", according to Helen Morrissey, pensions expert at Hargreaves Landsdown.",
      "Running these schemes costs money. Each one must pay administration, governance and management costs.",
      "If larger funds are created by combining smaller ones, Ms Morrissey says, they will have the scale to invest in larger projects.",
      "They also have greater bargaining power to drive down fees, which should increase investment returns, and could have the ability to hire their own investment experts.",
      "Tracy Blackwell, chief executive of Pension Insurance Corporation, told the BBC:  \"I think by having the scale and the right expertise internally to invest in a wide range of assets, they'll be able to invest in a lot more than what they can invest in now.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Canadian pension fund, the Public Sector Pension Investment Board, bought the company that owns Aberdeen, Glasgow and Southampton airports in a deal worth more than \u00a31.5bn.",
      "However, big investments can also bring bigger risks, with Canadian pension fund the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System being the largest investor in troubled Thames Water.",
      "Megafunds 'a mistake'",
      "Gervais Williams, head of equities at Premier Miton, said combining smaller schemes into megafunds was a \"mistake\".",

      "He laundered the stolen cryptocurrency with the help of his wife Heather Morgan, who used the alias Razzlekhan to promote her hip hop music.",
      "At the time of the theft, the bitcoin was worth around $70m (\u00a355.3m), but had risen in value to more than $4.5bn by the time they were arrested. At today's prices they would be worth more than double that.",
      "The $3.6bn worth of assets recovered in the case was the biggest financial seizure in the Department of Justice's history, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said at the time.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important to send a message that you can\u2019t commit these crimes with impunity, that there are consequences to them,\u201d district judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly said.",
      "Lichtenstein, who has been in prison since his arrest in February 2022, expressed remorse for his actions.",
      "He also said that he hopes to apply his skills to fight cybercrime after serving his sentence.",
      "Morgan also pleaded guilty last year to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. She is due to be sentenced on 18 November.",
      "According court documents, Lichtenstein used advanced hacking tools and techniques to hack into Bitfinex.",
      "Following the hack, he enlisted Morgan's help to launder the stolen funds.",

      "The methods included using fictitious identities, switching the funds into different cryptocurrencies and buying gold coins.",

    "story": [
      "Plans for a major shake-up of pension funds have been announced by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves.",
      "She wants to create pension \"megafunds\" by merging the UK's 86 council schemes, using the set-up in Canada and Australia as a model.",
      "Other proposals suggest pension schemes need to reach a certain size or pool together. Larger funds could then be invested in UK infrastructure projects, the government says.",
      "So, will this affect people with pension savings?",
      "Which pension funds are involved?",
      "The government says the Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) can get more from investments - while tackling a \u00a32bn bill for fees - by joining together.",
      "There are 86 local government pension funds in England and Wales, which are mainly paid into by local government workers.",
      "These individually managed funds are divided by local authority, making it more costly, because each fund is paying its own management and administration fees.",
      "Between them, they have 6.5 million members and manage assets worth \u00a3354bn.",
      "The schemes are all part of the LGPS which is the seventh-largest in the world, according to the UK government.",
      "Most of its participants are low-paid women.",
      "Under Reeves\u2019 plans, the funds would be consolidated in some way, although at present it is unclear exactly how.",
      "She may ask them to pool their assets and resources, or she may ask them to merge with one another to create a smaller number of larger funds, which would benefit from greater financial firepower and fewer costs.",
      "The LGPS is a defined benefit scheme which means that, when it is time to draw their pensions, its savers get an agreed amount based on their salary, no matter what the fund is worth at the time.",
      "So drawing scheme into \"megafunds\" will make little, or no, difference to what they receive.",
      "That is different to private pension pots, which rise and fall in value depending on how investments perform.",
      "Why copy Canada and Australia?",
      "The \u201cMaple 8\u201d is a group of vast Canadian pension funds, including the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, which manages assets worth C$247.5bn (\u00a3141.8bn), and the Canada Pension Plan, whose assets are worth C$409.6bn.",
      "While UK pension schemes tend to invest more in assets like equities and bonds, their Canadian rivals focus more on private markets.",
      "The Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, for example, only has 7% of its assets in listed equities, compared with 60% for traditional pension funds.",
      "Instead, it skews its investments towards private markets, including infrastructure (including a 25% stake in British energy giant SSE), real estate and private equity deals.",
      "This kind of model is not without risk, however.",
      "The Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System is the largest investor in the troubled Thames Water, which has been highlighted by those questioning Reeves' plans.",
      "Why is bigger supposed to be better?",
      "Individually, the UK\u2019s 86 local government pension schemes vary in size, from Greater Manchester\u2019s massive \u00a330bn fund all the way down to several schemes which are \u201csub-\u00a31bn\u201d, according to Joanne Donnelly, board secretary at the Local Government Pension Scheme Advisory Board.",
      "Running these schemes costs money. Each one must pay administration, governance and management costs, which can build up \u2013 last year, they increased by \u00a328m.",
      "Like her predecessor, Jeremy Hunt, who also announced plans for a Canadian-style model, the chancellor believes consolidation would save money.",
      "That would in turn \u201cdeliver better returns for savers and unlock billions of pounds of investment\u201d.",
      "Other chancellors have aimed to make similar moves, including George Osborne who, in 2015, set out plans for local government schemes to pool resources,",
      "Does everyone agree with the idea?",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 11:20:47 GMT",
    "summary": "The department for rural affairs suggested exempting some older farmers from having to pay, Newsnight is told.",
    "story": [
      "A bid by the department for rural affairs to soften changes to inheritance tax for farms - possibly by exempting some older farmers - has been rejected by the Treasury.",
      "The Treasury said there would be no change or mitigations to the policy, which will see an end to inheritance tax exemption for some farms.",
      "From April 2026, farms worth more than \u00a31m will face an effective inheritance tax rate of 20% - half the usual rate of 40%.",
      "BBC Newsnight understands that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), which represents the interests of farmers in government, believes it was not properly consulted over the change.",
      "How many farms will be affected by Budget tax rises?",
      "Most farmers won't pay inheritance tax, PM insists",
      "Farmers 'betrayed' by \u00a31m inheritance tax relief cap",
      "The department was informed about the policy the night before it was announced in the Budget.",
      "The move has been branded \"disastrous\" by the National Farmers' Union (NFU), with some farmers warning it would decimate the countryside.",
      "Defra suggested softening the policy to exempt some older people, possibly those over the age of 80.",
      "The April 2026 start for the policy means they may not have time to make use of existing rules to skip inheritance tax by passing on an asset seven years before death.",
      "But this suggestion has been dismissed by the Treasury, which said it had taken \"a fair and balanced approach\".",
      "Since its introduction in 1984, agricultural property relief (APR) has allowed small family farms \u2013 including land used for crops or rearing animals, as well as farm buildings, cottages and houses - to be exempt from inheritance tax.",
      "The Treasury said 40% of APR had been going to \"the 7% wealthiest claimants\", and that it had \"made a difficult decision to ensure the relief is fiscally sustainable\".",
      "It put this against a backdrop of \u201cpublic services crumbling [and] a \u00a322bn fiscal hole inherited from the previous government\".",
      "\u201cAround 500 claims each year will be impacted and farm-owning couples can pass on up to \u00a33m without paying any inheritance tax - this is a fair and balanced approach,\" a spokesperson added.",
      "There are divisions in government over the change.",
      "Some ministers believe it will only have an impact on relatively wealthy farmers - a couple using all their inheritance tax benefits will be able to pass on a \u00a33m farm tax free. Any inheritance tax charge on farms can be paid over 10 years.",
      "But other ministers believe the chancellor is in danger of undermining Labour\u2019s relations with rural Britain while raising a relatively small amount of money.",
      "The change could raise around \u00a3560m.",
      "Some sources in government have expressed concerns that the chancellor is creating unnecessary grief over a change that is not, in relative terms, a huge money spinner.",
      "There are concerns that the change - which has proved controversial among farmers since its announcement - could become \u201ctotemic\u201d in rural Britain.",
      "Protests",
      "The NFU warned it would \u201csnatch away the next generation\u2019s ability to carry on producing British food\u201d and see farmers forced to sell land to pay the tax.",
      "A rally to protest against the plan will be held in Whitehall next Tuesday.",
      "There is also a dispute around the figures used to calculate the changes.",
      "Farmers' leaders have been told by Defra that the figures come from the Treasury and not their department.",
      "Tom Bradshaw, the president of the NFU, said that Defra figures showed the changes would have an impact on 66% of estates.",
      "The Treasury said the figure was 28%.",
      "Clive Bailey, founder of the Farming Forum which is also organising a protest in central London next week, said on Thursday that any change to the new rules \u201cwould be a step forward\u201d.",
      "Mr Bailey, who farms in Staffordshire, said the suggested exemption should cover people much younger than 80.",
      "Compared with the wider population, farming sees \"a lot of people who should have retired already still working\u201d, he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme.",
      "He called the inheritance rules \u201cso poorly thought out\u201d.",
      "The cost of running a viable farm exceeded \u00a31m, he said, arguing that the government needed to sit down \"with real family farmers or agricultural economists\".",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not special, but the economic circumstances of farming are very different to other industries.\"",
      "'The policy will not change'",
      "During rural affairs questions in the Commons, Conservative shadow environment minister Robbie Moore accused the government of \"arrogance\" and urged ministers to publish a full impact assessment of the change.",
      "Environment minister Daniel Zeichner reiterated the government's figures that fewer than 500 farms a year would be affected.",
      "He added there were ways the change could \"be managed\" and called on Conservatives to \"join me in reassuring British farmers about their future\".",
      "Another Tory MP, former cabinet minister Sir Jeremy Wright, asked if ministers had considered limiting inheritance tax exemptions to those who could prove a farm had been in family ownership for \"a certain number of years\".",
      "Zeichner replied that the issue was \"complicated\", adding \"in future we will have further discussions\".",
      "Lib Dem environment spokesman Tim Farron said the tax rise would be a \"disaster for family farms\".",

      "People who were mis-sold finance agreements when buying cars could face a delay to potential compensation payouts.",
      "A decision by judges at the Court of Appeal has blown open an ongoing saga into hidden commission payments, with buyers possibly in line for payouts totalling billions of pounds.",
      "Now the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is consulting on giving dealers extra time to deal with complaints.",
      "However, lawyers say this could further delay compensation which should be paid to car buyers who may not have given their informed consent for the commission payments.",
      "Who may be in line for payouts?",

      "About two million are sold this way each year, with customers paying an initial deposit, then a monthly fee with interest for the vehicle.",
      "In a complicated, and long-running, series of developments, many of these agreements have come under scrutiny.",
      "In 2021, the FCA banned deals in which the dealer received a commission from the lender, based on the interest rate charged to the customer. It said this provided an incentive for a buyer to be charged a higher than necessary interest rate.",
      "Since January, it has been considering whether compensation should be paid to people with these deals before 2021.",
      "That has created the prospect of banks and other lenders having to make payouts totalling millions of pounds.",
      "Last month, a decision at the Court of Appeal broadened the net of those who could receive compensation, potentially increasing the lenders' final bill to billions of pounds.",

      "While the initial investigations surrounded discretionary commission arrangements, which were banned in 2021, the Court of Appeal decision widened the scope to any car finance commissions.",
      "The three judges unanimously agreed that it would be illegal for the lender to pay any commission to the dealer without the informed consent of the buyer.",
      "In other words, customers should be clearly told how much commission would be paid, and agree to it, without those details being buried in the terms and conditions of the loan.",
      "The hearing included the test case of Marcus Johnson, 34, from Cwmbran, Torfaen, who bought his first car - a Suzuki Swift - in 2017.",
      "He was not informed the car dealership was being paid 25% commission, which was added on to what he had to pay back.",
      "\"I signed a few documents and then drove away in the car,\" he told the BBC.",

      "Andy Higginson, chair of JD Sports and the British Retail Consortium, which represents supermarkets, said tax hikes from April - including a rise in National Insurance contributions from employers - would lead to a jump in costs for shoppers.",
      "Higher drinks prices could show in as little as six months, added Simon Emeny, the boss of Fullers, which owns about 400 pubs and hotels.",
      "There has been a growing backlash from firms to the higher costs they face from the Budget, but chancellor Rachel Reeves has said \"businesses will have to absorb some of this through profits\".",
      "From April next year, employers will have to pay NI at 15% on salaries above \u00a35,000, instead of 13.8% on salaries above \u00a39,100 currently.",
      "Minimum wages are also set to rise from April.",
      "On Wednesday, Mr Higginson warned: \"I'm guaranteeing you today, if these go through as they are without any sort of feathering, we\u2019re going to see significant inflation in prices.\"",
      "He called on the government to \"phase\" in the increases in National Insurance and minimum wages for businesses \"over the next two to three years\" rather than in April next year.",
      "\"We just need to make sure that the immediate impact of all these things doesn\u2019t come in one big lump and that the economy has time to absorb these changes in a way that doesn\u2019t fuel inflation,\" Mr Higginson told the BBC's Today programme.",
      "The JD Sports boss was one of more than 120 business leaders to sign a letter, published in The Times, backing Labour ahead of the general election and endorsing the party's economic plans.",
      "Warning 'pain' of tax hikes to hit jobs and pay rises",
      "'This catastrophic Budget will put up pint prices'",
      "JD Sports and Fullers warn of price rises due to Budget",
      "The chancellor's budget included \u00a340bn in total worth of tax rises.",
      "More than half of these will be paid for by employers, with the National Insurance increase set to generate \u00a325bn a year.",
      "But there are concerns, the impact will still be felt by working people if firms decide to pass on costs through higher prices and if wage increases are restricted.",
      "Mr Higginson said there was \"plenty of time yet\" but added it was \"hard to see that the actions so far really match that pro-business rhetoric before the election\".",
      "He said the Budget created a \"worrying\" backdrop for businesses at a time when economic growth is desperately needed.",
      "\"It doesn\u2019t feel like a Budget for working people. It doesn\u2019t feel like a Budget for growth. I think it will restrict investment,\" added Fullers boss Mr Emeny.",
      "The pub chain boss said that businesses still had not recovered profits fully post-Covid, and that the Budget measures announced cost an \"extra \u00a33.5bn\" for the hospitality sector.",
      "\"There\u2019s no way a sector like ours can carry this level of cost and just absorb it as profit,\" he added.",
      "Mr Emeny said that the combination of NI and minimum wage changes would cost his business an additional \u00a38m, although the businesses latest results saw increased sales and profits on its food, drinks and hotels.",
      "In the six months to September, Fullers increased profits before tax by 21% to \u00a317.6m compared with the same time last year.",
      "The average price of a pint of draught lager in the UK was \u00a34.47 in September, according to the Office for National Statistics, but the British Beer and Pub Association recently revealed that landlords make 12p profit per pint.",

    "story": [
      "Up to 115 Post Office branches and hundreds of head office jobs are at risk as part of a radical shake-up of the business.",
      "The Post Office is looking at options for its wholly-owned branches, which currently employ about 1,000 workers and are loss-making.",
      "These could include alternative franchise arrangements where an operator like the retailer WHSmith or another third party could take on the branches.",
      "The Communication Workers Union (CWU) said that for the company to propose the plans as the inquiry into the Horizon IT scandal continues was \"immoral\" and \"tone deaf\".",
      "The government-owned Post Office has 11,500 branches across the UK, most of which are franchises, with 115 Crown Post Offices.",
      "These are usually found in city centres, and staffed by Post Office employees.",
      "The strategic review, led by the Post Office\u2019s new chairman Nigel Railton, is designed, however, to overhaul how the organisation operates.",
      "It faces a host of challenges, such as stiff competition from rival parcel operators like Evri and fewer people sending letters, with revenues for its branches being hit as a result.",
      "The shake-up aims to put the business on a firmer financial footing, but it comes as the long-running inquiry into the Horizon IT scandal heads into its final stages.",
      "Between 1999 and 2015, hundreds of sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted after faulty computer software made it appear as though money was missing from their accounts.",
      "'A new deal'",
      "The former boss of Camelot, Mr Railton, told sub-postmasters on Wednesday that the Post Office \"urgently\" needed \"a fresh start\", with a \"new deal\" putting them at the \"heart of this business\".",
      "It has become increasingly reliant on government subsidy and the retail side of its business, reporting pre-tax losses of \u00a381m in 2022-23.",
      "Today, nearly half of its branches are not profitable or only make a small profit from the Post Office element of the business.",
      "It has faced a \"tough\" time in the last 10 years, Mr Railton acknowledged, which meant that sub-postmasters' remuneration has \"lagged behind\".",
      "He said that the plans set out would provide more than \u00a3250m each year to postmasters by 2030, although this would be subject to government funding.",
      "It also aims to improve branches\u2019 banking offer for customers, and will see a \"lower-risk, better value\" IT system introduced for sub-postmasters.",
      "On Monday, the European boss of Fujitsu, the company which developed the faulty Horizon system, admitted he \"does not know\" if the software is currently reliable.",
      "A survey in September revealed almost seven in 10 sub-postmasters have experienced an \"unexplained discrepancy\" on the Horizon system since January 2020.",
      "'Learned no lessons'",
      "Dave Ward, general secretary of the CWU, said it appeared the Post Office had \"learned no lessons from its chaotic and uncoordinated mistakes from the past\".",
      "\"CWU members are victims of the Horizon scandal \u2013 and for them to now fear for their jobs ahead of Christmas is yet another cruel attack,\" he added.",
      "Earlier this month, Post Office minister Gareth Thomas said the organisation was at a critical juncture and the government had already commissioned its own review into what the Post Office should look like in the future.",
      "As part of the overhaul, hundreds of jobs at its head office are also under threat, with Mr Railton saying it was necessary to \"right-size\" the organisation.",
      "Mr Railton said that conversations with the government on the proposed changes, and funding required, had been \"positive\" so far.",
      "Speaking in front of the inquiry on Monday, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds hinted that Post Office branches could fill a gap left on British High Streets by sweeping bank closures.",
      "But with the rise of mobile banking and contactless payments, there is a question mark over whether this would be a sustainable strategy.",
      "Fujitsu boss 'does not know' if Horizon is reliable",
      "New Lord vows to fight for Post Office justice",
      "Separately, ministers have been exploring plans to hand ownership of the Post Office to sub-postmasters.",
      "Reynolds told the inquiry there was still \"tremendous affection\" for the Post Office among the UK public and a \"desire for it to have a strong future.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the Department for Business and Trade said: \"The government is in active discussion with Nigel Railton on his plans to put postmasters at the centre of the organisation and strengthen the post office network for its long-term future.\"",

    "summary": "Makers of a new generation of European electric aircraft are struggling to raise money.",
    "story": [
      "One of the innovations at this year's Paris Olympics was supposed to be an electric flying taxi service.",
      "Germany's Volocopter promised its electric-powered, two-seater aircraft, the VoloCity, would be ferrying passengers around the city.",
      "It never happened. Instead the company ran demonstration flights.",
      "While missing that deadline was embarrassing, behind the scenes a more serious issue was playing out - Volocopter was urgently trying to raise fresh investment to keep the firm going.",
      "Talks to borrow \u20ac100m (\u00a383m; $106m) from the government failed in April.",
      "Now hopes are pinned on China's Geely, which is in talks to take an 85% stake in Volocopter in return for $95m of funding, according to a Bloomberg report. The deal could mean that any future manufacturing would be moved to China.",
      "Volocopter is one of dozens of companies around the world developing an electric vertical take-off and landing (EVTOL) aircraft.",
      "Their machines promise the flexibility of a helicopter, but without the cost, noise and emissions.",
      "However, faced with the massive cost of getting such novel aircraft approved by regulators and then building up manufacturing capabilities, some investors are bailing out.",
      "One of the most high-profile casualties is Lilium.",
      "The German company had developed a radical take on the EVTOL theme.",
      "Lilium's aircraft uses 30 electric jets that can be tilted in unison to swing between vertical lift and forward flight.",
      "The concept proved attractive, with the company claiming to have orders and memoranda of understanding for 780 jets from around the world.",
      "It was able to demonstrate the technology using a remote controlled scale model. Construction had begun on the first full-sized jets, and testing had been due to begin in early 2025.",
      "As recently as the Farnborough Airshow in July, Lilium\u2019s COO Sebastian Borel was sounding confident.",
      "\u201cWe are definitely burning through cash,\" he told the BBC. \u201cBut this is a good sign, because it means we are producing the aircraft. We\u2019re going to have three aircraft in production by the end of the year, and we have also raised \u20ac1.5bn\u201d.",
      "But then the money ran out.",
      "Lilium had been attempting to arrange a loan worth \u20ac100m from the German development bank, KfW. However, that required guarantees from national and state governments, which never materialised.",
      "In early November, the company put its main operating businesses into insolvency proceedings, and its shares were removed from the Nasdaq stock exchange.",
      "For the moment, work on the new aircraft is continuing, as the company works with restructuring experts to sell the business or bring in new investment. However, getting the new e-jet into production is looking more challenging than ever.",
      "The high-profile British player in the eVTOL market is Vertical Aerospace. The Bristol-based company was founded in 2016 by businessman Stephen Fitzpatrick, who also set up OVO Energy.",
      "Its striking VX4 design uses eight large propellers mounted on slim, aircraft style wings to generate lift. Mr Fitzpatrick has made ambitious claims about the aircraft, suggesting it would be \u201c100 times\u201d safer and quieter than a helicopter, for 20% of the cost.",
      "The company has made progress. After completing a programme of remote-controlled testing, it began carrying out piloted tests earlier this year. Initially, these were carried out with the aircraft tethered to the ground. In early November, it carried out its first untethered take-off and landing.",
      "But there have also been serious setbacks. In August last year, a remotely-piloted prototype was badly damaged when it crashed during testing at Cotswold Airport, after a propeller blade fell off.",
      "In May one of its key partners, the engineering giant Rolls Royce pulled out of a deal to supply electric motors for the aircraft.",
      "Ambitions remain sky high. Vertical Aerospace says it will deliver 150 aircraft to its customers by the end of the decade. By then, it also expects to be capable of producing 200 units a year, and to be breaking even in cash terms.",
      "Yet financial strains have been intensifying. Mr Fitzpatrick invested an extra $25m into the company in March. But a further $25m, due in August if alternative investment could not be found, has not been paid. As of September, Vertical had $57.4m on hand \u2013 but it expects to burn through nearly double that over the coming year.",
      "Hopes for the future appear to be pinned on doing a deal with the American financier Jason Mudrick, who is already a major creditor through his firm Mudrick Capital Management.",
      "He has offered to invest $75m into the business \u2013 and has warned the board of Vertical that rejecting his plan would inevitably lead to insolvency proceedings. But the move has been resisted by Mr Fitzpatrick, who would lose control of the company he founded.",
      "Sources close to the talks insist an agreement is now very close. The company believes if a deal can be done, it will unlock further fundraising opportunities.",
      "Amid the turbulence, one European project is quietly on track, says Bjorn Fehrm who has a background in aeronautical engineering and piloted combat jets for the Swedish Air Force. He now works for aerospace consultancy Leeham.",
      "He says that the EVTOL project underway at Airbus is likely to survive.",
      "Called the CityAirbus NextGen, the four-seater aircraft has eight propellers and a range of 80km.",
      "\"This is a technology project for their engineers, and they've got the money, and they've got the know how,\" says Mr Fehrm.",
      "Elsewhere in the world, other well funded start-ups stand a good change of getting their aircraft into production. That would include Joby and Archer in the US.",
      "Once the aircraft are being produced, the next challenge will be to see if there's a profitable market for them.",
      "The first routes are likely to be between airports and city centres. But will they make money?",
      "\"The biggest problem area when it comes to the cost of operation is the pilot and the batteries. You need to change the batteries a couple of times per year,\" points out Mr Fehrm.",
      "Given all the uncertainty and expense, you might wonder why investors put money into new electric aircraft in the first place.",
      "\"No one wanted to miss out on the next Tesla,\" laughs Mr Fehrm.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 00:09:24 GMT",
    "summary": "With its rich resources, uranium mining companies want Canada to play a key role in fuelling nuclear reactors worldwide.",
    "story": [
      "Uranium is making a comeback thanks to a renewed focus on nuclear energy as a climate crisis solution. Canada, rich with high-grade deposits, could become a nuclear \u201csuperpower\u201d. But can its potential be realised?",
      "Leigh Curyer had been working in uranium mining for nearly two decades when he noticed a striking shift.",
      "In 2011, the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster in Japan badly damaged the world's view of nuclear power, and the price for the heavy metal - a critical component for nuclear fuel - cratered.",
      "But the last five years has seen a reversal, with the global price of uranium spiking by more than 200%, becoming one of this year's top-performing commodities.",
      "Mr Curyer, an Australian-born businessman, credits this to a changing attitude that began soon after Microsoft founder Bill Gates touted nuclear energy as \u201cideal for dealing with climate change\u201d in 2018.",
      "Four years later, then-UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson pushed forward a policy of generating at least 25% of the country\u2019s energy from nuclear.",
      "Shortly after, the European Union voted to declare nuclear energy climate-friendly.",
      "These events were \u201ccatalytic\u201d for the uranium industry and a turning point for Mr Curyer's company NexGen, which is behind the largest in-development uranium mine in Canada.",
      "His phone began to ring with calls from investors worldwide - something that \u201chad never happened in my previous 17 years in the industry\u201d, he said.",
      "NexGen, whose project is located in Canada's remote, uranium-rich Athabasca Basin in northern Saskatchewan, is now worth nearly $4bn (\u00a32.98bn), despite the fact that the mine won\u2019t be commercially operational until at least 2028.",
      "If fully cleared by regulators, NexGen\u2019s project alone could push Canada to become the world\u2019s largest producer of uranium over the coming decade, knocking Kazakhstan out of the number one spot.",
      "Other companies have also rushed to Saskatchewan to capitalise on the boom, starting their own exploration projects in the region, while existing players re-opened dormant mines.",
      "With its rich resources, Canada\u2019s mining companies see the country playing a major role in the future of nuclear energy, meeting a demand for uranium that is poised to rise after nearly two dozen countries committed in COP28 climate conference to tripling their nuclear energy output by 2050.",
      "Nuclear energy is often hailed for its low carbon emissions compared to other sources like natural gas or coal.",
      "The World Nuclear Association estimates that 10% of power generated worldwide comes from nuclear sources, while more than 50% is still generated by gas or coal.",
      "At this year's COP29, the focus has been on ramping up funding for nuclear projects in the wake of a recent UN report indicating that current policies and investments fall short of what is needed to slow global temperature rise.",
      "Canada\u2019s role in supplying the commodity is made more urgent by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, particularly for the US, which had relied heavily on Russian-supplied enriched uranium to fire up its commercial nuclear reactors.",
      "Mr Curyer believes his mine could prove to be \u201cabsolutely critical\u201d to America\u2019s nuclear energy future, as the US is now hunting for alternatives to Russia, including by ramping up exploration on its own soil.",
      "Uranium can be found around the world, though it is heavily present in Canada, Australia and Kazakhstan.",
      "But what makes Canada\u2019s Athabasca Region unique is that its uranium is especially high grade, said Markus Piro, a professor of nuclear engineering at McMaster University.",
      "Canada has set strict rules for the sale of its uranium to other countries, Prof Piro said, and mandates it only be used for nuclear power generation.",
      "The country is also referred to as a \u201ctier-one nuclear nation\u201d, he said, due to its capability to produce nuclear fuel from the mining to the manufacturing stage.",
      "Once mined, uranium is milled to produce what is called calcined yellowcake. It can then be enriched, if needed, at facilities overseas to create fuel for nuclear reactors.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got a one-stop shop here in Canada, not every nation\u2019s like that,\u201d Prof Piro said.",
      "Canada is currently the world\u2019s second largest producer of uranium, accounting for roughly 13% of the total global output, according to the Canadian government. NexGen anticipates that once its mine is operational, it will boost that to 25%.",
      "Meanwhile, Cameco, which has been mining uranium in Saskatchewan since 1988 that supplies 30 nuclear reactors around the world, re-opened two of its mines in late 2022 to increase output.",
      "CEO Tim Gitzel told the BBC that he believes \u201cCanada could be a nuclear superpower around the world\u201d.",
      "But enthusiasm around nuclear energy is not without its critics.",
      "Some environmental groups worry nuclear projects are too costly and come with timelines that do not meet the urgency of the climate crisis.",
      "Data from the UK-based World Nuclear Association shows that 65 nuclear reactors are under construction across 16 countries, most of them in China, and a further 90 are in the planning stages.",
      "Some are expected to come online this year - others won\u2019t be ready until at least the end of the decade.",
      "Meanwhile, more than 100 nuclear plants have been closed in the last two decades around the world, including the sole nuclear power plant near New York City, which was retired in 2021 due to high operating costs and environmental and safety concerns.",
      "Plants were also shuttered in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Quebec, Canada.",
      "And not all of Canada is on board with the country\u2019s uranium industry.",
      "British Columbia sits on its own supply of uranium but has not allowed any nuclear plants or uranium mines to operate in the province since 1980.",
      "Critics have also expressed concern about radioactive waste nuclear reactors leave behind for future generations.",
      "Others fear another Fukushima-scale disaster, where a tsunami disabled three reactors, causing the release of highly radioactive materials and forcing mass evacuations.",
      "\u201cThe risk is not zero, that is for sure\u201d though it can be reduced, said Prof Piro.",
      "\u201cEven though amongst the general public there are mixed feelings about it, the reality is that it has produced very safe, very reliable and affordable electricity worldwide.\u201d",
      "The industry maintains the technology is both promising and viable.",
      "Mr Gitzel of Cameco said the industry has learned from past safety errors.",
      "\u201cAnd the public is buying on,\u201d he said. \u201cI can tell you that we have in Canada great public support for nuclear power.\u201d",
      "A 2023 Ipsos poll indicates that 55% of Canadians support nuclear energy.",
      "Still, past uranium booms in Canada have turned into dramatic busts.",
      "North of NexGen\u2019s proposed mine stands Uranium City, once home to 2,500 residents in its mid-20th Century heyday. In 1982, a major local mining firm shuttered operations over high costs and a soft market for uranium.",

      "Despite being someone who cares about climate change, and keen to retrofit his property to make it more efficient, there\u2019s a problem.",
      "\u201cThe whole question of how to better insulate the house is a real mystery to me,\u201d says Mr Duffy, a director of sustainability think-tank Citizen Network. \u201cI don\u2019t know where the expertise for that is.\u201d He also adds that he\u2019s also not sure whether he could install solar panels, given that he lives in a conservation area.",
      "Millions of homeowners across the country could be facing the same dilemma.",
      "Around 29 million British homes require retrofitting by 2050, according to the UK Green Building Council, an industry body.",
      "Retrofitting might involve measures such as improving your home\u2019s insulation, upgrading the heating system, or installing energy-generating devices such as solar panels, or even a private wind turbine.",
      "These adjustments can cost thousands of pounds up front, but, if properly executed, they could improve comfort and reduce people\u2019s bills in the long-run.",
      "Plus, increased energy efficiency ought to cut carbon emissions from homes, especially if property owners switch away from gas or oil-fired boilers, for example.",
      "Roughly one fifth of the UK\u2019s total emissions comes from residential buildings.",
      "Amy Peace and her husband live in the northwest of England, near Warrington. The pair both work in sustainability, advising businesses on their path to net zero.",
      "They were keen to improve the quality of their home and apply the principles they promote at work to their own lives \u2013 but they too faced challenges when deciding on how to go about it.",
      "\u201cEven though we\u2019ve got this background, and we\u2019re engineers as well, what we weren\u2019t entirely clear on was where was best to spend the money,\u201d says Mrs Peace.",
      "The couple spoke to multiple consultants, but Mrs Peace found the advice they received was often geared towards meeting Passivhaus standards \u2013 an ultra-energy efficient type of building.",
      "\u201cThere weren\u2019t many in that pragmatic middle space where you are literally saying, \u2018We\u2019ve got this much money, where would we be best putting it?\u2019,\u201d Mrs Peace adds.",
      "Perseverance during the past three years paid off, however, and the couple\u2019s 1930\u2019s detached house now has improved insulation, a heat pump, and an electric car charging point. Solar panels and battery will follow shortly, if all goes to plan.",
      "Conscious of the confusion around approaches to retrofit, some organisations are moving to improve the advice available to homeowners. Among them is Ecofurb.",
      "\u201cWe can model all the different options that are available, suitable for your home and your budget, and identify a package of measures,\u201d says Liz Lain\u00e9, of Parity Projects, a housing data analysis company, which runs Ecofurb.",
      "The firm offers this initial consultation for free, but full plans, with personalised input from a retrofit coordinator, start at \u00a3470. Ecofurb can also oversee any works as they are carried out by contractors to avoid \u201chorror stories\u201d, says Ms Lain\u00e9.",
      "There are many other organisations that offer to help homeowners plan a retrofit.",
      "The work often involves carrying out a heat-loss survey, to spot cold areas that require insulation, and to better understand a property\u2019s heating demand. Experts might also advise on the suitability of solar panels for your home, for example.",
      "There\u2019s the Get a Heat Pump website, launched by the charities Nesta and The MCS Foundation, which explains what heat pumps are and how they might fit into a home renovation plan.",
      "RICS, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, has also just launched a new retrofit standard for its members \u2013 essentially, it encourages surveyors with the appropriate training to offer their services to homeowners planning or undergoing a retrofit.",
      "The RICS website will soon include a range of retrofit advice and a tool to help homeowners find a suitable surveyor in their local area, says Steve Lees, from the RICS retrofit project team.",
      "Improving the energy efficiency of homes is \u201cessential\u201d for decarbonisation, says Gerald Charles, head of housing retrofit at the Centre for Sustainable Energy, but he adds that the current lack of good advice remains a genuine problem.",
      "\u201cThe industry as a whole don\u2019t appreciate the importance of good retrofit advice,\u201d he says.",
      "One entrepreneur who has noticed a knowledge gap in the market is James Major, founder and chief executive of HubbPro, which helps architects plan energy efficient buildings. Architects don\u2019t always have the latest information about how to incorporate energy-saving technologies into their designs, notes Mr Major.",
      "\u201cClean tech isn\u2019t part of what they do or what they should know \u2013 that\u2019s an engineering function,\u201d he says. And yet architects\u2019 clients increasingly ask about such tech when planning a new home or an extension.",
      "Through an initiative called MyHubb, Mr Major is now offering architects detailed reports that estimate the carbon reduction potential and payback period on retrofitted measures - such as heat pump-based heating systems or solar panels, for instance.",
      "He says these reports cost around \u00a31,000, though he adds that this price is not yet finalised.",
      "Mr Duffy says he will keep looking for solutions to his own retrofit conundrum. But he makes another point. So much of the currently available technology and advice is tailored to individual homeowners.",

      "Speaking exclusively to the BBC, Sir David Behan, the regulator\u2019s chairman, called for radical change, saying course closures and university mergers might be needed for financial stability.",
      "The government is considering the long-term funding and reform of universities.",
      "Tuition fees in England will rise for current and existing students by \u00a3285 to \u00a39,535 a year for those on full-time degrees, in autumn 2025.",
      "Even so, new analysis by the OfS, the independent regulator of higher education in England, shows a worsening position for universities.",
      "The regulator had said it expected 40% of universities to be in financial deficit in 2023-24.",
      "Now the OfS says by 2025-26, 72% could be spending more money than they have coming in and may have to use an overdraft or financial reserves, with a total \u00a31.6bn deficit forecast across the sector.",

      "Apprentices are paid to work while they study, so students end up with less debt.",

      "Unlike big city universities, there are no nearby institutions to collaborate with, so remaining financially sustainable is crucial, especially for the many local students who live at home.",

    "story": [
      "Davina McCall is recovering from surgery she underwent to remove a rare brain tumour, her partner has said.",
      "The TV presenter, 57, earlier posted a video on Instagram to say she had been diagnosed with a type of benign tumour called a colloid cyst.",
      "In an update on Friday evening, Michael Douglas said McCall was \"out of surgery\" and recovering in hospital - and thanked well-wishers \"for all the love\". He added that McCall was \"utterly exhausted\".",
      "A benign tumour is not cancerous, but such cysts tend to grow slowly, according to the Brainstrust charity.",
      "In the statement, shared to McCall's 1.9 million Instagram followers, Douglas said a doctor had described the procedure as being \"textbook\".",
      "Prior to the surgery, McCall explained how the tumour had been found by chance.",
      "\"A few months ago, I did a menopause talk for a company and they offered me a health scan in return, which I thought I was going to ace,\" she said in the video.",
      "\"But it turned out I had a benign brain tumour called a colloid cyst, which is very rare - three in a million.",
      "\"And so I slightly put my head in the sand for a while, and then I saw quite a few neurosurgeons. I got lots of opinions, and I realised that I have to get it taken out.",
      "\"It's big for the space. It fills the space. It's 14mm wide, and it needs to come out because if it grows, it would be bad. So I'm having it removed via a craniotomy.\"",
      "A craniotomy is an operation where a surgeon removes part of the skull to take out the tumour.",
      "\"Get the cyst, empty it, take it out, Bob's your uncle,\" McCall said.",
      "Speaking alongside her partner Douglas, she added: \"I'm OK. It's been up and down, obviously. We've been through a lot, yes.\"",
      "She said she expected to spend about nine days in hospital after the operation.",
      "She told followers: \"I don't want you to worry about me. I'm doing that enough.",
      "\"But I'm not worrying too much and I am in a good space. I have all the faith in the world in my surgeon and his team, and I am handing the reins over to him.",

      "Douglas said then that he would temporarily take over her social media.",
      "What are colloid cysts?",
      "They typically form in a fluid-filled cavity in the centre of the brain, and are themselves filled with fluid, the Brains Trust says.",
      "They account for less than 2% of all primary brain tumours, and the rate of growth and symptoms can vary from person to person, according to the charity.",
      "They are often found during a scan for something else, and some surgeons recommend a watch and wait policy if the cyst is small and causing no symptoms.",
      "However, as they grow they can block the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), causing symptoms including headaches, vision problems, nausea and loss of consciousness. In extreme cases, without treatment they can cause coma and even sudden death.",
      "'We're grateful to Davina'",
      "The Brain Tumour Charity told BBC News: \"All of us wish Davina the best possible outcome for this procedure.",
      "\"As an inspiration to so many, we're grateful that she has chosen to raise awareness of this uniquely devastating disease.",
      "\"We are committed to funding pioneering research, campaigning for systemic change and offering support to all those whose lives are turned upside down by a brain tumour diagnosis.\"",
      "Will Jones, chief executive of Brainstrust, added: \"Brain tumours are indiscriminate, they can affect anyone and they are more common than people might think. Over 80,000 people in the UK are living with a brain tumour, and there are over 130 different diagnoses.\"",
      "He added they were also \"grateful to Davina\" for sharing her story \"openly and candidly\".",
      "\"This will help hundreds of people living with a colloid cyst to feel acknowledged and less alone,\" he said.",
      "McCall's long TV presenting career includes Channel 4's Big Brother, ITV's Long Lost Family, and My Mum, Your Dad, along with Comic and Sport Relief for the BBC.",
      "Earlier this year she won a special recognition award at the National TV Awards, for her contributions to the TV industry over her career.",
      "She also campaigns on menopause awareness, after her changing hormones prompted her to  highlight women's experiences with her work.",
      "Last year she won the top prize at the British Book Awards for 2022's Menopausing, which she co-wrote with Dr Naomi Potter.",

      "NGN has previously denied unlawful activity happened at The Sun.",
      "Both sides returned to court to ask a judge to rule on preliminary issues ahead of the 2025 trial - including whether Prince Harry could be allowed access to emails sent between former NGN executives and members of the Royal Household between 2013 and 2019.",
      "His barrister, David Sherborne, said the emails were sent between five accounts of NGN employees and five employees of the Royal Household, who were \"involved in Royal Communications and the private secretaries to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II\".",
      "Mr Sherborne said the emails would be \"highly relevant in terms of providing the full picture not only as to the actual knowledge of the claimant but also as to the position in relation to constructive knowledge, based on what the Palace was being told by NGN\".",
      "Some of the emails had already been provided by former News UK chief executive Rebekah Brooks last year, the court heard, but Mr Sherborne said that these had been \"cherry-picked\".",
      "These included discussions between NGN and the Royal Household before Harry began legal action in 2019, and conversations about a possible apology being made by the publisher.",
      "Anthony Hudson KC, for NGN, opposed the bid, saying the emails were \"not relevant to the pleaded issues\" in the prince's case and were \"not necessary to ensure a fair trial will take place\".",
      "He added that \"extracting\" the emails would cost \u00a317,000.",
      "In a ruling, Mr Justice Fancourt said there was a \"degree of speculation whether any of the documents sought are going to assist the claimant's case\", but ultimately ruled there was \"sufficient justification\" for a limited number of emails to be provided.",
      "He said: \"In all the circumstances, therefore, it seems to me that there is a limited category of documents where despite the element of delay, and despite the relative lateness of the application, there is a credible case for saying a full picture is necessary in the interest of justice.",
      "\"I will, however, limit the documents that are being sought,\" the judge added.",
      "The judge also added it was \"unsatisfactory that so little progress has been made\" and that there needs to be \"further work done on both sides\".",
      "The court heard the trial is expected to last between six and eight weeks, and a further hearing is due to be held in December.",
      "Others who have settled their claims in recent years include actress Sienna Miller, ex-footballer Paul Gascoigne, and actor Hugh Grant.",
      "Grant previously claimed journalists had used private investigators to tap his phone and burgle his house - NGN denied the claims against it. He said in April that he \"did not want to accept\" the \"enormous sum of money\" he had been offered to settle but a trial was likely to prove \"very expensive\".",
      "A spokesperson for NGN said it published an apology in 2011 to \"victims of voicemail interception by the News of the World\", adding that the company had \"publicly committed to paying financial compensation\" and had since \"paid settlements to those with proper claims\".",

      "The fortnightly Granny Series was created in 2023 by her granddaughter Diana Kaumba, a stylist who is based in New York City.",
      "She came up with the idea when she was visiting Zambia to mark the second anniversary of the death of her father - the person she says inspired her passion for fashion because he always dressed well.",
      "During that visit Ms Kaumba had not worn all her carefully curated outfits, so she asked her grandmother - or \"Mbuya\" in the Bemba language - if she wanted to try them on.",
      "\"I wasn\u2019t doing anything at the time, so I just said: 'OK. If that\u2019s what you want to do let\u2019s do it - why not?'\" Ms Chola said.",
      "\"You will miss me when I die and at least this way you will be remembering me.\"",
      "Ms Kaumba wore Mbuya\u2019s top and \"chitenge\" - a piece of patterned cloth wrapped around the waist. And Mbuya\u2019s first outfit was a silver pantsuit.",
      "\"I thought it would be nice to dress up Mbuya in high fashion and then take photographs of her in her natural habitat,\" Ms Kaumba tells the BBC.",
      "That natural habitat is a farm in the village of 10 Miles, just north of the Zambian capital, Lusaka.",
      "Most often Ms Chola is photographed in all her glamour outside - often sitting on an elegant wooden chair or lounging on a leather sofa.",
      "In the background are exposed brick buildings with corrugated iron roofs, ploughed fields, mango trees and maize crops.",
      "\"I was so nervous when I posted that first photo. I left my phone for 10 minutes and in those 10 minutes there were 1,000 likes,\" Ms Kaumba says.",
      "\"My mind was blown. The comments were flying in and people were asking for more.\"",
      "It was in April 2024 that the Granny Series really took off - after Ms Kaumba posted a series of photos of her grandmother in a red Adidas dress, several chunky, golden necklaces and a glittering jewelled crown.",
      "\"It surprised me to hear that so many people around the world love me,\" Ms Chola says - who does not know her exact age because she does not have a birth certificate.",
      "\"I didn\u2019t know I could make such an impact at this age.\"",
      "Ms Chola poses in clothes that are a mix of vibrant colours, textures and styles.",
      "From a green American football jersey, combined with a layered frilly red dress styled as a skirt - in the colours of the Zambian flag to pay homage to 60 years of independence.",
      "To a blue, black and green sequined top, complete with a golden snake necklace and bracelet.",
      "And Mbuya\u2019s personal favourite - jeans, a graphic T-shirt with her image on the front and a blonde wig.",
      "\"I had never worn jeans or a wig before - so I was happy, and I was dancing.\"",
      "Ms Kaumba, who has been a stylist since 2012, says that her grandma has \"courage, grace - and nails every look\".",
      "All the looks reflect her maximalist-chic aesthetic - which celebrates the joy of excess, eclectic combinations, the big and the bold, and clashing patterns and colours.",
      "At the heart of it all are eye-catching accessories - bold sunglasses, oversized hats, necklaces, bracelets, pendants, rings, gloves, bags, blonde wigs, crowns.",
      "That influence has come directly from her grandmother, who has \"always been a lover of pearls and bangles\".",
      "In one particularly playful scene called GOAT - short for greatest of all time - Ms Chola appears with a goat - that is decked out in Mbuya\u2019s beloved pearls.",
      "Other accessories also reflect Chola\u2019s personality and story.",
      "In some shots Mbuya is holding the beloved radio that she carries around all day and takes to bed with her.",
      "Or she\u2019s clutching an \"ibende\" - a long wooden stick that over the years she has used to pound millet or cassava or maize.",
      "She is smoking a pipe or holding a metal cup full of tea, and hanging off the edge of the chair arm is an \"mbaula\" or charcoal brazier that Zambians often use for cooking - especially now that the country is plagued by severe power cuts.",
      "Ms Kaumba hopes that the Granny Series will highlight that older people still have a lot to offer - and making memories together is an important way to \"leave footprints for the next generation\".",
      "\"Do not write them off, love them just the same till the end because remember we will be just like them one day.\"",
      "As a result of Mbuya\u2019s photo shoots, Ms Kaumba\u2019s been hired by four granddaughters to style their grandmothers - aged between 70 and 96.",
      "Ms Chola hopes that the Granny Series will inspire people \"to live their lives and not worry about being judged by society\".",
      "She urges people to \"always forgive yourself for whatever mistakes you made. You can never change your past - but you can change your future\".",
      "The photo shoots have brought granddaughter and grandmother closer - and through their special bond Ms Kaumba has learnt so much more about her Mbuya\u2019s often difficult life.",
      "Ms Chola was raised by her grandparents, went to school until she was 12 or 13 and then, because of economic reasons, was forced to marry a man in his 30s.",
      "She had three children, ended up drinking heavily and eventually escaped the marriage.",
      "That trauma still haunts her - but her unexpected global fame has given her a new lease on life.",
      "\"I\u2019m now able to wake up with a purpose knowing that people around the world love to see me,\" Chola says.",

      "There is something quite bold about telling people you look like someone famous - especially if your supposed doppelganger is one of the world\u2019s biggest heartthrobs.",
      "But that hasn't put off the hundreds of men in the UK and US who have taken part in a recent craze for lookalike competitions.",
      "It all started with the Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet competition in New York three weeks ago, which even attracted the real actor himself.",
      "Since then, similar contests have attracted crowds of young people hoping to get a glimpse of someone who vaguely resembles Harry Styles, Dev Patel or Paul Mescal.",
      "With eternal bragging rights, five minutes of fame and (paltry) cash prizes up for grabs, the winners and organisers explain why these events have taken off.",
      "'It was a free event, why wouldn't I go?'",
      "Our fascination with celebrity lookalikes is nothing particularly new - Stars in Their Eyes, a show in which amateur lookalikes impersonate singers, ran on ITV for 16 years. The format was revived as Starstruck in 2022.",
      "But the latest competitions all have one thing in common: the celebrities are all young, attractive and male.",
      "Avani Johnson, who was at the Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet contest, says she believes the latest trend has taken off because \"women are relishing the opportunity to objectify men in a complete switch in power dynamics\".",
      "She adds that it also gives us a chance \"to laugh at the absurdity of pageantry\".",
      "Miles Mitchell, a 20-year-old student, picked up the prize for the best Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet lookalike last month at the competition that set this trend alight.",
      "Miles was first told he looked like Chalamet when studying in South Korea.",
      "\"I was there at the time Dune was released, so people kept asking me in shops and restaurants if I was Timoth\u00e9e on a press tour.\"",
      "He says he was drawn to the competition because, as a university student in New York, \"socialising can be really expensive so my friends and I loved the fact this was a free and fun event\".",
      "\"It was also just something a bit different and wacky that I wanted to be part of.\"",
      "The event took social media by storm, with one person commenting on X it was \"a historic pop culture moment\", while another said the competition \"shows that the people yearn for weird town events\".",
      "Although the real Timoth\u00e9e turned up and took pictures with some of the lookalikes, Miles didn't get a chance to meet the American actor.",
      "\"He arrived at the same time the police did to shut down the event so I had already moved to the secondary location for the event. I'm gutted I didn't get to meet him.\"",
      "'I entered the contest for publicity'",
      "Oscar Journeaux, a 22-year-old musician, recently won a Harry Styles lookalike competition in central London and admits he entered \"for publicity\".",
      "\"I thought I could get a bit of fame and promo for my music and the industry is so hard to break into, you really have to get yourself out there.\"",
      "Oscar, who says he once missed his train because an insistent fan made him sign an autograph, adds: \"People want to think there's a deeper meaning to these events, but really we're all just bored millennials and Gen Z looking for something to do.\"",
      "Keenan Gregor, who entered as a blond Harry, says he went along because he \"wanted to be part of something that could go viral\".",
      "Journalist Katrina Mirpuri says she organised the lookalike contest because \"people need to have some fun after all the dreary news we're having\".",
      "Despite worrying that \"no-one would turn up\", she says half of Soho Square was packed with lookalikes and fans.",
      "Even though most of the contestants didn't quite look like Harry, \"the girls were screaming for each man as they got up to twirl, so they were doing something right\".",
      "\"Really it wasn't about who looked most like Harry,\" Katrina explains. \"It was a way for people to just be positive and celebratory about each other, which is what we need when everyone is so nasty and negative on social media.\"",
      "She has now got her eye on hosting another competition but this time \"for someone older, like Hugh Grant\".",
      "'I made new friends at the contest'",
      "Jaipreet Hundal had a pretty good weekend when he was crowned the most convincing Dev Patel lookalike in San Francisco.",
      "\"The best bit was that when I turned up, some people thought I was the real Dev Patel and they were so excited that he had come to the event,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "The 25-year-old says looking like the Slumdog Millionaire actor has \"given him a glimpse of what it's like to be a celebrity\".",
      "He explains that the trend is popular now because \"it's a great way to get people together to have a wholesome time\".",
      "Sudev Namboodiri, who drove hours to enter the competition and gets told he looks like Dev on an almost daily basis, says it \"wasn't about winning\".",
      "\"It's nice to meet new people and it was cool that hundreds of young people decided to turn up and hang out.\"",

      "'I don't get called my real name any more'",
      "Julyus Odreman has spent a decade being mistaken for Zayn Malik, but cannot see it himself because he says he is \"nowhere near as handsome\".",
      "Julyus, from Venezuela, says his friends think he looks so much like Zayn that \"people don't even call me by my real name any more\".",
      "The resemblance to the former One Direction star means he often gets \"stopped by groups of girls on the subway or the street\".",

      "But John Lewis has hit a \"more traditional\" feel, she added, after last year\u2019s advert  proved divisive.",
      "Its 2023 commercial featured a giant Venus flytrap. It left some viewers perplexed, as they questioned what a bloodthirsty plant had to do with Christmas.",
      "In this year's John Lewis advert, the heroine, Sally, is seen frantically doing last-minute shopping for her sister.",
      "She falls through a rack of dresses and finds herself in a fantastical world, where she revisits moments in her life - from childhood through to teenage years and adulthood.",
      "There are no recognisable celebrities in the advert, something Charlotte Lock, customer director at John Lewis, told the BBC was deliberate.",
      "\"We get contacted every year by A-listers who want to be in our ad,\" she said.",

      "\"The cost of living is still on people's minds, and people are concerned about the cost of Christmas,\" she said.",
      "\"It feels like there's a nation that's quite exhausted and actually has been waiting to celebrate, and Christmas is a great outlet for that,\" she added.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 12:43:50 GMT",
    "summary": "Tickets go on sale this week, so here are some tips to maximise your chances of securing entry.",
    "story": [
      "Tickets for the Glastonbury Festival go on sale this week, with millions of fans expected to fight it out for a chance to attend the event, which will run from 25-29 June 2025.",
      "No headliners have been announced yet, but demand is expected to be higher than ever because the festival will take a year off in 2026.",
      "Last year, all 210,000 tickets sold out in just 58 minutes as more than 2.5 million people tried to log on and secure a place.",
      "\"There aren't enough tickets for everybody,\" organiser Emily Eavis told the BBC's Sidetracked podcast earlier this year. \"It's one of the worst parts of the job [because] we can't do anything about it. We definitely can't do two weekends.",
      "\"But a lot of the time,\" she added, \"people who really, really want to come often get tickets through volunteering or through competitions.\"",
      "So there's always hope... But if you're brave enough to run the gauntlet of the online ticketing system, here are a few tips that might (might) help improve your chances.",
      "READ NEXT: Glastonbury 2025 tickets go on sale",
      "1) Check your registration",
      "As part of an ongoing (and successful) campaign to stop touts, anyone who wants to attend Glastonbury has to be registered in advance.",
      "The registration window closed on Monday, 11 November - so if you're not on the list already, it's too late.",
      "Everyone else is urged to check their details in advance, to make sure everything is up to date.",
      "You will need to have the registration number and postcode for each person you are buying a ticket for when the sale begins.",
      "2) Decide between coach or general entry",
      "Glastonbury tickets come in two flavours - standard weekend tickets and coach weekend tickets.",
      "Weekend tickets mean you can arrive under your own steam by train or car - although beware Glastonbury's legendary tailbacks, and how depleted your energy levels might be on the way home.",
      "Coach tickets are more environmentally friendly and, according to some, increase your chances of success, depending on how remote your starting point is. However, it's important to note that festival tickets are distributed on the coach itself, so you can't cheat the system.",
      "Ticket and coach packages will go on sale at 18:00 GMT on Thursday, 14 November.",
      "General admission tickets will go on sale at 09:00 on Sunday, 17 November.",
      "3) Team up with your friends",
      "You can purchase up to six tickets once you reach the booking stage, as long as you have the registration details for each attendee.",
      "Logically, the more people trying for tickets, the better the chances are of securing a space - so make sure all six of you are trying to log on when tickets go on sale (NB not in the same house... see below for why).",
      "Your syndicate doesn't have to be formed of people you're physically going to the festival with. It can be friends, colleagues, aunts, uncles, neighbours or Chris Martin from Coldplay. The point is that you're working together.",
      "Make a group chat so you can co-ordinate your efforts and, most importantly, put all of your registration numbers and postcodes in a shared document so the first person to reach the front of the queue is ready.",
      "4) Don't fall for scam websites",
      "The demand for Glastonbury tickets inevitably attracts scam artists and fraudsters, who prey on people's desperation to separate them from their money.",
      "Tickets are sold exclusively at glastonbury.seetickets.com. Avoid the temptation of buying from elsewhere.",
      "5) Log on early",
      "This year, Glastonbury has introduced a new queueing system that requires you to log on in advance.",
      "That way, when the ticket sale starts, you will be randomly assigned a place in the queue.",
      "People who join later will automatically be placed at the back of the line, so it pays to be punctual.",
      "Also, 09:00 on Sunday isn't the most sociable time of the week. Set an alarm. Set multiple alarms. Get an insomniac friend to come over to your house and poke you with a stick. Whatever works.",
      "If it's possible (and I apologise for this in advance), you could even drag yourself into work. No matter how good your wifi is at home, a work computer could have a more stable connection.",
      "6) Don't use multiple devices",
      "Using multiple devices and browser tabs can result in errors and may even get you kicked out of the queue, which you definitely don't want.",
      "Sticking to one device per household also makes the process more fair, according to the Glastonbury website.",
      "\"Whilst we understand that everyone wants to have the best possible chance of booking a ticket, running multiple devices simultaneously to attempt to access the website is a waste of valuable resources, and doesn\u2019t reflect the ethos of the festival.",
      "\"Please stick to one device and one tab, so that you can focus on entering your details without confusing your browser and help us make the ticket sale as quick and stress free as possible for all.\"",
      "7) Familiarise yourself with the booking process",
      "A limited number of people will be given access to the booking system at any one time. Before that, you will be held in a queue.",
      "When (or if) you get through, you will be asked to enter the registration number and postcode for the lead booker and up to five other people. Copy and paste them, instead of entering manually, to avoid errors.",
      "When you proceed, the next page will summarise the details you entered. Check them carefully because they cannot be changed.",
      "If you are booking a coach package, the next step will be to choose the time, date and place you will depart from. It is only possible to book tickets from one departure town in a single transaction.",
      "Once that's all confirmed, you will be asked to enter payment details.",
      "8) Have your payment information ready",

    "published": "Wed, 13 Nov 2024 03:55:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Before Tupac's murder, producer Quincy Jones brought stars together to try to end violence in hip-hop.",
    "story": [
      "Before the east and west coast rap beef of the 1990s boiled over with the murders of Tupac Shakur and Notorious BIG, legendary producer Quincy Jones called a secret meeting at which he appealed for an end to the violence.",
      "As hip-hop rose from the streets to the mainstream in the 90s, the rappers and hustlers that broke through had few role models who had trodden that path before them.",
      "There was one man, though, who had been there, and done pretty much everything.",
      "Quincy Jones had been in gangs and had been stabbed at the age of seven in 1930s Chicago, before becoming a major force in American music thanks to his work with legends like Ray Charles, Frank Sinatra and Michael Jackson.",
      "He was at the heart of revolutions in jazz, swing, soul, funk, disco and pop - but one aspect of his career that got less attention when he died last week at the age of 91 was his place in hip-hop.",
      "Jones was revered in all corners of music, including rap. Unlike most in the old guard and the media, he immediately realised the scene's artistic and cultural importance.",
      "Hip-hop reminded him of the bebop jazz of his youth. \"I feel a kinship there because we went through a lot of the same stuff,\" he said.",
      "\"Quincy understood it and got it right away,\" says pioneering artist, rapper and presenter Fab 5 Freddy.",
      "Jones worked with leading rappers in the 80s, and in the 90s he recognised risks including a volatile rivalry that had begun to erupt between competing labels and stars.",
      "So he brought artists, executives and elder black American statesmen together for a secret summit in 1995, hoping it would be a turning point.",
      "The east coast was hip-hop's spiritual home. In 1992, Sean Combs - then known as Puffy and later as P Diddy - launched his Bad Boy record label in New York with artists including Notorious BIG, aka Biggie Smalls.",
      "Meanwhile, across America, Los Angeles was coming into its own as the capital of gangsta rap, led by menacing mogul Suge Knight's Death Row Records, which had Dr Dre and Tupac.",
      "In 1994, Tupac was shot and injured during a robbery in the lobby of a studio. He later implied that his former friend Biggie may have known about the attack in advance. Biggie then released the track Who Shot Ya?, which Tupac thought was about him.",
      "The beef continued at the Source magazine awards on 3 August 1995, when Knight goaded Combs and Bad Boy Records from the stage.",
      "Jones, who had his own magazine, Vibe, held his summit three weeks later.",
      "Quincy Jones: From 'street rat' to music mastermind",
      "Quincy Jones: His brilliance explained in 10 songs",
      "'He changed my life': Stars remember Quincy Jones",
      "The brewing east-west beef wasn't the only reason Jones called it - it was mainly intended to discuss the state of hip-hop and let the new generation hear life and business advice from a group of highly successful black executives.",
      "But rap's negative image and the burgeoning tensions were a big talking point.",
      "\"He knew this was a bubbling issue, and so his idea was to bring together a symposium,\" says Fab 5 Freddy, who was hosting Yo! MTV Raps at the time and was the event's moderator.",
      "Jones told the summit: \"The thing that really provoked me to say it's time to pay attention now is Tupac.\"",
      "Tupac was missing, however - he was in jail for sexual assault at the time. Suge and Dre were there, as were Combs and Biggie.",
      "Jones had already experienced his own beef with Tupac - the rapper criticised the producer in a 1993 edition of Source for marrying white women.",
      "\"We finally hooked up, even though it was tension conditions in the beginning,\" Jones said at the event.",
      "\"We finally talked to each other, and he said nobody had talked to him like that before.",
      "\"And I said, I can't take it any more. Because we can no longer afford to be non-political, and I'm talking to the hip-hop nation now.\"",
      "About 50 influential artists and executives were in the room, including Public Enemy's Chuck D, members of A Tribe Called Quest, MC Lyte, Kris Kross, Jermaine Dupri and Boyz n the Hood film-maker John Singleton.",
      "Jones wrote in his now-out-of-print 2001 autobiography: \"I had been concerned about the potentially volatile diversity of a group who'd never been in the same room together.\"",
      "They were joined by veteran executives Clarence Avant and Ahmet Ertegun, plus Colin Powell, the former national security adviser and head of the US military who would go on to become the first African-American secretary of state.",
      "Powell had presidential ambitions - that was why the summit was held in secret. Jones wanted to save Powell from being associated with the negative publicity that surrounded rap music.",
      "He switched venues at the last minute to throw press off the scent, and confiscated the recordings.",
      "\"Rest assured that my discretion is based on a deep respect for you and a valued friendship,\" Jones wrote to Powell in an unpublished letter held at Indianapolis University Library.",
      "\"I know that we are going to make a difference at this conference. Thanks for the way you handled the situation. Maybe we can turn the battleship an inch or two.\"",
      "Jones later wrote in his book: \"Some of the younger rappers didn't even know who he was. When addressing some of the more confrontational comments from the floor, Powell maintained his South Bronx demeanour and authoritative cool throughout.\"",
      "Fab 5 Freddy remembers one exchange between Powell and Knight. \"There was an encounter where he [Knight] had something to say, and Colin Powell responded.",
      "\"Here you have this guy who was a four-star general talking to Suge Knight, and he pretty much put Suge in his place.\"",
      "Jones finally released a clip of the event for a 2018 Netflix documentary about his life.",
      "\"We've got to seriously talk about what you are going to deal with,\" he is seen telling the assembled attendees.",
      "\"They are not playing, there's real bullets out there, believe me. Maybe literally and figuratively.",
      "\"It's a very emotional thing,\" he added, his voice cracking. \"I want to see you guys live to at least my age.\"",
      "\"Quincy did get emotional,\" Fab 5 Freddy recalls, \"because he sensed what could happen.",
      "\"And the worst, unfortunately, did happen.\"",
      "Who was Tupac Shakur?",
      "Ex-gang leader pleads not guilty to Tupac murder",
      "Diddy accused of 'revenge' rape over Tupac claims",
      "Jones had ended up reconciling with Tupac. After Tupac's 1993 comments, Jones's 17-year-old daughter Rashida - who would go on to star in US sitcom The Office - wrote an irate letter to Source attacking the rapper.",
      "When Tupac bumped into one of Jones's other daughters, Kidada, he apologised, thinking she was Rashida. But Tupac and Kidada hit it off and began a relationship.",
      "\"Though we got off to a rocky start, as I came to know and feel him I saw his enormous potential and sensitivity as an artist and as a human being,\" Quincy Jones wrote.",
      "There have also been claims that Tupac was planning to leave Death Row for Jones's record label.",
      "But in September 1996, a year after the summit, Tupac was shot and killed.",
      "A former gang leader, Duane \"Keffe D\" Davis, was charged with his murder last year. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Then in 1997, Notorious BIG was shot dead outside a party thrown by Jones's record label and magazine. No-one has ever been charged.",
      "Meanwhile, today Knight is in prison for a hit-and-run, while Combs is awaiting trial on charges of racketeering and sex trafficking, which he denies.",
      "The violence in the 90s \"wasn't necessary\" and was caused by \"wannabes and gang-related troublemakers\" on the edges of the music industry, according to Fab 5 Freddy.",
      "\"Also, the east/west coast beef was mainly ignited by jealousy. It was an ashtray fire fanned into a big deal by media outlets that led to Biggie and Tupac getting killed.\"",
      "Despite his stature, not even Jones could alter the forces of power and pride that were at work and prevent the bloodshed.",
      "Freddy believes some lessons were learned at the summit, however, and that it deserves a place in hip-hop history.",
      "\"It was incredible and electric to be in that room.",
      "\"It was a thrilling moment. And then it became even more legendary because it was never released, so the only people that really knew about it were the people that were there.\""

      "On Wednesday, the Spanish-language musical is released worldwide on Netflix as the film awards race continues to heat up ahead of the Oscars in March.",
      "Selena Gomez, Zoe Salda\u00f1a, Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n and Adriana Paz launched the movie at the London Film Festival last month, where it continued to build its momentum.",
      "Emilia P\u00e9rez follows a dangerous Mexican Cartel leader (played by Gasc\u00f3n), who asks a high-powered lawyer named Rita (Salda\u00f1a) to help him fake his own death.",
      "But the reason he wants to retire and disappear from the world of crime isn't what you might expect - the drug baron wants to change gender and live a new life as a woman.",
      "The rest of the film focuses on four women, including the newly-transitioned Emilia P\u00e9rez, as they each pursue their own version of happiness in modern-day Mexico.",
      "P\u00e9rez is portrayed by Spanish trans actress Gasc\u00f3n, who has been tipped as a possible best actress contender in the forthcoming awards race.",
      "French director Jacques Audiard came up with the idea for the film after reading a chapter in Boris Razon's 2018 novel \u00c9coute about a drug lord who changes identity.",
      "Audiard went one step further for the film, and made it a story of changing gender.",
      "\"I was less interested in a change of identity to evade competitor drug barons, and more interested in the change of identity for the sake of the person she was and is,\u201d the director tells BBC News. \"I was more interested in the past and what led to that transition.\"",
      "The role required someone very specific \u2013 a trans actress, who was a Spanish speaker, who could also sing and dance.",
      "Recalling the casting process, Gasc\u00f3n explains: \u201cI was contacted when I was in Mexico by a production team, and was told 'We need an actress as crazy as you - you're the only one who can do this role, but you need to learn five songs for tomorrow!'",
      "\u201cAnd I was like 'OK, let's record the whole album and we'll go on tour as soon as you want!\u2019\" she jokes. \u201cBut I did say, \u2018this is going to be difficult, I'm not a singer'. But the team in the film, they worked with me incredibly, they really helped me with all the songs and made it so that we could do the best work possible.\u201d",
      "Asked about Gasc\u00f3n's casting, Audiard adds simply: \u201cWithout her, there would be no film.\u201d",
      "Interestingly, Gasc\u00f3n campaigned to play both the male and female roles \u2013 in other words, the character both before and after transition.",
      "Audiard had originally intended for a different actor to play the male drug lord Manitas, because, the director explains, he was \"uncomfortable asking [Gasc\u00f3n] to revisit something she was moving away from\".",
      "But, Gasc\u00f3n recalled: \u201cI said to Jacques, I want to play this role in the complete arc, because for me it is important to do the full part. It wouldn't be the same film if another actor played [Manitas].\"",
      "That meant using effects and make-up such as a fake beard, so she could play the drug baron in the first section of the musical.",
      "\"This film is this film because the same actress played the complete performance,\" Gasc\u00f3n continues. \"It's that kind of role you have once in your life and I didn't want to lose the opportunity to play this.\u201d",
      "The ongoing debate about whether actors should have lived experience of characters they play is complex, and Gasc\u00f3n herself says: \"I prefer that all actors have the full opportunities. When you chose this career, it's because you want to express another life that's not like your life.",
      "\"But,\" she continues, \"obviously when you are closer to the role of the character, it's better. In this case, I think it's beautiful, because I give all of myself to this role.\"",
      "Gasc\u00f3n has been described as a \"wonderful discovery\" by the Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney, who said she gives \"a magnificent performance\".",
      "\"The warmth, the joyous self-realisation, the complexity and authenticity... that illuminate her characterisation no doubt owe much to the parallels in the Spanish star\u2019s life - in her own words, she was an actor before becoming an actress, a father before becoming a mother.\"",
      "Gomez plays the drug lord's wife, who is kept in the dark about her former lover's new identity, while Paz portrays Emilia's new romantic interest after transitioning.",
      "Reviews of Emilia P\u00e9rez, which is released on Netflix next month, have been generally positive so far.",
      "\"It's a wild, gritty, glitter-soaked ride that defies convention and classification,\" said Entertainment Weekly's Maureen Lee Lenker.",
      "She praised the film's performances, commenting: \"Selena Gomez is a welcome surprise, shedding any remaining hints of her Disney Channel origins in her portrayal of a hard-loving wife of a narco.",
      "\"The film's climax in particular allows Gomez to shine as a dramatic actress in new ways. She conveys heartache and anguish through a tortured physicality that propels her into the unpredictable state of a woman on the verge of something dangerous.\"",
      "Asked by the BBC's Graham Norton if it was comfortable going back to the world of singing and dancing for the musical, Gomez said: \"No, because this was completely different.",
      "\"It was intricate dance moves I never knew my body could do, and it was also me playing a character so if anything I tried to avoid what I was comfortable with.\"",
      "The Telegraph's Tim Robey described the film as \"amazingly confident \u2013 it\u2019s clever, earnest, ridiculous, knowing, forceful and absolutely bonkers\", while Hoai-Tran Bui of Inverse said it was \"an emotionally fulfilling triumph\".",
      "Not all critics were as enthusiastic about the film, however.",
      "\"Emilia P\u00e9rez was originally intended to be an opera, which perhaps partly explains its saccharine sentimentality, repetitive lyrics, and diverging story branches. But that doesn\u2019t excuse its almost random, whiplash-inducing tonal pivots,\" said Slant's Kyle Turner.",
      "However, Lauren Bradshaw of Fangirl Freakout said: \"Emilia P\u00e9rez is a magnificent, genre-bending thrill ride that transcends the typical movie construct, breathing a fresh burst of excitement into the way we think about film.\"",
      "As an actress, Gomez is best known for starring in Only Murders in the Building, but also has a successful singing career with hits including Back To You, Wolves and Love You Like a Love Song.",
      "Her co-star Salda\u00f1a, meanwhile, has starred in a large number of blockbusters in the last two decades, with roles in the Avatar and Guardians of the Galaxy franchises.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Emilia P\u00e9rez could be a big awards player, but Academy voters may see an opportunity to recognise Salda\u00f1a's box office success via this more critically acclaimed work.",
      "Their co-star Adriana Paz is a Mexican actress whose credits include Not Forgotten, Hilda and La Caridad, while Gasc\u00f3n also had a successful acting career before transitioning in 2018.",
      "Emilia P\u00e9rez has already been selected as France's entry for the best international feature category at the Oscars, which take place in March.",
      "But despite the film's awards traction, Paz tells BBC News: \u201cI never think about that, really. I get into a project because I'm interested in the topic, character, director or actors, you do it because it really matters to you.\u201d",
      "She adds that the attention in recent months is unlike anything she's experienced in her career. \"It's been a lot,\" she says, \"because I've been working in Spain and have a long career in Mexico, and people have a recognition of my work, but not like [it's been] since Cannes.",
      "\"In my country they feel very proud of me, and there was a lot of people that didn't know about my work, and now thanks to Emilia they are getting to know my work... and they see 'we feel so proud as Mexicans that you won this award.'\"",
      "After the success of Emilia Perez, Paz says she would \"love to\" appear in more musicals in future, and loves singing.",
      "But Gasc\u00f3n has a slightly different take. \"I don't like musicals!\" she laughs, adding that she hopes casting directors aren't too enthusiastic about her performance.",
      "\"I don't like to sing, I don't want to be compared to Shakira or something like that, and I don't like dancing, so please don't call me!\"",

    "story": [
      "Folic acid is to be added to non-wholemeal wheat flour in the UK to help prevent birth defects.",
      "Adding folic acid to flour could prevent around 200 cases of neural tube defects, such as spina bifida, every year, and improve the health of pregnant women, says the government, which is giving manufacturers until the end of 2026 to conform to the new legal requirement.",
      "Expectant mothers and women trying to conceive should continue to take supplementary folic acid -  the synthetic version of the vitamin folate - as currently advised by medical practioners.",
      "Folic acid is particularly important in early pregnancy, aiding proper development of the baby's brain, skull and spinal cord.",
      "Experts, many of whom have called for the move for a number of years, have welcomed the government's decision.",
      "The announcement follows health improvements in other countries, such as Australia and Canada, where the practice is already carried out.",
      "Some say the change doesn't go far enough, however, and more foods should be included.",
      "Prof Neena Modi, professor of neonatal medicine at Imperial College London, said: \"This will disadvantage groups such as women who are sensitive to gluten, eat rice in preference to bread, and products made from wholemeal flour - excluding them and their babies from benefiting, and thus adding to the considerable health inequities that already exist in the UK.\"",
      "The vitamin folate, also known as vitamin B9, is found in everyday foods such as beans and some green vegetables, meaning most people receive a sufficient dose  from eating a regular, healthy diet.",
      "In addition, the NHS recommends women who are trying for a baby take folic acid supplements for approximately three months before getting pregnant, and for at least 12 weeks after becoming pregnant. This recommendation will remain in place.",
      "It is estimated that half of all pregnancies in the UK are unplanned. The fortification of flour will therefore help boost intake of folic acid across the population, and, indirectly, better protect unborn babies.",
      "The government's independent advisory body has looked at all the evidence and is satisfied that fortification is the right course of action for society as a whole.",
      "Small-scale millers (producing less than 500 metric tonnes of flour a year) will be exempt.",

    "story": [
      "Davina McCall is recovering from surgery she underwent to remove a rare brain tumour, her partner has said.",
      "The TV presenter, 57, earlier posted a video on Instagram to say she had been diagnosed with a type of benign tumour called a colloid cyst.",
      "In an update on Friday evening, Michael Douglas said McCall was \"out of surgery\" and recovering in hospital - and thanked well-wishers \"for all the love\". He added that McCall was \"utterly exhausted\".",
      "A benign tumour is not cancerous, but such cysts tend to grow slowly, according to the Brainstrust charity.",
      "In the statement, shared to McCall's 1.9 million Instagram followers, Douglas said a doctor had described the procedure as being \"textbook\".",
      "Prior to the surgery, McCall explained how the tumour had been found by chance.",
      "\"A few months ago, I did a menopause talk for a company and they offered me a health scan in return, which I thought I was going to ace,\" she said in the video.",
      "\"But it turned out I had a benign brain tumour called a colloid cyst, which is very rare - three in a million.",
      "\"And so I slightly put my head in the sand for a while, and then I saw quite a few neurosurgeons. I got lots of opinions, and I realised that I have to get it taken out.",
      "\"It's big for the space. It fills the space. It's 14mm wide, and it needs to come out because if it grows, it would be bad. So I'm having it removed via a craniotomy.\"",
      "A craniotomy is an operation where a surgeon removes part of the skull to take out the tumour.",
      "\"Get the cyst, empty it, take it out, Bob's your uncle,\" McCall said.",
      "Speaking alongside her partner Douglas, she added: \"I'm OK. It's been up and down, obviously. We've been through a lot, yes.\"",
      "She said she expected to spend about nine days in hospital after the operation.",
      "She told followers: \"I don't want you to worry about me. I'm doing that enough.",
      "\"But I'm not worrying too much and I am in a good space. I have all the faith in the world in my surgeon and his team, and I am handing the reins over to him.",
      "\"He knows what he's doing, and I'm going to do the getting better bit after. I'll see you on the other side.\"",
      "Douglas said then that he would temporarily take over her social media.",
      "What are colloid cysts?",
      "They typically form in a fluid-filled cavity in the centre of the brain, and are themselves filled with fluid, the Brains Trust says.",

      "Extra beds and staff would have been used to cut waiting lists for planned care and \u201cbuild resilience\u201d going into a second winter wave of the pandemic, she said.",
      "The government has said it cannot comment while the inquiry is in progress.",
      "Health ministers from the time are expected to give evidence later this month, to the third section of the inquiry, looking at Covid's impact on the NHS and healthcare systems across the UK.",
      "Ms Pritchard served as NHS England\u2019s chief operating officer from 2019 until she was promoted to chief executive, in August 2021.",
      "In her evidence, she said a request had been made to the government, for 10,000 extra permanent, staffed hospital beds, in July 2020.",
      "\u2018Very disappointing\u2019",
      "The demand had been based on modelling the spread of the virus, along with the need to deal with other pressures that coming winter and resume more planned, or elective, surgery and other treatments for non-Covid patients.",
      "But the inquiry heard the Treasury and the prime minister\u2019s private office had refused the request, saying they wanted more use made of temporary Nightingale hospitals along with the private sector.",
      "And Ms Prichard had been told the decision would be looked at again as part of a wider spending review expected in the autumn of 2021.",
      "She called the decision \u201cvery disappointing\u201d, saying waiting lists for planned NHS treatment in England would be in \u201cquite a different position\u201d today had the extra funding been agreed.",
      "\u201cIf we had had that capacity, we could certainly have treated thousands more patients\u2026 as well as being more resilient going into the second wave of the pandemic and into winter more generally,\u201d Ms Prichard said.",
      "In the summer of 2020, the NHS in England had a total permanent bed capacity to treat about 95,000 patients in acute hospitals.",
      "That was increased by another 4,000 from winter 2023, under a recovery plan agreed by then Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.",
      "\u2018Completely overwhelming\u2019",
      "Later in her evidence, Ms Pritchard said the health service had faced a period of \u201cextreme pressure\u201d in the winter of 2020-21, as another wave of Covid spread across the country.",
      "By that point, new treatments had been discovered, including the cheap steroid dexamethasone, and the first Covid vaccines were starting to be rolled out in small numbers.",
      "But the level of community transmission at the time meant some intensive-care units were still being pushed \u201cto the brink\u201d and were \u201cright on the edge\u201d of running out of bed space.",
      "Nationally, the health service had never had to \u201csystematically limit\u201d access to treatments because hospitals could not cope with demand, Ms Pritchard said.",
      "\u201cThat does not mean, though, that it did not feel completely overwhelming to staff at this time in those places - and it does not mean that the kind of care that was being provided was anything like normal,\u201d she added.",
      "'Field hospitals'",
      "Ms Pritchard was also asked about the seven temporary Nightingale hospitals built quickly, in March and April 2020, across England to treat Covid patients.",
      "Data seen by the inquiry shows the total cost to the taxpayer, including setting up and decommissioning, is now estimated at \u00a3358.5m.",
      "The hospitals \u2013 in Birmingham, Bristol, Exeter, Harrogate, London, Manchester and Sunderland \u2013 treated 141 Covid patients in the first wave of the virus and 1,097 Covid and other patients in the second wave.",
      "In total, \u00a350.4m was spent on one site, Birmingham, which was never used by patients in the pandemic.",
      "The site in Bristol also carried out 6,554 assessments for patients from the eye hospital in the city.",
      "Ms Pritchard told the inquiry the programme had still been \u201cuseful\u201d, as the sites had been envisaged as \u201cmilitary field hospitals\u201d at the time.",
      "\u201cWe thought we were doing it to avoid a northern Italy situation,\u201d she said, referring to scenes in Lombardy, where intensive-care units had been overwhelmed.",

      "\"I don't know,\" he says. \"There was never anything that was explicit to say that, but I certainly felt a threat.\"",
      "Wragg also concedes that amidst the intoxication of possible romance he felt \"a sense of wanting to please\" \u2018Charlie\u2019. He ended up handing over around a dozen phone numbers, including for a number of MPs.",

      "\"When I found out some of the things that had been going on, I just felt enormous guilt, enormous remorse,\" he tells me. \"My mood just plummeted.\"",
      "Wragg had struggled with his mental health in the past and had already stopped taking his antidepressants, which he considers a factor in the suicidal thoughts which led him to be admitted to hospital.",
      "The Westminster catfishing operation was sophisticated, and had been under way for many months before Wragg became involved. But he concedes that his actions led to friends and colleagues also becoming victims.",
      "Wragg says he feels \"great regret\" and has \"sought to apologise\", adding: \"I hope I can explain it in the context of the almost sense of control, the influence this person had over me.\"",
      "However, one former MP who believes his number was passed on by Wragg told the BBC: \"None of us to my recollection have ever received an apology from Will\u2026 It might be an idea for him to apologise to those he dropped in the dirt.\"",
      "Contrary to some early speculation, police have said they do not think any other foreign state was involved. In June a member of the Labour Party in his mid-20s was arrested in London on suspicion of harassment and offences under the Online Safety Act. He has been bailed until late November.",
      "Seven months on from the height of the scandal, Wragg has left the world of Westminster behind. He is much happier, he says, but still talks of the \"shame\" he feels and the \"havoc\" the catfisher wrought.",
      "\"I have no bitterness or anger left in me,\" he says, when I ask how he feels about the catfisher. \"Because I felt so wretched and awful in myself.\"",
      "He believes they were motivated by sexual kicks and by the power they held over others.",
      "\"My only wish for them is not to do it any more,\" he says. \"And to understand that impersonating or pretending to be somebody\u2026 it's not victimless. It is very real and its psychological impact is particularly strong.\"",
      "Wragg hopes by speaking out he may help others to spot the signs of catfishing, and report it. ActionFraud has received almost 7,500 reports of dating scams so far this year.",
      "\"It\u2019s a source of great shame that my time in Parliament ended in this way,\" he says.",
      "On his final day as an MP, Wragg had a consultation with a psychologist, which he jokes is \"a fitting summation\" of his nine years in the Commons.",
      "\"They have two mental health beds available at any one time for members of Parliament. And it's surprising how often they're occupied.\"",
      "The trauma of recent months has undoubtedly damaged his interest in dating. Does he think he\u2019ll find love? \"I hope so, yes,\" he says. \"But I'm being a bit more guarded at the moment.\"",

      "A report found \"corners [were] cut\" so the site could be acquired quickly to house asylum seekers despite an assessment deeming it \"high risk\".",
      "The Home Office said the report related to the last government's actions and it remained \"committed to ending the use of hotels\".",

    "summary": "Multiple sources say the Treasury is deeply nervous about the cost of fixing social care, and that the PM is yet to decide how to proceed.",
    "story": [
      "Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s first five months have produced little sign of a plan for Labour\u2019s promised National Care Service \u2013 and now I\u2019m told there is a \u201cgenuine impasse\u201d at the top of government over what to do about social care.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting publicly acknowledges \u201cwe can\u2019t solve the NHS crisis\u201d without improving what a government source describes as an \u201cappalling\u201d situation, in a system that\u2019s meant to look after vulnerable and elderly adults in England.",
      "But multiple sources tell me the Treasury is deeply nervous about the cost and that the prime minister is yet to make a decision on how to proceed.",
      "Talks have so far failed to decide even whether to hold another review of the system. \u201cDither, dither, dither,\u201d said one insider involved in the discussions.",
      "But another source said: \u201cEveryone wants to fix it but we don\u2019t want to embark on something that then doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d",
      "I understand the prime minister, health secretary and the Chancellor Rachel Reeves are due to meet a week on Monday to try to make some progress.",
      "What options do they have?",
      "There is little controversy about the scale of the problem in social care, the system that helps older and disabled people with day-to-day tasks like washing, dressing, getting out of bed, eating and medication.",
      "There are as many as 500,000 people waiting for care. Council budgets are stretched, some teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, in part because of care costs. As the population ages, thousands upon thousands of people are stuck without the care they need, and thousands more stuck in hospital because there isn\u2019t the support they need at home.",
      "Labour has given little detail on what its National Care Service would look like, but long-term reform would likely aim to address the shortage of care, the length of waiting lists, and the costs for people who don't qualify for free care, which can be crippling for families.",
      "Why Starmer\u2019s NHS reforms may give you a sense of deja-vu",
      "No extra NHS funding without reform, says PM",
      "Ministers are considering whether to create a Royal Commission to look at the issue or a government-backed independent review, tipped to be led by the straight-talking Whitehall troubleshooter Dame Louise Casey.",
      "The advantage of a Royal Commission? It\u2019s not party political, so theoretically can bind every politician to back its solutions and make the warring parties work together.",
      "The downside? It could take two or three years, pushing possible fixes to the urgent problems until after the next election.",
      "An independent review of a year to 18 months could change things quicker. Without the kudos of the King, any plans would be easier for opposition politicians to reject \u2013 but Labour has a once-in-a-generation majority to vote through big reforms.",
      "There are nerves, however, at the top of government about what any review might recommend. If it suggests an expensive new system quickly, then that would need billions in extra tax. Does the government have a mandate for that in this parliamentary term, having ruled out changes to the main tax rates?",
      "If a review process took longer, would any political party want to go into the next election asking voters to pay more - even for the best of reasons, a shiny new social care system?",
      "\u2018Same old stalemate\u2019",
      "In truth, conversations about the process are only a symbol of the actual dilemma \u2013 not just what to do, but how to pay.",
      "The Department of Health wants to get on with the process. The Treasury agrees that it\u2019s a very serious problem that the government ought to fix (and people caught up in the system, often stuck in hospital, are costly to the whole NHS too). Yet the chancellor is understood to be nervous about the cost of any fix, which would run to many billions.",
      "One source told me: \u201cThe Treasury is the block.\u201d But a department insider rejects that characterisation, and says: \u201cNo one doubts the issue is huge, but any solution is expensive \u2013 everything is a trade-off.\u201d",
      "Others suggest Reeves wants reform but also wants to be sure of a full political backing from the neighbours at No 10. So it\u2019s suggested both Streeting and Reeves are looking to Sir Keir.",
      "A No 10 source told me the prime minister is \u201canimated by solving the issue and is keen to proceed\u201d, hence the meeting planned with the health secretary and chancellor in the next fortnight. The source denies the accusation of \u201cdither\u201d, saying it takes time to work out the right moves.",
      "There is no suggestion this is a bruising split between ministers.",
      "But another source familiar with the process told me: \"As soon as the election was out of the way we went back into the same old stalemate.\" In other words, the Department of Health says please, the Treasury says no, and No 10 wants more time to think.",
      "\u2018It\u2019s almost too late\u2019",
      "Inside the care sector itself, one leader says people are \u201cworn\u201d by the debate between different parts of government when the need for change is urgent. Another care source tells me \u201cit\u2019s already almost too late\u201d and is upset at how the industry has been treated so far.",
      "They say existing government plans and the decisions in the Budget have made life harder. Asking care providers to pay the extra costs of employers\u2019 national insurance means that, effectively, \u201cpublic services are charged to pay for a black hole in (you guessed it) public services\u201d, they say.",
      "The NHS itself will be exempt from those increased costs but, as things stand, not-for-profit organisations including some care charities providing public services will have to pay.",
      "Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.",
      "A group of them have written to the chancellor as part of a grassroots campaign called Providers Unite, warning the increased payments could top \u00a31bn. They have asked Reeves to look again at the changes or face \u201ca systematic collapse of community care services across Britain\u201d.",
      "The chancellor told us after the Budget she is \u201cnot immune\u201d to pleas from particular sectors, but there is no chance of her reversing the whole policy.",
      "On top of charging more National Insurance, ministers are creating a negotiating body to improve pay and conditions for care staff. While the industry is broadly supportive of that aim, it will increase costs, and many believe they just can\u2019t cover it without extra funding.",
      "There is an obvious eagerness for the government to get on with the conversation about how to fix the system that cares for the most vulnerable adults in the long term. But, wearily, a source told me conversation in the industry is \u201cso dominated by funding emergencies now, [long-term reform] is second order\u201d.",
      "Pressure builds for a decision",
      "When the prime minister, Streeting and Reeves sit down to consider what to do about social care in a week or so, don\u2019t expect a sudden revelation or a shiny new plan. One source told me \u2013 in a line worthy of the sitcom Yes Minister \u2013 that the trio might \u201cdecide to decide, decide to delay deciding, or\u2026 decide not to decide\u201d.",
      "But the pressure is building on them to make a call.",
      "While the Conservatives promised then failed multiple times to follow through with big changes to the system, the newly emboldened Lib Dems put social care right at the centre of their successful election campaign.",
      "It\u2019s the party\u2019s signature issue, and rarely a day goes by without them pursuing a political opportunity to press the case. The Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey, who will join me on tomorrow's show, said that any investment in the NHS would be an \"expensive failure\" without social care reform.",
      "\"Ministers need to get a grip, and quickly,\" he said. \"The cross-party talks we've been campaigning for should start now, but there are urgent actions the government should take regardless,\" such as a higher minimum wage for care workers.",
      "And a spokesperson for the Conservatives said: \"The Labour Party are piling on costs for social care providers and charities. The Local Government Association has warned that any extra funding will be consumed by the costs as a result of Labour\u2019s budget.\"",
      "Few in government would deny that a solution for social care is long overdue. Few in government would deny that patients are being let down, and families are being left without the support they need. And few in government would deny that Sir Keir\u2019s mission to sort out the NHS is hampered by a lack of action.",
      "A source familiar with the dilemmas told me it \u201cbeggars belief\u201d that minsters can talk about giving the NHS extra billions and promising reform without doing the same for social care.",
      "Yet nobody wants to repeat previous governments\u2019 pattern, where plans were drawn up, pitched to the public, then ditched (the Scottish Government has again shelved plans for its promised National Care Service).",

    "summary": "The chancellor says she wants to \u201cfire up the UK\u2019s economy\u201d with a \"Canadian-style\" pensions model.",
    "story": [
      "Plans for a major shake-up of pension funds have been announced by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves.",
      "She wants to create pension \"megafunds\" by merging the UK's 86 council schemes, using the set-up in Canada and Australia as a model.",
      "Other proposals suggest pension schemes need to reach a certain size or pool together. Larger funds could then be invested in UK infrastructure projects, the government says.",
      "So, will this affect people with pension savings?",
      "Which pension funds are involved?",
      "The government says the Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) can get more from investments - while tackling a \u00a32bn bill for fees - by joining together.",
      "There are 86 local government pension funds in England and Wales, which are mainly paid into by local government workers.",
      "These individually managed funds are divided by local authority, making it more costly, because each fund is paying its own management and administration fees.",
      "Between them, they have 6.5 million members and manage assets worth \u00a3354bn.",
      "The schemes are all part of the LGPS which is the seventh-largest in the world, according to the UK government.",
      "Most of its participants are low-paid women.",
      "Under Reeves\u2019 plans, the funds would be consolidated in some way, although at present it is unclear exactly how.",
      "She may ask them to pool their assets and resources, or she may ask them to merge with one another to create a smaller number of larger funds, which would benefit from greater financial firepower and fewer costs.",
      "The LGPS is a defined benefit scheme which means that, when it is time to draw their pensions, its savers get an agreed amount based on their salary, no matter what the fund is worth at the time.",
      "So drawing scheme into \"megafunds\" will make little, or no, difference to what they receive.",
      "That is different to private pension pots, which rise and fall in value depending on how investments perform.",
      "Why copy Canada and Australia?",
      "The \u201cMaple 8\u201d is a group of vast Canadian pension funds, including the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, which manages assets worth C$247.5bn (\u00a3141.8bn), and the Canada Pension Plan, whose assets are worth C$409.6bn.",
      "While UK pension schemes tend to invest more in assets like equities and bonds, their Canadian rivals focus more on private markets.",
      "The Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, for example, only has 7% of its assets in listed equities, compared with 60% for traditional pension funds.",
      "Instead, it skews its investments towards private markets, including infrastructure (including a 25% stake in British energy giant SSE), real estate and private equity deals.",
      "This kind of model is not without risk, however.",
      "The Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System is the largest investor in the troubled Thames Water, which has been highlighted by those questioning Reeves' plans.",
      "Why is bigger supposed to be better?",
      "Individually, the UK\u2019s 86 local government pension schemes vary in size, from Greater Manchester\u2019s massive \u00a330bn fund all the way down to several schemes which are \u201csub-\u00a31bn\u201d, according to Joanne Donnelly, board secretary at the Local Government Pension Scheme Advisory Board.",
      "Running these schemes costs money. Each one must pay administration, governance and management costs, which can build up \u2013 last year, they increased by \u00a328m.",
      "Like her predecessor, Jeremy Hunt, who also announced plans for a Canadian-style model, the chancellor believes consolidation would save money.",
      "That would in turn \u201cdeliver better returns for savers and unlock billions of pounds of investment\u201d.",
      "Other chancellors have aimed to make similar moves, including George Osborne who, in 2015, set out plans for local government schemes to pool resources,",
      "Does everyone agree with the idea?",
      "Tracy Blackwell, chief executive of Pension Insurance Corporation, told the BBC: \"I think by having the scale and the right expertise internally to invest in a wide range of assets, they'll be able to invest in a lot more than what they can invest in now.\"",
      "However, some argue megafunds would not invest so much in smaller projects while some claim the changes could bring risks for pension savers.",
      "\"Conflating a government goal of driving investment in the UK and people\u2019s retirement outcomes brings a danger because the risks are all taken with members\u2019 money,\" said Tom Selby at investment platform AJ Bell.",
      "He said the current system encourages trustees to deliver the best outcome for members rather than focus on UK-wide economic growth, which might mean investing outside the UK.",
      "Others question whether there are enough big UK projects to invest in.",
      "\"Large funds need substantial, reliable projects to generate returns, but the market may struggle to offer enough of these opportunities, especially in the infrastructure sector,\" said Jon Greer, head of retirement policy at wealth manager Quilter."

      "\u201cI am a little bit exhausted,\u201d she admits. \u201cI\u2019ve come here from Paris. And after here I go to Berlin, then Geneva. I\u2019m on this tour talking about the danger to the environment and some of the remedies,\u201d she says.",
      "\u2018The sixth great extinction is happening now\u2019",
      "One of the remedies she wants to talk about today is a tree-planting and habitat restoration mission that her eponymous foundation and non-profit technology company, Ecosia, are carrying out in Uganda. Over the past five years, with the help of local communities and smallholder farmers, the organisations have planted nearly two million trees.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in the midst of the sixth great extinction,\u201d Dr Goodall tells me during our interview for BBC Radio 4\u2019s Inside Science. \u201cThe more we can do to restore nature and protect existing forests, the better.\u201d",
      "The primary aim of this project is to restore the threatened habitat of Uganda\u2019s 5,000 chimpanzees. Dr Goodall has studied and campaigned to protect the primates for decades. But the activist also wants to highlight the threat that deforestation poses to our climate.",
      "\u201cTrees have to grow to a certain size before they can really do their work,\u201d she says. \u201cBut all this [tree-planting] is helping to absorb carbon dioxide.\u201d",

      "This week, world leaders have gathered in Baku, Azerbaijan, for COP29 - the latest round of UN climate talks.",

      "\u201cWe still have a window of time to start slowing down climate change and loss of biodiversity,\u201d Dr Goodall says. \u201cBut it's a window that's closing.\u201d",
      "Destruction of forests, and other wild places, she points out, is intrinsically linked to the climate crisis.",
      "\u201cSo much has changed in my lifetime,\u201d she says, recalling that in the forests of Tanzania where she began studying chimps more than 60 years ago, \u201cyou used to be able to set your calendar by the timing of the two rainy seasons\u201d.",
      "\u201cNow, sometimes it rains in the dry season, and sometimes it's dry in the wet season. It means the trees are fruiting at the wrong time, which upsets the chimpanzees, and also the insects and the birds.\u201d",
      "Over the decades that she has studied and campaigned to protect the habitat of wild chimpanzees, she says she has seen the destruction of forests across Africa: \u201cAnd I've seen the decrease in chimpanzee numbers.",
      "\u201cIf we don't get together and impose tough regulations on what people are able to do to the environment - if we don't rapidly move away from fossil fuel, if we don't put a stop to industrial farming, that's destroying the environment and killing the soil, having a devastating effect on biodiversity - the future ultimately is doomed.\u201d",
      "\u2018He looked into my eyes and squeezed my fingers\u2019",
      "Hearing her speak in this way gives me a glimpse of a toughness that belies her well-spoken, gentle demeanour. When Jane Goodall began observing and studying chimpanzees in Gombe Stream National Park in Tanzania, she was a trailblazer. Her research, now considered groundbreaking, was controversial.",
      "She was the first person to witness and document chimpanzees making and using tools \u2013 the primates prepared sticks to fish for termites. Prior to her observations, that was a trait that was thought to be uniquely human.",
      "She revealed that the animals form strong family bonds - and even that they engage in warfare over territory.",
      "But her approach \u2013 associating so closely with the animals she studied, naming them and even referring to them as \u201cmy friends\u201d was scoffed at by some (mostly male) scientists.",
      "Her supervisor and mentor, Professor Louis Leakey, though, saw the value in her technique: \u201cHe wanted somebody whose mind wasn't messed up by the reductionist attitude of science to animals,\u201d Dr Goodall explains.",
      "\u201cYou don't have a dog, a cat, a rabbit, a horse and not give them a name. It's the same as when I studied squirrels in my garden as a little girl - they all had names.\u201d",
      "Her methods \u2013 and her sense of closeness to the primates she has dedicated her life to \u2013 have given her a unique perspective.",
      "She tells me about a \u201cwonderful moment\u201d with a chimpanzee she named David Greybeard, the male chimp who she first witnessed making and using tools to catch termites. \u201cHe was the first to lose his fear of me,\u201d she recalls.",
      "\u201cI sat down near him and, lying on the ground, was the ripe red fruit of an oil palm. I held it out towards him and he turned his head away. Then I put my hand closer and he turned and looked into my eyes, reached out and very gently squeezed my fingers.",
      "\u201cThat is how chimpanzees reassure each other. We understood each other perfectly - with a gestural language that obviously predates human speech.\u201d",
      "\u2018We need to get tougher\u2019",
      "Dr Goodall\u2019s career has often been challenging. She has written about the early years of her work for Professor Leakey, who was a renowned scientist, and who had enormous influence over her career. He repeatedly declared his love for her, putting pressure on her in a way that, today, might be viewed as sexual harassment.",
      "But she spurned his advances and kept her focus on her work and her beloved chimpanzees. Now, having turned 90 this year, she does not appear to be slowing down.",

    "story": [
      "The mystery as to why a beluga whale appeared off the coast of Norway wearing a harness may finally have been solved.",
      "The tame white whale, which locals named Hvaldimir, made headlines five years ago amidst widespread speculation that it was a Russian spy.",
      "Now an expert in the species says she believes the whale did indeed belong to the military and escaped from a naval base in the Arctic Circle.",
      "But Dr Olga Shpak does not believe it was a spy. She believes the beluga was being trained to guard the base and fled because it was a \"hooligan\".",
      "Seeking sanctuary for whale dubbed a Russian spy",
      "Russia has always refused to confirm or deny that the beluga whale was trained by its military.",
      "But Dr Shpak, who worked in Russia researching marine mammals from the 1990s until she returned to her native Ukraine in 2022, told BBC News: \u201cFor me it\u2019s 100% (certain).\u201d",
      "Dr Shpak, whose account is based on conversations with friends and former colleagues, features in a BBC documentary, Secrets of the Spy Whale, which is now on BBC iPlayer and being shown on BBC Two on Wednesday at 21:00 GMT.",
      "Secrets of the Spy Whale",
      "The mysterious whale first came to public attention five years ago when it approached fishermen off the northern coast of Norway.",
      "\u201cThe whale starts rubbing against the boat,\u201d Joar Hesten, one of the fishermen, says. \u201cI heard about animals in distress that instinctively knew that they need help from humans. I was thinking that this is one smart whale.\u201d",
      "The sighting was unusual because the beluga was so tame and they're rarely seen as far south. It was also wearing a harness, which had a mount for a camera, and bore the words, in English, \u201cEquipment St Petersburg\u201d.",
      "Mr Hesten helped to remove the harness from the whale, which then swam to the nearby port of Hammerfest, where it lived for several months.",
      "Seemingly unable to catch live fish to eat, it charmed visitors by nudging at their cameras and even on one occasion returning a mobile phone.",
      "\u201cIt was very obvious that this particular whale had been conditioned to be putting his nose on anything that looked like a target because he was doing it each time,\u201d says Eve Jourdain, a researcher from the Norwegian Orca Survey.",
      "\u201cBut we have no idea what kind of facility he was in, so we don\u2019t know what he was trained for.\u201d",
      "Captivated by the whale's story Norway made arrangements for the beluga to be monitored and fed. The name it was given \u2013 Hvaldimir - is a nod to hval which is Norwegian for whale, and the name of Russia's President, Vladimir Putin.",
      "Dr Shpak did not want to name her sources in Russia for their own safety but said she had been told that when the beluga surfaced in Norway, the Russian marine mammal community immediately identified it as one of theirs.",
      "\u201cThrough the chain of vets and trainers the message came back \u2013 that they were missing a beluga called Andruha,\u201d she says.",
      "According to Dr Shpak, Andruha/Hvaldimir had first been captured in 2013 in the Sea of Okhotsk in Russia's Far East. A year later it was moved from a facility owned by a dolphinarium in St Petersburg to the military programme in the Russian Arctic, where his trainers and vets remained in contact.",
      "\u201cI believe that when they started to work in open water, trusting this animal (not to swim away), the animal just gave up on them,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cWhat I've heard from the guys at the commercial dolphinarium who used to have him was that Andruha was smart, so a good choice to be trained. But at the same time, he was kind of like a hooligan - an active beluga - so they were not surprised that he gave up on (following) the boat and went where he wanted to.\u201d",
      "Satellite images from near the Russian naval base in Murmansk show what could have been Hvaldimir/Andruha\u2019s old home. Pens can clearly be seen in the water with what appear to be white whales inside.",
      "\u201cThe location of the beluga whales very close to the submarines and the surface vessels might tell us that they are actually part of a guarding system,\u201d says Thomas Nilsen, from Norwegian online newspaper The Barents Observer.",
      "Russia, for its part, has never officially addressed the claim that Hvaldimir/Andruha was trained by its army. But it does have a long history of training marine mammals for military purposes.",
      "Speaking in 2019, a Russian reserve colonel, Viktor Baranets, said: \"If we were using this animal for spying, do you really think we'd attach a mobile phone number with the message 'Please call this number'?\"",
      "Sadly, Hvaldimir/Andruha\u2019s incredible story does not have a happy ending.",
      "Having learned to feed himself, it spent several years travelling south along Norway\u2019s coast and in May 2023 was even spotted off the coast of Sweden.",
      "Then on September 1 2024 its body was found floating at sea, near the town of Risavika, on Norway's south-western coast.",
      "Had the long arm of Putin\u2019s Russia caught up with the reluctant beluga?",
      "It appears not. Despite some activist groups suggesting that the whale had been shot, that explanation has been dismissed by the Norwegian police.",
      "They say there was nothing to suggest that human activity directly caused the beluga\u2019s death. A post-mortem examination revealed that Hvaldimir/Andruha died after a stick became lodged in his mouth."

      "The planet Uranus and its five biggest moons may not be the dead sterile worlds that scientists have long thought.",
      "Instead, they may have oceans, and the moons may even be capable of supporting life, scientists say.",
      "Much of what we know about them was gathered by Nasa\u2019s Voyager 2 spacecraft which visited nearly 40 years ago.",
      "But a new analysis shows that Voyager's visit coincided with a powerful solar storm, which led to a misleading idea of what the Uranian system is really like.",
      "Uranus is a beautiful, icy ringed world in the outer reaches of our solar system. It is among the coldest of all the planets. It is also tilted on its side compared to all the other worlds \u2013 as if it had been knocked over \u2013 making it arguably the weirdest.",
      "We got our first close-up look at it in 1986, when Voyager 2 flew past and sent back sensational pictures of the planet and its five major moons.",
      "But what amazed scientists even more was the data Voyager 2 sent back indicating that the Uranian system was even weirder than they thought.",
      "The measurements from the spacecraft\u2019s instruments indicated that the planets and moons were inactive, unlike the other moons in the outer solar system. They also showed that Uranus\u2019s protective magnetic field was strangely distorted. It was squashed and pushed away from the Sun.",
      "A planet\u2019s magnetic field traps any gases and other material coming off the planet and its moons. These might be from oceans or geological activity. Voyager 2 found none, suggesting that Uranus and its five largest moons were sterile and inactive.",
      "This came as an enormous surprise because it was unlike the solar system\u2019s other planets and their moons.",
      "But the new analysis has solved the decades-long mystery. It shows that Voyager 2 flew past on a bad day.",
      "The new research shows that just as Voyager 2 flew past Uranus, the Sun was raging, creating a powerful solar wind that might have blown the material away and temporarily distorted the magnetic field.",
      "So, for 40 years we have had an incorrect view of what Uranus and its five largest moons are normally like, according to Dr William Dunn of University College London.",
      "\u201cThese results suggest that the Uranian system could be much more exciting than previously thought. There could be moons there that could have the conditions that are necessary for life, they might have oceans below the surface that could be teeming with fish!\u201d.",
      "Linda Spilker was a young scientist working on the Voyager programme when the Uranus data came in. She is now still serving as the project scientist for the Voyager missions. She said that she was delighted to hear about the new results, which have been published in the Journal Nature Astronomy.",
      "\u201cThe results are fascinating, and I am really excited to see that there is potential for life in the Uranian system,\u201d she told BBC News.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m also so pleased that so much is being done with the Voyager data. It\u2019s amazing that scientists are looking back at the data we collected in 1986 and finding new results and new discoveries\u201d.",
      "Dr Affelia Wibisono of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, who is independent of the research team, described the results as \u201cvery exciting\u201d.",
      "\u201cIt shows how important it is to look back at old data, because sometimes, hiding behind them is something new to be discovered, which can help us design the next generation of space exploration missions\u201d.",
      "Which is exactly what Nasa is doing, partly as a result of the new research.",
      "It has been nearly 40 years since Voyager 2 last flew past the icy world and its moons. Nasa has plans to launch a new mission, the Uranus Orbiter and Probe, to go back for a closer look in 10 years\u2019 time.",
      "According to Nasa\u2019s Dr Jamie Jasinski, whose idea it was to re-examine the Voyager 2 data, the mission will need to take his results into account when designing its instruments and planning the scientific survey.",
      "\u201cSome of the instruments for the future spacecraft are very much being designed with ideas from what we learned from Voyager 2 when it flew past the system when it was experiencing an abnormal event. So we need to rethink how exactly we are going to design the instruments on the new mission so that we can best capture the science we need to make discoveries\u201d.",
      "Nasa\u2019s Uranus probe is expected to arrive by 2045, which is when scientists hope to find out whether these far-flung icy moons, once thought of as being dead worlds, might have the possibility of being home to life."

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 16:37:35 GMT",
    "summary": "Bluesky is picking up one million new users every day at its current rate.",
    "story": [
      "You may have seen the word \"Bluesky\" popping up on your social media pages recently and wondered what people are talking about.",
      "It is an alternative platform to Elon Musk's X and in terms of its colour and logo, it looks quite similar.",
      "Bluesky is growing rapidly and is currently picking up around one million new sign-ups a day.",
      "It had 16.7m users at the time of writing, but that figure will likely be outdated by the time you read this.",
      "So what is it - and why are so many people joining?",
      "What is Bluesky?",
      "Bluesky describes itself as \"social media as it should be\", although it looks similar to other sites.",
      "Visually, a bar to the left of the page shows everything you might expect - search, notifications, a homepage and so on.",
      "People using the platform can post, comment, repost and like their favourite things.",
      "To put it simply, it looks how X, formerly known as Twitter, used to look.",
      "The main difference is Bluesky is decentralised - a complicated term which basically means users can host their data on servers other than those owned by the company.",
      "This means that rather than being limited to having a specific account named after Bluesky, people can (if they like) sign up using an account they themselves own.",
      "But it is worth stating that the vast majority of people don't do that and a new joiner will most likely have a \".bsky.social\" at the end of their username.",
      "Who owns Bluesky?",
      "If you think it feels a lot like X, you won't be surprised to learn why. The former head of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, created it.",
      "He even once said he wanted Bluesky to be a decentralised version of Twitter that no single person or entity owns.",
      "But Mr Dorsey is no longer part of the team behind it, having stepped down from the board in May 2024.",
      "He deleted his account altogether in September.",
      "It is now run and predominantly owned by chief executive Jay Graber as a US public benefit corporation.",
      "Why is it gaining in popularity?",
      "Bluesky has been around since 2019, but it was invitation-only until February of this year.",
      "That let the developers deal with all the kinks behind-the-scenes, to try and stabilise it before opening the doors to the wider public.",
      "The plan has worked, somewhat. But the flurry of new users has been so significant in November that there continue to be issues with outages.",
      "It is no coincidence that the number of new Bluesky users spiked following Donald Trump's success in the US elections in November.",
      "X's owner, Mr Musk, was a big backer of Trump during his campaign, and will be heavily involved in his administration.",
      "Inevitably, this has led to a political division, with some people leaving X in protest.",
      "But others have cited different reasons, such as the Guardian newspaper which has chosen to stop posting there as it called X \"a toxic media platform\".",
      "Meanwhile, Bluesky's app continues to pick up significant downloads worldwide and on Thursday was the top free app in the Apple App Store in the UK.",
      "Several celebrities, from pop singer Lizzo to Taskmaster's Greg Davies, have announced they are joining the platform and limiting their use of - or in some cases leaving altogether - X.",
      "Other names you might recognise include Ben Stiller, Jamie Lee Curtis and Patton Oswalt.",
      "But this growth, while significant, will have to continue for a long time before Bluesky is able to mount a true challenge to its microblogging rival.",
      "X does not share its total user numbers but it is understood to be measured in the hundreds of millions, with Elon Musk previously saying the platform had 250 million users each day.",
      "How does Bluesky make money?",
      "It is the million dollar question, quite literally.",
      "Bluesky started off with funding from investors and venture capital firms and has raised tens of millions of dollars through these means.",
      "But with so many new users, it is going to have to find a way to pay the bills.",
      "Back in Twitter's heyday, the site made the vast majority of its money through advertising.",
      "Bluesky has said it wants to avoid this. Instead, it said it will continue to look into paid services, such as having people pay for custom domains in their username.",
      "That sounds complicated but it basically comes down to a person's username being even more personalised.",
      "For example, it may mean my username - @twgerken.bsky.social - could in the future be more official-sounding, such as @twgerken.bbc.co.uk.",
      "Proponents of this idea say it doubles-up as a form of verification as the organisation which owns the website would have to clear its use.",
      "If Bluesky's owners continue to avoid advertising, they may inevitably have to look to other broader options, such as subscription features, as a way of keeping the lights on.",
      "But if it is not making very much money, that would not be unusual for tech startups.",
      "In fact, Twitter, before it was purchased by Mr Musk in 2022, only made a profit twice in its eight years of being publicly traded.",
      "And we all know how that ended - a massive payday for investors when the world's richest man paid $44bn (\u00a334.7bn) for the privilege of owning it.",
      "For now, the future of Bluesky remains unknown, but if its growth continues, anything is possible.",

      "Here's the BBC's list of the seven wildest moments - so far - in Bitcoin's tumultuous history.",
      "1. The mysterious creator of Bitcoin",
      "Despite its enormous profile, no-one actually knows for sure who invented Bitcoin. The idea for it was posted on internet forums in 2008 by someone calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto.",
      "They explained how a peer-to-peer digital cash system could work to enable people to send virtual coins over the internet, just as easily as sending an email.",
      "Satoshi created a complex computer system that would process transactions and create new coins using a huge network of self-appointed volunteers around the world who used special software and powerful computers.",

      "In 2014, Japanese-American man Dorian Nakamoto was pursued by reporters who thought he was the elusive Bitcoin creator, but it proved to be false lead caused by some mistranslated information.",
      "Australian computer scientist Craig Wright said it was him in 2016 - but after years of legal battles, a High Court judge concluded he was not Satoshi.",
      "Earlier this year, a Canadian Bitcoin expert called Peter Todd strongly denied being Satoshi, while in London this month a British man, Stephen Mollah, claimed he was - but no-one believed him.",
      "2. Making history with pizza",
      "Bitcoin now underpins a two trillion-dollar cryptocurrency industry - but the first recorded transaction using it was the purchase of pizza.",
      "On 22 May 2010, Lazlo Hanyecz, offered $41 worth of Bitcoin on a crypto forum in return for two pizzas.",
      "A 19-year-old student obliged and the day went down in history for fans of the currency as #BitcoinPizza day.",
      "A source of memes for those in crypto community, it also showcased the power of Bitcoin - an internet money that could genuinely buy items online.",
      "Criminals must have been watching too, because within a year the first darknet marketplace was launched selling drugs and other illegal goods in exchange for Bitcoin.",
      "The deal looks pretty bad for Lazlo now too. If he had held onto those coins they would now be worth hundreds of millions of dollars!",
      "3. Becoming legal tender",
      "In September 2021, President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador, central America, made Bitcoin legal tender.",
      "Hairdressers, supermarkets and other shops had to accept Bitcoin by law, alongside its main currency, the US dollar.",
      "Many Bitcoin enthusiasts and reporters visited the area, briefly boosting tourism to the country.",
      "While President Bukele hoped the move would increase investment in his country and cut costs for citizens exchanging money, it did not become as popular as he hoped.",
      "He is still hoping it will take off but for now the US dollar still remains king in the country.",
      "As well as the huge amount of public money President Bukele spent on trying to make people embrace Bitcoin he also, controversially, bought more than 6,000 bitcoins over the past few years.",
      "The president spent at least $120m buying up bitcoins at various prices in the hope of making a profit for his cash-strapped country.",
      "It started to look good for him in December 2023 when, for the first time, his stash skyrocketed in value.",
      "A website built by Dutch software engineer Elias Zerrouq is tracking the country's Bitcoin holdings and currently estimates that the coins have risen 98% in value.",
      "4. Kazakhstan's crypto boom and bust",
      "In 2021, Kazakhstan became a hotspot for Bitcoin mining - the process of crunching through the complex calculations that underpin crypto transactions.",
      "These days it takes warehouses full of the latest computers running all day and all night, but the reward is brand new bitcoins for those companies that take part.",
      "Warehouses of computers require lots of power - and many businesses moved to Kazakhstan where electricity was abundant thanks to huge coal reserves.",
      "At first the government welcomed them with open arms as they brought investment.",
      "But too many miners arrived and put huge strain on the electricity grid, putting the country at risk of blackouts.",
      "Within a year, Kazakhstan's Bitcoin mining industry went from boom to bust as the government imposed restrictions and increased taxes to curb the growth.",
      "Around the world it is estimated that the Bitcoin network uses as much electricity as a small country, raising concerns about its environmental impact.",
      "5. Bitcoins in the rubbish dump",
      "Imagine having a crypto wallet worth more than $100m (\u00a378m) - and then  accidentally throwing away a hard drive containing the login details.",
      "That's what James Howells, from south Wales, says happened to him",
      "The very nature of crypto means that recovery is not as easy as resetting your password. With no banks involved - there is no customer support helpline.",
      "Unfortunately for him, his local council in Newport refused to let him access the landfill site where he says the device ended up - even after he offered to donate 25% of his Bitcoin stash to local charities if they let him.",
      "He told the BBC: \"It was a penny dropping moment and it was a sinking feeling.\"",
      "6. Crypto King fraudster",
      "No one has lost as much Bitcoin as former billionaire crypto mogul, Sam Bankman-Fried. The founder of the massive crypto firm FTX was nicknamed the Crypto King and loved by the community.",
      "FTX was a cryptocurrency exchange that allowed people to trade normal money for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.",
      "His empire was worth an estimated $32bn and he was flying high until everything came crashing down within days.",
      "Journalists had discovered that Bankman-Fried's company was financially shaky and had been illegally transferring FTX customer funds to prop up his other company, Alameda Research.",
      "Just before his arrest at his luxury apartment complex in the Bahamas in December 2022 he spoke to reporters. He told the BBC: \"I don't think I committed fraud. I didn't want any of this to happen. I was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was.\"",
      "After being extradited to the US he was found guilty of fraud and money laundering and was jailed for 25 years.",
      "7. Investment bank boom",
      "Despite all the turmoil, Bitcoin continues to attract attention from investors and big companies.",
      "In fact, in January 2024, some of the biggest financial firms in the world added Bitcoin to their official asset lists as Spot Bitcoin ETFs. These are like stocks and shares, linked to the value of Bitcoin but you don't have to personally own any.",
      "Customers have been pouring billions into these brand new products. Companies including Blackrock, Fidelity and GrayScale, have also been buying up Bitcoins in their thousands, pushing up its value to record highs.",
      "It is a huge milestone for crypto with some fans believing that Bitcoin is finally being taken as seriously as the mysterious Satoshi imagined.",
      "Nonetheless, few would back against more wild moments as the Bitcoin story continues to unfold."

      "It never happened. Instead the company ran demonstration flights.",
      "While missing that deadline was embarrassing, behind the scenes a more serious issue was playing out - Volocopter was urgently trying to raise fresh investment to keep the firm going.",
      "Talks to borrow \u20ac100m (\u00a383m; $106m) from the government failed in April.",
      "Now hopes are pinned on China's Geely, which is in talks to take an 85% stake in Volocopter in return for $95m of funding, according to a Bloomberg report. The deal could mean that any future manufacturing would be moved to China.",
      "Volocopter is one of dozens of companies around the world developing an electric vertical take-off and landing (EVTOL) aircraft.",
      "Their machines promise the flexibility of a helicopter, but without the cost, noise and emissions.",
      "However, faced with the massive cost of getting such novel aircraft approved by regulators and then building up manufacturing capabilities, some investors are bailing out.",
      "One of the most high-profile casualties is Lilium.",
      "The German company had developed a radical take on the EVTOL theme.",
      "Lilium's aircraft uses 30 electric jets that can be tilted in unison to swing between vertical lift and forward flight.",
      "The concept proved attractive, with the company claiming to have orders and memoranda of understanding for 780 jets from around the world.",
      "It was able to demonstrate the technology using a remote controlled scale model. Construction had begun on the first full-sized jets, and testing had been due to begin in early 2025.",
      "As recently as the Farnborough Airshow in July, Lilium\u2019s COO Sebastian Borel was sounding confident.",
      "\u201cWe are definitely burning through cash,\" he told the BBC. \u201cBut this is a good sign, because it means we are producing the aircraft. We\u2019re going to have three aircraft in production by the end of the year, and we have also raised \u20ac1.5bn\u201d.",
      "But then the money ran out.",
      "Lilium had been attempting to arrange a loan worth \u20ac100m from the German development bank, KfW. However, that required guarantees from national and state governments, which never materialised.",
      "In early November, the company put its main operating businesses into insolvency proceedings, and its shares were removed from the Nasdaq stock exchange.",
      "For the moment, work on the new aircraft is continuing, as the company works with restructuring experts to sell the business or bring in new investment. However, getting the new e-jet into production is looking more challenging than ever.",
      "The high-profile British player in the eVTOL market is Vertical Aerospace. The Bristol-based company was founded in 2016 by businessman Stephen Fitzpatrick, who also set up OVO Energy.",
      "Its striking VX4 design uses eight large propellers mounted on slim, aircraft style wings to generate lift. Mr Fitzpatrick has made ambitious claims about the aircraft, suggesting it would be \u201c100 times\u201d safer and quieter than a helicopter, for 20% of the cost.",
      "The company has made progress. After completing a programme of remote-controlled testing, it began carrying out piloted tests earlier this year. Initially, these were carried out with the aircraft tethered to the ground. In early November, it carried out its first untethered take-off and landing.",
      "But there have also been serious setbacks. In August last year, a remotely-piloted prototype was badly damaged when it crashed during testing at Cotswold Airport, after a propeller blade fell off.",
      "In May one of its key partners, the engineering giant Rolls Royce pulled out of a deal to supply electric motors for the aircraft.",
      "Ambitions remain sky high. Vertical Aerospace says it will deliver 150 aircraft to its customers by the end of the decade. By then, it also expects to be capable of producing 200 units a year, and to be breaking even in cash terms.",
      "Yet financial strains have been intensifying. Mr Fitzpatrick invested an extra $25m into the company in March. But a further $25m, due in August if alternative investment could not be found, has not been paid. As of September, Vertical had $57.4m on hand \u2013 but it expects to burn through nearly double that over the coming year.",
      "Hopes for the future appear to be pinned on doing a deal with the American financier Jason Mudrick, who is already a major creditor through his firm Mudrick Capital Management.",
      "He has offered to invest $75m into the business \u2013 and has warned the board of Vertical that rejecting his plan would inevitably lead to insolvency proceedings. But the move has been resisted by Mr Fitzpatrick, who would lose control of the company he founded.",
      "Sources close to the talks insist an agreement is now very close. The company believes if a deal can be done, it will unlock further fundraising opportunities.",
      "Amid the turbulence, one European project is quietly on track, says Bjorn Fehrm who has a background in aeronautical engineering and piloted combat jets for the Swedish Air Force. He now works for aerospace consultancy Leeham.",

      "Once the aircraft are being produced, the next challenge will be to see if there's a profitable market for them.",
      "The first routes are likely to be between airports and city centres. But will they make money?",

      "Millions of homeowners across the country could be facing the same dilemma.",
      "Around 29 million British homes require retrofitting by 2050, according to the UK Green Building Council, an industry body.",
      "Retrofitting might involve measures such as improving your home\u2019s insulation, upgrading the heating system, or installing energy-generating devices such as solar panels, or even a private wind turbine.",
      "These adjustments can cost thousands of pounds up front, but, if properly executed, they could improve comfort and reduce people\u2019s bills in the long-run.",
      "Plus, increased energy efficiency ought to cut carbon emissions from homes, especially if property owners switch away from gas or oil-fired boilers, for example.",
      "Roughly one fifth of the UK\u2019s total emissions comes from residential buildings.",
      "Amy Peace and her husband live in the northwest of England, near Warrington. The pair both work in sustainability, advising businesses on their path to net zero.",
      "They were keen to improve the quality of their home and apply the principles they promote at work to their own lives \u2013 but they too faced challenges when deciding on how to go about it.",
      "\u201cEven though we\u2019ve got this background, and we\u2019re engineers as well, what we weren\u2019t entirely clear on was where was best to spend the money,\u201d says Mrs Peace.",
      "The couple spoke to multiple consultants, but Mrs Peace found the advice they received was often geared towards meeting Passivhaus standards \u2013 an ultra-energy efficient type of building.",
      "\u201cThere weren\u2019t many in that pragmatic middle space where you are literally saying, \u2018We\u2019ve got this much money, where would we be best putting it?\u2019,\u201d Mrs Peace adds.",
      "Perseverance during the past three years paid off, however, and the couple\u2019s 1930\u2019s detached house now has improved insulation, a heat pump, and an electric car charging point. Solar panels and battery will follow shortly, if all goes to plan.",
      "Conscious of the confusion around approaches to retrofit, some organisations are moving to improve the advice available to homeowners. Among them is Ecofurb.",
      "\u201cWe can model all the different options that are available, suitable for your home and your budget, and identify a package of measures,\u201d says Liz Lain\u00e9, of Parity Projects, a housing data analysis company, which runs Ecofurb.",

      "There are many other organisations that offer to help homeowners plan a retrofit.",
      "The work often involves carrying out a heat-loss survey, to spot cold areas that require insulation, and to better understand a property\u2019s heating demand. Experts might also advise on the suitability of solar panels for your home, for example.",
      "There\u2019s the Get a Heat Pump website, launched by the charities Nesta and The MCS Foundation, which explains what heat pumps are and how they might fit into a home renovation plan.",
      "RICS, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, has also just launched a new retrofit standard for its members \u2013 essentially, it encourages surveyors with the appropriate training to offer their services to homeowners planning or undergoing a retrofit.",
      "The RICS website will soon include a range of retrofit advice and a tool to help homeowners find a suitable surveyor in their local area, says Steve Lees, from the RICS retrofit project team.",
      "Improving the energy efficiency of homes is \u201cessential\u201d for decarbonisation, says Gerald Charles, head of housing retrofit at the Centre for Sustainable Energy, but he adds that the current lack of good advice remains a genuine problem.",
      "\u201cThe industry as a whole don\u2019t appreciate the importance of good retrofit advice,\u201d he says.",
      "One entrepreneur who has noticed a knowledge gap in the market is James Major, founder and chief executive of HubbPro, which helps architects plan energy efficient buildings. Architects don\u2019t always have the latest information about how to incorporate energy-saving technologies into their designs, notes Mr Major.",
      "\u201cClean tech isn\u2019t part of what they do or what they should know \u2013 that\u2019s an engineering function,\u201d he says. And yet architects\u2019 clients increasingly ask about such tech when planning a new home or an extension.",
      "Through an initiative called MyHubb, Mr Major is now offering architects detailed reports that estimate the carbon reduction potential and payback period on retrofitted measures - such as heat pump-based heating systems or solar panels, for instance.",
      "He says these reports cost around \u00a31,000, though he adds that this price is not yet finalised.",
      "Mr Duffy says he will keep looking for solutions to his own retrofit conundrum. But he makes another point. So much of the currently available technology and advice is tailored to individual homeowners.",

      "Standing on a podium in a Florida convention centre on the night of the election, a row of American flags behind him and a jubilant crowd looking on, Donald Trump declared: \u201cMany people have told me that God spared my life for a reason, and that reason was to save our country and to restore America to greatness.\u201d",
      "This was one of the most striking themes of his election campaign - that he had been chosen by God. Yet even before the attempt on his life on 13 July in Butler, Pennsylvania, millions of Americans already felt guided by their faith to support the former, and now future, president.",
      "Some cast the election in an apocalyptic light and likened Trump to a Biblical figure.",
      "Last year, on the Christian show FlashPoint, TV evangelist Hank Kunneman described \u201ca battle between good and evil\u201d, adding: \u201cThere's something on President Trump that the enemy fears: it's called the anointing.\u201d",
      "Jim Caviezel, an actor who played Jesus in Mel Gibson\u2019s The Passion of the Christ, proclaimed, albeit jokingly, that Trump was \u201cthe new Moses\u201d. Then, in the months leading up to the election, many of his supporters referred to him as a \u201csaviour\u201d.",
      "The question is why. What makes so many see this man, who isn\u2019t known to have an especially strong faith, as sent from God?",
      "And what does that say about Christianity more broadly in a country where the numbers of churchgoers is in rapid decline?",
      "\u2018All of us have sinned\u2019",
      "Reverend Franklin Graham is one of America\u2019s best-known evangelists and the son of Billy Graham, arguably its most famous preacher. He is one of the Trump believers, convinced there is no doubt that the president-elect was chosen for this mission by God.",
      "\u201cThe bullet that went through his ear missed his brain by a millimetre, and his head turned just at the last second when the gun was fired,\u201d he says. \u201cI believe that God turned his head and saved his life.\u201d",
      "The questions asked about Trump\u2019s character - including accusations of sexual misconduct, and his alleged affair with adult film star Stormy Daniels and associated hush-money trial - don't dim Mr Graham\u2019s view.",
      "\u201cRemember when Jesus told the crowd, \u2018Let the one without sin cast the first stone\u2019 and that slowly, the entire audience began to disappear? All of us have sinned.\u201d",
      "Part of the reason some Christians may find it easier to look past questions of character is that during Trump\u2019s first term in office he delivered on a particular promise: to appoint anti-abortion judges to the US Supreme Court.",
      "Mr Graham points to this as evidence that the president-elect is a man of integrity.",
      "\u201cThis is a big win for Christians, for evangelicals,\u201d he says. \u201cWe believe the president will defend religious freedom where the Democrats would not.\u201d",
      "The selection of Mike Huckabee as ambassador to Israel is already a hint that faith might shape some foreign policy. US evangelicals including Huckabee are among the country\u2019s most fervent supporters of Israel.",
      "Many of them believe that Jews should populate the whole of the area of biblical Israel, including what is now the occupied West Bank and Gaza, in order to precipitate events leading to the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.",
      "A religion in rapid decline",
      "In the past Donald Trump had talked about having had a Presbyterian upbringing. But despite his strong support from Christians in last week\u2019s election, he never tried hard to convince them in his most recent campaign that he was one of them.",
      "\u201cI think he realised it was going to be a bit of a stretch to argue that he himself is a religious man, but instead he adopted a quid pro quo approach,\u201d says Robert Jones, founder and president of the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI), which has long tracked religious trends in the US.",
      "That approach centred on changes in demographics and dwindling numbers of churchgoers.",
      "In the early 1990s, about 90% of US adults identified as Christians - a figure that had fallen to 64% earlier this decade, with a large increase in the number of those unaffiliated to any faith, according to data from Pew Research Center.",
      "This, says Dr Jones, was something Trump was able to draw upon.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s message was: \u2018I know you're in decline, I know your numbers are waning. I know your children and grandchildren aren't affiliated with your Churches anymore, but if you elect me, I'm going to restore power to the Christian Churches\u201d,\u2019 he says.",
      "Not all Christians in the US were won over, however. For some, their faith has guided them to precisely the opposite impression of Trump.",
      "'Trump has demeaned and debased'",
      "In recent months, from the pulpit of Bible Ways Ministries in Atlanta, Georgia, Reverend Monte Norwood has been sharing a very different message to that of Franklin Graham.",
      "He, for one, was dismayed at last week\u2019s election result.",
      "\u201cTrump has demeaned and debased just about anybody he could, from immigrants to minorities to women to those who are disabled,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cWhite conservative Republican Christianity that ignores character is just hypocritical.\"",
      "He has long been opposed to the idea of a second Trump presidency, and he has voiced this on social media and through activism encouraging voter turnout - such as by helping other black voters to register to vote and access free rides to the polls.",
      "\u201cI am a Matthew chapter 25 kind of Christian - where Jesus said: \u2018When I was hungry you fed me, when I was thirsty, you gave me something to drink.\u2019\u201d",
      "In history: Christian voting patterns",
      "PRRI\u2019s research has looked into voting records in history, not just by religious practice and belief but also by race, and found that when it comes to political views, there has been a clear trend for decades.",
      "\u201cAlmost without exception, white Christian groups have tended to vote Republican in presidential contests,\u201d says Dr Jones. \u201cNon-white Christian groups, non-Christian groups and religiously unaffiliated voters have tended to vote Democrat.\u201d",
      "This pattern dates back to the 1960s, he adds, when the Democratic party became associated with the civil rights movement and white Christian groups began migrating to the Republican Party.",
      "Polling ahead of the 2024 election looking at voter intention suggested that for the most part this pattern held. \u201cFrom our polling, we have a Republican party that is 70% white and Christian, and a Democratic party that's only a quarter white and Christian.\u201d",
      "According to the PPRI\u2019s survey of 5,027 adults, white evangelical Protestant voters were the strongest backers of Trump over Harris by 72% to 13%. White Catholic voters also backed Trump, with 55% supporting him and 34% aligned with Harris. White \u201cmainline\u201d non-evangelical Protestants showed a similar split.",
      "By contrast 78% black Protestants supported Harris while just 9% backed Trump, according to the survey. Harris\u2019s backers also included Jewish-Americans, the religiously unaffiliated and other non-Christian Americans, according to the PPRI.",
      "When it came to the actual vote, there were signs of departures from familiar patterns.",
      "The results from Michigan showed a clear lurch towards the Republican Party by Muslim voters in the state, likely the result of the Biden administration\u2019s role in aiding Israel in its war in Gaza.",
      "Analysis also shows that more Latino Catholics voted for Trump than expected, when previously they have tended to lean Democrat.",
      "Economic hardship brought about by soaring inflation, among other factors, is likely to have resulted in \u201cnon-traditional\u201d Republican voters being drawn to vote for Trump.",
      "As for his appeal to traditionalist Christians, Dr Jones argues that there has been a faith component to the idea of \u201cMaking America Great Again\u201d, with the promise of restoring the country's Christian character.",
      "\u201cHis has been a campaign of grievance and loss and nostalgia,\u201d argues Dr Jones, \u201cand that includes nostalgia from a faith perspective.\u201d",
      "The future of faith in the US",
      "For all his political strength, one thing that Trump cannot do is hold back the tide of demographic change in the US - including the move away from faith.",
      "While the number who define themselves as \u201catheist\u201d remains lower in the US than in most Western countries, those who say they are \u201creligiously unaffiliated\u201d is growing.",
      "There is a generational component to that, along with the familiar trends of personal economics meaning that people have greater autonomy to move away from the accepted norms in their communities. But there are other reasons too.",
      "A third of American atheists or agnostics say they disaffiliated from their childhood religion because of high-profile Church abuse scandals, according to a PPRI study.",
      "In 2020 the Catholic Church released lists of living members of clergy in the US found to have been accused of abuses, including some linked to child pornography and rape. There were around 2,000 names.",
      "Two years later, the Southern Baptist Conference collection of US Protestant Churches released a list of hundreds of Church leaders accused of child abuse between 2000 and 2019.",
      "Why the CofE and other big institutions still fail to protect children from abuse",
      "Why Britain\u2019s biggest unsolved mass murder is being revisited 50 years on",
      "The real reason for the rise in male childlessness",
      "It shows the scale of the issue that Trump faces. Nevertheless, Franklin Graham is optimistic.",
      "\u201cChurch attendance is not going to go up next week because President Trump has been elected - but what I think it does mean is that legislation that we might have seen coming down the road that that would make it very difficult for people of faith will not come,\u201d he says, referring to the idea of more progressive legislation around, for example, abortion and gay and trans rights.",
      "\u201cHe will protect people of faith, he will protect religious freedoms in this country. I don't talk about just Christian religious freedoms\u2026 [but] all people of faith.\u201d",
      "As to whether he is right, Americans can only watch and wait. But just as some are revelling in the promise of governance influenced by Christianity, others are undoubtedly nervous.",

    "summary": "Fifty-one men are on trial in a case that focuses on a formerly married couple, Dominique and Gis\u00e8le Pelicot.",
    "story": [
      "After 10 weeks, the mass rape trial that has shocked France is moving on to the final phase of closing statements.",
      "The case focuses on a formerly married couple, Dominique and Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, pensioners who are now in their early 70s.",
      "Ms Pelicot's legal team will give their final statements on Tuesday, and the defence will then follow, ahead of a verdict from a panel of five judges expected on 20 December.",
      "Dominique Pelicot went on trial with 50 other men in the southern city of Avignon in September.",
      "Every chapter of this case has played out in the full glare of publicity because Ms Pelicot has waived her anonymity, making the whole trial open to the media and the public.",
      "In France, it has become known as the Affaire Mazan, after the village near Avignon where the Pelicots lived.",
      "In November 2020, Dominique Pelicot admitted drugging his then-wife for almost a decade and recruiting dozens of men online to rape her in their home when she was unconscious.",
      "Police tracked down his co-accused from thousands of videos they found on Mr Pelicot's laptop, although they were unable to identify an additional 21 men. Investigators said they have evidence of around 200 rapes carried out between 2011 and 2020.",
      "The majority of the defendants deny the charges of rape, arguing that they cannot be guilty because they did not realise Ms Pelicot was unconscious and therefore did not \"know\" they were raping her.",
      "That line of defence has sparked a nationwide discussion on whether consent should be added to France's legal definition of rape, currently defined as \"any act of sexual penetration committed against another person by violence, constraint, threat or surprise\".",
      "The trial has also shone a light on the issue of chemical submission - drug-induced sexual assault.",
      "Blackouts and memory loss after years of marriage",
      "Dominique and Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, who were both born in 1952, married in 1973 and had three children. She worked as a manager in a large French company, while he - a trained electrician - started several ultimately unsuccessful businesses.",
      "The Pelicots lived in the Paris region until 2013, when they retired to the picturesque southern village of Mazan. They had a big house with a swimming pool and often used to entertain their extended family during the summer holidays.",
      "By all accounts, they were a happy, close-knit couple. \"We shared holidays, anniversaries, Christmases... All of that, for me, was happiness,\" Ms Pelicot has said.",
      "Between 2011 and 2020, Ms Pelicot experienced unsettling symptoms she took to be signs of Alzheimer's or a brain tumour, and underwent extensive medical exams. The blackouts and memory loss were, in fact, side-effects of the drugs her husband was giving her without her knowledge.",
      "Ms Pelicot divorced her husband soon after his crimes came to light. She is only using her married name for the purposes of the trial.",
      "Dominique Pelicot has been in jail since November 2020. He will be sentenced next month, alongside the other 50 defendants.",
      "How the case came to light",
      "In September 2020, Dominique Pelicot was spotted filming under women's skirts by a security guard in a supermarket in southern France.",
      "Police detained him and confiscated his electronic devices. They noticed suspicious chats on his Skype account, then found thousands of videos of men having sex with a seemingly unconscious woman - Mr Pelicot's wife, Gis\u00e8le.",
      "Investigators worked for weeks to gather enough evidence to take Mr Pelicot into custody and eventually arrested him in November 2020. He immediately admitted all the charges.",
      "When Ms Pelicot was questioned by police and shown photos and videos in which she appeared unconscious, it became clear she had no knowledge of what had happened to her. She denied ever giving her consent to having sex with other men and realised her husband had drugged her for almost a decade.",
      "Fifty-one men in the dock",
      "Fifty men - aged between 26 and 72 years old - are on trial alongside Mr Pelicot.",
      "They hail from all walks of life: among them are a fireman, a carpenter, a nurse and a journalist. Many are married with children. Most lived within a 60km (37 miles) distance of the Pelicots' residence.",
      "A handful have admitted to raping Ms Pelicot.",
      "The majority, however, reject the charges. Their defence hinges on the fact they did not believe what they were doing was rape, because they were not aware that she was unconscious and therefore could not give her consent.",
      "Mr Pelicot has repeatedly denied this was the case, insisting that when he recruited men on the internet he made it abundantly clear that his wife would be asleep. \"They all knew, they cannot say the contrary,\" he has said.",
      "What Gis\u00e8le Pelicot has told the court so far",
      "It was Gis\u00e8le Pelicot who decided to waive her anonymity - highly unusual in cases of rape. Her legal team also insisted for the videos of the alleged rapes to be shown in court.",
      "Ms Pelicot has said that she hopes her decision will empower other survivors of sexual violence to speak out: \"I want all women who have been raped to say: Madame Pelicot did it, I can too. I don't want them to be ashamed any longer.\"",
      "She has forcefully hit back at \"humiliating\" suggestions by the defence that she may have been drunk or pretending to be asleep during the alleged rapes, stating that she was never interested in partner-swapping or threesomes.",
      "Ms Pelicot has also, however, spoken candidly about the devastation that her husband's abuse and lies have wreaked on her life. \"People may see me and think: that woman is strong,\" she said. \"The facade may be solid, but behind it lies a field of ruins.\"",
      "How France has responded to the trial",
      "The horror of Dominique Pelicot's actions, the sheer number of men implicated in the case and Gis\u00e8le Pelicot's decision to push for an open trial has meant that the proceedings have garnered significant attention.",
      "Dozens of members of the public attend court in Avignon each day to back Ms Pelicot, meeting her with applause and handing her flowers.",
      "Murals have appeared across the country depicting her distinctive look of a short bob and round sunglasses, and demonstrations have taken place all over France in her support.",
      "Above all, she is credited by many with sparking a conversation on rape culture, misogyny and chemical submission.",
      "Several feminist groups are now pushing for the government to amend its definition of rape to include consent, as is already the case in many European countries.",
      "\"Society has already accepted the fact that the difference between sex and rape is consent,\" said Greens senator M\u00e9lanie Vogel, who proposed a consent-based rape law last year. \"Criminal law, however, has not.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 17 Nov 2024 19:05:19 GMT",
    "summary": "The march was led by Yulia Navalnaya, widow of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who died in February.",
    "story": [
      "The widow of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has urged thousands of supporters marching through central Berlin to continue their protests against President Vladimir Putin and the war in Ukraine.",
      "\"One protest alone won't change anything. We need to keep coming out,\" Yulia Navalnaya said, at the first rally she and other prominent opposition figures have led since being forced into exile.",
      "People carried the blue-and-white Russian opposition flag as well as Ukrainian flags, while chanting \"no to war\" and \"Putin is a killer\" in Russian.",
      "Many members of Russia's opposition have been exiled since the Kremlin escalated its crackdown on dissent, jailing hundreds - perhaps thousands - of people for their political views.",
      "The opposition says it has three main demands - the \"immediate withdrawal\" of troops from Ukraine, the trial of Putin as a \"war criminal\" and the liberation of all political prisoners in Russia.",
      "The Russian war on Ukraine was a major focus of the protest.",
      "Ukrainians often accuse the Russian opposition of failing to appreciate their suffering, and failing to do enough to stop the war being waged by their country.",
      "Just last week, Ukrainian protesters interrupted a speech by Yulia Navalnaya in Lisbon, playing the sound of air raid sirens and demanding that she condemn the war, which she did.",
      "This march seemed in part an attempt to address that impression, although one protester said he didn\u2019t agree with the prominent slogan  \"Putin = war\", because the invasion of Ukraine is being fought and supported by many Russians.",
      "Oleg Orlov, co-chair of the Nobel Peace Prize-winning organisation Memorial, who was sentenced to jail in Russia for his anti-war and anti-government statements, held a banner that read: \"Victory for Ukraine, Defeat for Putin, Freedom for Russia.\"",
      "Orlov now lives in Germany in enforced exile after he was released in a prisoner swap in August. He called for Ukraine's allies to continue supplying weapons.",
      "\"Victory for Putin in Ukraine will conserve his fascist regime in Russia for many years,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"More weapons for Ukraine is important, including for the future of Russia - because if Putin wins, then Russia is defeated - that is, the Russia that all of us here dream of and that we want to build.",
      "\"Those in Europe who talk about peace at all cost in Ukraine, those prepared to appease the aggressor, do not understand the mine they are laying for the future of Europe itself.\"",
      "The march ended outside the grand building of the Russian embassy on Unter Den Linden, where the three protest leaders clambered onto the back of a truck, linked arms and thanked the crowd for their support. They were greeted by cheers.",
      "Navalnaya said her husband had always thought you should go to protests in the same way you go to work.",
      "She urged people to march repeatedly, not only for themselves - but for Russians inside the country who can\u2019t do the same, \u201cfor the political prisoners\u2026 and for those who have been killed.\u201d",
      "Vladimir Kara-Murza, who was freed from jail in August after spending over two years - 11 months of them in solitary confinement \u2013 told the BBC he was \u201cproud\u201d to see a \u201csea of faces\u201d at the rally \u2013 although the march was smaller than some people had anticipated.",
      "\u201cThere are millions in Russia who feel the same way, who are against the war, Putin\u2019s regime. But in Russia it\u2019s impossible to do what we just did here today. For the smallest act of protest you will end up in prison, as I did.\u201d",
      "In his speech, he called the embassy \"a spy nest of Russia\".",
      "\"It will be an embassy again,\" he vowed.",
      "Navalny believed he would die in prison, memoir reveals",
      "I\u2019ll stand for Russian president when Putin's gone, Navalny\u2019s widow tells BBC",
      "One young IT worker, Anastasia - originally from Kazan in Russia - said she left in March 2022 because she could not stay in a country waging a war that she opposed.",
      "She said it was \u201cimpossible to protest in an authoritarian state\u201d, adding that this is why the rally was so crucial.",
      "The crowd was not huge, but it was diverse, including supporters of Alexei Navalny alongside anarchists and young men recruiting people to go and fight for Ukraine. We met protesters from as far away as Norway, Cyprus and Poland.",
      "As Yulia Navalnaya was whisked away by police, for security, the crowd gathered beside a memorial for those killed in Ukraine - chatting quietly and singing along with a young man playing guitar.",
      "One couple told the BBC that for them, this rally had given them a little hope - and sense that they weren\u2019t alone.",
      "\u201cThe mood now among Russians abroad is bad. People don\u2019t believe in change. Everything looks bad. They see no point in protesting,\u201d Polina said.",
      "\u201cMaybe they\u2019re right. But there\u2019s no shame in doing little; what's shameful is doing nothing. That\u2019s what Alexei Navalny once said.\u201d"

    "summary": "There is increasing tension between Italy's ruling coalition and the judiciary over migrant centres.",
    "story": [
      "It didn't take long for Elon Musk to be accused of meddling in Italy\u2019s domestic affairs.",
      "The tech billionaire\u2019s declaration that \u201cthese judges need to go,\u201d splashed across all of Italy's front pages, came amidst increasing tension between Italy\u2019s ruling coalition and the judiciary after a panel of Rome magistrates questioned the legality of a government initiative to detain asylum-seekers in Albania.",
      "Musk prompted a highly unusual statement from Italian President Sergio Mattarella, who told him not to interfere in Italian affairs.",
      "\"Italy is a great democratic country and... knows how to take care of itself,\" said Mattarella. \u201cAnyone, particularly if, as announced, he is about to assume an important government role in a friendly and allied country, must respect its sovereignty and cannot take it upon himself to issue instructions.\"",
      "Musk, who owns Tesla and X, has recently been picked by Donald Trump to head up his planned new Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "He has also developed close ties with Giorgia Meloni since she was elected over two years ago on the promise of cracking down on illegal migration.",
      "Two processing centres in Albania, built and managed by the Italian government to help manage the migrant flow in the Mediterranean towards Italy, soon became the symbol of her hard stance on migration.",
      "But delays in the project, legal hurdles and human rights concerns, as well as doubts about cost-effectiveness, have undermined its success so far.",
      "Last week a Rome court ordered the transfer of seven Egyptian and Bangladeshi asylum seekers from one of the two centres to Italy.",
      "The court had already ruled last month against the detention of other migrants from the same countries in Albania, a decision that the Italian prime minister had labelled \u201cprejudicial\".",
      "The two centres are currently empty, and Italian authorities are scaling back the number of staff on the ground.",
      "Since then, the debate in Italy has become increasingly heated, with Meloni and other members of her government regularly attacking the country\u2019s judiciary, until Musk also weighed in.",
      "The legal controversy revolves around an October ruling by the EU's Court of Justice (ECJ), stating that no country of origin can be deemed safe if any part of it is dangerous.",
      "This poses further challenges to Italy's policy of repatriating migrants without visas.",
      "While the ruling referred to a Czech case, it also applies to the entire EU and complicates Italy's plans for detention centres in Albania meant to fast-track repatriations.",
      "The Rome court has halted these actions pending further clarification from the ECJ.",
      "The project has attracted the attention of several leaders, including UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who are themselves seeking to stem illegal migration.",
      "During an official visit last September, Starmer praised Meloni's \u201cremarkable progress\u201d on tackling irregular arrivals by sea, while Meloni said her counterpart showed \u201cgreat interest\u201d in her country\u2019s deal with Albania.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has called for the exploration of \u201creturn hubs\u201d outside the EU. In a letter to European leaders on irregular migration, she cited the deal between Italy and Albania as a potential model.",
      "Several observers, however, have raised concerns over the actual impact of these centres, should they ever start operating at full capacity.",
      "\u201cAside from the delays in the implementation of the operation, I view the project as a distraction from more pressing issues that should be on the agenda, such as better allocation of funds and the creation of a functioning asylum system overall,\u201d said Alberto-Horst Neidhardt, a senior policy analyst at the European Policy Centre in Brussels.",

      "Former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who was charged with violation of antitrust law, money laundering, and tax fraud and faced prosecution for several other crimes over the years, repeatedly attacked judges, calling them \u201ccommunist\u201d.",
      "Meloni's coalition partner, Matteo Salvini, echoed his words saying judges who twisted Italy's laws should resign and go into politics with the \"refounded communists\".",
      "\u201cDemonising those whose role is to ensure that the law is upheld could pose a real danger,\u201d Neidhardt warned.",
      "According to Italian reports, Meloni and Musk have since spoken about the controversy. Musk is said to have expressed his respect for the Italian president, a report confirmed by Andrea Stroppa, a close confidant of Musk in Italy.",
      "Stroppa, however, added that Musk also \u201cemphasises that freedom of speech is protected by the First Amendment and the Italian constitution itself; therefore, as a citizen, he will continue to freely express his opinions\u201d.",

      "Trump's promised plans, however, are more wide-ranging and aggressive, including enforcement operations in the US far from the border. Officials are reportedly also mulling using the National Guard and military aircraft to detain and ultimately deport people.",
      "JD Vance, Trump's running mate and incoming vice-president, has said that the deportations could \"start\" with one million people.",
      "Still, some undocumented migrants believe that they will benefit from a Trump presidency instead of being kicked out.",
      "\"A lot of Latinos, those who can vote, did so because they think he [Trump] can improve the economy. That would be very good for us too,\" said Carlos, an undocumented Mexican who lives in New York City. His son is a US citizen.",
      "According to the American Immigration Council - a non-partisan organisation that conducts research and advocates for an overhaul of the US immigration system - there are more than five million Americans who were born to undocumented parents and have the security of US citizenship.",
      "Carlos says he is \"a little\" worried about getting swept up in immigration raids. But that fear is tempered by the possibility of an improved economy under Trump and more work.",
      "\"Things may be a bit tense right in our communities right now, but being worried isn't a solution,\" he said. \"The best thing to do is avoid problems and not commit any crimes.\"",
      "There are many others who don't share in this optimism, and are living in fear.",
      "Among them is California resident Eric Bautista, a so-called \"Dreamer\", who benefits from a longstanding programme that protects from deportation those who were brought illegally into the US as children.",
      "At 29, Mr Bautista has only fleeting memories of life in Mexico, the country in which he was born and left at the age of seven.",
      "For the last four years, he has taught US history to high schoolers  - including details of how waves of immigrants from Italy, Ireland, China, Japan and Mexico settled in the country, and often faced xenophobia.",
      "\"I don't think I've ever felt this way, even after more than 20 years here,\" Mr Bautista told the BBC. \"It feels like we're at a turning point, a new wave of nativism like those I teach about.",
      "\"It's just a future of fear and uncertainty for us.\"",
      "Advocates and legal experts said there was no guarantee that undocumented migrants without criminal convictions would not be ensnared in ramped-up deportation efforts.",
      "Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy director at the American Immigration Council, said that he foresaw an uptick in \"collateral arrests\" - a term used in the first Trump administration to describe immigrants swept up during enforcement actions even though they may not have been the original targets.",
      "\"Let's say they go after somebody with a criminal record, and that person lives in a house with four other [undocumented] people,\" he said. \"We saw with the first Trump administration, they'll arrest those people as well.\"",
      "How would Trump\u2019s promise of mass deportations of migrants work?",
      "How would Trump\u2019s promise of mass deportations of migrants work?",
      "In a recent interview with CBS, the BBC's US partner, Homan was asked about a hypothetical situation in which a grandmother was caught up in a \"targeted\" enforcement operation going after criminals.",
      "When asked if she would be deported, Homan responded \"it depends\".",
      "\"Let the judge decide,\" he said. \"We're gonna remove people that a judge has ordered deported.\"",
      "The arrest and potential removal of such collateral arrests would mark a drastic departure from the Biden administration, which has focused on public safety threats and deporting people soon after their apprehension at the border.",
      "While Homan recently dismissed suggestions that there could be \"a mass sweep of neighbourhoods\" or large detention camps set up, the stock prices of companies that could be involved in building detention facilities have jumped by as much as 90% since the election. They include publicly traded prison firms GEO Group and CoreCivic.",
      "Undocumented migrants are employed throughout the US economy - from agricultural fields to warehouses and construction sites.",
      "Mr Reichlin-Melnick said operations targeting such workplaces could lead to \"indiscriminate\" detentions.",
      "\"I don't think that being a person with no criminal record [who] pays taxes protects anybody,\" he said. \"One of the first things that Trump will do is get rid of the Biden administration's enforcement priorities. And we've seen that when there are no priorities, they will go after whoever are the easiest targets.\"",
      "The possibility of becoming \"an easy target\" has worried many migrants - particularly those from families with mixed legal statuses. Their biggest fear is finding themselves separated.",
      "Brenda, a 37-year-old Mexico-born \"Dreamer\" in Texas, is currently protected from deportation but her husband and her mother are not.",
      "Her two children were born in the US and are American citizens.",
      "While Brenda told the BBC she does not believe that \"good people\" would be the first targets for deportation, she can't escape the thought that her husband could be sent back to Mexico.",
      "\"It's important for us that we see our sons grow up,\" she said. \"Of course, the thought of being separated leaves one frightened.\"",

      "Holding a press conference in 2017, shortly after a cornerstone-laying ceremony at one of the biggest Israeli settlements in the West Bank, Huckabee said: \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a settlement. They\u2019re communities, they\u2019re neighbourhoods, they\u2019re cities.",

      "The Israeli far right has indicated that it sees Huckabee\u2019s appointment as a sign that it will be able to further advance its agenda, including annexation of the West Bank, during the next Trump term.",

      "\u201cWith President Trump, the Middle East experienced historic levels of peace and stability. Strength prevents wars. Iran\u2019s money was cut off which prevented their funding of global terror,\u201d he said.",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s decision to nominate a hardline settler leader for Israeli ambassador to Washington three days after Trump\u2019s election also indicates that the prime minister believes the next administration will be receptive to right-wing arguments.",

      "Donald Trump has moved speedily since winning the US presidential election to set the foundations of his second term in the White House.",
      "He has made his early priorities clear - and stunned some in Washington and around the world while doing so.",
      "Here\u2019s what we\u2019ve learned from his rollercoaster first week as president-elect.",
      "1) He\u2019s building a loyal team to shake up government",
      "Trump started building his top team almost immediately, nominating cabinet picks for Senate approval and appointing White House advisers and other senior aides.",
      "But that doesn\u2019t tell the full story.",
      "His selections make clear that he plans a radical shake up of government, eschewing more conventional and experienced picks for those who are loyal to him and share his vision for a second term that will upend the status quo in Washington.",
      "His choice for defence secretary, for example, has called for a purge of military chiefs enacting \u201cwoke\u201d policies. His nominee for health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, has said he wants to \u201cclear out corruption\u201d at America\u2019s health agencies and cut \u201centire departments\u201d at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).",
      "And that\u2019s not to mention a promised \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201c helmed by advisers Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, which Trump says will focus on slashing regulations and historic cost-cutting.",
      "The bigger picture is that Trump\u2019s proposed team is almost universally loyal, and favour overhauling their respective government departments.",
      "You can take a deeper look at who\u2019s in the frame for his top team here.",
      "2) He\u2019ll have a friendly Congress on his side",
      "Republicans have won control of the House as well as the Senate, giving the party a crucial (albeit narrow) majority in both chambers for at least the next two years, when there will be the usual midterm elections.",
      "This is a major boost to Trump\u2019s agenda. It means he will be more easily able to pass legislation and gives his policy priorities a friendly path to becoming law.",
      "The Democratic Party will, naturally, be less able to block and resist his agenda too. And Trump should for now be able to avoid the kind of congressional investigations he faced in the second half of his first term.",
      "Ultimately, Republican control of Congress could prove key in pushing through his big pledges such as mass deportations, sweeping tariffs on foreign imports and the rolling back of environmental protections.",
      "It won\u2019t always be smooth sailing for Trump in Congress, however, as our correspondent Gary O\u2019Donoghue explains here.",
      "3) But Senate Republicans won\u2019t always roll over",
      "Trump\u2019s influence was put to the test earlier this week when Republicans in the Senate picked their new leader.",
      "While he did not weigh-in on the race directly, there had been a concerted effort from the president-elect\u2019s most vocal allies as well as favourable \u2018Maga\u2019 media outlets to get hard-line Trump loyalist Rick Scott elected.",
      "But he was defeated in the first round and Republicans opted for a more orthodox pick in John Thune, who has had a more rocky relationship with Trump.",
      "It\u2019s worth noting that this was a secret ballot, so it was far from a public repudiation of Trumpworld.",
      "There will be sterner tests of Trump\u2019s power on Capitol Hill to come, notably when confirmation hearings are held for his more divisive cabinet picks.",
      "Some Senate Republicans, for example, have already signalled their opposition to Trump's shock choice of Matt Gaetz to lead the justice department.",
      "4) Trump's criminal conviction could soon be wiped",
      "While much of the focus was on the president-elect\u2019s nominations and appointments, we also had a reminder that his legal troubles have been upended by his victory.",
      "In New York specifically, his criminal fraud conviction in the hush-money case lives on for at least a few more days.",
      "But it could soon be consigned to history. Earlier this week a judge delayed his decision as to whether Trump\u2019s conviction should be thrown out because of a Supreme Court ruling in the summer that expanded presidential immunity.",
      "That decision is now expected to come next week. And while it\u2019s not clear whether the conviction will be tossed out, Trump\u2019s scheduled sentencing on 26 November is likely to be delayed regardless.",

      "5) He has China firmly in his sights",
      "It\u2019s no secret that Trump views the world differently to Biden, and could drastically shift US foreign policy over the next few years.",
      "One clear theme that's emerged in recent days is the prominence of China hawks in his proposed team - those who believe Beijing poses a serious threat to US economic and military dominance and want to challenge this more forcefully.",

    "summary": "Gary O'Donoghue looks at Trump's \"trifecta\" of power, and how far it will help him keep his promises.",
    "story": [
      "On election night, Donald Trump repeated the phrase: \"Promises made, promises kept.\"",
      "Now, Republicans have officially taken control of Congress and his \"promises\" are a whole lot easier to keep.",
      "In Washington political parlance, it's called \"a governing trifecta\", when the president's party also controls both chambers of Congress - the House of Representatives and the Senate.",
      "That control is what Donald Trump's Republican Party now has.",
      "Single-party control was once common, but in recent decades it has become rarer and shorter.  Often, the party in power loses seats when midterm congressional elections roll around two years later.",
      "Both Trump and Joe Biden enjoyed trifectas for their first two years in the White House, but they also saw that having such control is no guarantee a president can get their way.",

      "Seven things Trump says he will do in power",
      "When does he become president again?",
      "Who has Trump appointed to his top team so far?",
      "Why is Elon Musk Trump's efficiency tsar?",
      "In his first two years, Trump passed a signature tax bill - reducing corporate taxes from 35% to 21%, and cutting some taxes on individuals.",
      "But with some members of his own party resistant to his surprise ascent to the top in 2016, he struggled with other aims.",
      "His plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act (known as Obamacare) failed when a senator from his own party, John McCain, refused to vote for it. He also failed to pass an infrastructure bill as he had promised.",
      "In his first two years, when the Democrats controlled the House and the Senate, Biden succeeded in passing the American Rescue plan, the Investment and Jobs Act, and the Chips and Science Act. But he, too, had to significantly scale back his spending and investment plans - touted as the Build Back Better package - after opposition from one of his own senators.",
      "A major impediment to total control for either party is that Senate bills require a three-fifths majority, or 60 votes, to bypass the filibuster, which enables senators to delay legislation by keeping debate open-ended. That means that when a party has a simple majority in the Senate, it needs to reach across the aisle to get a bill passed.",
      "Even with a healthy majority in the Senate this time around, Trump will not have the magic 60 seats that would allow him to overcome opposition attempts to delay legislation.",
      "And on Wednesday, Republicans in the Senate selected John Thune as their majority leader over Florida's Rick Scott, the clear favourite in the Trump camp, in a sign some lawmakers may be reasserting their independence (Trump did not officially endorse Scott).",
      "That said, a trifecta, if astutely managed, does open the way for the possibility of major legislative initiatives.",
      "Trump's power advantage could be key in pushing through his big promises such as the largest deportation of migrants in history, sweeping tariffs on foreign imports, and the rolling back of environmental protections.",
      "Using legislation to achieve these ends will make such plans much harder to overturn in the courts - something Donald Trump was plagued by in his first term when he extensively used executive orders that were regularly and often successfully challenged.",
      "The judicial landscape also has changed in Trump's favour.",
      "The signature achievement of his first term was putting three conservatives on the Supreme Court - cementing a two-thirds majority for possibly decades to come.",
      "He also named more than four dozen judges to the federal appeals courts, flipping several circuits to a more conservative bent.",
      "The majority Republicans have in the Senate also provides a key advantage.",
      "Trump will be able to get his nominees for administration posts approved more easily, something he struggled with back in 2017 when internal resistance to him in the Republican Party was still significant.",
      "All this bodes for a busy and possibly turbulent next two years. But, as recent history indicates, these trifectas don't last all that long. The incoming administration will want to get a move on.",

    "summary": "Nominees can face a lengthy Senate vetting process before taking office, though Trump may try to upend that exercise in some cases.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump is facing opposition in some corners over key hires he has announced ahead of his return to the White House.",
      "Though some of the Republican president-elect's personnel decisions are immediate, many must go through further vetting.",
      "Several of the posts require a Senate hearing and a majority of the chamber's approval.",
      "But Trump is reportedly looking into a clause in the US Constitution that allows a president to unilaterally appoint nominees if the Senate is not in session.",
      "Senate vetting: How does it work?",
      "More than 1,000 positions - including the 15 officials chosen to lead executive departments, known as the Cabinet - typically require Senate approval. This also includes ambassadors and even some lower-level positions.",
      "But many members of Trump's team, including those who work in the White House or posts like the national security adviser, don't require Senate approval. They still are vetted, however, by the administration and could face intensive FBI background checks.",
      "On Thursday, incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune on Fox News that he does not anticipate a smooth road for each nominee.",
      "'None of this is gonna be easy,' he said.",
      "The FBI says members who are subject to vetting include presidential appointees, White House staff, positions requiring Senate confirmation, and other national security positions requiring security clearance.",
      "The FBI says it \"does not adjudicate or render an opinion on the results of the background investigation\", which are then sent to the office of the president-elect or the office of White House Counsel for their use \"as deemed appropriate\".",
      "It also is responsible for focusing \"on character and conduct\" and completing its investigation \"as expeditiously as possible.\"",
      "But the president-elect\u2019s transition team is\u202fbypassing FBI background checks for some cabinet picks, according to anonymous sources, CNN reported. It also has considered turning to private vetting companies. BBC has not independently verified this.",

      "What Trump could do on day one in the White House",
      "What White House picks tell us about Trump 2.0",
      "The Senate approval process requires nominees to submit financial disclosure forms, fill out a questionnaire - which differs based on the role - and testify before a Senate committee.",
      "These hearings can sometimes be contentious. They allow members from both political parties to question nominees about their backgrounds and plans for the post.",
      "After the hearing, the committee votes on the nomination. If it approves the candidate, the full Senate then votes on the nominee.",
      "Historically, the upper chamber has approved cabinet positions quickly - sometimes with little or no debate. But \"political and partisan conflicts between the president and senators have at times produced dramatic fights over cabinet nominees and led to their ultimate withdrawal or rejection\", the Senate's historical website notes.",
      "Bitter political brawls over Trump's picks could be limited somewhat because Republicans will control both chambers of Congress when the president-elect takes office in January.",
      "But some Republicans already have questioned at least one Trump choice, Florida congressman Matt Gaetz, the nominee for post of attorney general, or top prosecutor in the US.",
      "What are recess appointments?",
      "The vetting and approval process for nominees can be lengthy, but it was included in the US Constitution to provide a check on presidential power. It is also designed to rule out corrupt or unqualified nominees.",
      "There is, however, an exception to this process - recess appointments - which Trump appears intent to use to ensure his appointments are able to take office.",
      "Basically, the process says that when Congress is in recess - meaning it's not in session for a duration of time - the president can make appointments temporarily without congressional approval or vetting.",
      "Sen Thune warned on Fox that while recess appointments are an option for nominees, it is also not a certainty. First, all senators would need to vote to recess, he said, adding that the same senators with concerns about a nominee might also oppose a recess.",
      "The recess process was created when Congress didn't meet as often as it does today, and was to be used in emergencies so presidents would be able to fill positions without delay.",
      "It is also supposed to be a temporary appointment and expires at the end of a congressional session - so at most, one year.",
      "Trump recently said the Senate \"must agree\" to recess appointments, otherwise \"we will not be able to get people confirmed in a timely manner\". He noted that in his past administration, some of his nominees took multiple years to be confirmed.",
      "Trump's plan to use recess appointments, along with the announcement that Republican senators' support bypassing the Senate vetting process, is not without precedent.",
      "Some past presidents have employed the method liberally, often as a way of circumventing political divides that would slow nominations.",
      "George W Bush made 171 recess appointments, Bill Clinton made 139 and Barack Obama made at least 32, according to the Congressional Research Service (CRS).",
      "This method of getting nominees into office was virtually stopped after the Supreme Court ruled against Obama in 2014, striking down multiple recess appointments and calling them unconstitutional.",

      "Trump has full control of government - but he won't always get his way",
      "Why is Elon Musk becoming Donald Trump's efficiency tsar?",
      "Josh Chafetz, a constitutional law professor at Georgetown University, says recess appointments are \"not meant to be a mechanism for circumventing Senate consent\".",
      "While other presidents have used them, Prof Chafetz says: \"I can't think of an instance in which the Senate majority has triggered a recess simply so that a president could make recess appointments.\"",
      "When can Trump make recess appointments?",
      "According to Professor Chafetz, there are two paths Trump could take to making recess appointments.",
      "The first would involve the Senate agreeing to recess for 10 days or more by majority vote.",
      "The second would involve the House voting for a longer recess than the Senate, which would allow Trump to invoke a never-used constitutional power to adjourn both chambers of Congress.",
      "According to the US Constitution, \"in Case of Disagreement\" a president can adjourn both chambers of Congress until \"such Time as he shall think proper\" - which would then provide Trump an opportunity to make recess appointments.",
      "Trump previously threatened to use this power when he was in the White House.",
      "In 2020, during a pandemic briefing, Trump said that he would \"exercise my constitutional authority to adjourn both chambers of Congress\u201d to make recess appointments if his nominees before Congress were not approved.",
      "Professor Chafetz stressed that this route has never been used before in US history, and so \"no-one is quite sure how it would work\".",
      "He added that Trump cannot make any recess appointments until he is president. His inauguration is scheduled for 20 January.",
      "If Trump wishes for the Senate to recess for a period longer than 10 days, he would require the unanimous consent of all 100 lawmakers.",
      "But the chamber includes 47 Democrats, all or most of whom will vote to block the change.",
      "In order to override that blockade, Republicans need a 60-vote majority, which means winning support from all 53 of their members and at least seven Democrats.",
      "With Republicans unlikely to reach that threshold, they will be faced with rolling back a procedural tool known as the filibuster. Incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune, like his predecessor Mitch McConnell, has already indicated he does not support setting such a precedent.",

      "\"We know that on day one he is going to launch the largest mass deportation of illegal immigrants in American history,\" she said.",
      "In the week since his re-election, Trump has prioritised filling leadership positions that would oversee immigration, suggesting he is preparing to tackle his plans for border policy early.",
      "He tapped veteran immigration official Tom Homan as his \"border tsar\"; selected South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem to oversee homeland security; and appointed Steven Miller as White House deputy chief of staff for policy. Mr Miller is best known for shaping some of Trump's most restrictive policies on illegal immigration during his first term.",
      "Any mass deportation programme could face logistical difficulties as well as a flurry of legal challenges from immigration and human rights activists.",
      "Trump could also re-implement his \"Remain in Mexico\" policy that required asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while claims are processed.",
      "President Joe Biden had called the programme \"inhumane\" and tried to end it on his first day in office, but faced legal challenges. In 2022, the Supreme Court allowed him to move ahead.",
      "During the Trump administration, about 70,000 asylum seekers were returned to Mexico to wait for their hearings.",
      "Another day one promise was to end birthright citizenship - the 150-year-old principle that says anyone born on US soil is an American citizen.",
      "It's not clear how Trump plans to achieve this policy. He has pledged an executive order but birthright citizenship is explicitly guaranteed by the US Constitution, meaning it can only be altered under specific circumstances.",
      "He would need states to agree to a national convention or a two-thirds vote in favour in the narrowly split Congress to propose a change, then subsequent approval by three-fourths of state legislatures - of which Republicans control just over half.",

      "\"Oh, absolutely, I would. If they're innocent, I would pardon them,\" Trump said during a panel at the National Association of Black Journalists.",
      "US presidents have wide authority to forgive people convicted of federal crimes or end their prison sentences. Prosecutors may also decide to drop pending cases depending on who Trump might choose to pardon.",
      "What's less clear is who might get a pardon.",
      "At one point, Trump told CNN: \"I am inclined to pardon many of them. I can't say for every single one, because a couple of them, probably they got out of control.\"",
      "Ms Leavitt told the Washington Post that he will decide \u201con a case-by-case basis when he is back in the White House\u201d.",
      "More than 1,500 people were arrested in connection with the Capitol riot. According to federal numbers, more than 750 of them were sentenced for crimes ranging from trespassing to assaulting police officers and seditious conspiracy.",
      "Jack Smith",
      "Trump has also faced his own legal challenges over his actions following the 2020 election and a separate classified documents case.",
      "Special Counsel Jack Smith, a veteran prosecutor appointed to oversee the US Department of Justice's investigations into Trump, filed charges, to which the president-elect has pleaded not guilty.",
      "This week, sources told CBS News that Mr Smith plans to resign before Trump takes office and avoid Trump's promises to fire him. The BBC's US media partner also reported that his office would wind down the two cases it was pursuing against Trump.",

      "\"I would fire him within two seconds. He\u2019ll be one of the first things addressed,\" he said in an interview in October.",
      "Trump regularly railed against the special counsel in interviews and online, calling him a \"crooked person\", a \"scoundrel\" and other insults.",

      "President Joe Biden made rejoining the agreement one of his top priorities when he ran against Trump in 2020. Biden signed a letter requesting the US be readmitted on his first day in office.",
      "How will Trump respond in his second term? Media reports suggest that his team is preparing orders to withdraw once again when he takes office in January.",
      "Leaving the agreement would mean the US is no longer beholden to meeting set carbon emissions reductions.",
      "Among other priorities at odds with the Paris standards, Trump has said he wants to prioritise US production of oil and gas. He promised to quickly expedite permitting and fracking - \"We\u2019re drilling, drilling, drilling,\" he told Fox News host Sean Hannity last year.",
      "Trump has also criticised the Biden administration's plans to expand wind energy and increase electric car production, which could be early targets in his new administration.",
      "Russia and Ukraine",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump said he could end the war in Ukraine \"in a day\". He has also repeatedly criticised the US government's continued support of Ukraine, casting the war as a drain on resources.",

      "The economy is an issue that Trump heavily campaigned on, vowing to end inflation as soon as he takes office.",
      "\u201cWe will target everything from car affordability to housing affordability to insurance costs to supply chain issues,\u201d Trump has said.",
      "\u201cI will instruct my cabinet that I expect results within the first 100 days, or much sooner than that.\u201d",
      "He said he would sign an executive order that directs every cabinet secretary and agency head to \u201cuse every tool and authority at their disposal\u201d to defeat inflation and to bring consumer prices down.",
      "Trump\u2019s plan includes imposing tariffs on imported goods, especially those coming in from China, arguing that these taxes would keep manufacturing jobs in the US.",
      "It\u2019s still unclear how widespread these tariffs will be, but Trump has raised the prospect of at least a 10% across-the-board tariff on imported goods, as well as a 60% import tax on goods from China.",
      "He also vowed to target Mexico with his tariffs.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to inform (the Mexican president) on Day 1 or sooner that if they don\u2019t stop this onslaught of criminals and drugs coming into our country, I\u2019m going to immediately impose a 25% tariff on everything they send into the US,\u201d he has said.",
      "These tariffs would probably not need congressional approval.",
      "Trump already introduced tariffs in his first term, citing Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which empowers a president to impose duties on goods that could affect US national security.",
      "Another promise is to \u201cend the Biden-Harris war on American energy\u201d, Trump has said, vowing to ramp up oil drilling and fracking as a way to lower the cost of energy bills for consumers.",
      "Trump can do this with an executive order that rolls back environmental protections, which would allow him to halt clean energy projects and scrap climate targets set by the Biden administration.",
      "The president-elect has also vowed to fire Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, on day one. Gensler, who was appointed by Biden, pushed for climate disclosure rules and strong enforcement of the cryptocurrency market.",
      "Trump has championed cryptocurrency, and his election saw the value of Bitcoin go up by 30% in the past week due to an expectation that his administration will be more crypto-friendly.",
      "Title X",
      "Donald Trump has vowed to undo the changes made by President Biden to Title X, the country\u2019s only national, federally-funded family planning programme.",
      "In 2019, during his first term, Trump\u2019s administration implemented a new rule that prohibited any health provider in the Title X network from mentioning abortion to patients, even if a patient raised questions about it themselves.",
      "The change effectively stripped tens of millions of dollars from organisations such as Planned Parenthood that offer or refer patients for abortions.",
      "But just months later, when Biden took office, he had that policy reversed.",
      "Now, it\u2019s expected that Trump will change the rules again.",

      "Ramaswamy, meanwhile, has put forward plans to scrap a number of federal departments including the Department of Education, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Internal Revenue Service and the FBI.",
      "Railing against regulation",
      "Musk has cast his plans to optimise government efficiency in heroic terms, pointing to his hopes of one day colonising Mars, while arguing that the feat would only be possible \"so long as it is not smothered by bureaucracy\".",
      "At the time, he said creating the new Doge was \"the only path to extending life beyond Earth\".",
      "Any major cuts to government agencies could also have potentially significant implications for his business interests, which are closely entwined with the government.",
      "Rocket firm SpaceX alone has more than $8bn-worth of ongoing contracts with the US government, according to public contracting sites, and could stand to benefit further from closer government ties.",
      "Meanwhile, his electric car company Tesla is facing investigations from numerous government agencies over issues such as the safety of its self-driving features. His desire to cut regulation could affect such probes.",
      "In recent years, Musk has repeatedly accused regulators of launching trivial probes and standing in the way of his companies.",
      "In September he threatened to sue the Federal Aviation Administration over its plans to fine his SpaceX company $633,000 for alleged licence infringements related to some of its rocket launches from Cape Canaveral in Florida. He accused the agency of \"regulatory overreach\".",
      "Musk \"stands to benefit personally from a lot of the deregulation that he touts,\" says Christopher Phelps, a professor of modern US political history, adding: \"I think putting someone who is a billionaire and runs major corporations in charge of a federal project of deregulation is innately full of conflicts of interest.\"",
      "Others said Musk, who has long described himself as having a libertarian bent, appeared to be a true believer in the benefits of smaller government.",
      "\"There\u2019s no doubt that Musk has significant vested interests in the US regulatory landscape as a result of his many business enterprises,\" says Thomas Gift, a political science professor and director of the Centre on US Politics at University College London.",
      "\"At the same time, it\u2019s hard to make the case that this is the only impetus driving him.",
      "\"Musk has undertaken huge personal and political risks in coming out for Trump, and many of his activities and rhetoric seem to reflect an individual ideologically committed to causes he believes in.\"",
      "\"Clearly he has got skin in the game and there\u2019s a self-interest, but equally you can have a sincere belief that there is too much government regulation and too much government bureaucracy,\" says Alex Waddan, a professor of US politics at the University of Leicester.",
      "Reward for loyalty",
      "For years, Musk did not play a big role in politics, despite his large fortune, now worth more than $300bn, according to Forbes estimates.",

      "He formally endorsed Trump this year after an assassination attempt, ultimately donating more than $100m (\u00a379m) to Trump's 2024 presidential campaign and appearing at numerous rallies.",
      "Prof Phelps describes Musk's relationship with Trump as \"transactional\", adding that the new role \"gives him a lot of symbolic clout - and possibly the clout to get the things that matter most to him done\".",
      "As the South African-born billionaire is not a US citizen by birth, Musk cannot become president - something that has frustrated other famous faces who became involved in politics in the past.",
      "But he can have an influence on US policy, and Trump will have a sympathetic adviser to call upon.",
      "\"Trump is looking to surround himself with loyalists in his new administration, and there\u2019s no-one who\u2019s been more loyal than Musk since he announced his endorsement for Trump,\" says Prof Gift.",
      "\"Not only did Musk go 'all in' in supporting Trump personally and financially during the campaign, but he\u2019s also evolved into a trusted adviser on topics as diverse as technology policy to the war in Ukraine.\"",
      "In an early sign of the influence the tech entrepreneur may be rewarded with for his loyalty, Musk was party to a call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky following the election. The war in Ukraine will be a major foreign policy concern when Trump takes office.",
      "\"That is actually quite extraordinary,\" says Prof Waddan. \"Normally, even your biggest donors wouldn\u2019t get that kind of access.\"",
      "What is the Department of Government Efficiency?",
      "Musk first raised the idea of a cost-cutting effort while hosting Trump on X this summer. The official name is a winking reference to a meme featuring a Shiba Inu dog, which then gave its name to the cryptocurrency Dogecoin, a favourite of Musk that has seen its value soar since the election.",
      "Prof Phelps says the name is \"a nod to crypto deregulation being part of what they\u2019ll do\".",
      "But it is not clear how much of Musk's talk of cutting might actually become reality.",
      "For one thing, the new department will not have an official role, but provide \"advice and guidance from outside government\", according to the announcement.",
      "Experts have also warned that cuts of the scale discussed could be enormously disruptive - and face pushback in Congress - depending on how rapidly they are implemented.",
      "Musk himself acknowledged the risks, saying Americans should be ready to stomach temporary hardship for long-run gain.",
      "The way he has run his own firms may hint at what Americans can expect.",
      "After his October 2022 takeover of the social media platform Twitter - which he branded as X - Musk introduced radical changes, including the reduction X's workforce from around 8,000 to 1,500 in a matter of weeks.",
      "\"His idea of efficiency was to let a lot of people go,\" says Alex Waddan, a professor of US politics at the University of Leicester.",
      "Musk also loosened content moderation, stopped verifying accounts and welcomed users back to the platform who had been banned for violating its rules on hate speech and disinformation.",
      "Among the users he reinstated was Trump, who had been banned following the Capitol riot in January 2021 after continuing to claim the 2020 election had been rigged against him.",
      "Critics argue his changes have given prominence to hate-speech and misinformation - though Musk maintains the site is politically neutral.",
      "The overhaul also prompted an exodus of advertisers - the main way the site has made money. Though Musk has introduced new ways to raise revenue, such as paid subscriptions, the company today is worth far less than the $44bn Musk paid for it just two years ago.",
      "His record at his other big companies - Tesla and SpaceX - is stronger.",
      "Among car companies, Tesla stands out for making electric vehicles at a large profit, thanks in part to streamlined operations. His rocket firm SpaceX is credited with enabling rocket launches at significantly lower cost.",
      "\"As a serial entrepreneur, Musk has been relentless in trying to improve institutional efficiency at his own enterprises,\" Prof Gift says.",
      "He adds that though Musk's primary role will be \"slashing through the thicket of red tape that is the US federal government\", his position will also give him influence in the new administration.",

      "The president-elect has announced nearly a dozen appointees, the first steps toward filling out his White House staff and key government departments. He also made comments to the media and on social media that highlight what his priorities will be upon taking office in January, with a special focus on immigration and foreign policy.",
      "After a sometimes chaotic start to his first term, Trump is laying the groundwork for his next administration with a more clearly defined plan - and personnel ready to enact it.",

      "A hard-line immigration team in place",
      "Some of Trump\u2019s newly revealed appointments suggest that the president-elect\u2019s campaign promise to deport millions of undocumented migrants living in the US is no exaggeration.",
      "Stephen Miller, who has been Trump\u2019s close adviser and speechwriter since 2015, is Trump\u2019s choice for White House deputy chief of staff for policy.  He will likely shape any plans for mass deportations - and pare back both undocumented and legal immigration. During Trump's first term, Miller was involved in developing some of the administration's strictest immigration policies.",
      "Thomas Homan, acting director of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency in Trump\u2019s first term, supported the president\u2019s policy of separating undocumented families detained at the US-Mexico border. Now he\u2019s back with an even broader portfolio, as Trump\u2019s \u201cimmigration tsar\u201d.",
      "\u201cI will run the biggest deportation force this country has ever seen,\u201d Homan said at a conservative conference in July.",
      "Critics have warned that Trump\u2019s mass deportation plan could cost upwards of $300bn. In an interview with NBC News last week, however, the president-elect said cost was not an issue.",
      "\u201cWhen people have killed and murdered, when drug lords have destroyed countries, and now they\u2019re going to go back to those countries because they\u2019re not staying here,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no price tag.\u201d",
      "How would Trump\u2019s promise of mass deportations of migrants work?",
      "How would Trump\u2019s promise of mass deportations of migrants work?",
      "China hawks take flight",
      "Many conservatives believe that China poses the single greatest threat to continued US global dominance, both economically and militarily. While Trump has been more circumspect, limiting most of his China critiques to the realm of trade, he is filling his foreign policy team with vocal China critics.",
      "The president-elect picked Florida Congressman Mike Waltz, a retired Army colonel, as his national security adviser \u2013 a key foreign policy post within the White House. Waltz has said the US is in a \u201ccold war\u201d with China and was one of the first members of Congress to call for a US boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.",
      "In October, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, Trump\u2019s pick for US ambassador to the UN, accused China of \u201cblatant and malicious election interference\u201d amid reports that China-backed hackers attempted to gather information from the former president\u2019s phones.",
      "While Trump has yet to officially name his choice for secretary of state, Florida Senator Marco Rubio \u2013 another China hawk \u2013 appears to be the leading contender for the top diplomatic job. In 2020, Rubio was sanctioned by the Chinese government after he pushed measures to punish the nation for its crackdown on pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong.",
      "US-China relations were often rocky during Trump's first term, amidst trade disputes and the Covid pandemic. The Biden administration, which kept many of Trump's China tariffs and imposed some new ones, only somewhat calmed the waters. Now it looks like the next Trump administration will pick up where the last one left off.",

      "Musk's new role",
      "While the list of Trump\u2019s political appointees grows, there\u2019s another group that stays small \u2013 and exceedingly influential.",
      "Elon Musk, the wealthiest man in the world, has been a full-time presence at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago transition headquarters. According to media reports, he is advising the president-elect on cabinet nominees and even joined a conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week.",
      "On Tuesday night, Trump announced that he was assigning Musk to work with tech entrepreneur and former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy in a \"department of government efficiency\" tasked with identifying new budget cuts.",
      "Musk has regularly offered his political opinions on his social media platform X, including endorsing Florida Senator Rick Scott\u2019s bid to be the next Senate majority leader.",
      "Musk\u2019s political action committee spent around $200m to help Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, and he promises to continue to fund the group\u2019s efforts to advance the president-elect\u2019s agenda and help Republican candidates in upcoming congressional elections.",
      "Meanwhile, it remains to be seen where Robert F Kennedy Jr, another key figure, lands. Trump has said that he plans to give the former Democrat and vaccine sceptic, who abandoned his independent bid and endorsed the Republican, a role in making America \u201chealthy\u201d again.",
      "\u201cHe wants to do some things, and we\u2019re going to let him go to it,\u201d Trump said in his election victory speech.",
      "Prioritising presidential power over Congress",
      "As Trump takes office, Republicans have control of the Senate and could still take the House, albeit by a slim margin. However, the president-elect\u2019s early actions suggest he is more concerned with exercising his presidential power than working with the legislative branch.",
      "Last week, he posted on social media that the Senate\u2019s Republican leadership should smooth the way for more presidential \u201crecess appointments\u201d \u2013 allowing him to fill top administration jobs without Senate approval when Congress is not in session. The move would strengthen presidential power by undercutting the chamber\u2019s constitutional role to \u201cadvise and consent\u201d on political appointees.",
      "Meanwhile, the president-elect keeps chipping away at those narrow congressional majorities. Senators who move to administration roles can quickly be replaced by appointment from the governor of their home state. But any House vacancies \u2013 such as ones created by Stefanik and Waltz\u2019s departures \u2013 require special elections that can take months to schedule.",
      "Some of Trump\u2019s advisers, including Musk, have warned that the president-elect could be endangering his legislative agenda if he plucks too many more Republicans from the chambers.",
      "Even in the best of circumstances, congressional legislation takes time, effort and compromise. Executive action, such as new immigration enforcement, can be done with the stroke of a presidential pen.",
      "Trump\u2019s actions indicate he is, at least at the moment, more focused on the latter.",
      "Rewarding loyalists",
      "Trump has only just begun filling out the thousands of jobs that open up with a new presidential administration, not including the senior-level career bureaucrats he has said he will replace.",
      "In 2016, as a political newcomer, he had to rely on more establishment Republicans for key roles. This time, he has a wealth of prospective candidates with proven track records of supporting him and after eight years, Trump loyalists are the Republican establishment.",
      "On Tuesday, Trump named South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem as homeland security secretary, and Fox News host and conservative author Pete Hegseth as defence secretary.",
      "The latter has been particularly controversial, given his lack of experience navigating the sprawling US military bureaucracy and penchant for inflammatory remarks. For Trump, however, status as an outsider and a willingness to lean into hot-button cultural issues are a strength, not a flaw.",
      "And above all else, Hegseth and Noem have been fierce Trump defenders from the start.",
      "Some of Trump\u2019s other picks, like Rubio and Stefanik, were critics of Trump early in his first presidential bid, but they have now spent years demonstrating that their harsh words are a thing of the past.",
      "Rubio, who ran for president against Trump in 2016, may still have White House ambitions, however. Trump often soured on appointees who seemed drawn to the limelight during his first term, and even the warmest of relationships could go bad.",
      "Trump may be placing a premium on loyalty with his early staff announcements, but the pressures of governing ultimately will reveal whether his second four years in office end up different from his first.",

      "\u201cBy the time I came home, people were taking what they could out of their home,\u201d Komal says. She grabbed books, laundry, anything she could carry, but remembers thinking that with their house so far above the water there was no way it could be affected.",

    "summary": "Citizen activists are taking unusual steps to push authorities for better pedestrian infrastructure.",
    "story": [
      "In India, if you ask a pedestrian how many obstacles they've encountered on a footpath, they may not be able to count them - but they'll certainly tell you that most footpaths are in poor condition.",
      "This is what Arun Pai says he learnt when he started asking people about their experience walking on the streets of his city, Bengaluru (formerly Bangalore), in southern India.",
      "This month he set up a \"fun challenge\" - called the 'world's longest footpath run' - which invited people to walk or jog on an 11km (8 miles) stretch of footpath and make a note of all the obstacles they encountered, like hawkers, garbage or broken slabs of concrete. Next, they were asked to rate the footpath on a scale of one to five.",
      "\"When you have specifics, it gets easier to ask the authorities to take action. Instead of telling your local politician \"the footpaths are bad\", you can ask him or her \"to fix specific spots on a street,\" Mr Pai says.",
      "Mr Pai, who is the founder of Bangalore Walks, a non-profit that promotes walking, is among several citizen activists who are pushing to make the country's roads more pedestrian-friendly.",
      "In India's capital, a tour company called Delhi by Cycle has been advocating for making the city more cycle-friendly and walkable. These walking-enthusiasts are holding awareness walks, building walking apps and lobbying with politicians to make a change.",
      "Even in India's biggest cities, proper footpaths are few and far between and they are often overrun by hawkers and shops, parked vehicles and even cattle. In some places, they double up as homes for the poor.",
      "Even footpaths that exist are often not built to standard or properly maintained. Navigating roads on foot through crowds and traffic can be a nightmare.",
      "Last month, Walking Project, a citizen's group in India's financial capital, Mumbai, released a 'pedestrian manifesto' ahead of Maharashtra state elections to highlight the poor condition of the city's roads and encourage local politicians to take action.",
      "The manifesto included demands for better parking, designated hawking zones, pedestrian-friendly corridors on arterial roads and to make footpaths more accessible to those with mobility challenges.",
      "\"Government statistics show that almost 50% of the city's population relies on walking, which is far greater than the 11% that uses private transport and the combined 15% that uses tuk-tuks and buses,\" says Vendant Mhatre, convener of Walking Project.",
      "\"And yet, pedestrians are the most ignored group of users when it comes to framing policies around transport or road safety,\" he adds.",
      "According to the latest government estimates on road accidents, pedestrian fatalities were the second-highest after those of two-wheeler riders. In 2022, over 10,000 pedestrians lost their lives on national highways across the country, with around 21,000 more sustaining injuries in accidents.",
      "\"Authorities often resort to band-aid solutions like adding speed bumps or a signal to curb road accidents. But what is really needed is inter-connected footpaths that can accommodate high footfall,\" Mr Mhatre says.",
      "Studies have found that addressing the problems of this forgotten group of road users can reap benefits for multiple stakeholders.",
      "In 2019, researchers in the southern city of Chennai studied the impact the construction of new footpaths on 100km (62 miles) of the city's streets had on the environment, economy and the health and safety of citizens.",
      "They found that the new footpaths encouraged 9% to 27% of the surveyed respondents to walk instead of using motorized transport, which led to a reduction in greenhouse gases and particulate matter. They also learned that the footpaths provided new opportunities for women and lower-income groups, helping them save money as well.",
      "The survey highlighted how people with disabilities and women might have nuanced requirements from footpaths and that tailoring improvements to meet their needs could enhance accessibility and equity.",
      "\"Very often, people don't have a benchmark for footpath quality, especially if they haven't travelled abroad or been exposed to places that have good facilities for pedestrians,\" Mr Mhatre says. He reasons that that's why there isn't enough outrage about the quality or absence of footpaths in the country.",
      "He also points out that most people see walking as an activity performed for leisure or exercise. And so, the infrastructure they associate with walking stops at gardens or walking tracks. In reality, however, people walk to various destinations daily, so the scope of walking infrastructure is far broader.",
      "\"Walking is the most economical and environment-friendly way to navigate one's city and it's high time our leaders paid as much attention to walking infrastructure as they do to public transport,\" Mr Mhatre says.",
      "Geetam Tiwari, a professor of civil engineering, says that the main problem is that too much focus is given to solving the problem of car congestion on roads.",
      "\"To improve the flow of traffic, authorities often narrow down footpaths or eliminate them entirely,\" she says. Ms Tiwari says that this approach is problematic because doing so makes it difficult for pedestrians to access public transport systems, like buses and metros, which can take the pressure off the roads.",
      "\"It might seem counter-intuitive, but allowing the congestion to persist and focussing on improving infrastructure for pedestrians will help solve the traffic problem in the long run,\" she says.",
      "Ms Tiwari also says that the federal government should make it mandatory for states to implement the guidelines issued by the Indian Road Congress -  a national organisation that lays down designing standards for roads and highways.",
      "She says that cities can also implement their own Non-Motorised Transport Policy (NMTP) to create better infrastructure for cyclists and pedestrians.",
      "\"At the moment, only a handful of cities in India have experimented with a NMTP but its time more cities step up to the plate,\" she adds.",

      "Ms Kaumba wore Mbuya\u2019s top and \"chitenge\" - a piece of patterned cloth wrapped around the waist. And Mbuya\u2019s first outfit was a silver pantsuit.",
      "\"I thought it would be nice to dress up Mbuya in high fashion and then take photographs of her in her natural habitat,\" Ms Kaumba tells the BBC.",
      "That natural habitat is a farm in the village of 10 Miles, just north of the Zambian capital, Lusaka.",
      "Most often Ms Chola is photographed in all her glamour outside - often sitting on an elegant wooden chair or lounging on a leather sofa.",
      "In the background are exposed brick buildings with corrugated iron roofs, ploughed fields, mango trees and maize crops.",
      "\"I was so nervous when I posted that first photo. I left my phone for 10 minutes and in those 10 minutes there were 1,000 likes,\" Ms Kaumba says.",
      "\"My mind was blown. The comments were flying in and people were asking for more.\"",
      "It was in April 2024 that the Granny Series really took off - after Ms Kaumba posted a series of photos of her grandmother in a red Adidas dress, several chunky, golden necklaces and a glittering jewelled crown.",
      "\"It surprised me to hear that so many people around the world love me,\" Ms Chola says - who does not know her exact age because she does not have a birth certificate.",
      "\"I didn\u2019t know I could make such an impact at this age.\"",
      "Ms Chola poses in clothes that are a mix of vibrant colours, textures and styles.",
      "From a green American football jersey, combined with a layered frilly red dress styled as a skirt - in the colours of the Zambian flag to pay homage to 60 years of independence.",
      "To a blue, black and green sequined top, complete with a golden snake necklace and bracelet.",
      "And Mbuya\u2019s personal favourite - jeans, a graphic T-shirt with her image on the front and a blonde wig.",
      "\"I had never worn jeans or a wig before - so I was happy, and I was dancing.\"",
      "Ms Kaumba, who has been a stylist since 2012, says that her grandma has \"courage, grace - and nails every look\".",
      "All the looks reflect her maximalist-chic aesthetic - which celebrates the joy of excess, eclectic combinations, the big and the bold, and clashing patterns and colours.",
      "At the heart of it all are eye-catching accessories - bold sunglasses, oversized hats, necklaces, bracelets, pendants, rings, gloves, bags, blonde wigs, crowns.",
      "That influence has come directly from her grandmother, who has \"always been a lover of pearls and bangles\".",
      "In one particularly playful scene called GOAT - short for greatest of all time - Ms Chola appears with a goat - that is decked out in Mbuya\u2019s beloved pearls.",
      "Other accessories also reflect Chola\u2019s personality and story.",
      "In some shots Mbuya is holding the beloved radio that she carries around all day and takes to bed with her.",
      "Or she\u2019s clutching an \"ibende\" - a long wooden stick that over the years she has used to pound millet or cassava or maize.",
      "She is smoking a pipe or holding a metal cup full of tea, and hanging off the edge of the chair arm is an \"mbaula\" or charcoal brazier that Zambians often use for cooking - especially now that the country is plagued by severe power cuts.",
      "Ms Kaumba hopes that the Granny Series will highlight that older people still have a lot to offer - and making memories together is an important way to \"leave footprints for the next generation\".",
      "\"Do not write them off, love them just the same till the end because remember we will be just like them one day.\"",
      "As a result of Mbuya\u2019s photo shoots, Ms Kaumba\u2019s been hired by four granddaughters to style their grandmothers - aged between 70 and 96.",
      "Ms Chola hopes that the Granny Series will inspire people \"to live their lives and not worry about being judged by society\".",
      "She urges people to \"always forgive yourself for whatever mistakes you made. You can never change your past - but you can change your future\".",
      "The photo shoots have brought granddaughter and grandmother closer - and through their special bond Ms Kaumba has learnt so much more about her Mbuya\u2019s often difficult life.",
      "Ms Chola was raised by her grandparents, went to school until she was 12 or 13 and then, because of economic reasons, was forced to marry a man in his 30s.",
      "She had three children, ended up drinking heavily and eventually escaped the marriage.",
      "That trauma still haunts her - but her unexpected global fame has given her a new lease on life.",

    "published": "Sun, 17 Nov 2024 01:13:31 GMT",
    "summary": "Some pioneers see it as opportunity but others fear the continent's creativity will be stripped for profit.",
    "story": [
      "Described as a virtual singer powered by artificial intelligence (AI), Mya Blue says: \"I am not the enemy, I am just a music lover exploring the different sounds of the world.\"",
      "Her Instagram account, where she makes this statement, has the tag line: \"I may not be human but I sing from my soul\" - and is the creation of Nigerian musician and producer Eclipse Nkasi.",
      "She features in his recently released remix of Joromi, a classic tune by the late Nigerian highlife artist Sir Victor Uwaifo.",
      "She and her creator want to calm the fears that many musicians the world over have about the impact of AI on the music industry.",
      "Earlier this year, for example, high-profile artists such as Billie Eilish and Nicki Minaj called for a halt to the \"predatory\" use of AI tools which they say steal artists' voices.",
      "And given a lack of understanding about AI throughout Africa, and the fact that AI tends to rely on data sources collated in the West, there are concerns about how African music and cultural heritage will be affected.",
      "But there are many African artists and industry professionals who are excited about the possibilities this emerging technology offers.",
      "Indeed Nkasi says the fact that AI is in its infancy in Africa may be a boon for the continent.",
      "\"There is a huge threat, but just saying: 'Let\u2019s abolish AI' is not going to work - there are too many countries and people invested,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"The best thing we can do is figure out better ways to use it.\"",
      "The 33-year-old is determined to be that pioneer and last year also produced the continent\u2019s first AI-powered music album Infinite Echoes.",
      "Nkasi says he has intentionally taken a manual and creative approach to using AI in his music, primarily using it to generate samples.",
      "\"My biggest drive with AI is its application, finding healthy ways to apply it. With each project it was important to find something that it did that moved the needle forward,\" he says.",
      "But while Nkasi is happy to experiment with the new technology, some see it as a threat to African culture.",
      "For Kenyan musician and producer Tabu Osusa, it heralds the risk of cultural appropriation - with AI passing off African sounds without acknowledging their source.",
      "This is because AI is able to quickly create new compositions by learning from existing music.",
      "\"My problem with AI is the ownership. Once you have taken some music from Ghana or Nigeria, who owns that music? How would you find out where the original creators are and ensure they are credited? It\u2019s theft for me through the backroom,\" Osusa told the BBC.",
      "\"Due to unregulated sampling methods by musicians, AI will enable recording company moguls in the West to make colossal sums of money while leaving some creatives in African villages to languish in abject poverty.\"",
      "This fear is reflected in a report released last year by Creatives Garage, a Kenya-based arts platform which worked in collaboration with the Mozilla Foundation to study the impact of AI on the East African nation\u2019s creative communities.",
      "It revealed that most Kenyan musicians were anxious that AI could lead to others benefitting from their creativity, says Bukonola Ngobi, research consultant at Creatives Garage.",
      "The study also warned that AI\u2019s power to store data might sound the death knell for the culture around traditional music.",
      "One musician even questioned whether recording and storing traditional sounds for AI to replicate might be a disincentive for local artists to continue to learn traditional instruments, Ngobi says.",
      "Osusa goes even further: \"In Africa we mostly don\u2019t study music, we are born with it. We live it. It\u2019s very spiritual. Music in Africa is always alive. It\u2019s so dynamic. That shouldn\u2019t be taken away from us.\"",
      "Yet the report did show that for those with access to tech devices, AI not only provided creative music development but also the chance to develop cheaper marketing and design services.",
      "Although this would be no help for emerging artists from Africa\u2019s poorer communities - and might raise the barrier to pursuing a music career, warned Ngobi.",
      "\"If you don\u2019t have a laptop to start off with or you\u2019re a musician in an environment where there is no internet connectivity then how will you participate?\" she told the BBC.",
      "For those wanting to innovate, one of the problems Africa faces is the lack of data from the continent to dictate algorithms. Searches are often shaped by Western biases which decrease the accuracy and quality of work produced by AI for African musicians.",
      "For example, when Nkasi created Mya Blue using AI, he faced issues with her imagery - the artist presents as a Gen Z American girl with blue hair.",
      "\"AI is very limited in how it understands and perceives my space,\" he says.",
      "But the Nigerian musician views this as an opportunity for human contribution: \"The limits we Africans experience with AI can be a good thing.",
      "\"One can argue that right now, while AI can\u2019t give the very detailed African sound, there\u2019s still room for the guy who can play it. So I\u2019m not sure what we\u2019re really fighting for when we consider that a problem.\"",
      "Fellow Nigerian Emmanuel Ogala, the boss of AI-powered company Josplay, definitely sees the opportunities for Africa.",
      "His company uses AI models to collate detailed metadata and intelligence to create archives of the continent\u2019s diverse music heritage.",
      "\"African music is really complex and it\u2019s one of the most understudied types of music,\" he told the BBC.",
      "This was reflected at the MTV Video Music Awards in September, when South African musician Tyla won the award for the Best Afrobeats song for her hit Water.",
      "During her acceptance speech she hit out against the tendency of Western award bodies to group all African artists under the umbrella of \"Afrobeats\" - a genre of music more associated with Nigeria and West Africa.",
      "\"African music is so diverse,\" she said. \"It\u2019s more than just Afrobeats. I come from South Africa. I represent amapiano. I represent my culture.\"",
      "Ogala feels AI would address such homogenisation and benefit African musicians by revealing to the world more of the continent\u2019s cultural diversity.",
      "\"A lot of the academics we speak to have knowledge that is very specific about a very small area of African music. You have to build for an African audience taking note of how fragmented our listening culture is. You just cannot humanly do that,\" he says.",
      "As AI continues to develop, there is consensus among African music artists, producers and researchers that there needs to be better financing.",
      "\"We need investment in the data infrastructure for the opportunities it presents to really be leveraged by people,\" says Ngobi.",
      "Ogala agrees and says that raising funds to develop his digital archive AI tool is difficult.",
      "\"We, the founders, have been funding the project out of our pockets because of our belief in the industry. If we put in place the fundamental building blocks, the industry will be a lot more viable than it is now.\"",
      "Added to this are the uncertainties around copyright legislation written for a pre-AI era which will need to be renegotiated. Copyright is already a huge issue for African artists whose music is often pirated, sold and played on the continent without them earning anything.",
      "These challenges aside, there is a growing realisation that unless the African music industry embraces the new technology, it is in danger of losing control of its talent and heritage.",
      "And Nkasi\u2019s Mya Blue certainly has big ambitions.",
      "During a Q&A on her Instagram, replying to a question about whether she could win a Grammy, she said: \"Who knows. As an AI [artist], I don\u2019t dream of trophies, but of resonating with hearts through music. But wouldn\u2019t it be fun to see a virtual artist on that stage?\"",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 22:38:25 GMT",
    "summary": "A new China-backed megaport in Peru may create whole new trade routes that will bypass North America entirely.",
    "story": [
      "As the world waits to see how the return of Donald Trump will reshape relations between Washington and Beijing, China has just taken decisive action to entrench its position in Latin America.",
      "Trump won the US presidential election on a platform that promised tariffs as high as 60% on Chinese-made goods. Further south, though, a new China-backed megaport has the potential to create whole new trade routes that will bypass North America entirely.",
      "President Xi Jinping himself attended the inauguration of the Chancay port on the Peruvian coast this week, an indication of just how seriously China takes the development.",
      "Xi was in Peru for the annual meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation Forum (Apec). But all eyes were on Chancay and what it says about China's growing assertiveness in a region that the US has traditionally seen as its sphere of influence.",
      "As seasoned observers see it, Washington is now paying the price for years of indifference towards its neighbours and their needs.",
      "\"The US has been absent from Latin America for so long, and China has moved in so rapidly, that things have really reconfigured in the past decade,\" says Monica de Bolle, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.",
      "\"You have got the backyard of America engaging directly with China,\" she tells the BBC. \"That's going to be problematic.\"",
      "Even before it opened, the $3.5bn (\u00a32.75bn) project, masterminded by China's state-owned Cosco Shipping, had already turned a once-sleepy Peruvian fishing town into a logistical powerhouse set to transform the country's economy.",
      "China's official Communist Party newspaper, the People's Daily, called it \"a vindication of China-Peru win-win co-operation\".",
      "Peru's President Dina Boluarte was similarly enthusiastic, describing the megaport as a \"nerve centre\" that would provide \"a point of connection to access the gigantic Asian market\".",
      "But the implications go far beyond the fortunes of one small Andean nation. Once Chancay is fully up and running, goods from Chile, Ecuador, Colombia and even Brazil are expected to pass through it on their way to Shanghai and other Asian ports.",
      "China already has considerable appetite for the region's exports, including Brazilian soybeans and Chilean copper. Now this new port will be able to handle larger ships, as well as cutting shipping times from 35 to 23 days.",
      "However, the new port will favour imports as well as exports. As signs grow that an influx of cheap Chinese goods bought online may be undermining domestic industry, Chile and Brazil have scrapped tax exemptions for individual customers on low-value foreign purchases.",
      "As nervous US military hawks have pointed out, if Chancay can accommodate ultra-large container vessels, it can also handle Chinese warships.",
      "The most strident warnings have come from Gen Laura Richardson, who has just retired as chief of US Southern Command, which covers Latin America and the Caribbean.",
      "She has accused China of \"playing the \u2018long game\u2019 with its development of dual-use sites and facilities throughout the region\", adding that those sites could serve as \"points of future multi-domain access for the [People's Liberation Army] and strategic naval chokepoints\".",
      "Even if that prospect never materialises, there is a strong perception that the US is losing ground in Latin America as China forges ahead with its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).",
      "Outgoing US President Joe Biden was among the leaders at the Apec summit, on his first and last visit to South America during his four-year term. Media commentators remarked that he cut a diminished figure next to China's Xi.",
      "Prof \u00c1lvaro M\u00e9ndez, director of the Global South Unit at the London School of Economics, points out that while the US was taking Latin America for granted, Xi was visiting the region regularly and cultivating good relations.",
      "\"The bar has been set so low by the US that China only has to be a little bit better to get through the door,\" he says.",
      "Of course, Latin America is not the only part of the world targeted by the BRI. Since 2023, China's unprecedented infrastructure splurge has pumped money into nearly 150 countries worldwide.",
      "The results have not always been beneficial, with many projects left unfinished, while many developing countries that signed up for Beijing's largesse have found themselves burdened with debt as a result.",
      "Even so, left-wing and right-wing governments alike have cast aside their initial suspicions of China, because \"their interests are aligned\" with those of Beijing, says the Peterson Institute's Ms de Bolle: \"They have lowered their guard out of sheer necessity.\"",
      "Ms de Bolle says the US is right to feel threatened by this turn of events, since Beijing has now established \"a very strong foothold\" in the region at a time when president-elect Trump wants to \"rein in\" China.",
      "\"I think we will finally start to see the US putting pressure on Latin America because of China,\" she says, adding that most countries want to stay on the right side of both big powers.",
      "\"The region doesn't have to choose unless it's put in a position where they are forced to, and that would be very dumb.\"",
      "Looking ahead, South American countries such as Peru, Chile and Colombia would be vulnerable to pressure because of the bilateral free trade agreements they have with the US, which Trump could seek to renegotiate or even tear up.",
      "They will be watching keenly to see what happens to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which is up for review in July 2026, but will be subject to negotiations during 2025.",
      "Whatever happens, Prof M\u00e9ndez of the LSE feels that the region needs more co-operation.",
      "\"It shouldn't be that all roads lead to Beijing or to Washington. Latin America has to find a more strategic way, it needs a coherent regional strategy,\" he says, pointing to the difficulty of getting 33 countries to agree a joint approach.",
      "Eric Farnsworth, vice-president at the Washington-based Council of the Americas, feels that there is still much goodwill towards the US in Latin America, but the region's \"massive needs\" are not being met by its northern neighbour.",
      "\"The US needs to up its game in the region, because people would choose it if there was a meaningful alternative to China,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Unlike many others, he sees some rays of hope from the incoming Trump administration, especially with the appointment of Marco Rubio as secretary of state.",
      "\"Rubio has a real sense of a need to engage economically with the Western Hemisphere in a way that we just haven't done for a number of years,\" he says.",
      "But for successive US leaders, Latin America has been seen primarily in terms of illegal migration and illegal drugs. And with Trump fixated on plans to deport record numbers of immigrants, there is little indication that the US will change tack any time soon.",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 00:46:38 GMT",
    "summary": "A new study finds that caste plays a vital role in high rates of stunting in children in India.",
    "story": [
      "Decades of caste discrimination have contributed to India having higher levels of child stunting rates than across Sub-Saharan Africa, new research has revealed.",
      "The two regions together are home to 44% of the world\u2019s under-five population but account for about 70% of stunted children globally - a key indicator of malnutrition.",
      "But, while both have made significant strides in recent years, India\u2019s rate stands at 35.7%, with the average across Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s 49 countries at 33.6%.",
      "A child is considered stunted when they fall short of the expected height for their age - a clear sign of critical nutritional gaps.",
      "However, the study by Ashwini Deshpande (Ashoka University) and Rajesh Ramachandran (Monash University, Malaysia) found that focusing only on the height gap - or why Indian children are shorter than children in Sub-Saharan Africa - overlooks an important factor: the crucial role of social identity, especially caste, in child malnutrition in India.",
      "The first 1,000 days of a child's life, often called the \"golden period\", are pivotal: by age two, 80% of the brain develops, laying the foundation for lifelong potential. In these early years, access to healthcare, good nutrition, early learning, and a safe environment profoundly shapes a child's future.",
      "India and Sub-Saharan Africa, both with rapidly growing middle classes, young populations and significant workforce potential, share longstanding comparisons. In 2021, the World Bank reported, \u201cSub-Saharan Africa and South Asia [including India] account for over 85% of the global poor,\u201d underscoring similar challenges in poverty and development.",
      "Using official data, the authors looked at the most recent estimates of the stunting gaps between India and a sample of 19 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.",
      "Official data shows that more than 35% of India\u2019s 137 million children under five are stunted, with over a third also underweight. Globally, 22% of children under five are stunted.",
      "Then they examined six broad socially disadvantaged groups in India. Among them are adivasis (tribespeople living in remote areas) and Dalits (formerly known as untouchables), who alone comprise more than a third of the under-five population.",
      "The economists found that children from higher-ranked, non-stigmatised caste groups in India stood at 27% - markedly lower than the Sub-Saharan African rate.",
      "They also found that children from higher-ranking caste groups in India are some 20% less likely to experience stunting compared with those from marginalised groups, who occupy the lowest tiers of the caste hierarchy.",
      "This conclusion remains significant even after accounting for factors like birth order, sanitation practices, maternal height, sibling count, education, anaemia and household socio-economic status.",
      "This difference is despite seven decades of affirmative action, India's caste system - a four-fold hierarchy of the Hindu religion - remains deeply entrenched.",
      "\u201cThis should not be surprising given that children from better-off groups in India have access to more calories and face a better disease environment,\u201d the authors say.",
      "The reasons behind high stunting rates among Indian children have sparked a complex debate over the years.",
      "Some economists have argued that the differences are genetic - that Indian children are genetically disposed to lower heights.",
      "Others believe that improved nutrition over generations has historically closed height gaps thought to be genetic.",
      "Some studies have found that girls fare worse than boys and others just the opposite, using different global standards.",
      "To be sure, stunting has decreased across social groups - a separate 2022 study found that improvements in health and nutrition interventions, household living conditions and maternal factors led to reduction in stunting in four Indian states. (More than half of India's under-five children were stunted, according to a federal family health survey of 1992-93).",
      "Children from marginalised groups like adivasis are likely to be more malnourished.",
      "In Africa, the rate of stunting has also fallen since 2010, although the absolute number increased.",
      "But what is clear is that children from poor families, with less-educated mothers, or from marginalised groups, are especially vulnerable to stunting in India.",
      "\u201cThe debate on the height gap between Indian and Sub-Saharan African children has resulted in overlooking the role of social identity, especially caste status,\u201d the authors say.",
      "\u201cThis is a crucial dimension to understanding the burden of child nutrition in India.\u201d",
      "The analysis uses data from demographic and health surveys. For India, it includes the latest data from 2019-21, and for Sub-Saharan Africa, it includes data from 19 countries with surveys from 2015 onwards. The dataset covers anthropometric - measurements related to the physical dimensions and composition of the human body- outcomes for 195,024 children under five in India and 202,557 children under five in Sub-Saharan Africa."

      "Now hopes are pinned on China's Geely, which is in talks to take an 85% stake in Volocopter in return for $95m of funding, according to a Bloomberg report. The deal could mean that any future manufacturing would be moved to China.",

      "However, faced with the massive cost of getting such novel aircraft approved by regulators and then building up manufacturing capabilities, some investors are bailing out.",

      "As recently as the Farnborough Airshow in July, Lilium\u2019s COO Sebastian Borel was sounding confident.",
      "\u201cWe are definitely burning through cash,\" he told the BBC. \u201cBut this is a good sign, because it means we are producing the aircraft. We\u2019re going to have three aircraft in production by the end of the year, and we have also raised \u20ac1.5bn\u201d.",
      "But then the money ran out.",
      "Lilium had been attempting to arrange a loan worth \u20ac100m from the German development bank, KfW. However, that required guarantees from national and state governments, which never materialised.",
      "In early November, the company put its main operating businesses into insolvency proceedings, and its shares were removed from the Nasdaq stock exchange.",
      "For the moment, work on the new aircraft is continuing, as the company works with restructuring experts to sell the business or bring in new investment. However, getting the new e-jet into production is looking more challenging than ever.",
      "The high-profile British player in the eVTOL market is Vertical Aerospace. The Bristol-based company was founded in 2016 by businessman Stephen Fitzpatrick, who also set up OVO Energy.",
      "Its striking VX4 design uses eight large propellers mounted on slim, aircraft style wings to generate lift. Mr Fitzpatrick has made ambitious claims about the aircraft, suggesting it would be \u201c100 times\u201d safer and quieter than a helicopter, for 20% of the cost.",
      "The company has made progress. After completing a programme of remote-controlled testing, it began carrying out piloted tests earlier this year. Initially, these were carried out with the aircraft tethered to the ground. In early November, it carried out its first untethered take-off and landing.",
      "But there have also been serious setbacks. In August last year, a remotely-piloted prototype was badly damaged when it crashed during testing at Cotswold Airport, after a propeller blade fell off.",
      "In May one of its key partners, the engineering giant Rolls Royce pulled out of a deal to supply electric motors for the aircraft.",
      "Ambitions remain sky high. Vertical Aerospace says it will deliver 150 aircraft to its customers by the end of the decade. By then, it also expects to be capable of producing 200 units a year, and to be breaking even in cash terms.",
      "Yet financial strains have been intensifying. Mr Fitzpatrick invested an extra $25m into the company in March. But a further $25m, due in August if alternative investment could not be found, has not been paid. As of September, Vertical had $57.4m on hand \u2013 but it expects to burn through nearly double that over the coming year.",
      "Hopes for the future appear to be pinned on doing a deal with the American financier Jason Mudrick, who is already a major creditor through his firm Mudrick Capital Management.",
      "He has offered to invest $75m into the business \u2013 and has warned the board of Vertical that rejecting his plan would inevitably lead to insolvency proceedings. But the move has been resisted by Mr Fitzpatrick, who would lose control of the company he founded.",
      "Sources close to the talks insist an agreement is now very close. The company believes if a deal can be done, it will unlock further fundraising opportunities.",
      "Amid the turbulence, one European project is quietly on track, says Bjorn Fehrm who has a background in aeronautical engineering and piloted combat jets for the Swedish Air Force. He now works for aerospace consultancy Leeham.",
      "He says that the EVTOL project underway at Airbus is likely to survive.",
      "Called the CityAirbus NextGen, the four-seater aircraft has eight propellers and a range of 80km.",
      "\"This is a technology project for their engineers, and they've got the money, and they've got the know how,\" says Mr Fehrm.",
      "Elsewhere in the world, other well funded start-ups stand a good change of getting their aircraft into production. That would include Joby and Archer in the US.",
      "Once the aircraft are being produced, the next challenge will be to see if there's a profitable market for them.",
      "The first routes are likely to be between airports and city centres. But will they make money?",
      "\"The biggest problem area when it comes to the cost of operation is the pilot and the batteries. You need to change the batteries a couple of times per year,\" points out Mr Fehrm.",
      "Given all the uncertainty and expense, you might wonder why investors put money into new electric aircraft in the first place.",

    "story": [
      "Forty years after they began the task \u2013 and nearly four hundred years after receiving their first commission \u2013 sages in Paris have finally produced a new edition of the definitive French dictionary.",
      "The full ninth edition of the Dictionnaire de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise was formally presented to President Macron this afternoon in the plush surroundings of the 17th century Coll\u00e8ge des Quatre-Nations on the left bank of the Seine.",
      "This is where the 40 wise men and women of the French Academy \u2013 so-called immortels (immortals) chosen for their contributions to French language and literature \u2013 have met since the body was first created by Cardinal Richelieu in 1635.",
      "Their task at the start was to \u201cgive certain rules to our language, to render it pure and eloquent\u201d \u2013 to which end they set about writing their first dictionary.",
      "However, the job has proved so slow \u2013 the first book was not produced until 1694 and today it takes more than a year to get through a single letter of the alphabet \u2013 that the relevance of the enterprise is increasingly in question.",
      "\u201cThe effort is praiseworthy, but so excessively tardy that it is perfectly useless,\u201d a collective of linguists wrote in the Liberation newspaper on Thursday.",
      "This ninth edition replaces the eighth, which was completed in 1935.  Work started in 1986, and three previous sections \u2013 up to the letter R \u2013 have already been issued.",
      "Today the end section (last entry Zzz) has been added, meaning the work is complete.",
      "In its press release, the Academy said the dictionary is a \u201cmirror of an epoch running from the 1950s up to today,\u201d and boasts  21,000 new entries compared to the 1935 version.",
      "But many of the \u201cmodern\u201d words added in the 1980s or 90s are already out of date.  And such is the pace of linguistic change, many words in current use today are too new to make it in.",
      "Thus common words like tiktokeur, vlog, smartphone and \u00e9moji \u2013 which are all in the latest commercial dictionaries \u2013 do not exist in the Acad\u00e9mie book.  Conversely its \u201cnew\u201d words include such go-ahead concepts as soda, sauna, yuppie and sup\u00e9rette (mini-supermarket).",
      "For the latest R-Z section, the writers have included the new thinking on the feminisation of jobs, including female alternatives (which did not exist before) for positions such as ambassadeur and professeur. However print versions of the earlier sections do not have the change, because for many years the Acad\u00e9mie fought a rear-guard action against it.",
      "Likewise the third section of the new dictionary \u2013 including the letter M \u2013 defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman, which in France it no longer is.",
      "\u201cHow can anyone pretend that this collection can serve as a reference for anyone?\u201d the collective asks, noting that online dictionaries are both bigger and faster-moving.",
      "Under its president, the writer Amin Maalouf, the dictionary committee meets every Thursday morning and after discussion gives its ruling on definitions that have been drawn up in preliminary form by outside experts.",
      "Among the \u201cimmortals\u201d is the English poet and French expert Michael Edwards, who told Le Figaro newspaper how he tried to get the Academy to revive the long-forgotten word improfond (undeep).",

      "Quincy Jones had been in gangs and had been stabbed at the age of seven in 1930s Chicago, before becoming a major force in American music thanks to his work with legends like Ray Charles, Frank Sinatra and Michael Jackson.",
      "He was at the heart of revolutions in jazz, swing, soul, funk, disco and pop - but one aspect of his career that got less attention when he died last week at the age of 91 was his place in hip-hop.",
      "Jones was revered in all corners of music, including rap. Unlike most in the old guard and the media, he immediately realised the scene's artistic and cultural importance.",
      "Hip-hop reminded him of the bebop jazz of his youth. \"I feel a kinship there because we went through a lot of the same stuff,\" he said.",
      "\"Quincy understood it and got it right away,\" says pioneering artist, rapper and presenter Fab 5 Freddy.",
      "Jones worked with leading rappers in the 80s, and in the 90s he recognised risks including a volatile rivalry that had begun to erupt between competing labels and stars.",
      "So he brought artists, executives and elder black American statesmen together for a secret summit in 1995, hoping it would be a turning point.",
      "The east coast was hip-hop's spiritual home. In 1992, Sean Combs - then known as Puffy and later as P Diddy - launched his Bad Boy record label in New York with artists including Notorious BIG, aka Biggie Smalls.",
      "Meanwhile, across America, Los Angeles was coming into its own as the capital of gangsta rap, led by menacing mogul Suge Knight's Death Row Records, which had Dr Dre and Tupac.",
      "In 1994, Tupac was shot and injured during a robbery in the lobby of a studio. He later implied that his former friend Biggie may have known about the attack in advance. Biggie then released the track Who Shot Ya?, which Tupac thought was about him.",
      "The beef continued at the Source magazine awards on 3 August 1995, when Knight goaded Combs and Bad Boy Records from the stage.",
      "Jones, who had his own magazine, Vibe, held his summit three weeks later.",
      "Quincy Jones: From 'street rat' to music mastermind",
      "Quincy Jones: His brilliance explained in 10 songs",
      "'He changed my life': Stars remember Quincy Jones",
      "The brewing east-west beef wasn't the only reason Jones called it - it was mainly intended to discuss the state of hip-hop and let the new generation hear life and business advice from a group of highly successful black executives.",
      "But rap's negative image and the burgeoning tensions were a big talking point.",
      "\"He knew this was a bubbling issue, and so his idea was to bring together a symposium,\" says Fab 5 Freddy, who was hosting Yo! MTV Raps at the time and was the event's moderator.",
      "Jones told the summit: \"The thing that really provoked me to say it's time to pay attention now is Tupac.\"",
      "Tupac was missing, however - he was in jail for sexual assault at the time. Suge and Dre were there, as were Combs and Biggie.",
      "Jones had already experienced his own beef with Tupac - the rapper criticised the producer in a 1993 edition of Source for marrying white women.",
      "\"We finally hooked up, even though it was tension conditions in the beginning,\" Jones said at the event.",
      "\"We finally talked to each other, and he said nobody had talked to him like that before.",
      "\"And I said, I can't take it any more. Because we can no longer afford to be non-political, and I'm talking to the hip-hop nation now.\"",
      "About 50 influential artists and executives were in the room, including Public Enemy's Chuck D, members of A Tribe Called Quest, MC Lyte, Kris Kross, Jermaine Dupri and Boyz n the Hood film-maker John Singleton.",
      "Jones wrote in his now-out-of-print 2001 autobiography: \"I had been concerned about the potentially volatile diversity of a group who'd never been in the same room together.\"",
      "They were joined by veteran executives Clarence Avant and Ahmet Ertegun, plus Colin Powell, the former national security adviser and head of the US military who would go on to become the first African-American secretary of state.",
      "Powell had presidential ambitions - that was why the summit was held in secret. Jones wanted to save Powell from being associated with the negative publicity that surrounded rap music.",
      "He switched venues at the last minute to throw press off the scent, and confiscated the recordings.",
      "\"Rest assured that my discretion is based on a deep respect for you and a valued friendship,\" Jones wrote to Powell in an unpublished letter held at Indianapolis University Library.",
      "\"I know that we are going to make a difference at this conference. Thanks for the way you handled the situation. Maybe we can turn the battleship an inch or two.\"",
      "Jones later wrote in his book: \"Some of the younger rappers didn't even know who he was. When addressing some of the more confrontational comments from the floor, Powell maintained his South Bronx demeanour and authoritative cool throughout.\"",
      "Fab 5 Freddy remembers one exchange between Powell and Knight. \"There was an encounter where he [Knight] had something to say, and Colin Powell responded.",
      "\"Here you have this guy who was a four-star general talking to Suge Knight, and he pretty much put Suge in his place.\"",
      "Jones finally released a clip of the event for a 2018 Netflix documentary about his life.",
      "\"We've got to seriously talk about what you are going to deal with,\" he is seen telling the assembled attendees.",
      "\"They are not playing, there's real bullets out there, believe me. Maybe literally and figuratively.",
      "\"It's a very emotional thing,\" he added, his voice cracking. \"I want to see you guys live to at least my age.\"",
      "\"Quincy did get emotional,\" Fab 5 Freddy recalls, \"because he sensed what could happen.",
      "\"And the worst, unfortunately, did happen.\"",
      "Who was Tupac Shakur?",
      "Ex-gang leader pleads not guilty to Tupac murder",
      "Diddy accused of 'revenge' rape over Tupac claims",
      "Jones had ended up reconciling with Tupac. After Tupac's 1993 comments, Jones's 17-year-old daughter Rashida - who would go on to star in US sitcom The Office - wrote an irate letter to Source attacking the rapper.",
      "When Tupac bumped into one of Jones's other daughters, Kidada, he apologised, thinking she was Rashida. But Tupac and Kidada hit it off and began a relationship.",
      "\"Though we got off to a rocky start, as I came to know and feel him I saw his enormous potential and sensitivity as an artist and as a human being,\" Quincy Jones wrote.",
      "There have also been claims that Tupac was planning to leave Death Row for Jones's record label.",
      "But in September 1996, a year after the summit, Tupac was shot and killed.",
      "A former gang leader, Duane \"Keffe D\" Davis, was charged with his murder last year. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Then in 1997, Notorious BIG was shot dead outside a party thrown by Jones's record label and magazine. No-one has ever been charged.",
      "Meanwhile, today Knight is in prison for a hit-and-run, while Combs is awaiting trial on charges of racketeering and sex trafficking, which he denies.",
      "The violence in the 90s \"wasn't necessary\" and was caused by \"wannabes and gang-related troublemakers\" on the edges of the music industry, according to Fab 5 Freddy.",
      "\"Also, the east/west coast beef was mainly ignited by jealousy. It was an ashtray fire fanned into a big deal by media outlets that led to Biggie and Tupac getting killed.\"",
      "Despite his stature, not even Jones could alter the forces of power and pride that were at work and prevent the bloodshed.",
      "Freddy believes some lessons were learned at the summit, however, and that it deserves a place in hip-hop history.",
      "\"It was incredible and electric to be in that room.",
      "\"It was a thrilling moment. And then it became even more legendary because it was never released, so the only people that really knew about it were the people that were there.\""

    "summary": "Marine scientist uncovers the story behind Andruha's escape from Russian military training programme.",
    "story": [
      "The mystery as to why a beluga whale appeared off the coast of Norway wearing a harness may finally have been solved.",
      "The tame white whale, which locals named Hvaldimir, made headlines five years ago amidst widespread speculation that it was a Russian spy.",
      "Now an expert in the species says she believes the whale did indeed belong to the military and escaped from a naval base in the Arctic Circle.",
      "But Dr Olga Shpak does not believe it was a spy. She believes the beluga was being trained to guard the base and fled because it was a \"hooligan\".",
      "Seeking sanctuary for whale dubbed a Russian spy",
      "Russia has always refused to confirm or deny that the beluga whale was trained by its military.",
      "But Dr Shpak, who worked in Russia researching marine mammals from the 1990s until she returned to her native Ukraine in 2022, told BBC News: \u201cFor me it\u2019s 100% (certain).\u201d",
      "Dr Shpak, whose account is based on conversations with friends and former colleagues, features in a BBC documentary, Secrets of the Spy Whale, which is now on BBC iPlayer and being shown on BBC Two on Wednesday at 21:00 GMT.",
      "Secrets of the Spy Whale",
      "The mysterious whale first came to public attention five years ago when it approached fishermen off the northern coast of Norway.",
      "\u201cThe whale starts rubbing against the boat,\u201d Joar Hesten, one of the fishermen, says. \u201cI heard about animals in distress that instinctively knew that they need help from humans. I was thinking that this is one smart whale.\u201d",
      "The sighting was unusual because the beluga was so tame and they're rarely seen as far south. It was also wearing a harness, which had a mount for a camera, and bore the words, in English, \u201cEquipment St Petersburg\u201d.",
      "Mr Hesten helped to remove the harness from the whale, which then swam to the nearby port of Hammerfest, where it lived for several months.",
      "Seemingly unable to catch live fish to eat, it charmed visitors by nudging at their cameras and even on one occasion returning a mobile phone.",
      "\u201cIt was very obvious that this particular whale had been conditioned to be putting his nose on anything that looked like a target because he was doing it each time,\u201d says Eve Jourdain, a researcher from the Norwegian Orca Survey.",
      "\u201cBut we have no idea what kind of facility he was in, so we don\u2019t know what he was trained for.\u201d",
      "Captivated by the whale's story Norway made arrangements for the beluga to be monitored and fed. The name it was given \u2013 Hvaldimir - is a nod to hval which is Norwegian for whale, and the name of Russia's President, Vladimir Putin.",
      "Dr Shpak did not want to name her sources in Russia for their own safety but said she had been told that when the beluga surfaced in Norway, the Russian marine mammal community immediately identified it as one of theirs.",
      "\u201cThrough the chain of vets and trainers the message came back \u2013 that they were missing a beluga called Andruha,\u201d she says.",
      "According to Dr Shpak, Andruha/Hvaldimir had first been captured in 2013 in the Sea of Okhotsk in Russia's Far East. A year later it was moved from a facility owned by a dolphinarium in St Petersburg to the military programme in the Russian Arctic, where his trainers and vets remained in contact.",
      "\u201cI believe that when they started to work in open water, trusting this animal (not to swim away), the animal just gave up on them,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cWhat I've heard from the guys at the commercial dolphinarium who used to have him was that Andruha was smart, so a good choice to be trained. But at the same time, he was kind of like a hooligan - an active beluga - so they were not surprised that he gave up on (following) the boat and went where he wanted to.\u201d",
      "Satellite images from near the Russian naval base in Murmansk show what could have been Hvaldimir/Andruha\u2019s old home. Pens can clearly be seen in the water with what appear to be white whales inside.",
      "\u201cThe location of the beluga whales very close to the submarines and the surface vessels might tell us that they are actually part of a guarding system,\u201d says Thomas Nilsen, from Norwegian online newspaper The Barents Observer.",
      "Russia, for its part, has never officially addressed the claim that Hvaldimir/Andruha was trained by its army. But it does have a long history of training marine mammals for military purposes.",
      "Speaking in 2019, a Russian reserve colonel, Viktor Baranets, said: \"If we were using this animal for spying, do you really think we'd attach a mobile phone number with the message 'Please call this number'?\"",
      "Sadly, Hvaldimir/Andruha\u2019s incredible story does not have a happy ending.",
      "Having learned to feed himself, it spent several years travelling south along Norway\u2019s coast and in May 2023 was even spotted off the coast of Sweden.",
      "Then on September 1 2024 its body was found floating at sea, near the town of Risavika, on Norway's south-western coast.",
      "Had the long arm of Putin\u2019s Russia caught up with the reluctant beluga?",
      "It appears not. Despite some activist groups suggesting that the whale had been shot, that explanation has been dismissed by the Norwegian police.",
      "They say there was nothing to suggest that human activity directly caused the beluga\u2019s death. A post-mortem examination revealed that Hvaldimir/Andruha died after a stick became lodged in his mouth."

    "summary": "Gary O'Donoghue looks at Trump's \"trifecta\" of power, and how far it will help him keep his promises.",
    "story": [
      "On election night, Donald Trump repeated the phrase: \"Promises made, promises kept.\"",
      "Now, Republicans have officially taken control of Congress and his \"promises\" are a whole lot easier to keep.",
      "In Washington political parlance, it's called \"a governing trifecta\", when the president's party also controls both chambers of Congress - the House of Representatives and the Senate.",
      "That control is what Donald Trump's Republican Party now has.",
      "Single-party control was once common, but in recent decades it has become rarer and shorter.  Often, the party in power loses seats when midterm congressional elections roll around two years later.",
      "Both Trump and Joe Biden enjoyed trifectas for their first two years in the White House, but they also saw that having such control is no guarantee a president can get their way.",
      "Follow live updates on this storySeven things Trump says he will do in powerWhen does he become president again?Who has Trump appointed to his top team so far?Why is Elon Musk Trump's efficiency tsar?",

      "Seven things Trump says he will do in power",
      "When does he become president again?",
      "Who has Trump appointed to his top team so far?",
      "Why is Elon Musk Trump's efficiency tsar?",
      "In his first two years, Trump passed a signature tax bill - reducing corporate taxes from 35% to 21%, and cutting some taxes on individuals.",
      "But with some members of his own party resistant to his surprise ascent to the top in 2016, he struggled with other aims.",
      "His plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act (known as Obamacare) failed when a senator from his own party, John McCain, refused to vote for it. He also failed to pass an infrastructure bill as he had promised.",
      "In his first two years, when the Democrats controlled the House and the Senate, Biden succeeded in passing the American Rescue plan, the Investment and Jobs Act, and the Chips and Science Act. But he, too, had to significantly scale back his spending and investment plans - touted as the Build Back Better package - after opposition from one of his own senators.",
      "A major impediment to total control for either party is that Senate bills require a three-fifths majority, or 60 votes, to bypass the filibuster, which enables senators to delay legislation by keeping debate open-ended. That means that when a party has a simple majority in the Senate, it needs to reach across the aisle to get a bill passed.",
      "Even with a healthy majority in the Senate this time around, Trump will not have the magic 60 seats that would allow him to overcome opposition attempts to delay legislation.",
      "And on Wednesday, Republicans in the Senate selected John Thune as their majority leader over Florida's Rick Scott, the clear favourite in the Trump camp, in a sign some lawmakers may be reasserting their independence (Trump did not officially endorse Scott).",
      "That said, a trifecta, if astutely managed, does open the way for the possibility of major legislative initiatives.",
      "Trump's power advantage could be key in pushing through his big promises such as the largest deportation of migrants in history, sweeping tariffs on foreign imports, and the rolling back of environmental protections.",
      "Using legislation to achieve these ends will make such plans much harder to overturn in the courts - something Donald Trump was plagued by in his first term when he extensively used executive orders that were regularly and often successfully challenged.",
      "The judicial landscape also has changed in Trump's favour.",
      "The signature achievement of his first term was putting three conservatives on the Supreme Court - cementing a two-thirds majority for possibly decades to come.",
      "He also named more than four dozen judges to the federal appeals courts, flipping several circuits to a more conservative bent.",
      "The majority Republicans have in the Senate also provides a key advantage.",
      "Trump will be able to get his nominees for administration posts approved more easily, something he struggled with back in 2017 when internal resistance to him in the Republican Party was still significant.",
      "All this bodes for a busy and possibly turbulent next two years. But, as recent history indicates, these trifectas don't last all that long. The incoming administration will want to get a move on.",

      "PREFACE",
      "Los Angeles, Summer 1956",
      "Staring at the television open-mouthed, I let my peanut butter and jelly sandwich drop onto the plate in my lap as chills ran up and down my body.",
      "Home alone after school, I was sitting cross-legged (my favorite position, still) on the floor in front of the TV enjoying the peace and quiet and watching my favorite show, American Bandstand. \"And now, ladies and gentlemen, Ray Charles,\" Dick Clark announced as the camera panned to a handsome man in sunglasses sitting at a piano.",
      "\"Georgia, Georgia . . . ,\" he began, and I burst into tears. I couldn't believe he was singing a song about my mom. As tears dripped onto my sandwich, I'd never felt more connected to anything in my life. Ray Charles's voice and the melody seemed to express exactly how I felt.",
      "It took me weeks to get over seeing him sing, and in some ways, I never did, but then someone whose songs I first heard on the radio blew a hole in my understanding of the world and I was never, ever the same. As I stared at the TV with my mom watching The Ed Sullivan Show, a popular young singer named Elvis Presley filled the screen. Mom and I were two of the sixty million Americans who witnessed that historic performance in September 1956.",
      "Even though Elvis was dressed quite traditionally that Sunday night, he looked and moved differently than any performer I'd ever seen. He began by singing \"Don't Be Cruel,\" and by the time he broke into \"Love Me Tender,\" I felt as if he was singing only to me. I wanted to jump right into the TV and be Elvis.",
      "When I heard a year later that he was giving a concert at the Pan-Pacific Auditorium in Los Angeles, I rushed home with stars in my eleven-year-old eyes. \"Mom, Mom! Elvis is going to be at the Pan-Pacific! Can we go? . . . Please?\" I was convinced that I had to be there. Secretly, I thought that he would spot me in the crowd and pick me, although I'm sure that's what every girl thought.",
      "Luckily for me, my thirty-one-year-old mother was as crazy about Elvis as I was, a fact that impressed my friends because their moms didn't approve of his raw sexuality. To this day I don't know where she found the money, but somehow Georgia did. Mom and I dressed up and made our way into town, more like sisters than mother and daughter. Feeling the tension grow the closer we got to the Fairfax District, we soon found ourselves caught up in a pulsing mob of nine thousand noisy girls.",
      "We were swept inside the auditorium on a wave of pure adrenaline. Our folding seats were about halfway back in the audience, but that was fine by me. Looking around at all the girls gazing in anticipation at the darkened stage, I could feel my heart pounding inside my flat little chest\u2014a sensation I was to become all too familiar with later in life.",
      "The stage was dark, but when the spotlights hit him, Elvis was there and he was magic. There was a roar from the crowd that was like nothing I had ever heard. An explosion of flashbulbs went off. I only wished I'd brought our little Kodak Brownie. Elvis was standing there in his famous gold suit, which was shimmering and changing color in the spotlights.",
      "He was so handsome with that amazing smile and lustrous black hair, exactly the same color as mine. Everyone around us jumped to their feet and started screaming so hysterically that we could hardly hear a word of \"Heartbreak Hotel.\" But, boy, we could see his moves\u2014the way he gyrated his hips and shook his legs so that they quivered. Not content with making as much noise as they could, the girls began jumping up onto their chairs for a better view, which meant that from then on, we could only see Elvis's head and shoulders.",
      "Being in the middle of that shrieking crowd was like being caught up in a massive swivel-hipped tidal wave, swept along with the hysteria toward the stage. I had no idea why everyone was acting so insane. I was too young to get that part of it, truthfully (but if I had been three years older and my mom had been three years younger, we would have fainted). It was the most exciting experience I'd ever had because I knew that I wanted to be on that stage in the spotlight one day too.",
      "When I looked over at my mother, she was down for the count. We were both mesmerized. She looked so beautiful dressed in some amazing outfit that of all the girls in the place, including me, I felt sure that Elvis would have picked her.",
      "Pressing my mouth to her ear so that she could hear, I cupped my hand over it and yelled, \"Mom, can we stand on our seats and scream, too?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" she replied, grinning like a teenager and taking off her high heels. \"Come on, let's do it!\" So we did, straining on our tip-toes to see him.",
      "Glowing with happiness, I tried to work out if Elvis would be too old to marry me by the time I was grown, so that he could sing to me every day. Dreaming of being Mrs. Presley, I couldn't stop talking to Mom about Elvis for weeks as I floated around on a gold lam\u00e9 cloud.",

    "published": "Sun, 17 Nov 2024 10:13:14 -0500",
    "summary": "With the release of part one of her new memoir, Cher talks about her relationship - on stage and off - with Sonny Bono, and why their TV partnership survived beyond their marriage.",
    "story": [
      "It took too long for Cher to get into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. \"I thought, what do I have to do?\" she said. \"I've had number one records in all these decades. I had a song [\"Believe\"] that changed music forever. And so, what is it that I've gotta do?\"",
      "This year she finally made it. At her induction ceremony last month, she said, \"It was easier getting divorced from two men than it was to get into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame!\"",
      "It also took forever for Cher to write her story. This week, \"Cher: The Memoir \u2013 Part One\" finally comes out. Asked what she wanted to say with the book, she replied, \"In the beginning, I didn't wanna say much. And then at some point, I just thought, Cher, do it or give the money back.\"",
      "The book centers on her years with Sonny, and her itinerant childhood with a mother who married at least seven times. She writes of how she had to be a grownup from the beginning: \"One time we were driving in the car and she said, 'Cher, I don't know how we're gonna pay the rent. What do you think?' And I was like, 'Okay, how is this gonna work? How are we gonna do this?'\"",
      "In 1962, Cherilyn Sarkisian met Sonny Bono in a coffee shop. He was wearing a mohair suit and a mustard-colored shirt with a white collar. \"I thought it was like when Tony met Maria,\" she said. \"Everybody disappeared, and it was just the two of us.\"",
      "But she said it was not love at first sight. \"It was something,\" Cher said. \"I never felt it before.\"",
      "Sonny was 27, Cher was 16. \"It wasn't passionate; I just loved him,\" she said.",
      "What did she love about him? \"How he was different than anyone else. And he made me laugh. And we had a dream.\"",
      "That dream came true. By the mid-1960s, Sonny & Cher had five songs in the top 50 at the same time. They had a #1 hit with \"I Got You Babe.\"",
      "In the 1970s, on \"The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour,\" they'd become America's favorite couple, with their banter, their songs, and that Bob Mackie wardrobe: \"And then, when they started to realize that people were tuning in because of what I was wearing, then they just gave us all the money we needed,\" she said. \"It was so much fun.\"",
      "But Sonny began to change. \"He just started not to care,\" Cher said.",
      "About what? \"About me.\"",

    "summary": "He's earned critical acclaim and award nominations for performances in \"Aftersun\" and \"Normal People.\" Now, Irish actor Paul Mescal, who's become a Gen Z heartthrob, is front-and-center of Ridley Scott's epic \"Gladiator II.\"",
    "story": [
      "Walking through the streets of Dublin, Paul Mescal said, \"There's this weird sensation about landing into the city \u2013 I don't know, it just makes me feel calm.\"",
      "The Irish actor was not going to get much of that calm on this stop, attending the Dublin premiere of \"Gladiator II.\" He was here to promote the highly-anticipated film. \"There's a little bit of really enjoying it, but part of it also hanging on for dear life,\" he said. \"Just the size is something that I haven't experienced before. I also just haven't led a huge amount of films.\"",
      "In \"Gladiator II,\" he plays Lucius, who learns (along with the audience) of his connection to Russell Crowe's character from the original 2000 blockbuster. Nearly 25 years later, director Ridley Scott is back with the sequel, out this week.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"Gladiator II\" click on the video player below:",
      "What was it like for Mescal to be in the middle of such an epic film? \"I would say equally epic,\" he replied.",
      "The 28-year-old has already been nominated for an Oscar, playing a single dad in \"Aftersun,\" and an Emmy for his role in \"Normal People.\" Aside from the critical acclaim, that series turned him into a Gen Z heartthrob practically overnight.",
      "Ridley Scott says he was so impressed with Mescal that he cast the young actor after just a 30-minute zoom call.",
      "\"I got a phone call and they were like, 'You're going to be in \"Gladiator II,\"'\" Mescal recalled. \"That's kind of massively life-altering news to receive.\"",
      "It's that big? \"Yeah, of course it is,\" Mescal said. \"I think there's something that comes with the legacy of Ridley Scott.\"",
      "The first \"Gladiator\" won five Academy Awards, including best picture. In this incarnation, from Paramount Pictures (a division of CBS' parent company), Mescal stars alongside Denzel Washington.",
      "I asked, \"As an actor, are you taking mental notes when you work with someone like Washington?\"",
      "\"When you go back to bed in the evening, you're like, 'How is he doing this? How is he doing that?'\" he replied. \"Every scene I did with him was never how I expected it to go, which is the dream. It was very thrilling to be five feet in front of his face watching him do that.\"",
      "Mescal has star power of his own, as we saw when we witnessed a sea of people following us when we met at Trinity College, where, not so long ago, he'd studied acting.",
      "He's proving to be a singular actor, at least until a recent look-a-like contest. \"I feel like it's easy to do a parody of me,\" he laughed.",
      "\"The shorts?\"",
      "\"Yeah yeah yeah.\"",
      "Those shorts are the uniform of his other love, Gaelic football. For \"Gladiator II,\" this athlete bulked-up, putting on 18 pounds of muscle.",
      "I asked, \"The role is so different. You're often playing these kind of softer, almost tormented, shy characters. It's a major transition for you.\"",
      "\"Yeah, it is,\" he replied. \"I think going back to the sport that I played before, there was definitely a desire to make a more physically-informed choice with a character Lucius represented, like, the perfect opportunity for that to happen.\"",
      "\"Normal People,\" his big break, was shot at his alma mater. In it, Mescal portrays the sharp, nuanced emotions of a student: angst, torment, desire. \"I think it exposed an audience to me,\" Mescal said. \"That job essentially allowed me to prove to people that I can act.\"",
      "The series came after he made a commercial for an Irish sausage company: \"Yeah, that covered my rent for the year. I was absolutely delighted by it.\"",
      "He'd started acting at 16, and a high school production of \"Phantom of the Opera\" changed his trajectory. \"I think I'm still chasing that feeling again,\" he said. \"Nothing has ever really come close to that feeling.\"",
      "\"Your high school 'Phantom of the Opera' production vs. 'Gladiator II'?\" I asked.",
      "\"It sounds absolutely bizarre! I think because it felt physically dangerous in my body to be exposed to an audience of people who knew me as somebody who played sports. The adrenaline was, like, extraordinary.\"",
      "His childhood, he says, was pretty standard. His mother was a policewoman, his dad a teacher, both now retired. But he credits that upbringing with helping him navigate today's pressures.",
      "\"This is new for me,\" he said, of fame.",
      "\"But you're used to attention at this point?\"",
      "\"Uh, within reason.\"",
      "On campus, at times this star was as struck as the students.",
      "Mescal is hoping to maintain some distance, some mystery as an actor, to be able to convincingly inhabit such varied roles. \"You don't want an audience to know you innately,\" he said.",
      "And what is his relationship with fame? \"Ever-changing,\" he said.",
      "Perhaps that's because it's all changing so quickly for him. Instead of dispersing during our interview inside, the crowd, we soon discovered, had multiplied. And we got to witness Paul Mescal in a role for which there is no rehearsal, and no script.",
      "\"What the hell?\" he remarked to the assembled hordes. \"I don't know what to say other than, hello! This is f*****g bananas! I have to go finish an interview \u2026 you should all go back to school. See you later!\"",

      "How much is Mike Tyson getting paid for the fight?",
      "Regarded as one of the greatest boxers of all time, 58-year-old Mike Tyson has an estimated net worth of $10 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. That is a modest sum compared with the hundreds of millions of dollars \"Iron Mike,\" as he is known, accumulated in career earnings, including $400 million in fight purses, according\u00a0to\u00a0Forbes.

That bout lasted less than two minutes, with Tyson knocking out the previously undefeated Spinks in 91 seconds.",
      "In 1992, Tyson was sent to prison for six years after being convicted of raping a teenage beauty-pageant contestant.

His net worth is estimated at $80 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.",
      "With a 10-1 fight record, mostly against\u00a0mixed martial artists and other pro-boxing newcomers under his belt, Paul, a former child star and YouTube prankster who began his boxing career in 2018, does not lack confidence \u2014 or showmanship. His cocky attitude earned him his latest nickname \"El Gallo de Dorado\" or the Golden Rooster, coined by fans in Puerto Rico.

It will mark the first time Tyson (50-6, 44 KOs) has entered the ring for a pro bout since retiring from the sport in 2005.",
      "Paul (10-1, 7 KOs) will be fighting for the third time in 2024 in what is easily his highest-profile bout to date. The match-up between the 58-year-old Tyson and 27-year-old Paul was initially scheduled for July 20 but was rescheduled to give Tyson time to recover from medical issues stemming from a stomach ulcer.",
      "Here's what you need to know about tonight's big fight, including when and how to watch.",
      "What time is the Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul fight tonight?",
      "The Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul televised fight card\u00a0began at 8 p.m. ET (5 p.m. PT) on Netflix. There were three professional boxing fights before Tyson and Paul were set to enter the ring. The main event will occur once those bouts have concluded with the exact timing dependent on the length of the preceding fights.",
      "How many rounds will the Tyson vs. Paul fight have?",
      "The Tyson-Paul fight is scheduled for eight, two-minute rounds. That's slightly shorter than the typical three-minute rounds most professional men's boxing fights are scheduled for. Both men will also wear heavier boxing gloves than heavyweights often do, sporting 14-ounce gloves versus the traditional 10-ounce versions.",
      "How to watch the Tyson vs. Paul fight",
      "The Tyson vs. Paul fight will be broadcast live on Netflix and will be free for subscribers.",
      "What is Mike Tyson's boxing background?",
      "Mike Tyson is one of the most famous \u2014 and infamous \u2014 boxers in sports history. A Hall of Fame inductee, Tyson burst onto the world stage in the 1980s when he became the youngest heavyweight champion in boxing history. Combining speed and power, Tyson possessed an uncanny ability to intimidate opponents before they even entered the ring. He won his first world title in 1986 and became the undisputed champion in the years that followed. He lost his belts to Buster Douglas in 1990 in one of the biggest upsets in sports history and was incarcerated on a rape conviction from 1992 to 1995.",
      "Tyson won the World Boxing Council (WBC) and World Boxing Association (WBA) titles upon his return to the ring in the mid-1990s but then lost to Evander Holyfield in a major upset in November 1996. A highly-anticipated rematch between the two in June 1997 led to Tyson getting disqualified after he bit off a chunk of Holyfield's ear.",
      "His subsequent performances in the ring after that were largely overshadowed by bizarre antics both during the fight and in between matches. He lost his final title fight against then-heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis in June 2002 and he retired following consecutive knockout losses to other opponents in 2004 and 2005. He was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility. He last fought in an exhibition (non-professional) match against former champion Roy Jones Jr. in November 2020.",
      "What is Jake Paul's boxing background?",
      "Jake Paul was best known as a popular YouTuber and former Disney star before he decided to become a professional boxer in 2020. He fought his second professional fight on the undercard of Tyson's fight against Jones but has since promoted himself to main event status. Loquacious and promotable, Paul currently has 27 million followers on Instagram, 18.2 million followers on TikTok and 4.6 million on X.",
      "He's been able to morph that social media success into the boxing ring, entering tonight's fight with just a single loss against 10 wins, with seven of those victories via knockout. The lone loss came against undefeated Tommy Fury, the younger brother of former undisputed heavyweight champion Tyson Fury (who, ironically, was named after Paul's opponent tonight).",
      "Who do experts predict will win the Tyson vs. Paul fight?",
      "Expert predictions for tonight's match-up vary. Former opponents Lewis and Jones are both predicting a Tyson victory as is his namesake, Tyson Fury. Former boxing champion Oscar De La Hoya also likes Tyson but former heavyweight champ Anthony Joshua is going with Paul as is Paul's brother, Logan. Oddsmakers have had Paul as the slight favorite but the betting line has been moving more toward Tyson throughout fight week, according to ESPN.",

    "story": [
      "We were amazed at what we were seeing on a sweltering summer's day, when a group of people with Parkinson's Disease began rock-climbing on the Carderock Cliffs of Maryland. Yes, rock-climbing!",
      "It's all part of their therapy, says Molly Cupka, the no-nonsense instructor and cheerleader for this community of courageous climbers.",
      "She started this program, called UpENDing Parkinsons, as a non-profit twelve years ago.",
      "\"There's a lot of balance involved, mobility involved, strength, cardio, and then there's the cognitive part, where you have to look at the hold, and figure out how to get your body to move to get to that hold,\" she said.",
      "How often do they fall? \"Falling is definitely part of climbing,\" said Cupka. But they never really fall, because they wear a harness that provides a layer of safety. \"You're always on the rope. You fall, but you don't fall far. We always say if you're not falling, you're not trying hard enough!\"",
      "There's no cure for Parkinson's, which usually affects mobility, coordination, balance, and even speech. Jon Lessin was diagnosed in 2003. He was once an all-around athlete. About 12 years ago he retired as a cardiac anesthesiologist because of Parkinson's. His daughter, Brittany, watched his steady decline, until he discovered climbing walls as high as 60 feet!",
      "\"My dad has a hard time walking across the room, but he can make it to the top of this giant wall,\" Brittany said. \"There's a lot that he's had to give up because of his disease. But this is something that he found through it, which is really cool.\"",
      "Jon said, \"I get to the top and I feel like I've conquered something. And I feel like the wall can't beat me. I can beat the wall.\"",
      "Full disclosure: This story is very personal to me. My late husband, Aaron Latham, had Parkinson's, and boxed as a way to fight the symptoms, as he explained on \"Sunday Morning\" in 2015. \"Boxing's just the opposite of Parkinson's,\" said Latham. \"Everything's designed, instead of to shrink you, everything's designed to pump you up.\"",
      "Jon Lessin said Parkinson's \"makes you feel very small. You make small movements, you're hunched over. And [rock climbing] makes you feel like you can accomplish the world.\"",
      "It was Lessin who first had that big idea to use rock climbing as a therapy for Parkinson's. \"I wanted to do big-movement exercise,\" he said. \"And I found Molly at this gym.\"",
      "Lessin proposed the idea to Molly Cupka, who runs the Sportrock Climbing Center in Alexandria, Virginia. She thought it was worth a try, given the sport requires participants to plan ahead, to know where to position their hands and feet. \"I wish I could go into the brain and see what's happening while people climb,\" Cupka said.",
      "Some people with Parkinson's, like Vivek Puri, get dyskinesia (involuntary jerking motions). Puri said he's usually unaware of his. He runs a home building company in the D.C. area, and was only 38 when he found out he had Parkinson's. \"Fine motor skills have kind of really suffered dramatically,\" he said. \"When I don't climb for some periods of time, I get worse.\"",
      "But once he gets on the wall, he calls himself Spider-Man.",
      "\"Honestly, I climb like a monkey,\" he said. \"I get my finger strength moving, which gets my fine motor skills \u2013 maybe not back, but kind of keeps that in motion.\"",
      "There's no evidence climbing slows the progress of Parkinson's, but Cupka joined forces with Marymount University last year to study patients climbing for the first time. \"We have people literally walking and carrying weights, you know, walking and looking, multitasking,\" she said.",
      "The study found that, in so many words, if you climb, you may walk better.",

I'm doing this!' It just makes me feel stronger, and I'm fighting it. I'm doing something about it.\"",
      "Many of the climbers have become friends who climb together several times a week; and they've become a support group, Parkinson's Pals, who encourage each other.",
      "\"When I reach the top, I can turn around and look and wave, and see my wife and my friends, and that's the reward,\" said de Mulder. \"It's really wonderful.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 15:45:31 -0500",
    "summary": "One couple took out a loan to cover the out-of-network costs of an abortion and drove eight hours to a hospital in the neighboring state.",
    "story": [
      "Four women suing over Idaho's strict abortion ban told a judge Tuesday how excitement over their pregnancies turned to grief and fear after they learned their fetuses were not likely to survive to birth \u2014 and how they had to leave the state to get abortions amid fears that pregnancy complications would put their own health in danger.",
      "\"We felt like we were being made refugees, medical refugees,\" said Jennifer Adkins, one of the plaintiffs in the case.",
      "The women, represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights, aren't asking for the state's abortion ban to be overturned. Instead, they want the judge to clarify and expand the exceptions to the strict ban so that people facing serious pregnancy complications can receive abortions before they are at death's door.",
      "Currently, the state's near-total ban makes performing an abortion a felony at any stage of pregnancy unless it is \"necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.\"",
      "Adkins' fetus had a severe medical condition that meant the fetus would not survive the pregnancy. The illness also put Adkins at risk of developing \"mirror syndrome,\" a dangerous syndrome that can cause fatally high blood pressure and other issues, she said.",
      "Adkins and her husband, John, decided to seek an abortion, and learned, after another ultrasound showed the fetus still had a heartbeat, that they would have to go out of state to get one.",
      "Idaho law prohibits a woman from getting an abortion when a fetal heartbeat is detected, with the exception of cases of rape, incest or a \"medical emergency,\" defined by the law as \"a condition that, in reasonable medical judgment, so complicates the medical condition of a pregnant woman as to necessitate the immediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert her death or for which a delay will create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\"",
      "\"No parent wants to wish that when they look at an ultrasound they don't see their baby's heartbeat, yet here I was hoping that I wouldn't,\" Adkins said. \"I wanted the decision to be made for us, and I wanted to end her suffering, so it was really hard to see that and know that we had the challenges ahead of us that we did.\"",
      "\"I was not willing to watch my son suffer\"",
      "Kayla Smith cried as she told the judge how she found out she was pregnant for a second time on Mother's Day of 2022, and how she and her husband chose the name \"Brooks\" for their son. She was around 18 or 20 weeks along in her pregnancy when the sonographer grew quiet during a routine anatomy scan, Smith said.",
      "Brooks' heart had fatal anomalies, and the young family could not find a pediatric cardiologist willing to attempt an operation. The veins supplying Brooks' lungs were also abnormal, Smith said, and he would not survive birth.",
      "Smith had developed dangerously high blood pressure during a previous pregnancy, and she was at risk of developing the condition called preeclampsia again.",
      "\"If I were to continue pregnancy not only would I risk my life with preeclampsia, I was not willing to watch my son suffer and potentially gasp for air,\" Smith said, crying.",
      "Idaho's abortion ban went into effect two days before Brooks' diagnosis, she said, making it impossible for her to get an abortion in her home state.",
      "\"We wanted to meet our son \u2014 that was really important to us \u2014 so we needed to do it in a hospital,\" she said.",
      "They took out a loan to cover the estimated $16,000 to $20,000 out-of-network cost for the procedure and drove more than eight hours to a hospital where doctors induced labor.",
      "\"All four of these women were overjoyed to be pregnant with their second child and all four of them received the worst news a mother can imagine,\" attorney Gail Deady, with the Center for Reproductive Rights, told 4th District Judge Jason D. Scott during opening arguments. All of them sought abortions \"to protect their health, to spare their babies from pain and suffering, and to remain alive and healthy to protect their young children.\"",
      "James Craig, a division chief with the Idaho Attorney General's office, said the women and their attorneys are relying on hypotheticals rather than concrete facts to make their case. Under their proposal, a pregnant woman could receive her abortion for something as minor as stepping on a rusty nail \u2014 even though the risk of infection in that scenario could be easily treated by receiving a tetanus booster shot, Craig said.",
      "\"Unborn children have a fundamental right to life, and protecting the lives of children is a legitimate and fundamental government interest,\" Craig said.",
      "The state also has the same interest in protecting the lives of women, Craig said \u2014 and the abortion ban laws do both, he contended.",
      "In the \"rare circumstances where abortion is necessary\" to prevent the death of the mother, Idaho law allows that to occur, Craig said. The women suing are trying to \"usurp the role of the Legislature\" by asking the judge to rewrite the law, he said, and that is not the proper role of the court.",
      "Dr. Emily Corrigan, an ob-gyn who works in emergency medicine at Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center who is also a plaintiff in the case, told the judge how Idaho's multiple abortion bans have created confusion for physicians and made it difficult to treat pregnant patients who need emergency care.",
      "Doctors have had to \"basically guess which pregnancy conditions would fall under the state medical exception,\" Corrigan said.",
      "\"I have had other hospital staff refuse to participate in the care of my patients because of the lack of understanding of the laws, and this has caused patient care delays,\" she said. \"I have personally cared for several patients who have been denied stabilizing abortion care at other hospitals in Idaho. By the time they arrive at my institution, their conditions have deteriorated and have lead to increased complications that I need to manage.\"",
      "Several conditions can put the health of pregnant people at risk, she said. Some are caused by pregnancy like preeclampsia, and others \u2014 including some chronic illnesses and cancers \u2014 can be made worse by pregnancy, she said. In those cases, delaying an abortion might not cause immediate death but can cause a shortened life span or have dramatic effects on a person's health, Corrigan said.",
      "\"We are not trained to wait until things become urgent or emergent. We are trained to prevent harm to our patients,\" she said.",

Medical King of Brooklyn, New York, is recalling about 220,000 adult portable bed rails due to entrapment and asphyxia risks. The recall follows the death of a 66-year-old man who became trapped between a mattress and a bed rail in November at a residential care facility in South Carolina.",

      "The recall is the ninth issued by the CPSC in the last three years. The recalls and two product warnings impacted more than 3 million units and are associated with serious injuries from head, neck or chest entrapment and 18 deaths, the federal agency stated.",
      "CPSC data shows that 92% of fatalities associated with adult portable bed rails are from entrapment, usually of the head or neck.",
      "The agency issued new mandatory safety standards for adult portable bed rails in January 2023.",
      "Often purchased for sick or frail older people, the side rails or metal bars are used on hospital beds and in home care with the idea of helping patients pull themselves up or to keep them from falling out of bed.

    "summary": "Allowing enhanced subsidies for health insurance bought through ACA marketplaces to expire would cause premiums to soar, experts warn.",
    "story": [
      "With Republicans edging closer to gaining control of Congress, millions of Americans may be at risk of losing enhanced subsidies that currently underwrite the cost of health insurance bought through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces, according to industry experts and the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The November 5 election gave control of the Senate to Republicans, while control of the House remains in limbo Monday as votes in several critical races continue to be tallied. Currently, Democrats are projected to win at least 210 House seats and Republicans 215 seats, with a party needing 218 seats in order to have the majority.",
      "If Republicans gain control of Congress, they are widely expected to allow the enhanced ACA subsidies to expire at the end of 2025, depriving many people who buy coverage through the ACA and who currently receive these subsidies of that financial assistance, according to health care policy experts.",
      "So-called enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, which lower the cost of health plans for millions of Americans and were passed under the Biden administration, will expire unless lawmakers renew them. During his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump backed efforts by Republican lawmakers to repeal the ACA, but hasn't yet revealed his plans for the program, commonly known as Obamacare, for his second term in office.",
      "Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said at a campaign stop last week just before the Nov. 5 election that \"the ACA is so deeply ingrained, we need massive reform to make this work, and we've got a lot of ideas on how to do that.\"",
      "Who is eligible for enhanced ACA subsidies?",
      "Americans with incomes over 400% of poverty \u2014 those who make just above four times the poverty level, or $103,280 for a family of four \u2014 are eligible for the enhanced ACA insurance subsidies. They also increase financial help for those who were already eligible for assistance under the ACA.",
      "KFF, an independent health policy nonprofit, estimates\u00a0the subsidies have cut premiums for eligible enrollees by 44%, or $705 annually. The organization says that if the tax credit expires, average premiums for subsidized enrollees in 12 states would at least double.",
      "In 2024, of the 21.6 million Americans who purchased health insurance plans from ACA marketplaces, 20.1 million received enhanced subsidies,\u00a0according\u00a0to the CBO.",
      "People most at risk of losing ACA coverage if the enhanced subsidies lapse are those who live in states where health insurance premiums are particularly high, including in rural parts of the U.S. Middle-income households that depend on the enhanced subsidies could see a sharp rise in premiums, Cynthia Cox, vice president and ACA policy researcher at KFF, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"They could go from paying no more than 8.5% of their income to easily paying 20% or more,\" she said. \"I imagine a lot of those folks would drop coverage.\"",
      "Without enhances subsidies, many middle income ACA Marketplace enrollees with incomes just above four times poverty would be priced out of health insurance coverage, according to Cox.",
      "Subsidies remain for 2025",
      "Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at\u00a0healthinsurance.org, noted that 93% of people who buy health insurance through ACA marketplaces receive enhanced subsidies. A sharp increase in their premiums would lead many to drop their coverage, leaving them uninsured, she said.",
      "The CBO\u00a0estimates\u00a0that 22.8 million total Americans will enroll in ACA marketplace health insurance plans in 2025. The agency expects enrollment to drop sharply, from 22.8 million to 18.9 million, in 2026 if the subsidies are not renewed. By 2030, enrollment could dip to 15.4 million people without the enhanced subsidies.",
      "For now, the subsidy enhancements will remain in place through the end of 2025.",
      "\"If people are signing up now during open enrollment, their coverage will take effect in January, and it will cover them for the whole year. Their premiums won't change \u2014 they're good for 2025,\" Norris said.",
      "The enhanced subsidies, which were first passed in 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, will have been in place for roughly five years when they expire in 2025, or about half as long as the ACA marketplace has existed, Cox said.",
      "Enrollment in ACA plans has roughly doubled since the enhance subsidies have been in place, she noted, with most of that growth coming from low-income enrollees. \"That's one group you might expect to see, if they have to start making a higher premium payments, would drop their coverage,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Opioid overdose deaths have now slowed to the lowest levels nationwide since 2020, according to new estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This marks the 12th straight month of decline since a peak last year.",
      "Around 70,655 deaths linked to opioids like heroin and fentanyl were reported for the year ending June 2024, the CDC now estimates, falling 18% from the same time in 2023.",
      "Almost all states, except for a handful in the West from Alaska through Nevada, are now seeing a significant decrease in overdose death rates. Early data from Canada also suggests overdose deaths there might now be slowing off of a peak in 2023 too.",
      "\"While these data are cause for optimism, we must not lose sight of the fact that nearly 100,000 people are still estimated to be dying annually from drug overdose in the U.S.\" said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, in a statement.",
      "Other types of drug overdoses beyond opioids are also slowing. While they make up a smaller share of overall deaths, overdoses linked to drugs like methamphetamine and cocaine are also showing signs of dropping nationwide following a peak last year.",
      "\"We are encouraged by this data, but boy, it is time to double down on the things that we know are working. It is not a time to pull back, and I feel very strongly, and our data shows, that the threat continues to evolve,\" Dr. Allison Arwady, head of the CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, told CBS News.",
      "Arwady pointed to a long list of factors that officials hope are contributing to the decline, ranging from broader availability of the overdose reversing spray naloxone, also known as Narcan, to efforts to ease gaps in access to medications that can treat opioid use disorder.",
      "Trends in what health officials call \"primary prevention\" have also improved in recent years \u2014 meaning fewer people using the drugs to begin with. As an example, Arwady cited CDC surveys showing a clear decline in high school students reporting that they have tried illegal drugs.",
      "The CDC and health departments have also gotten faster at gathering and analyzing data to respond to surges in overdoses, Arwady said, often caused by new so-called \"adulterants\" that are mixed in. Health authorities study this by testing blood and drug samples taken in the wake of surges, in search of potential emerging drug threats.",
      "Agency researchers are now looking closer at what could be behind gaps in communities that are still not seeing slowdowns, Arwady said.",
      "\"Unfortunately, for the most affected groups, namely Native Americans and Black American men, the death rates are not decreasing and are at the highest recorded levels,\" said Volkow.",
      "Why are drug overdose deaths declining?",
      "In the months since CDC data first began showing real signs of a nationwide change to the deadly record wave of opioid overdose deaths, experts have floated a number of theories to explain what caused the change.",
      "\"We had been seeing the numbers go down, on the national aggregate level, since last April, and we were skeptical and kind of holding our tongues. Then we started hearing from a lot of folks on the ground, frontline providers,'\" said Nabarun Dasgupta, a senior scientist at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill who studies opioid overdose deaths.",
      "Dasgupta led an analysis in September by the university's Opioid Data Lab illustrating the nationwide scope of the downturn and probing a number of theories that might explain it.",
      "Some explanations they dismissed as unlikely, like stepped-up law enforcement operations. Other ideas they judged as plausible, but complicated to prove, like a so-called \"depletion of susceptibles\" \u2014 essentially the epidemic burning itself out, as users either found ways to survive the influx of fentanyl or died \u2014 or the wider availability of naloxone.",
      "Dasgupta said they received a flood of interest since their initial post proposing more theories, like new scanners that were deployed on the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "There are likely a number of factors all playing a role in the shift, Dasgupta says. But he said early data from research they are wrapping up now supports one leading explanation: a shift in the illegal drug supply.",
      "\"Our hypothesis is that something has changed in the drug supply. This kind of pronounced shift, something that happens suddenly, if numbers had suddenly shot up, we would definitely be pointing to a change in the drug supply to explain it,\" said Dasgupta.",
      "Amid its downsides, xylazine's rise might have led to less injection drug use, they speculate. Its longer high could also be reducing the number of times people use fentanyl each day.",
      "\"We're not in our offices celebrating. We're still losing too many people that we love. So I just want it to be very clear that with like a hundred thousand people still dying, that's obscenely high,\" he said.",

      "Nearly 4 in 10 seniors have gotten a COVID-19 vaccine so far this year, new survey data published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests, marking a steep increase in vaccination rates compared with the same time last year.",
      "The data from the CDC's National Immunization Survey estimates that 37.6% of Americans ages 65 and older had gotten a shot of this season's updated COVID-19 vaccine by Nov. 2, compared with 22.6% of older adults by the same week in 2023.",

      "More data on COVID-19 vaccinations among seniors is expected later this fall, as the CDC analyzes records gathered from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",
      "Health officials had been hoping for improved COVID-19 vaccination rates this year, after authorities worked to launch this year's COVID shots closer to when the annual flu shot is also shipped out to doctor's offices and pharmacies.",
      "Last year's round of COVID-19 vaccines did not get off the ground in many places until late September, long after providers had already begun offering flu shots. CDC officials said that led to confusing messaging and logistical fumbles that may have hampered vaccination rates.",
      "\"Weekly comparisons to previous season should take into account differences between seasons in vaccine availability dates. 2023\u201324 COVID-19 vaccines were first available mid-September 2023, and 2024\u201325 COVID-19 vaccines were first available at the end of August 2024,\" according to a statement on the CDC website.",

    "summary": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has vowed to combat \"the chronic disease epidemic in this country\" in the Trump administration, with the slogan \"Make America Healthy Aagain.\"",
    "story": [
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has outlined a number of promises to \"Make America Healthy Again\" under President-elect Donald Trump, vowing to combat an \"epidemic\" of chronic diseases that he has described as an \"existential\" threat to America's future.",
      "All are under the banner of fighting what Kennedy sees as a common thread behind a broad swath of ailments: that Americans have been \"mass poisoned by big pharma and big food,\" and that federal agencies have failed to stop it. In response, he has also floated a number of specific policy ideas to remake the federal government's public health institutions.",
      "\"[Trump] asked me to end the chronic disease epidemic in this country. And he said, I want to see results, measurable results in the diminishment of chronic disease within two years. And I said, Mr. President, I will do that,\" Kennedy said on Nov. 2.",
      "Authority for a MAHA agenda",
      "Kennedy's allies say Trump's election is also a mandate for their platform of health proposals, which they say delivered key votes for the president-elect. Trump has promised to let Kennedy \"go wild\" on health issues.",
      "\"The American people re-elected President Trump by resounding margins because they trust his judgement and support his policies, including his promise to Make America Healthy Again alongside well-respected leaders like RFK Jr.,\" Karoline Leavitt, Trump-Vance Transition spokeswoman, told CBS News in a statement.",
      "Some ideas in Kennedy's wide-ranging platform have evolved since his original longshot\u00a0presidential campaign. He has acknowledged Trump does not agree with him on every policy.",
      "The president-elect has listed oil and gas as one off-limits issue for Kennedy. In the past, Kennedy has been critical of \"big oil\" and natural gas, over the fatal toll of fossil fuel pollution and climate change.",
      "Several of Kennedy's ideas would require presidential or congressional action to implement, though it is possible that they could be supercharged by emergency powers.",
      "\"I'm going to urge President Trump on day one to do the same thing they did in COVID, which is to declare a national emergency, but not for infectious disease, but for chronic disease,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 26.",
      "Staff changes at federal agencies",
      "Kennedy claims a number of health issues have worsened due to federal inaction, including autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, sleep disorders, infertility rates, diabetes and obesity.",
      "He aims to address that by replacing many staff throughout the agencies, which Kennedy has accused of being too sympathetic to large food and drug companies. As a co-chair of Trump's transition, Kennedy has been vetting a slate of staffers who could fill top positions throughout the Trump administration.",
      "Kennedy has said Trump tasked him with returning agencies \"to their rich tradition of gold-standard, evidence-based science.\" He has also said \"medical expertise\" is not the priority for all staff picks.",
      "\"What we don't really need at HHS is more medical expertise. What we need is an expertise on decoupling the agency from institutional corruption. Because it's the corruption that has distorted the science,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 30.",
      "Kennedy has said he hopes \"to have every nutritional scientist\" across the Department of Health and Human Services and U.S. Department of Agriculture \"fired on Day One.\"",
      "Kennedy himself has been floated to head the Department of Health and Human Services, though some allies say he could be more effective in a \"czar\" type role out of the White House.",
      "\"Get the chemicals out\" of food",
      "When talking about his platform, Kennedy often lampoons products like McDonald's French fries or Fruit Loops cereal as examples of how foods sold in the U.S. are made with ingredients that are banned or discouraged abroad, or have changed for the worse.",
      "\"It's easy to fix. We have a thousand ingredients in our foods that are illegal in Italy and other countries in Europe,\" he said on Oct. 29.",
      "Trump agrees with his plans to \"get the chemicals out\" of America's food supply, Kennedy says, which also includes upending the use of common pesticides and herbicides by American farmers.",
      "Kennedy has described the food in the U.S. as \"just poison,\" citing his own anecdotal experience with his son struggling with eczema while eating pasta in the U.S.",
      "\"When he ate any kind of pasta in this country, he would get these terrible, terrible outbreaks, you know, really agonizing. And he moved to Italy and he lived off of pasta for a year and a half and he never got a case,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 19.",
      "Kennedy suspects that was caused by glyphosate, used in Roundup brand weed-killers, which Italy moved to start restricting in 2016. Italy's decision was over worries that it could pose a cancer risk, and some advocacy groups in the U.S. have also voiced similar concerns.",
      "Agricultural trade associations have defended glyphosate as \"one of the safest, most effective\" tools farmers have to manage weeds and support \"important conservation practices.\"",
      "Kennedy's plea to crack down on food additives and chemicals comes as the FDA is in the middle of launching its own new effort \u2014 and is calling on Congress to step up funding for \u2014 scrutinizing chemicals currently allowed in foods.",
      "Food industry groups have generally voiced support for the FDA to step up its vetting of chemicals in food, in hopes that it \"negates the ill advised and disruptive state by state patchwork\" of legislatures drawing up their own restrictions.",
      "Reducing unhealthy and processed foods in federal programs",
      "Kennedy has also promised to \"get processed food out of school lunch immediately\" and voiced frustration over the amount of federal food assistance for low-income Americans that goes towards sugary drinks and processed food.",
      "One way Kennedy could try to get at this issue is through the federal dietary guidelines process, jointly run by the USDA and HHS, which is in the final stages of crafting the next edition of recommendations that influence a broad range of government nutrition programs.",
      "\"Kids shouldn't be eating grains. They should definitely not be eating seed oils. And they for sure should not be eating sugar. And yet that is what we're forcing them to eat,\" he said on Sept. 26.",
      "On seed oils, Kennedy has claimed that the switch away from oils like beef tallow which were high in saturated fats in favor of vegetable oils was a mistake, and is to blame for a rise in obesity rates. That puts him at odds with longstanding recommendations to limit saturated fats.",
      "\"The guidance around this has been reviewed many times since, and has only become stronger in its conclusion for the role of saturated fat, particularly in its relationship with higher risks of cardiovascular disease,\" Deirdre Tobias, a researcher on this year's Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, said last month.",
      "Grains have been more divisive at this year's committee and the broader scientific community, which has debated setting lower limits to overall grain consumption alongside recommendations to switch from refined to whole grains.",
      "Setting new limits is difficult, scientists on the panel have said, because the only source of some key nutrients for many Americans is cereals and breads fortified with vitamins.",
      "Kennedy has also been critical of the panel of outside researchers put together to create the scientific report underpinning the recommendations, but acknowledges broader changes will also be needed to move the needle.",
      "While Kennedy says he personally would \"never eat anything in a package\" as a rule of thumb, he acknowledges \"most people don't have access to the resources I have.\"",
      "\"We need to start forcing these companies to internalize their costs. So the illusion of cheap food goes away, right? Because if you're drinking Coke and it seems cheap and it gives you diabetes over the long run, that's not very cheap,\" he said on Sept. 30.",
      "Curbing the influence of drugmakers",
      "Kennedy has called for a \"review\" of guidelines that govern advertising by pharmaceutical companies.",
      "The FDA currently regulates advertising about prescription drugs, going after drugmakers that misrepresent their products. Responsibility for some other medical products is shared between the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission.",
      "Kennedy has urged Trump to go further, saying he is advising the president-elect to \"ban pharmaceutical advertising on TV\" over concerns that it is influencing news coverage of health issues.",
      "He has also urged reform of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, which charges pharmaceutical companies millions of dollars for the cost of the FDA vetting their applications to decide whether to approve new drugs.",
      "\"We need to end the corruption. 50% of FDA's budget comes not from the taxpayer, but from the pharmaceutical industry,\" he said on Sept. 26.",
      "Kennedy has not said how Congress or the Trump administration would make up the difference from the fees if they were cut, which amount to around $3 billion out of FDA's budget.",
      "Undoing the fees could leave taxpayers effectively subsidizing a hefty bill previously paid for by drugmakers \u2014 or a return to the significant delays for new medications that initially spurred the creation of the fees.",
      "Promoting alternatives to drugs",
      "Kennedy has accused the FDA of waging a \"war on public health\" which he says includes \"aggressive suppression\" of anything \"that advances human health and can't be patented by Pharma.\"",
      "In his view, that includes treatments like psychedelics, which recently fell short of FDA approval, and foods like raw milk, which officials have stepped up warnings against amid this year's unprecedented bird flu outbreak on dairy farms.",
      "Kennedy has also praised the dietary supplement industry for a court win against the FDA, after the agency tried to take action against what it said was an illegally marketed anti-aging drug.",
      "Also on Kennedy's list are things like \"clean foods\" and exercise, which he wants to allow Medicare and Medicaid to cover.",
      "The promise has echoes of the \"food is medicine\" initiative, which has called for the health care system to offer more financial support for healthier lifestyle habits.",
      "\"If a doctor's patient has diabetes or obesity, the doctor ought to be able to say, I'm going to recommend gym membership, and I'm going to recommend, good food and Medicaid ought to be able to finance those things the same as they would Ozempic,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 30.",
      "Kennedy has also promised to promote healthier lifestyles in other ways, ranging from requiring nutrition classes in federally funded medical schools to reviving the presidential fitness test in schools.",
      "\"Informed choices\" on vaccines",
      "Kennedy has a long record criticizing the safety of vaccines, including recent misleading claims that shots have an \"exemption from pre-licensing safety testing\" before they are approved.",
      "In fact, the FDA requires new vaccines be studied for their safety and efficacy in large trials, results of which are published in peer-reviewed journals and publicly disclosed.",
      "His activism on the issue dates back decades, including a now-retracted article he published in Rolling Stone in 2005 claiming a link between autism and an ingredient called thimerosal that had been used in vaccines before 2001 \u2014 which medical research has disproven. His focus has broadened since then.",
      "\"This doesn't mean vaccines is the only cause of autism. Our kids today are swimming around in a toxic soup coming mainly from their foods that operate along the same biological pathways. But some of it's coming from pharmaceutical drugs,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 19.",
      "Kennedy has insisted that is not \"anti-vaccine\" and would not seek to ban them under Trump, instead saying he wants to \"restore the transparency\" around them \u2014 echoing lawsuits by the group he chaired, Children's Health Defense, over its Freedom of Information Act requests.",
      "\"[Trump] doesn't want me to take vaccines away from people. If you want to take a vaccine, you ought to be able to take it. We believe in free choice in this country. You ought to know the risks and benefits of everything you take,\" Kennedy said on Nov. 2.",
      "But Kennedy has also asserted \"there's no vaccine that is safe and effective,\" and encouraged people to \"resist\" CDC guidelines on vaccines for kids \u2014 raising concern among public health officials, who point to the success of vaccination in saving millions of children worldwide from debilitating illness or premature death from preventable diseases.",
      "Opposing water fluoridation",
      "Ahead of the election, Kennedy said one of Trump's first acts in the White House would be to \"advise all U.S. water systems to remove fluoride from public water.\"",
      "While a number of health risks have been tied to higher levels of fluoride, most are extremely rare in the U.S. and involve far greater exposure than what is added to drinking water.",
      "Fluoride has been incorporated into a majority of U.S. water systems for decades. The American Dental Association estimates that the practice has reduced tooth decay by about 25%, though some research suggests modern use of toothpaste with fluoride has reduced the policy's benefits.",
      "Kennedy's announcement does come as the Environmental Protection Agency is now under a federal court order to take action over one specific risk: the concern that fluoride might lower children's IQ \"at dosages that are far too close to fluoride levels in the drinking water of the United States,\" stemming in large part from a report published by the National Institutes of Health.",
      "Beyond influencing what rule the Trump administration's EPA ends up pursuing in response to the order, Kennedy could also take aim at fluoride through another route: changing the CDC's widely-cited statement about the practice, which hails water fluoridation as one of the greatest \"public health achievements of the 20th century.\"",
      "Kennedy himself has described fluoride as \"a poison\" and praised the nonprofits for suing over the issue.",
      "\"The simple answer is I don't like it,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 30.",

      "How much is Mike Tyson getting paid for the fight?",
      "Regarded as one of the greatest boxers of all time, 58-year-old Mike Tyson has an estimated net worth of $10 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. That is a modest sum compared with the hundreds of millions of dollars \"Iron Mike,\" as he is known, accumulated in career earnings, including $400 million in fight purses, according\u00a0to\u00a0Forbes. Over the last decade, Tyson has also fought his way back after filing for bankruptcy in 2013 at the age of 37.",
      "Though promotors did not reveal exactly how much Tyson earned for Friday's fight, reports from online sources,\u00a0including DraftKings Network, estimate he'll make around $20 million.",

      "Mike Tyson says he's \"scared to death\" of upcoming Jake Paul fight",
      "Jake Paul, 27, to fight 57-year-old Mike Tyson live on Netflix: \"Time to put Iron Mike to sleep\"",
      "That's about the same dollar amount Tyson earned in his match against Michael Spinks in 1988, a record purse at the time (worth roughly $53 million today adjusting for inflation). That bout lasted less than two minutes, with Tyson knocking out the previously undefeated Spinks in 91 seconds.",
      "In 1992, Tyson was sent to prison for six years after being convicted of raping a teenage beauty-pageant contestant. He was released on parole after three and a half years, returning to boxing in 1995 in a match against Peter McNeely, who was dispatched by technical knockout in under 90 seconds.",
      "Tyson would go on to earn $30 million for each of his next four matches, which included an infamous 1997 fight against Evander Holyfield in which Tyson bit off a piece of his opponent's right ear. Tyson was disqualified from the fight, had his boxing license revoked and fined $3 million, but was allowed to keep the purse.",
      "At a news conference on Wednesday, Paul wore a diamond-spiked ear cover, a pointed reference to the incident. But when it comes to making light of the ear biting, Tyson has beat Paul to the punch, having launched ear-shaped marijuana edibles\u00a0(with Holyfield's consent) through his company, Tyson 2.0, a premium cannabis brand he launched in 2021. The brand generated an estimated $150 million in revenue in 2023, according to Forbes Australia.",
      "How much is Jake Paul getting paid for the fight?",
      "Jake Paul, 27, is set to earn $40 million, according to an estimate from DraftKings Network and other sources \u2014 double what Tyson is expected to receive for the fight. A simple explanation for that may be that Paul, a top social influencer with 27 million followers on Instagram alone, is also co-founder of Most Valuable Promotions (MVP), the company promoting the extravaganza in partnership with Netflix. His net worth is estimated at $80 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.",
      "With a 10-1 fight record, mostly against\u00a0mixed martial artists and other pro-boxing newcomers under his belt, Paul, a former child star and YouTube prankster who began his boxing career in 2018, does not lack confidence \u2014 or showmanship. His cocky attitude earned him his latest nickname \"El Gallo de Dorado\" or the Golden Rooster, coined by fans in Puerto Rico. Before that, he was called \"The Problem Child,\" a fairly self-explanatory moniker based on the online persona he's crafted for himself over the years.",
      "Paul, who went full Gallo at an open training session this week with Tyson at the Toyota Music Factory in Irving, Texas, donning a rooster hat and red-feathered skirt over his boxing trunks, epitomizes social media's melding of Barnumesque entertainment and sports.",
      "In a TikTok video posted Tuesday, a shirtless Paul, slumped on a couch wearing a prosthetic belly to make himself look out of shape, places stacks of money on his protruding stomach while offering \"Mikey, Mikey\" an additional $5 million if the former champion can last more than four rounds with him in the ring. If he doesn't, says Paul in the video, the aging boxer will have to get a tattoo that says \"I love Jake Paul.\"",
      "\"This is why modern boxing is a joke,\"commented one user on Reddit in reaction to the video. \"People get more excited about freak show fights than actual boxing matches.\"",
      "As\u00a0reported by USA Today, \"Tyson and his camp have not publicly responded to the offer.\"",
      "How much is the purse for the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight?",

      "Originally set to take place on July 20, the event was later postponed and rescheduled for November 15 after\u00a0Tyson suffered an ulcer flare-up on a flight from Miami to Los Angeles in May.",
      "As of early Friday evening, gate receipts at AT&T Stadium brought in $17.8 million in revenue, CNBC reported. Promotor MVP told the news outlet it expects more than 70,000 people fill the stadium, home to the Dallas Cowboys, which has a seating capacity of 80,000.",
      "Who do gamblers think will win the fight?",
      "Tyson enters the ring on Friday, nearly 20 years since his last professional fight, as a +160 underdog,\u00a0according\u00a0to the latest betting odds from DraftKings. That means a $100 wager on post-retirement Iron Mike will bring in a $160 profit if he wins. At -200, Paul is the favorite to win. Bettors will have to place a $200 wager to make a $100 profit, should the social influencer prevail over Tyson.",
      "\"There has been a lot of anticipation for this fight, and we have been pleased with the betting volume,\" Johnny Avello, director of sports operations at DraftKings, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We expect more action to come in the hours leading up to the fight.\"",
      "Although it remains to be seen how much will be wagered in total, the event is attracting some whale-sized bets of $500,000, according to ESPN.",
      "Gamblers are backing Tyson, according to DraftKings, with 69% of all bets currently on the former undisputed world champion to emerge victorious. \"While Tyson is 58-years old now, people see one of the greatest boxers of all time at a favorable price and jump at that opportunity,\" Avello said.",
      "\"While it won't match up to an event like the Super Bowl, it could certainly be our most bet boxing match of the year,\" he added.",
      "Not everyone will be able to place a bet the epic bout. Though the fight is sanctioned by Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation, changes in the rules, including\u00a0shorter rounds and bigger gloves, disqualifies the fight from being bet on in at least seven U.S.\u00a0states.",
      "How to watch the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight",
      "For most fans, the best seats will be at home, with Tyson vs. Paul streaming worldwide on Netflix. A standard Netflix subscription plan with ads is $6.99 a month. The platform's broadcast starts at 8 p.m. Eastern time.",
      "As reported by CBS Sports, the fight marks Netflix's biggest bet to date on live sports. Netflix, which has 282 million subscribers in over 190 countries, has recently tested the waters by airing exhibition events in golf and tennis.",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 18:31:51 -0500",
    "summary": "Americans looking to purchase EVs may want to do so quickly, as the incoming administration is likely to axe a $7,500 tax credit.",
    "story": [
      "With President-elect Donald Trump vowing to pull the plug on the $7,500 tax credit for buyers of electric vehicles, one EV maker and its billionaire owner are fully behind the idea and even stand to profit from it.",
      "\"Take away the subsidies, it will only help Tesla,\" Tesla owner Elon Musk posted in July on X, the social media platform he owns.",
      "The credit granted to buyers of EVs helped make the case for buying the climate-friendlier vehicles, and when an earlier version of the tax credit was done away with several years ago, Tesla cut prices on its cars by about half of the credit its buyers were no longer receiving.",
      "Tesla is the sole automaker to be generating a profit on its U.S. sales. Manufacturing EVs is a losing proposition for Big Three vehicle makers like Ford and General Motors, who sell a fraction of EVs compared with Tesla.",
      "Once the EV tax credit is vanquished, the price of EVs overall might drop, cutting into Tesla's profits, as opposed to increasing the company's red ink as it could for legacy automakers still working to get a firmer footing in the EV market. Should traditional automakers scale back on their EV production and sales to curtail the losses, EV shoppers would have even fewer options, benefiting Tesla.",
      "As Musk touted his support for axing the EV tax credit, Tesla's auto industry rivals signaled the opposite.",
      "The Alliance for Automotive Innovation urged that the tax credit continue, telling lawmakers in an October letter that U.S. manufacturers count on it as they vie with Chinese EV production. Around the world, vehicle makers have poured billions into transitioning to electric cars.",
      "Further, the Zero Emission Transportation Association on Friday called on Trump to reconsider, saying the tax credit has bolstered employment in states that voted Republican, including Ohio, Kentucky, Michigan and Georgia.",
      "\"If the United States is going to continue to fight to bring those jobs here and actually compete to win against China, there needs to be a demand signal \u2014 like the New Clean Vehicle Tax Credit \u2014 aligned with that goal, otherwise we would be undercutting those investments and hurting American job growth,\" ZETA Executive Director Albert Gore stated on Friday.",
      "\"The potential elimination of the federal tax credit for electric vehicles by the Trump administration \u2014 without another form of incentive to replace it \u2014 could derail the trajectory of EV sales in the United States,\" offered Edmunds analysts.",
      "Trump repeatedly vowed to eliminate what he labeled President Joe Biden's \"EV mandate\" as he campaigned for the White House.",
      "While there is no such mandate in federal law, the Inflation Reduction Act passed during President Biden's term revived the credit for many EV purchases, while also granting low interest loans to manufacturers constructing EV and battery plants.",
      "Trump's transition team intends to knock out the credit as part of a broader tax-reform measure, according to a Thursday report by Reuters, which cited two sources with direct knowledge of the matter.",
      "The president-elect during his first term attempted to repeal the EV tax credit, which was expanded by President Biden in 2022.",
      "Analysts who track Tesla concurred with Musk's view that the credit's demise would only help his company.",
      "\"This is a clear negative for the EV industry at first look and would particularly hurt GM, Ford, Stellantis and Rivian,\" wrote Wedbush Securities tech analyst Daniel Ives. Conversely, \"this will enable Tesla to further fend off competition from Detroit as pricing/scale/scope is an apples-to-oranges when compared to the rest of the auto industry once the EV tax credit disappears.\"",
      "Americans looking to buy an electric car should do so sooner rather than later, advised Ivan Drury, Edmunds' director Insights.",
      "\"The federal tax credit combined with slashed prices due to slowed sales momentum has contributed to electric vehicles becoming labeled as some of the best deals on the market in 2024. Now, with production cuts shrinking supply and a fresh wave of demand from those seeking a deal while they still can, it can be all but assured that the price for that EV you've been eyeing is going up in the coming months,\" Drury stated.",

    "summary": "The Social Security Fairness Act, which would increase benefits for 2.8 million retirees, has bipartisan support but time running out.",
    "story": [
      "Efforts to get the Senate to vote on a bill to expand Social Security benefits are intensifying, as the House-passed Social Security Fairness Act enjoys rare bipartisan support but has only a short window of time \u2014 six weeks \u2014 to be passed.",
      "\"We're guardedly optimistic,\" Shannon Benton executive director of The Senior Citizens League, or TSCL, an advocacy group devoted to protecting retirement benefits, said. \"There is so much momentum, if it doesn't get passed now, a lot of people will lose hope.\"",
      "Decades in the making, the legislation would eliminate a provision that reduces Social Security payments to some retirees who also collect a pension from jobs that aren't covered by the retirement program, such as state and federal workers including teachers, police officers and U.S. postal workers. It would also end a second provision that reduces Social Security benefits for those workers' surviving spouses and family members.",
      "Various forms of the measure have been introduced over the years, but like many legislative proposals, they had failed to get enacted.",
      "\"I've been working at the league 25 years, and I don't remember ever not having a version,\" said Benton.",
      "Introduced by Reps. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., and Garret Graves, R-La., the bill was passed by the House in a 327-75 vote late Tuesday night, after a last-ditch effort to derail it by members of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus failed.",

      "The bill \"dies December 31, at the end of the second session of Congress,\" Benton said. \"Not only would this bill have to start from scratch, but a new person would have to introduce it.\"",
      "The Republican and Democratic lawmakers who introduced the measures in their respective bodies either did not run for reelection or lost their reelection bid, as was the case with Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat, who introduced the bill in the Senate.",
      "If the Social Security Fairness Act comes up for a vote in the Senate, it's expected to pass, having already secured 62 co-sponsors \u2014 surpassing the majority needed to send it to President Joe Biden for his signature.",
      "If signed into law, the changes would be effective for benefits payable after December 2023.",
      "What does the Social Security Fairness Act do?",
      "The legislation would cut two provisions that curtail retirement payments for public workers and their surviving spouses and family members, the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO), which Spanberger and Graves argue are tantamount to theft of those workers' benefits.",
      "\"For more than 40 years, the Social Security trust funds have been artificially propped up by stolen benefits that millions of Americans paid for and that their families deserve,\" they said in a Nov. 13 statement.",
      "As things stand now, the WEP reduces the Social Security benefits of workers who also receive a public pension from a job not covered by Social Security. For instance, that would include teachers who don't earn Social Security through their public school positions but who work part-time or during the summer in jobs that are covered by Social Security, even though they pay into the system over enough quarters to qualify.",
      "The GPO impacts the spousal benefits of people who work for federal, state or local governments \u2014 including police officers, firefighters and teachers \u2014 if the job is not covered by Social Security. The GPO cuts by two-thirds the benefit received by surviving spouses who also collect a government pension, often offsetting benefits entirely.",
      "For instance, under the GPO, someone who receives a $900 spousal benefit from Social Security but who also has a $1,000 non-covered pension would see their Social Security benefit cut by $667. That would leave them with a $233 remaining spousal benefit from Social Security.",
      "Under the Social Security Fairness Act, the same person would receive the entire $900 spousal benefit.",
      "\"Workers should be able to count on the retirement benefits they've earned,\" said Senator Elizabeth Warren, D-MA, an original cosponsor of the bill. \"It's time to pass the Social Security Fairness Act so government workers and their families and people with disabilities are not punished for earning multiple sources of retirement income.\"",
      "What is the chance of the Social Security Fairness Act passing?",
      "The biggest opposition to the bill is its cost. The Congressional Budget Office estimates it would cost upward of $190 billion over a decade.",
      "\"It would hasten the combined trust funds shortfall by six months to a year, when it's already in trouble,\" said Benton, who said TSCL supports reforming Social Security to resolve its projected insolvency in 2033 to 2034.",
      "\"The long-term solvency of Social Security is an issue that Congress must address \u2014 but an issue that is wholly separate from allowing Virginians, Louisianans, and Americans across our country who did their part and contributed their earnings to retire with dignity,\" Graves and Spanberger said in their joint statement.",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 11:03:39 -0500",
    "summary": "Pregnant women say health care providers are billing them to deliver their babies earlier than expected. Patient advocates say that's unethical.",
    "story": [
      "In April, just 12 weeks into her pregnancy, Kathleen Clark was standing at the receptionist window of her OB-GYN's office when she was asked to pay $960, the total the office estimated she would owe after she delivered.",
      "Clark, 39, was shocked that she was asked to pay that amount during this second prenatal visit. Normally, patients receive the bill after insurance has paid its part, and for pregnant women that's usually only when the pregnancy ends. It would be months before the office filed the claim with her health insurer.",
      "Clark said she felt stuck. The Cleveland, Tennessee, obstetrics practice was affiliated with a birthing center where she wanted to deliver. Plus, she and her husband had been wanting to have a baby for a long time. And Clark was emotional, because just weeks earlier her mother had died.",
      "\"You're standing there at the window, and there's people all around, and you're trying to be really nice,\" recalled Clark, through tears. \"So, I paid it.\"",
      "On online baby message boards and other social media forums, pregnant women say they are being asked by their providers to pay out-of-pocket fees earlier than expected. The practice is legal, but patient advocacy groups call it unethical. Medical providers argue that asking for payment up front ensures they get compensated for their services.",
      "How frequently this happens is hard to track because it is considered a private transaction between the provider and the patient. Therefore, the payments are not recorded in insurance claims data and are not studied by researchers.",
      "Patients, medical billing experts, and patient advocates say the billing practice causes unexpected anxiety at a time of already heightened stress and financial pressure. Estimates can sometimes be higher than what a patient might ultimately owe and force people to fight for refunds if they miscarry or the amount paid was higher than the final bill.",
      "Up-front payments also create hurdles for women who may want to switch providers if they are unhappy with their care. In some cases, they may cause women to forgo prenatal care altogether, especially in places where few other maternity care options exist.",
      "It's \"holding their treatment hostage,\" said Caitlin Donovan, a senior director at the Patient Advocate Foundation.",
      "Medical billing and women's health experts believe OB-GYN offices adopted the practice to manage the high cost of maternity care and the way it is billed for in the U.S.",
      "When a pregnancy ends, OB-GYNs typically file a single insurance claim for routine prenatal care, labor, delivery, and, often, postpartum care. That practice of bundling all maternity care into one billing code began three decades ago, said Lisa Satterfield, senior director of health and payment policy at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. But such bundled billing has become outdated, she said.",
      "Previously, pregnant patients had been subject to copayments for each prenatal visit, which might lead them to skip crucial appointments to save money. But the Affordable Care Act now requires all commercial insurers to fully cover certain prenatal services. Plus, it's become more common for pregnant women to switch providers, or have different providers handle prenatal care, labor, and delivery \u2014 especially in rural areas where patient transfers are common.",
      "Some providers say prepayments allow them to spread out one-time payments over the course of the pregnancy to ensure that they are compensated for the care they do provide, even if they don't ultimately deliver the baby.",
      "\"You have people who, unfortunately, are not getting paid for the work that they do,\" said Pamela Boatner, who works as a midwife in a Georgia hospital.",
      "While she believes women should receive pregnancy care regardless of their ability to pay, she also understands that some providers want to make sure their bill isn't ignored after the baby is delivered. New parents might be overloaded with hospital bills and the costs of caring for a new child, and they may lack income if a parent isn't working, Boatner said.",
      "In the U.S., having a baby can be expensive. People who obtain health insurance through large employers pay an average of nearly $3,000 out-of-pocket for pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum care, according to the Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker. In addition, many people are opting for high-deductible health insurance plans, leaving them to shoulder a larger share of the costs. Of the 100 million U.S. people with health care debt, 12% attribute at least some of it to maternity care, according to a 2022 KFF poll.",
      "Families need time to save money for the high costs of pregnancy, childbirth, and child care, especially if they lack paid maternity leave, said Joy Burkhard, CEO of the Policy Center for Maternal Mental Health, a Los Angeles-based policy think tank. Asking them to prepay \"is another gut punch,\" she said. \"What if you don't have the money? Do you put it on credit cards and hope your credit card goes through?\"",
      "Calculating the final costs of childbirth depends on multiple factors, such as the timing of the pregnancy, plan benefits, and health complications, said Erin Duffy, a health policy researcher at the University of Southern California's Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics. The final bill for the patient is unclear until a health plan decides how much of the claim it will cover, she said.",
      "But sometimes the option to wait for the insurer is taken away.",
      "During Jamie Daw's first pregnancy in 2020, her OB-GYN accepted her refusal to pay in advance because Daw wanted to see the final bill. But in 2023, during her second pregnancy, a private midwifery practice in New York told her that since she had a high-deductible plan, it was mandatory to pay $2,000 spread out with monthly payments.",
      "Daw, a health policy researcher at Columbia University, delivered in September 2023 and got a refund check that November for $640 to cover the difference between the estimate and the final bill.",
      "\"I study health insurance,\" she said. \"But, as most of us know, it's so complicated when you're really living it.\"",
      "While the Affordable Care Act requires insurers to cover some prenatal services, it doesn't prohibit providers from sending their final bill to patients early. It would be a challenge politically and practically for state and federal governments to attempt to regulate the timing of the payment request, said Sabrina Corlette, a co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University. Medical lobbying groups are powerful and contracts between insurers and medical providers are proprietary.",
      "Because of the legal gray area, Lacy Marshall, an insurance broker at Rapha Health and Life in Texas, advises clients to ask their insurer if they can refuse to prepay their deductible. Some insurance plans prohibit providers in their network from requiring payment up front.",
      "If the insurer says they can refuse to pay up front, Marshall said, she tells clients to get established with a practice before declining to pay, so that the provider can't refuse treatment.",
      "Clark said she met her insurance deductible after paying for genetic testing, extra ultrasounds, and other services out of her health care flexible spending account. Then she called her OB-GYN's office and asked for a refund.",
      "\"I got my spine back,\" said Clark, who had previously worked at a health insurer and a medical office. She got an initial check for about half the $960 she originally paid.",
      "In August, Clark was sent to the hospital after her blood pressure spiked. A high-risk pregnancy specialist \u2014 not her original OB-GYN practice \u2014 delivered her son, Peter, prematurely via emergency cesarean section at 30 weeks.",
      "It was only after she resolved most of the bills from the delivery that she received the rest of her refund from the other OB-GYN practice.",
      "This final check came in October, just days after Clark brought Peter home from the hospital, and after multiple calls to the office. She said it all added stress to an already stressful period.",
      "\"Why am I having to pay the price as a patient?\" she said. \"I'm just trying to have a baby.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 21:45:03 -0500",
    "summary": "Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will head an effort, dubbed DOGE, to reduce wasteful federal spending. Here's what it's about.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump is vowing to reduce wasteful federal spending by tapping two billionaires \u2014 Tesla CEO Elon Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy \u2014 to spearhead the initiative, which the president-elect is calling the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.",
      "The appointments, announced by Trump on Tuesday, raise a host of questions about the effort, including whether Musk and Ramaswamy will have the authority to make changes in federal outlays, given that Congress authorizes the nation's spending, as well as where the businessmen might look to cut spending. Under the plan, meanwhile, DOGE is not an official government department, raising questions about its powers and how it will operate.",
      "Speaking Thursday night at Mar-a-Lago at a gala hosted by the right-leaning think tank the America First Policy Institute, Ramaswamy thanked Trump \"for making sure that Elon Musk and I are in a position to start the mass deportations of millions of unelected federal bureaucrats out of the D.C. bureaucracy.\"",
      "\"And I don't know if you've got to know Elon yet, but he doesn't bring a chisel, he brings a chainsaw, and we're going to be taking it to that bureaucracy,\" Ramaswamy added. \"It's going to be a lot of fun.\"",
      "The announcement comes a week after Trump won a second term\u00a0as president, with voters expressing their dissatisfaction with the economy under the Biden administration. As part of his campaign vows, Trump promised to slash government spending. Musk's bio on X, the social media platform he bought in 2022, now reads, \"The people voted for major government reform.\"",
      "\"Frankly, it does need to be done again, so every few decades you really need to look at everything,\" Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution who managed the Clinton Administration's National Performance Review, an effort to cut government spending in the 1990s, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "But Kamarck harbors reservations about Musk and Ramaswamy's mandate, especially after the former recently suggested he could find more than $2 trillion in savings \u2014 almost one-third of the federal government's $6.7 trillion in annual spending. Two-thirds of that spending is mandatory through programs including Social Security and Medicare, while discretionary spending is largely spent on defense.",
      "\"This is the first warning sign that this is going to be a failed operation,\" Kamarck said. \"That's insane.\"",
      "Speaking on transformational change within government and organizations, Michael Morris, a professor at Columbia University's Columbia Business School, noted there are two models: a bottom-up, grassroots effort and a top-down strategy \u2014 sometimes called a shock-change approach. DOGE likely belongs to the latter, according to Morris, who is also author of the nonfiction book \"Tribal,\" about how people form and relate to each other through group dynamics.",
      "\"Unless you have a new leader with incredible legitimacy and the status quo with no legitimacy, you rarely have people responding well to shock therapy,\" he said. \"It's hard to see it happening in this case \u2014 I don't think Musk is going to be able to form a deep knowledge of government.\"",
      "The Trump campaign didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Here's what to know about the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "What is the Department of Government Efficiency?",
      "Trump announced the DOGE in a statement on Tuesday, describing it as an effort to \"slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies.\"",
      "The name is a nod to Musk's support for a cryptocurrency called dogecoin, which was created as a joke by two software engineers and uses the image of a smiling Shiba Inu dog. (Dogecoin has more than tripled in price during the last month, and now trades at 38 cents.)",
      "Trump said Musk and Ramaswamy's work \"will conclude no later than July 4, 2026,\" or by the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "Trump only outlined the initiative's contours and didn't disclose how it will be staffed or funded. The Trump campaign didn't respond to a request about the DOGE's funding or whether Musk or Ramaswamy will be paid for their work on the effort.",
      "On Thursday, an X account for DOGE said the group is accepting resumes from \"super high-IQ small-government revolutionaries willing to work 80+ hours per week on unglamorous cost-cutting.\" In a separate post, Musk said \"compensation is zero.\"",
      "Can the DOGE actually cut federal spending?",
      "At the moment, that appears unlikely given that the DOGE isn't a real government department, which would need to be created by congressional approval. Federal spending is authorized by Congress, and senators and House representatives may hesitate to support cuts to major programs like Social Security or Medicare, which are popular with millions of voters, or to the nation's military.",
      "It's also not clear how the organization will operate. It could come under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which dictates how external groups that advise the government must operate and be accountable to the public.",
      "Trump described Musk and Ramaswamy's role as providing \"advice and guidance from outside of government.\"",
      "That doesn't amount to much, Kamarck said.",
      "\"They have no authority \u2014 none whatsoever,\" she added, while noting that the backing of the president can help convince lawmakers to throw their support behind efficiency efforts.",
      "However, Trump's aides are reportedly working on a way to enact some of DOGE's spending recommendations without requiring congressional approval, the Washington Post reported.",
      "What have Musk and Ramaswamy said about federal spending?",
      "Musk, the world's richest person with a net worth of $319 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, has described the U.S. government as bloated and said it its spending is unsustainable. The Tesla founder also said he wants to reduce the number of federal agencies to 99, down from more than 400.",
      "\"There are so many [agencies] that people have never heard of, and that have overlapping areas of responsibilities,\" Musk\u00a0said earlier this month.",
      "While on the campaign trail with Trump, Musk also\u00a0said\u00a0he could cut \"at least $2 trillion\" from the annual budget. \"Your money is being wasted, and the Department of Government Efficiency will fix that,\" Musk said.",
      "Musk is known for cost-cutting at his own companies, slashing\u00a0most of X's workforce after he bought the business two years ago as well as focusing on manufacturing costs at Tesla. Even so, those efforts have had mixed results, with X's valuation falling by about 80% since his purchase. Tesla's stock price, meanwhile, has surged 48% in the past year, bumping its value above $1 trillion.",
      "Ramaswamy, whom Forbes says has a net worth of about $1 billion, dropped out of the presidential race in January after running on an \"anti-woke\"\u00a0campaign. He also advocated for government cuts by eliminating the Department of Education, a goal shared by President-elect Trump.",
      "Have administrations previously tried to cut costs?",
      "Yes, both Republican and Democratic presidents have created efforts to cut government spending.",
      "In 1982, President Ronald Reagan created the Grace Commission, led by wealthy businessman J. Peter Grace, the CEO of W. R. Grace & Company, a chemicals business. About 150 business people volunteered for the commission, which ultimately recommended 2,500 reforms, according to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.",
      "\"Most of the recommendations, especially those requiring legislation from Congress, were never implemented,\" the library notes. \"However, the Commission's work provided a starting point for many conservative critiques of the federal government.\"",
      "In the 1990s, President Bill Clinton created the National Performance Review with the goal to create a government that would work better and cost less, Kamarck said. The group was staffed with civil servants who understood the bureaucracy, and many of whom had frustrations with it, she added.",
      "The group had some successes in streamlining operations and paring costs, eventually cutting more than 300,000 jobs, according to a study from the Congressional Research Service. Kamarck noted that the group also focused on integrating technology into departments at a time when the internet was just emerging, leading to efficiencies such as online tax filing.",
      "Where could the Trump administration cut spending?",
      "While experts are skeptical of Musk's claim he can cut $2 trillion in spending, they also point out there are opportunities to look at efficiencies.",
      "Eliminating Medicare fraud is one area that could result in savings, according to the Citizens Against Government Waste, a nonpartisan group that looks at government spending. Its recommendations also include reducing the nation's contributions to the U.N. and ending subsidies for some agricultural products, like dairy and sugar. Its projected savings: $377 billion in the first year, or about 19% of the $2 trillion that Musk is eyeballing.",
      "But efficiency goes beyond cost-cutting, Kamarck noted. It's also about understanding how the bureaucracy works.",
      "\"Every single thing in the federal government is big and complicated, and there are layers and layers of complexity,\" she noted. \"Al Gore and I relied on hundreds of experienced civil servants to tell us how this worked \u2014 and if you don't do this, which I suspect they won't because Musk is an arrogant billionaire, you will fail.\"",
      "Does Musk have conflicts of interest?",
      "Yes, as Musk's SpaceX works with the Department of Defense and NASA, with the federal government pledging $3 billion to his companies last year, according to the New York Times. Tesla, meanwhile, has been investigated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, as well as by other agencies.",
      "Federal employees are generally required to disclose their financial assets and entanglements to ward off any potential conflicts of interest, and to divest significant holdings relating to their work. Because Musk and Ramaswamy would not be formal federal workers, they would not face those requirements or ethical limitations.",
      "Then there's also the question of Musk's ability to juggle another major role, given that he is also running several businesses, from Tesla to SpaceX, Columbia Business School's Morris noted.",
      "\"The whole question of Elon coming into government, that he's going to be this sort of roving efficiency expert, like a McKinsey consultant looking over the shoulders of the entire government \u2014 it's absurd on so many levels,\" Morris said. \"He's already the CEO of companies that are very demanding of his time.\"",
      "He added, \"To do work in government of this sort, you have to be process-oriented in a way that he has never been before.\"",

      "The USPS said it lost $9.5 billion in the fiscal year ended September 30, compared with a loss of $6.5 billion a year earlier. The postal service blamed the wider loss on billions spent on noncash contributions to worker compensation.",
      "Excluding that expense as well as what it described as other \"certain expenses that are not controllable by management,\" the USPS said it would have lost $1.8 billion in fiscal 2024, compared with a loss of more than $2.2 billion a year earlier. Revenue rose 1.7% to $79.5 billion in the most recent fiscal year.",
      "The USPS is in the midst of a 10-year overhaul engineered by DeJoy, who has argued that higher postal rates and other changes are essential to staunch the postal service's financial bleeding. Under his original plan, the USPS had aimed to turn a profit in fiscal 2024, but instead, the agency has now reported mounting losses for two consecutive years, raising questions about the effectiveness of the turnaround effort.",
      "DeJoy said the agency is focused on reducing its costs, but that it is also dealing with \"many economic, legislative and regulatory obstacles for us to overcome.\"",
      "The USPS has raised postage rates twice in 2024, with a two-cent per stamp increase in January and a second boost in July, which raised the cost of a Forever stamp to 73 cents.",

    "summary": "One couple took out a loan to cover the out-of-network costs of an abortion and drove eight hours to a hospital in the neighboring state.",
    "story": [
      "Four women suing over Idaho's strict abortion ban told a judge Tuesday how excitement over their pregnancies turned to grief and fear after they learned their fetuses were not likely to survive to birth \u2014 and how they had to leave the state to get abortions amid fears that pregnancy complications would put their own health in danger.",
      "\"We felt like we were being made refugees, medical refugees,\" said Jennifer Adkins, one of the plaintiffs in the case.",
      "The women, represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights, aren't asking for the state's abortion ban to be overturned. Instead, they want the judge to clarify and expand the exceptions to the strict ban so that people facing serious pregnancy complications can receive abortions before they are at death's door.",
      "Currently, the state's near-total ban makes performing an abortion a felony at any stage of pregnancy unless it is \"necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.\"",
      "Adkins' fetus had a severe medical condition that meant the fetus would not survive the pregnancy. The illness also put Adkins at risk of developing \"mirror syndrome,\" a dangerous syndrome that can cause fatally high blood pressure and other issues, she said.",
      "Adkins and her husband, John, decided to seek an abortion, and learned, after another ultrasound showed the fetus still had a heartbeat, that they would have to go out of state to get one.",
      "Idaho law prohibits a woman from getting an abortion when a fetal heartbeat is detected, with the exception of cases of rape, incest or a \"medical emergency,\" defined by the law as \"a condition that, in reasonable medical judgment, so complicates the medical condition of a pregnant woman as to necessitate the immediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert her death or for which a delay will create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\"",
      "\"No parent wants to wish that when they look at an ultrasound they don't see their baby's heartbeat, yet here I was hoping that I wouldn't,\" Adkins said. \"I wanted the decision to be made for us, and I wanted to end her suffering, so it was really hard to see that and know that we had the challenges ahead of us that we did.\"",
      "\"I was not willing to watch my son suffer\"",
      "Kayla Smith cried as she told the judge how she found out she was pregnant for a second time on Mother's Day of 2022, and how she and her husband chose the name \"Brooks\" for their son. She was around 18 or 20 weeks along in her pregnancy when the sonographer grew quiet during a routine anatomy scan, Smith said.",
      "Brooks' heart had fatal anomalies, and the young family could not find a pediatric cardiologist willing to attempt an operation. The veins supplying Brooks' lungs were also abnormal, Smith said, and he would not survive birth.",
      "Smith had developed dangerously high blood pressure during a previous pregnancy, and she was at risk of developing the condition called preeclampsia again.",
      "\"If I were to continue pregnancy not only would I risk my life with preeclampsia, I was not willing to watch my son suffer and potentially gasp for air,\" Smith said, crying.",
      "Idaho's abortion ban went into effect two days before Brooks' diagnosis, she said, making it impossible for her to get an abortion in her home state.",
      "\"We wanted to meet our son \u2014 that was really important to us \u2014 so we needed to do it in a hospital,\" she said.",
      "They took out a loan to cover the estimated $16,000 to $20,000 out-of-network cost for the procedure and drove more than eight hours to a hospital where doctors induced labor.",
      "\"All four of these women were overjoyed to be pregnant with their second child and all four of them received the worst news a mother can imagine,\" attorney Gail Deady, with the Center for Reproductive Rights, told 4th District Judge Jason D. Scott during opening arguments. All of them sought abortions \"to protect their health, to spare their babies from pain and suffering, and to remain alive and healthy to protect their young children.\"",
      "James Craig, a division chief with the Idaho Attorney General's office, said the women and their attorneys are relying on hypotheticals rather than concrete facts to make their case. Under their proposal, a pregnant woman could receive her abortion for something as minor as stepping on a rusty nail \u2014 even though the risk of infection in that scenario could be easily treated by receiving a tetanus booster shot, Craig said.",
      "\"Unborn children have a fundamental right to life, and protecting the lives of children is a legitimate and fundamental government interest,\" Craig said.",
      "The state also has the same interest in protecting the lives of women, Craig said \u2014 and the abortion ban laws do both, he contended.",
      "In the \"rare circumstances where abortion is necessary\" to prevent the death of the mother, Idaho law allows that to occur, Craig said. The women suing are trying to \"usurp the role of the Legislature\" by asking the judge to rewrite the law, he said, and that is not the proper role of the court.",
      "Dr. Emily Corrigan, an ob-gyn who works in emergency medicine at Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center who is also a plaintiff in the case, told the judge how Idaho's multiple abortion bans have created confusion for physicians and made it difficult to treat pregnant patients who need emergency care.",
      "Doctors have had to \"basically guess which pregnancy conditions would fall under the state medical exception,\" Corrigan said.",
      "\"I have had other hospital staff refuse to participate in the care of my patients because of the lack of understanding of the laws, and this has caused patient care delays,\" she said. \"I have personally cared for several patients who have been denied stabilizing abortion care at other hospitals in Idaho. By the time they arrive at my institution, their conditions have deteriorated and have lead to increased complications that I need to manage.\"",
      "Several conditions can put the health of pregnant people at risk, she said. Some are caused by pregnancy like preeclampsia, and others \u2014 including some chronic illnesses and cancers \u2014 can be made worse by pregnancy, she said. In those cases, delaying an abortion might not cause immediate death but can cause a shortened life span or have dramatic effects on a person's health, Corrigan said.",

      "\"There is obviously a niche in the market for historical jewels with fabulous provenances... People are not only buying the object, but they're buying all the history that is attached to it,\" he said.",
      "Some of the diamonds in the piece are believed to stem from the jewel at the center of the \"Diamond Necklace Affair\" \u2014 a scandal in the 1780s that further tarnished the reputation of France's last queen, Marie Antoinette, and boosted support for the coming French Revolution.",
      "The auction house said the necklace, composed of three rows of diamonds finished with a diamond tassel at each end, had emerged \"miraculously intact\" from a private Asian collection to make its first public appearance in 50 years.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 07:28:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump claims he can unilaterally impose sweeping tariffs on U.S. imports. The reality is more complicated, according to trade experts.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump, who recently described \"tariff\" as\u00a0\"the most beautiful word in the dictionary,\" has proposed a range of taxes on imports from other countries. The president-elect's stated aim: to reduce American companies' use of foreign goods and parts by raising their cost, a policy he contends would strengthen the U.S.' international trade position and boost job growth at home.",
      "Trump has also claimed that he doesn't need Congress' support to impose sweeping tariffs. The reality is more complicated, according to economists and foreign trade experts.",
      "What has Trump proposed?",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump proposed tariffs of up to 60% on Chinese goods. He's offered few additional details, however, such as whether the tariffs would apply to all goods or just certain categories of products.",
      "He's also proposed much broader tariffs of 10% to 20% on all imports, including those from key allies and trade partners, and has promised retaliatory levies on any country that imposes taxes on American-made goods.",
      "Can Trump unilaterally impose tariffs?",
      "Once he takes office, President-elect Trump has several possible pathways for implementing tariffs.",
      "The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the authority to impose tariffs in Article 1, Section 8, which states that \"The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties\u2026To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.\" But Congress can also selectively delegate tariff-setting authority to the president, which it has done for decades.",
      "In his first term as president from 2017-2021, Trump freely exercised this presidential authority to increase tariffs: Total duties paid on U.S. imports doubled from roughly $37 billion in 2015 to $74 billion in 2020, according to the\u00a0Congressional Research Service.",
      "\"Looking at his previous four years in office, he seems to believe he has the authority to impose tariffs,\" said Jake Colvin, president of the National Foreign Trade Council, a group dedicated to advocating for U.S. companies in international commerce. \"If they decide on day one that they want to use executive authority to put tariffs on Chinese goods, they could probably go ahead and do that.\"",
      "Colvin added that it will be important for the incoming Trump administration to provide businesses with more specifics so that companies can plan accordingly. \"A lot has been proposed in the course of the campaign, so it's important for the administration to give a signal about the path it intends to pursue, for clarity and planning purposes for American businesses,\" he said.",
      "How fast is Trump likely to move?",
      "The president has authority to impose a range of trade restrictions on foreign nations, said Inu Manak, a trade policy fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "\"It seems pretty clear that he would pursue tariffs soon after taking office. During his last term, tariffs were a tool of choice in the trade war against China and against allies, too. So I believe that is a strategy he'll replicate in his next term,\" Manak told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Manak added that he would likely be able to do so without support from Congress. \"The president has quite a bit of discretion to do what he wants,\" she said.",
      "Legal powers at Trump's disposal include Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, under which the president may impose retaliatory tariffs when \"an act policy, or practice of a foreign country \u2026 violates, or is inconsistent with, the provisions of, or otherwise denies benefits to the United States under, any trade agreement, or \u2026 is unjustifiable and burdens or restricts United States commerce.\"",
      "Trump previously\u00a0invoked\u00a0Section 301 to impose tariffs on China in 2018 and 2019 \u2014 many of which have been continued under the Biden administration \u2014 and he could simply expand upon existing tariff actions he's already taken, according to Manak.",
      "\"That would require no action from Congress because they are already in place,\" she said.",
      "What other power Trump does have?",
      "In his previous term as president, he also made use of\u00a0Section 232\u00a0of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. It grants the president the authority to adjust imports, including by imposing tariffs, when they are deemed a threat to national security.",
      "There's also the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), although it hasn't used to restrict trade since President Richard Nixon was in office. The act says: \"Any authority granted to the President by ... this title may be exercised to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat ... to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States, if the President declares a national emergency with respect to such threat.\"",
      "\"The authorities granted to the President ... may only be exercised to deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat with respect to which a national emergency ...\" it adds in part.",
      "In other words, in order to use IEEPA to impose tariffs, Trump would have to declare a national emergency through an executive order, claiming that a U.S. trading partner posed a major threat.",
      "Alan Wm. Wolff, former deputy director-general of the World Trade Organization and a distinguished visiting fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE), is skeptical that Trump has the authority to impose sweeping tariffs under IEEPA.",
      "\"Can it be used against trade with all countries, our allies and friends in Europe and Asia, in the Americas, not to mention the poorest countries in Africa? That would simply be too large a power grab to have been within what Congress intended in this statute,\" he wrote in a recent blog post.",
      "Manak also said Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930 could conceivably give the president the authority to unilaterally raise tariffs. The rarely used act allows the president to impose duties of up to 50% of a product's value, and is triggered when a president finds that a foreign country has imposed an unreasonable charge on, or discriminated against, U.S. commerce.",
      "Typically, though, that has to be determine by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC). \"But the statute's language is ambiguous in terms of what that would look like, and I would imagine he could pursue this without a final finding from ITC, or pursue it while a finding is being made,\" Manak said.",
      "How would sweeping tariffs affect U.S. consumers?",
      "Some companies have already said they're aiming to move production out of China to avoid Trump's proposed tariffs. Shoemaker Steve Madden, for example, said last week week it plans to import fewer goods made in China and replace them with items made in other countries.",
      "If imposed, the proposed tariffs on imports could lead to consumers losing between $46 billion and $78 billion in spending power each year on products including apparel, toys, furniture, household appliances, footwear and travel goods, according to the National Retail Federation.",
      "By another estimate, a 20% general tariff on all imported goods, combined with a 60% tariff on goods imported from China, would cost the typical U.S. households more than $2,600 a year. If Trump instead imposed a 10% across-the-board tariff, that would cost families $1,700 more, according to PIIE.",
      "Experts expect the incoming Trump administration to impose some proposed tariffs quickly, while perhaps phasing in or threatening to apply other levies over time in a bid to gain trade concessions.",
      "\"We would imagine that within a few months of him taking office, we would see the first tranche of tariffs taking effect,\" Manak said.",

      "U.S. inflation rose 2.6% on an annual basis last month, representing an uptick from September when the Federal Reserve began cutting interest rates amid signs of cooling prices and a weaker labor market.",
      "That matched forecasts from economists polled by FactSet that the Consumer Price Index rose 2.6% in October. The CPI rose 2.4% in September, when the Fed ushered in a jumbo rate cut of 0.5 percentage points, followed by a second rate cut this month.",
      "The slight rise on a month-over-month basis signals that the Fed's battle to tame inflation to its goal of a 2% annual rate might take a bumpy path over the next months. Some types of goods and services, from housing to insurance products, are still experiencing sharply higher prices, crimping consumers' budgets and creating economic headwinds.",
      "\"Looking ahead to the next six months, we foresee consumers and businesses still spending but doing so more prudently amid still-elevated costs and rates,\" noted EY chief economist Gregory Daco in a November 11 research note.",
      "A key driver of last month's inflation bump was the housing market, with shelter prices rising 0.4% in October, contributing about half of the monthly increase, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Wednesday. Transportation costs also rose due to higher airfares and a 14% annual jump in auto insurance, the report said.",
      "Despite the monthly uptick in prices, the Federal Reserve is forecast to cut rates for a third time this year at its December meeting, with two-thirds of economists polled by FactSet predicting a 0.25 percentage point cut. The latest CPI report isn't likely to derail that, given that the inflation numbers were in line with expectations, noted Lindsay Rosner, head of multi sector fixed income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management in an email.",

      "23andMe on Tuesday announced it is slashing 40% of its workforce as part of a restructuring plan. The move comes after its entire board resigned in September. Its stock price has since plunged, prompting speculation that the company could be acquired by another buyer and sparking concern among customers about the security of their genetic information.",
      "CEO Anne Wojcicki has said she intends to take the company private and is not considering third-party takeover proposals.",
      "Customer data collected from its genetic testing tools makes up the company's most valuable asset. Because 23andMe is not a health care company, health privacy laws don't apply, raising questions about what the business might opt to do with its 15 million users' personal genetic data.",
      "Under 23andMe's current user agreement, users must opt-in to allow the company to share their personal DNA or data. The agreement states that if the company is acquired, customers' data may be accessed or sold as part of such a transaction.",
      "23andMe told CBS MoneyWatch correspondent Kelly O'Grady that while there are no plans for a sale, the current privacy agreement would apply.",
      "Meanwhile, at least 11 states have passed privacy laws that would require customers' consent before their genetic data is transferred.",
      "Still, experts say a new owner could change 23andMe's privacy terms following a sale, potentially putting the onus on consumers to push back against any move to share their data.",

Any data that shared is anonymized and cannot be traced back to individual customers, according to the company.",

      "Church's use of the term \"original recipe\" in its advertising is \"likely to deceive, confuse and mislead purchasers and prospective purchasers into believing the goods and services offered under the mark are affiliated with, authorized by, or come from KFC,\" the chain operated by Yum Brands claimed in a lawsuit filed last week in U.S. District Court in Texas.",

      "Temu and Shein have won over\u00a0many Gen Z shoppers and other bargain hunters by offering low-cost clothing, electronics and other items that typically ship directly from manufacturers in China. At the same time, U.S. consumers are still feeling the bite of inflation that hit a 40-year high in the pandemic, with many searching for deals as a result.",
      "\"Amazon Haul is a response to both the rise of low-price Chinese marketplaces and the fact that consumers are increasingly seeking value for money as they try to make their budgets stretch further,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director of market research firm GlobalData.",
      "He added, \"The value retail segment has been a major growth area over the past few years, and while the regular Amazon site has a good value-for-money reputation, its wide offer means that it is not primarily seen as an everyday low-price destination.\"",

      "Amazon Haul is an online storefront within the Amazon app that sells low-cost items, aimed especially at consumers who shop at discount retailers such as Temu and Shein.",

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump has called the Biden administration's student loan relief efforts a \"total catastrophe.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Joe Biden made student loan forgiveness a central issue to his administration, rolling out efforts to forgive debt as well as to lower repayments for millions of borrowers. But with President-elect Donald Trump returning to the White House in January, the future of those efforts is now in question.",
      "During the presidential debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump described Mr. Biden's efforts to forgive student borrowers as \"a total catastrophe.\" While he hasn't explicitly addressed his plans for student loans, he's called for eliminating the Department of Education, which manages the $1.6 trillion federal student loan portfolio.",
      "It's unclear which agency or group would manage those loans if the Education Department were to be eliminated, a step that would require approval from Congress. The Trump campaign didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about Trump's plans for student debt relief.",
      "There's a lot on the line for the 46 million Americans who hold $1.7 trillion in student loans, a financial burden that about half of borrowers say has impacted their life choices, delaying home purchases or starting their families, according to a 2021 Morning Consult study. Mr. Biden's term is drawing to an end with two of his key relief efforts tied up in the courts, adding to the uncertainty about what Trump's second presidency will mean for those plans.",
      "\"We know what is in Project 2025, and we know what we saw in the first Trump administration,\" Persis Yu, managing counsel for the Student Borrower Protection Center, an advocacy group for people with student loans. \"We just should be very concerned about what the next administration will mean for borrowers.\"",
      "The next Trump administration may be unlikely to continue the Biden administration's effort to fight against ongoing lawsuits targeting current student debt relief efforts, according to NerdWallet lending expert Kate Wood in an email. That could mean an end to those programs, experts say.",
      "\"Programs that the Biden administration created or expanded access to via regulatory changes could be easily rolled back,\" she added.",
      "What has Trump said about student loan relief?",
      "During his September debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump bashed the Biden administration's efforts.",
      "\"When they said they're going to get student loans terminated and it ended up being a total catastrophe. He went out, got rejected again by the Supreme Court,\" Trump said, referring to the high court's 2023 decision\u00a0that blocked Mr. Biden's initial student loan forgiveness program, which would have provided up to $20,000 in relief per borrower.",
      "\"So all these students got taunted with this whole thing about \u2014 this whole idea. And how unfair that would have been. Part of the reason they lost,\" he added.",
      "What does Project 2025 say about student loans?",
      "Project 2025\u00a0\u2014 an initiative overseen by the conservative Heritage Foundation to guide the next Republican president in an overhaul of the executive branch \u2014 calls for the abolishment of the Department of Education, and says student loans should be handled by the private sector. It also advocates for scuttling student loan relief.",
      "\"The new administration must end the practice of acting like the federal student loan portfolio is a campaign fund to curry political support and votes,\" Project 2025 says. \"The new administration must end abuses in the loan forgiveness programs. Borrowers should be expected to repay their loans.\"",
      "It's unclear whether Trump agrees with those views, although he has called for an end to the Education Department. While on the campaign trail, Trump distanced himself from Project 2025, calling some of the proposals \"abysmal.\"",
      "What is the status of Biden's student loan relief plans?",
      "Currently, there are two student loan relief plans that are tied up in court, both of which are being challenged by Republican-led states.",
      "The\u00a0Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, is an income-driven repayment program, which pegs a borrower's monthly payment to their income, lowering their financial costs. Some lower-income borrowers in SAVE have monthly payments of $0.",
      "The plan's 8 million enrollees are now in limbo, however, after court rulings blocked the Biden administration from implementing the plan. Currently, those borrowers are in forbearance through April, meaning that their loans are essentially paused while the Biden administration defends the plan in court.",
      "Separately, another Biden administration plan to use\u00a0the Higher Education Act to erase all or some of the student debt held by 30 million borrowers has also hit a legal roadblock, with a court putting that plan on hold in October.",
      "In the latter case, the Republican states argued that Mr. Biden's plan sought to \"unlawfully mass cancel up to hundreds of billions of dollars in student loans.\" The Education Department vowed to defend both plans.",
      "What could happen to these programs under Trump?",
      "Bob Eitel, who served during the first Trump administration as a senior counselor to the education secretary, said he expects the president-elect will move to rescind the proposed loan cancellation regulations.",
      "\"The Trump administration may pursue different avenues of loan relief, but it will not be the mass, blanket types of forgiveness that the current administration has pursued,\" said Eitel, president and co-founder of the Defense of Freedom Institute for Policy Studies.",
      "Some other student loan relief programs may remain, such as the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which would be tougher to eliminate but could become less accessible, said NerdWallet's Wood.",
      "That program, which was signed into law by former President George W. Bush in 2007, forgives student debt for public workers like teachers and police officers after 10 years in repayment. The Biden administration reworked the PSLF to make it easier for people to qualify for forgiveness, after the vast majority of people who applied were told they were ineligible.",
      "During Trump's first term, the Education Department was overseen by Betsy DeVos, who promoted school choice in K-12 and also called for deep spending cuts. She also proposed ending the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, although she was unsuccessful.",
      "Do Americans support student loan relief?",
      "It's a divisive issue among voters, with people's views colored by their political leanings and whether they themselves have student debt, according to an AP-Norc poll published in June.",
      "Only 15% of Republicans believe student loan forgiveness is important, versus 58% of Democrats. More than half of people currently paying student loans say it's an important issue, versus one-third of those with no experience with student debt, the poll found.",
      "Republicans have objected to Mr. Biden's efforts because they could deprive some lenders of revenue, while some object to forgiving loans for people who enrolled in college, given that a minority of Americans have college degrees.",
      "The Biden administration is \"saddling working Americans with Ivy League debt,\" said Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey in a September statement.",

This year's field included: the party game Apples to Apples, balloons, \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" gamebooks, Hess Toy Trucks, Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game, remote-controlled vehicles, Sequence, the stick horse and trampoline.",
      "\"These are three very deserving toys that showcase the wide range of how people play,\" Christopher Bensch, vice president for collections and chief curator, said in a statement. \"But for My Little Pony in particular, this year is extra validating. The beloved toy was a finalist seven times before finally crossing the finish line!\"",
      "Hasbro's mini-horses, distinguishable by different \"cutie marks\" on their haunches, were introduced in the 1980s and reintroduced in 2003, outselling even Barbie for several years.",
      "The collectibles were recognized for encouraging fantasy and storytelling \u2014 the kind of creative play the Hall of Fame demands of inductees \u2014 along with popularity over time.",

      "Transformers",
      "Transformers came along in the 1980s, when Hasbro bought the rights to several existing Japanese toy lines featuring transforming robots. They were first marketed with a cartoon and have since graduated to a series of live-action films. Social media sites allow for debates over which figures are must-haves, as well as demonstrations of the sometimes complex process of manipulating them from robot to vehicle or other alternate form.",

In September, the cost of food that consume at home rose 1.3%, below the Federal Reserve's goal of driving inflation down to a 2% annual rate. And grocery prices may remain relatively flat in 2025, with the USDA projecting that food-at-home costs will increase only 1.6% next year.",

      "Do you think the Ethics Committee should make that decision for itself?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Well, I think the Ethics Committee does make that decision for itself. But I think Speaker Johnson makes an important point, which is, Mr. Gaetz has resigned from Congress. There are many investigations that the House Ethics Committee has done, and we don't want to set a precedent where we, under any circumstances, will release documents from that committee.",
      "But that decision is theirs. Speaker Johnson has made his views known, and now it will be up to the Senate to conduct their advise-and-consent confirmation process.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, CBS News reported back in June that four women informed that committee they were paid to go to sex and drug-fueled parties with Mr. Gaetz.",
      "Also, the Ethics Committee has Venmo transactions showing Gaetz's payments for the women. Since taxpayers paid money for this report to be conducted, and it was done, do you think, if you were a Senate, you would consider this material information to confirming the top lawmaker for the United States of America \u2013 law enforcement officer, I should say?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: No.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Like I say, I don't \u2013 I don't have \u2013 I don't personally know any details about the Ethics investigation or the allegations because I haven't \u2013 don't serve on that committee.",
      "But your point is, would the Senate Judiciary Committee ask to see that report? And that may well be a decision that they take. And the Ethics Committee has a decision that they have to make. And Mike Johnson's expressed his view on that as well.",
      "So, as I say, this is an important process that the Senate has to do advise and consent for all the nominations. And President Trump has the prerogative to nominate the people that he thinks can best lead the change that he believes the American people are seeking in each of the agencies of the federal government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have spoken to us before here on Face the Nation about your work around Syria and Bashar al-Assad's oppressive regime there. You actually visited Northern Syrian, an area that he wasn't in control of, back in 2017, the first lawmaker since John McCain to do so.",
      "Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, when she was in office, went to Syria and met with Mr. Assad himself. Then, publicly, she came out and questioned U.S. intelligence assessments of his chemical weapons attacks that were carried out on civilian areas, not just once, multiple times.",
      "These were high-confidence assessments by the intelligence community. Would you feel comfortable with her at the helm of all 18 of them?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Well, I serve on the House Intelligence Committee during this past Congress, and I know the important job that the DNI performs in coordinating, collecting and reporting on our intelligence.",
      "And I think, should Tulsi Gabbard be confirmed, she would know with high confidence as to precisely how we collect intelligence, how we coordinate and collaborate on it, and how we then report it to the president of the United States and to the two Intelligence Committees.",
      "So, again, this is an important assessment for the Senate to make. But I remind you, Margaret, Donald Trump won the election. He wants people that he has a good relationship with, that he trusts, that he believes can do a good job in the agencies to send the message that we want change in Washington.",
      "And the Senate too has their important job. And we're going to have to wait and see how the Senate handles each of these confirmations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, it was John McCain who went in 2017. You went in 2023. I may have misspoken there on the year.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Right. Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But \u2013 so you believe the U.S. intelligence community conclusions, though? You don't mean to question those?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: No, I don't.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: I'm simply saying, as a member of the committee, I don't question that public assessment that's been made in the public domain over many, many years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: And I have led the charge against the Assad regime.",
      "I do not support that the Arab League put him back into diplomatic standing by admitting him to the Arab League. And I think America has a lot to do to limit Assad's influence in the region, which is a partner with the Russians and the Iranians. And that's not in the interest of the United States, Iraq, Israel, or peace in the region.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have also been a supporter of Ukraine. And you have been trying to find some creative ways to help allow them to gain access to continued U.S. support.",
      "There was a tremendous attack just overnight there by Russia. The Biden administration wants to provide a $20 billion loan backed up by frozen Russian assets. Will the Congress give them permission to use that money for military assistance?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Well, the REPO Act that was included in the national security package I worked on very closely with Chairman Mike McCaul of the Foreign Affairs Committee gives the United States the authority to not only take frozen assets, but confiscate them and use them for the benefit of Ukraine.",
      "The loan you're referring to has been negotiated between the Europeans and the Americans to back the Ukrainian government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: I believe that will go through, in my judgment.",
      "But I would urge President Trump, as he takes office, to actually follow the law and confiscate those Russian assets, as I believe that gives both Ukraine, the United States, and Europe a much stronger negotiating position with Russia. And I don't believe Biden, nor the G7 countries have been tough enough on Russian on sanctions, on the delivery of weapons that were needed to have ended this war long ago.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're gesturing to what we know, which is that this is a pretty dangerous world right now.",
      "One of the selections that the president-elect has made to run the Pentagon at this time is Pete Hegseth. He would be the defense secretary, 44 years old, decorated Army vet, TV commentator. Do you think experience is necessary, or is on-the-job training OK at the Pentagon?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Well, again, I think this will be assessed by the Senate in their confirmation process.",
      "He has a distinguished background in the military. And that counts for a lot. And I think his plans, his thoughts, his leadership will be exposed when he goes through that Senate confirmation process.",
      "But, once again, I have to say, President Trump, when he came into office in 2017, had Cabinet members that he really had no personal relationship with, had no working background with. He wants to correct that this time by finding people that he has a good working relationship with, he knows how they think, they know how he thinks, because he thinks it will lead to better decision-making in his administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: He's got that prerogative to nominate those men and women, and the Senate will have their advice-and-consent function well underway.",
      "And Majority-Leader-to-be John Thune has said, look, he will be effective\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: \u2026 he will be speedy, he will take it done \u2013 get it done in the right course of action.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, thank you for your time today.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: You bet. Thank you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we turn now to Democratic Congressman Jim Himes. He is the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, and he joins us this morning from Stamford, Connecticut.",
      "Good morning to you.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES (D-Connecticut): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I feel like there is so much news, and I'm getting through a fraction of it, frankly, here.",
      "I want to pick up on Tulsi Gabbard, which we just \u2013 who we just discussed in the previous segment,. She was a Democratic colleague of yours for many, many years. You're the ranking member on the Intelligence Committee. She never served on that kind of committee. Do you think experience is necessary? Is she fit for the job?",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Margaret, how far we have come that, on a major news show, the question we're examining is, is experience necessary for one of the most powerful positions in the land?",
      "Of course it's necessary. It's a little bit like our obsession right now with the Ethics Committee report on Matt Gaetz.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: How is it that this is what we're focusing on?",
      "Matt Gaetz is, by any standard, completely unqualified to be the attorney general, and yet we're sort of focused on this cherry on the cupcake of the Ethics report.",
      "It sort of reminds me of Al Capone. In 1931, Al Capone is convicted of a couple of counts of tax evasion. Now, he was a killer and a rum runner and a mafioso, and yet he was convicted of tax evasion. This is what the conversation we're having about Matt Gaetz.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: You know, well, what about this Ethics report?",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: And so, no, these people are manifestly unqualified, and they're not prepared to run the very complicated organizations they have been asked to run.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have any suggestion from your Republican colleagues in the Senate that either of those two individuals will not be confirmed for those positions?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Look, all I would observe is that history is a harsh judge.",
      "And I understand what happens to Republicans who stand up to Donald Trump. Talk to Adam Kinzinger or Liz Cheney or many of the Republicans who voted for his impeachment who are now gone. I understand that.",
      "But history is a harsh \u2013 a hard judge. And a Republican senator who takes a vote to consent to the appointment of Matt Gaetz, a chaos agent, a performative social media, no respect for the rule of law, individual, the Republican senator who votes to confirm Matt Gaetz or Robert Kennedy or Tulsi Gabbard\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: \u2026 will be remembered by history as somebody who completely gave up their responsibility to Donald Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "Well, the speaker of the House called him one of the greatest minds in the United States or anywhere on another program this morning.",
      "On intelligence, though, because of your committee oversight, John Ratcliffe, another former House member who went on to serve in an acting role at intelligence previously, he is the selection to run the CIA. Do you trust him to appropriately handle sensitive intelligence information?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: I do, Margaret.",
      "And just to be balanced here, since I was pretty strong in my opinions about the attorney general and the DNI nomination, I actually had a really good day when Marco Rubio was nominated for secretary of state, when John Ratcliffe was nominated for CIA, and when Mike Waltz was nominated to be national security adviser.",
      "I would even add the nominee for the Southern District of New York, Jay Clayton. Those were good nominations, not necessarily the nominations I would have made if I were president, but these are serious people with real experience. They're not social media personalities. They haven't built their careers on lies and conspiracy.",
      "So, look, some of these nominations, I think, are quite solid, and John Ratcliffe falls in that category for me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "Last night, president-elect Trump was at a UFC rally, and alongside him was someone who has had a lot of scrutiny, Elon Musk. He is a billionaire with extensive U.S. government contracts, as I understand it, holds a security clearance himself. He has extensive business ties with China.",
      "He also had with him the Saudi Arabia private investment fund governor. They invest with his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and they have held golf tournaments through the \u2013 one of their entities at Trump golf courses.",
      "Do you think that, in this new Congress, there will be scrutiny of potential financial conflicts of interest around Mr. Trump?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, of course there will be, right? This is sort of not subject to debate.",
      "We saw Trump's first term and the fact that that group of people weren't particularly concerned with financial conflicts of interest. And, look, all \u2013 I don't know Elon Musk, odd character. You sort of have to respect what he's done to disrupt space launch, to disrupt the auto industry and whatnot, but early reviews are not good.",
      "I read his 12-point government waste manifesto, and he said, look at all this money we're paying on interest on the debt. That's part of the wasteful spending.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Guess what? You have got to pay interest on the debt. And so I'm skeptical that he has any clue.",
      "Look, I live in Fairfield County, Connecticut. I know lots of wealthy people here, and there is a syndrome where very wealthy people who got wealthy in finance or as a tech entrepreneur decide that they're heart surgeons and capable of running the United States.",
      "I think that's what's going on with Elon Musk. But, again, early returns are not good with respect to his ability to understand the federal bureaucracy and make it more efficient, which is a laudable goal. But I'm going to reserve judgment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And no offense to the Fairfield County residents who voted for you, I'm sure.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On Saturday, President Biden was meeting with Xi Jinping. And they met for a little less than two hours.",
      "The White House says they did discuss that pervasive hacking of U.S. telecom companies that allowed them to steal customer call record data, compromise private communications of those involved in government, and copy information related to law enforcement actions.",
      "Do you know and can you say if the hackers have actually been kicked out of U.S. infrastructure, or is China still embedded?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Yes, Margaret, that's not a question I can answer with an awful lot of specificity, but the fact that we obviously know about these hacks means that those particular hacks probably have been addressed in one way or another.",
      "But one thing I can say with great confidence, having worked in the intelligence world for some time now, is that I promise you they are out there in ways that we don't know about. So, my hope is that the president made it very clear that this kind of behavior is not tolerable and that he backs that up and, quite frankly, that Donald Trump, the next president, backs that up with action, as Teddy Roosevelt said, the big stick, right?",
      "We're pretty good at hacking networks too. And I think it's really important for the Chinese to understand that we're not just going to name and shame the hackers and complain about it, but we \u2013 but that we are going to go into their networks and give as good as we got. I suspect that, in this realm, they need to see that we are capable of inflicting a lot of damage if they continue their present behavior.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Noted.",
      "There will be some selections, as we understand it, in the coming days in the financial space. You also sit on the Financial Services Committee. Trump backer Elon Musk yesterday blasted one of the hedge fund CEOs, Scott Bessent, a cryptocurrency skeptic who's being considered for that role.",
      "Howard Lutnick, the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, apparently also being considered for that role, he is a cryptocurrency fan. Does either candidate stand out to you for a better pick? And what does it really project out to you about what's going to happen in this space for Mr. Trump?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, it's obviously up to the president to decide who he'd like as Treasury secretary.",
      "I would note that his first Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, I certainly had disagree with \u2013 disagreements with him on any number of topics, including de-sanctioning the Russian aluminum company. But in the cast of characters in version 1.0 of the Trump administration, Steve Mnuchin was far from the creepiest and crawliest of them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: So we will see what he does on Treasury.",
      "What I will say is that, look, crypto\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: \u2026 it's a little bit like the Gaetz Ethics report.",
      "Crypto has yet to make an impact on most Americans' lives.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: And so I would just argue \u2013 and, by the way, I'm open to crypto. I helped work on the legislation to regulate it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: But this is not the determinative factor in our financial lives right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know. It's a technical issue I asked you to get to fairly quickly there, Congressman. I appreciate you weighing in. And thank you for your time.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, who joins us from Lexington.",
      "Good morning to you, Governor.",
      "You're a blue governor in a very red state. How do you even begin to try uniting a country as united \u2013 as divided as this? Are there lessons we can learn from Kentucky?",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR (D-Kentucky): I think there's absolute lessons that we can learn from Kentucky,a state where last year I won as a Democrat by five points and Donald Trump just won by 30.",
      "And I think it basically boils down to both running and governing where people wake up in the morning and what they worry about when they go to bed at night. And that's not the next election. It's their job and whether they make enough to support their family.",
      "It's the next doctor's appointment for themselves, their parents or their kids. It's the roads and bridges they drive every day. It's that public school they drop their kids off at, and it's public safety in their community.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: The goal here is to focus on all of those things where, if people don't feel secure in those areas, they don't get to anything else. They don't get to the crazy thing that some politicians said last night or this morning. They don't get to that next piece of policy that's out there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: So it's a \u2013 it's about a relentless focus on people's everyday needs and their everyday life.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "We're going to take a break, come back, and have the rest of the conversation on the other side of it. All of you, please stay with us.",
      "More from Andy Beshear in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We return to our conversation with Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear.",
      "Governor, Kentucky has a lot of coal. It's got natural gas. Mr. Trump has selected Chris Wright, the CEO of Liberty Energy, to be the next Energy secretary if confirmed. He's also selected Doug Burgum, the governor of North Dakota, to run the Interior Department, and he's promised to open up more federal lands to drilling.",
      "Do you have any idea what the impact would be on your state from the signals being sent with these selections?",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: Well, we'll see. I mean, I saw the comments recently from the CEO of Exxon, which was a little different than what we might expect, talking about needing to move to greener forms of energy regardless of what the policy of the day is. And I certainly see from companies that are coming into Kentucky each and every day. We just announced a new industrial battery facility that's going to create 1,600 new jobs. They demand a certain portfolio of energy. Yes, the lights have to come on. But especially over time for their customers, they want a certain amount of renewables.",
      "So, what I've seen as governor is a private sector push that I do not think is going to change demands placed on states, demands placed on utilities, and the private sector ultimately moving us to a more diverse and cleaner portfolio.",
      "So here in Kentucky, yes, we have many traditional forms of energy, and they have really good jobs. And we want to make sure that we never look down on, and we support each of those jobs. But my goal is to diversify our production as much as we can so that we have the jobs of the present and those jobs of the future.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've said Kentucky has something like 10,000 jobs related to electric vehicles. You really made a big push on that that.",
      "During the campaign, Mr. Trump vowed to undo the electric vehicle mandate, that's what he called it, and he's going to, he says, repeal the law that includes credits for green projects.",
      "Do you know at this point if Republican leaders intend to keep parts of that? And are there projections on what repealing that law entirely would do to the job creation in your state?",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: Well, it's really concerning. You look at a state like Kentucky, that voted for President-elect Trump by 30 points. And it's 10,000 EV-related jobs on the line. And those are only growing.",
      "Go up to Ohio and look at that - I think $20 billion chips factory, which I'm a little bit jealous of, but happy for the people of Ohio, and what that would mean. Another state that voted for the president-elect.",
      "So, you look at all of these jobs, and jobs of the future, that have come to what the administration will probably view as red states. It's important that these projects continue.",
      "Remember, a lot of the people taking these jobs, jobs that support their families, voted for President-elect Trump because they thought that would improve their job, that he was focused on their job. So, I hope that he will get good advice, and I'll do everything I can to get my message out through our federal delegation of how important these jobs are.",
      "And they're not in urban Kentucky. They're in rural Kentucky. They are game-changing investments that have created a bright future here. And I'm certainly going to do everything I can as governor of Kentucky to protect them. And not because I'm a Democrat -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: But because I've shown my people that every single day I'm going to try to create a better life for them. And that's what those jobs do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, $14 billion between now and 2030 was what was promised to your state.",
      "I wonder if you just think Democrats didn't do a good job of explaining that.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: Well, I certainly don't want to do any finger pointing because the vice president had 107 days, and she did her very best. And I proudly crisscrossed the country in support of her.",
      "But what I know is going forward, over the next couple years, we have a chance every day, every moment to show the American people that we are laser focused on jobs, on their health care, on their infrastructure -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: On their kids' education. Just - just those everyday worries. And with this administration at least right now selecting some very extreme appointees -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: It's a chance to make a real difference, to really show people that - that we are where their basic needs are.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, but there was, as you know, some analysis after the fact among Democrats about the focus on some culture war issues or - so to speak.",
      "Congressman Seth Moulton said of transgender issues, \"I have two little girls. I don't want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete. But as a Democrat, I'm supposed to be afraid to say that.\" He says he's speaking authentically and said Democrats should do more of it.",
      "Do you think Democrats have been out of touch on some of these things that obviously resonate in states like yours?",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: Well, I think that all candidates should stand up for their beliefs, and that we don't have to abandon those beliefs. You know, I vetoed one of the nastiest anti-LGBTQ bills that my state had ever seen in my election year.",
      "But I did two things. Number one, I talked about my wife (ph). For me that's my faith, where I'm taught that all children are children of God. And I wanted to stick up for some children that were being picked on in a pretty rough bill.",
      "But the second thing is the voters in my state knew the very next day I was going to be working on jobs, I was going to be opening a new health clinic, first hospital in our largest African American neighborhood in 150 years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: We just cut the ribbon on. And we've created two pediatric autism centers in Appalachia so that people don't have to drive two hours. So, it's both sharing your why and your authentic why for - for your views.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: But the other piece is about that focus.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: Because, remember, if we're talking about this issue of the day -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: And then we're talking about what Donald Trump said last night -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: And then we're talking about jobs, we're only spending a third of the time talking about what people are worried about and what impacts their life the most.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "Governor, thank you for joining us today.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by Sue Gordon. She served as the principal deputy director of national intelligence during Donald Trump's first term in the White House.",
      "Good to see you here again.",
      "SUE GORDON (Former Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence): Great to see you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you personally briefed Donald Trump as president in the Oval Office. If this nominee-to-be, Tulsi Gabbard, becomes the Director of National Intelligence, and John Ratcliffe becomes the CIA director, are you confident that Mr. Trump will be told the information he needs to know and not just what he wants to know?",
      "SUE GORDON: Well, I think that's the - I think that's the question of the day. Intelligence is weird because it's always uncertain. And you are always making an assessment so that a decisionmaker can figure out what they're going to do with it. And so, it's particular. And you - your only job is to ruthlessly report what you see, not what you prefer. So that's the primary job of the DNI is to go in there and to be his principal adviser on intelligence. You're the first in. You're the last out.",
      "You cannot afford to I'll say pander to preference. Loyalty doesn't serve you well in that job. You have to be so committed that you will say inconvenient things. I will say the former president would tell you that I would talk to him about Russian interference. I know he hated it. But Russia was, in fact, interfering, and he needed to hear that information.",
      "So, do I believe that Tulsi and John can be that person if they believe they must be? They can learn. If they lean on the women and men of the intelligence community, they will produce an assessment. But that's a hard day, and you better be good at it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You had to undergo an FBI background check -",
      "SUE GORDON: I did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: To obtain a security clearance and to maintain it. You were a career official, 25 years at the CIA. Then, as we said, moved on to national intelligence.",
      "\"The New York Times\" is reporting the Trump team may bypass the FBI process and just use a private firm to vet candidate. Then when the president is sworn in, he can grant access to the nation's secrets, rather than go through that screening.",
      "What risk is there in bypassing the FBI?",
      "SUE GORDON: Well, the first risk is that you will get an incomplete picture of the human that is carrying both the trust of the American people and the trust of our allies and partners and the trust of the women and men that are putting their lives on the line for that judgment, right? Everyone hates vetting. It's intrusive. It - you - you don't know why anyone should have to do it because you know who you are.",
      "But the truth is, we know adversaries and competitors will exploit humans to be able to advance their interests, and you want to make sure that the people that hold the American people's trust and the most precious pieces of information we have of advantage have no cracks in who they are. And so it seems expedient, but I think it will ultimately harm the institution. And by that I mean the institutions of America, if you have people who we discover later that they should not have had access or we discover later that they were vulnerable to the actions of our allies and of our adversaries and competitors.",
      "And -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it's leverage on them?",
      "SUE GORDON: It is. I mean that's - I mean, the craft of human intelligence is actually finding someone who has a weakness and getting them to be able to advance your interests. And it just - and what a really good day is when you find someone whose interests align with yours, and then you really push that.",
      "So, a private firm isn't going to have the standards that we've had. I know it's inconvenient, but I think it's a bad strategy and risky for America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, CBS has also learned that to date the Trump team hasn't signed the paperwork that would start the process of the national security briefings so that someone's not walking in cold. They're briefed and up to speed. Along with these background checks. The Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan group that helps with the transitions, confirmed that to CBS.",
      "Is there any good reason not to sign those papers? And what does it do for the officials who arrive without being read in on what's happening now?",
      "SUE GORDON: Yes, I can't think of a - I can't think of a good reason. I think one of the great falsehoods that's been perpetrated on America is that our institutions are maleficent. They need to be better. They need to be slimmer. They need to be more transparent, but they're not bums, so you're not protecting anybody by not signing those papers.",
      "And especially some of the nominees we have that don't have the really deep experience base, these are big jobs. I mean intelligence is not just advising the president, it's also running a huge enterprise in a manner that allows our allies and partners to trust us with their most precious thing. So, I can't think of a reason why that's not signed. And to start your gig without any foundation at all, especially when the institutions are begging to give you that foundation, just seems wrong-headed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're diplomatically referring to Tulsi Gabbard there, who doesn't have a background in intelligence.",
      "SUE GORDON: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: She also has a history of statements of saying things that mirror the rhetoric of U.S. adversaries.",
      "SUE GORDON: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Vladimir Putin and Bashar al Assad. There were at least two chemical weapons attacks in Syria that killed thousands of people, and the U.S. intelligence community came to public assessments of high confidence.",
      "SUE GORDON: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I imagine you saw all of that intelligence and you briefed on it.",
      "SUE GORDON: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, when she comes out and says that she doubts it, she's skeptical, how's that going to be received by the career professionals who work for her?",
      "SUE GORDON: Yes, I mentioned one of her jobs would be to be the senior adviser. The second is to be responsible for all intelligence-sharing agreements. So, our allies and partners, upon whom we rely that Syia assessment, that was joint with our allies and partners. The one we had on Skripal was joint. Our assessment of Ukraine was joint.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That was - sorry, just to explain for our viewers, Skripal, you are talking about the killing on British soil of a former Russian by Russian intelligence.",
      "SUE GORDON: Yes. Right. Right. Yes, I'm sorry.",
      "But all those were jointly done with our allies and partners. We need them. It's one of the greatest strengths of America. But they will make their own assessment over whether we can be trusted with their nation's interests. And whether she meant it or not, whether she was just ill informed with that, she comes in with strikes against her in the trust perspective. Can we trust her with our most sacred intelligence to represent that in a fair way?",
      "So, I think it's a problem, whether it's judgment or any other thing that she has represented there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Another nerve in the intelligence community, of course, is Edward Snowden.",
      "SUE GORDON: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Tulsi Gabbard and the selection for the attorney general, Matt Gaetz, put forward resolutions to call for the charges to be dropped against him because he leaked classified national intelligence material. He's living in Russia these days. That kind of a position, how's that going to be received?",
      "SUE GORDON: It reflects a lack of understanding of who we are, and it reflects a lack of respect for what we do. Unauthorized disclosures of intelligence are always bad. Don't go with the good or bad any - good outcome or whether he was right or wrong. He had no authority, and he had different paths and he harmed America. He not only harmed intelligence, he harmed our allies and partners and he harmed our businesses by what it allowed China to assume about that.",
      "There is nothing justifiable about what he's done. None. And so if they vacate it, what they're basically saying is, all those rules you follow in order to be able to serve America, they don't matter anymore.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sue Gordon, thank you for explaining this very opaque world of intelligence to us and for your analysis today.",
      "We'll be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Dr. Deborah Birx served as the White House coronavirus response coordinator in Donald Trump's first term. She also had a long career in public health in the Army, working on Aids in Africa at the State Department, as well as time at the CDC.",
      "Good morning. Welcome back.",
      "DR. DEBORAH BIRX (Former White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator): Good morning, Margaret. Glad to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Dr. Birx, I want to ask you about your views on public health, which we're looking at because of this nomination potentially of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "HHS has wide portfolio here, vaccines, medicine, overseas, Medicare, regulates food, beauty products, baby formula, reproductive health care. What would the impact be of having someone without government experience in that top job?",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: Well, I think the most important thing is what team he would bring with him because you're talking about really a large cap corporation with a highly diverse group. What you have to really bring together - and frankly eliminate some of the duplications between these agencies to really become more cost effective. And so really having a management person at his side, a chief of staff perhaps, that has really come out of industry, that would know how to bring and look and bring those individuals together that are running the other agencies, because it's a very comp - HHS is probably one of our most complicated departments.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you're saying people with experience around him, we need to look at those lower level appointees Mr. Trump might make.",
      "What's so interesting with RFK Jr. is how he has, in some ways, tapped into this health movement in America. He's talking about more regulation, not less when it comes to American food.",
      "Here's some of what he's said.",
      "(BEGIN VC)",
      "ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR., HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY NOMINEE: I'm just going to tell the cereal companies, take all the dyes out of their food. I'll get processed food out of school lunch immediately.",
      "Ten percent of food stamps go to sugar drinks, to, you know, sodas. We're creating diabetes problems in our kids by giving them food that's poison. And I'm going to stop that.",
      "(END VC)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Those sound like good goals. Can he actually take on big agriculture and get that through?",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: I think because of a lot of the people who are suffering the most from these additives are actually people in our rural areas. You know, 16 percent of the Americans live in a rural area, but they are providing all of our oil and gas, all of our fiber, all of our cotton, and all of our food. And the level of diabetes in these communities because of their access to certain foods is extraordinarily high.",
      "I just came out of the field, 58 percent of the adults in the town that I was just in had already diabetes or prediabetes based on household survey where we went house to house. This is the reality of America.",
      "And so what I'm hoping is he brings his transparency for all Americans, and we really start to tackle these issues one by one by one. I think everybody across America wants to have healthy kids that they know will grow up, and not end up with the complications of diabetes or heart disease.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It was very hard for Michelle Obama, when she was first lady, to get any of that done. And it might be hard for lawmakers who come from some of those agricultural states to vote against their own interests in terms of the farm subsidies and the like.",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: Well, we're not talking about eliminating good food. We're talking about using all of their ingredients in a way that is more healthy for Americans. And I think that's what people are calling for now.",
      "Europe did it years ago. And I think we are capable of doing that. We are really smart, high levels of technology. We can make food tasty without a lot of these additives because we can see that other groups are doing it in a small way. So, we're not talking about eliminating the need for wheats and grains, we're talking about putting those together in a healthy way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you as well about some of his - the things he said about vaccines. As you know, the vaccine - vaccination rates are declining in America. He said things like restoring transparency around them. It's not really clear what that means. Why do you think there's a decline of vaccination?",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: I think there's two pieces to it. I think when we talk about things in public health, we don't acknowledge the concerns because when my children went to school, there was maybe one in 1,000 kids with autism, diagnosed autisms. Now it's three per 100. So, every mom is seeing a classroom of kindergarteners where one of the children has autism. That's scary to moms and dads. They want to know why. So, it's not good enough for us to just say, vaccines don't cause autism, it's us finding what is the cause of autism and reverse it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I think a lot of people would absolutely agree that it is ridiculous that there isn't a lot of research and established causation with autism.",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: Yes. Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But what he has said in the past is that autism is caused by vaccines. And there's no scientific basis for that conclusion, as I understand it.",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: That's correct. And so that's why, when he talks about transparency, I'm actually excited that in a Senate hearing he would bring forward his data and the questions that come from the senators would bring forth their data.",
      "What I know for sure is, he's a very smart man who can bring his data and his evidence base forward, and we can have a discussion that many Americans believe already is a problem. So, until we can have that transparency and that open discussion from both sides, I know the members have incredible staffers who will bring great questions from their constituents, and that hearing would be a way for Americans to really see the data that you're talking about, that we can't see that causation right now. But what is causing it? And so you're absolutely right, addressing what the cause is will be critical.",
      "And I think what has confused people is we weren't clear about what Covid vaccines do and don't. And so now people are questioning, well, what do my child vaccines do and don't. And they don't understand that some of the vaccines that their children are getting protect them from both disease and create herd immunity, and some of them that they get are just for their child. Like H flu (ph) and pneumo vax (ph) to protect their child from getting very serious illness. And we're just not explaining all of this correctly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and that's why the messenger matters so much on this.",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: Yes, it does.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Which is why his past statements are being scrutinized.",
      "You worked on Aids for a good part of your career. He has said that he doesn't take a position on the relationship between HIV and Aids, but then he laid out alternative theories in his book and said, \"Dr. Fauci never produced a study to demonstrate his hypothesis using accepted scientific proof.\"",
      "Do you agree with that assertion on HIV and Aids?",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: Well, having spent a career in understanding how HIV and Aids progresses, HIV virus is the cause of Aids.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Period.",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: There's a whole set of things that happen, and I think what HIV taught me is you have to - it's asymptomatic for ten years. And we're finally recognizing how important asymptomatic disease progression and disease transmission is. That's what HIV taught us.",
      "But what other HIV taught us was the entire human immune system.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: So, by investing in HIV research, we learned about CAR T- cells that we use today in cancer.",
      "So, a lot of these research and investments pay off in other areas. And I think once he's there at HHS, he'll see that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. If he's open to the data.",
      "Dr. Birx, thank you.",
      "We'll be right back.",

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Rep. French Hill, Republican of Arkansas, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Nov. 17, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we are joined now by Republican Congressman French Hill. He joins us from his district in Little Rock. Good morning to you, Congressman.",
      "REP. FRENCH HILL: Good morning, Margaret. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Glad to have you here. You served with Congressman Gaetz. You heard the Speaker who has said, while he doesn't want to specifically wade in to the ethics matter, he also thinks it would set a bad precedent to release a report on a former member. Do you think the Ethics Committee should make that decision for itself?",
      "REP. HILL: Well, I think the Ethics Committee does make that decision for itself, but I think Speaker Johnson makes a important point, which is, Mr. Gaetz has resigned from Congress. There are many investigations that the House Ethics Committee has done, and we don't want to set a precedent where we, under any circumstances, will release documents from that committee, but that decision is theirs. Speaker Johnson has made his views known, and now it will be up to the Senate to conduct their advise and consent confirmation process.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, CBS News reported back in June that four women informed that committee they were paid to go to sex and drug fueled parties with Mr. Gaetz. Also the Ethics Committee has Venmo transactions showing Gaetz's payments for the women, since taxpayers paid money for this report to be conducted and it was done, do you think if you were a Senate you would consider this material information to confirming the top lawmaker for the United States of America- law enforcement officer, I should say?",
      "REP. HILL: I don't, I don't have, I don't, I don't personally know any details about the ethics investigation or the allegations, because I haven't, don't serve on that committee. But your point is, would the Senate Judiciary Committee asked to see that report, and that may well be a decision that they take, and the ethics committee has a decision that they have to make, and Mike Johnson's expressed his view on on that as well. So as I say, this is an important process that the Senate has to do, advise and consent for all the nominations, and President Trump has the prerogative to nominate the people that he thinks can best lead the change that he believes the American people are seeking in each of the agencies of the federal government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have spoken to us before here on \"Face The Nation\" about your work around Syria and Bashar Al Assad's oppressive regime there. You actually visited northern Syria, an area that he wasn't in control of, back in 2017. The first lawmaker since John McCain to do so. Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, when she was in office, went to Syria and met with Mr. Assad himself, then publicly, she came out and questioned U.S. intelligence assessments of his chemical weapons attacks that were carried out on civilian areas, not just once, multiple times. These were high confidence assessments by the intelligence community. Would you feel comfortable with her at the helm of all 18 of them?",
      "REP. HILL: Well, I served on the House Intelligence Committee during this past Congress, and I know the important job that the DNI performs in coordinating, collecting and reporting on our intelligence. And I think should Tulsi Gabbard be confirmed, she would know with high confidence as to precisely how we collect intelligence, how we coordinate and collaborate on it, and how we then report it to the President of the United States and to the two intelligence committees. So again, this is an important assessment for the Senate to make, but I remind you Margaret, Donald Trump won the election. He wants people that he has a good relationship with, that he trusts, that he believes can do a good job in the agencies to send the message that we want change in Washington. And the Senate, too, has their important job, and we're going to have to wait and see how the Senate handles each of these confirmations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So it was John McCain who went in 2017, you went in 2023 I may have misspoken there on the year, but so, you believe the US intelligence community conclusions, though? You don't mean to question those?",
      "REP. HILL: No, I don't.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.",
      "REP. HILL: I'm simply saying, as a member of the committee, I don't question that public assessment that's been made in the public domain over many, many years, and I've led the charge against the Assad regime. I do not support that the Arab League put him back into diplomatic standing by admitting him to the Arab League. And I think America has a lot to do to limit Assad's influence in the region, which is a partner with the Russians and the Iranians. And that's not in the interest of the United States, Iraq, Israel or peace in the region.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have also been a supporter of Ukraine, and you've been trying to find some creative ways to help allow them to gain access to continued U.S. support. There was a tremendous attack just overnight there by Russia. The Biden administration wants to provide a $20 billion loan backed up by frozen Russian assets. Will the Congress give them permission to use that money for military assistance?",
      "REP. HILL: Well, the REPO Act that was included in the national security package I worked on very closely with Chairman Mike McCaul of the foreign affairs committee gives the United States the authority to not only take frozen assets, but confiscate them and use them for the benefit of Ukraine. The loan you're referring to has been negotiated between the Europeans and the Americans to back the Ukrainian government. I believe that will go through in my judgment. But I would urge President Trump, as he takes office, to actually follow the law and confiscate those Russian assets, as I believe that gives both Ukraine, the United States and Europe a much stronger negotiating position with Russia. And I don't believe Biden, nor the G7 countries, have been tough enough on Russian on sanctions, on the delivery of weapons that were needed to have ended this war long ago.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're gesturing to what we know, which is that this is a pretty dangerous world right now. One of the selections that the President-elect has made to run the Pentagon at this time is Pete Hegseth. He would be the defense secretary, 44 years old, decorated Army vet, TV commentator. Do you think experience is necessary, or is on the job training OK at the Pentagon?",
      "REP. HILL: Well, again, I think this will be assessed by the Senate in their confirmation process. He has a distinguished background in the military, and that counts for a lot, and I think his plans, his thoughts, his leadership, will be exposed when he goes through that Senate confirmation process. But once again, I have to say, President Trump, when he came into office in 2017 had cabinet members that he really had no personal relationship with, had no working background with. He wants to correct that this time by finding people that he has a good working relationship with. He knows how they think. They know how he thinks, because he thinks it will lead to better decision making in his administration. He's got that prerogative to nominate those men and women and the Senate will have their advice and consent function well underway, and majority leader-to-be John Thune has said look, he'll be effective. He'll be speedy. He'll take it done, get it done in the right course of action.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, thank you for your time today.",
      "REP. HILL: You bet. Thank you, Margaret."

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Rep. Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Nov. 17, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we turn now to Democratic Congressman Jim Himes. He is the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, and he joins us this morning from Stamford, Connecticut. Good morning to you.",
      "REP. JIM HIMES: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I feel like there is so much news, and I'm getting through a fraction of it frankly here. I want to- I want to pick up on Tulsi Gabbard, which we just- who we just discussed in the previous segment, she was a democratic colleague of yours for many, many years. You're the ranking member on the Intelligence Committee. She never served on that kind of committee. Do you think experience is necessary? Is she fit for the job?",
      "REP. HIMES: Margaret, how far we have come that on a major news show the question we're examining is, is experience necessary for one of the most powerful positions in the land? Of course, it's necessary. You know, it's a little bit like our obsession right now with the ethics committee report on Matt Gaetz. You know- I mean, how is it that this is what we're focusing on? Matt Gaetz is, by any standard, completely unqualified to be the Attorney General, and yet we're sort of focused on this, you know, cherry on the cupcake of the ethics report. You know, it sort of reminds me of Al Capone in 1931. Al Capone is convicted of a couple of counts of tax evasion. Now he was a killer and a rum runner and a mafioso, and yet he was convicted of tax evasion. This is what the conversation we're having about Matt Gaetz. You know, well, what about this ethics report? So, these people are manifestly unqualified, and, you know, they're not prepared to run the very complicated organizations they've been asked to run.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have any suggestion from your Republican colleagues in the Senate that either of those two individuals will not be confirmed for those positions?",
      "REP. HIMES: Look, all I would observe is that, you know, history is- is a harsh judge and- and I understand what happens to Republicans who stand up to Donald Trump. You know, talk to Adam Kinzinger or Liz Cheney, or, you know, many of the Republicans who voted for his impeachment who are now gone. I understand that. But history is a hard- hard judge and a Republican senator who takes a vote to consent to the appointment of Matt Gaetz, a chaos agent, a performative social media, no respect for the rule of law, individual. The Republican senator who votes to confirm Matt Gaetz or Robert Kennedy or Tulsi Gabbard, will be remembered by history as somebody who completely gave up their responsibility to Donald Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Speaker of the House called him one of the greatest minds in the United States or anywhere on another program this morning. On intelligence, though, because of your committee oversight, John Ratcliffe, another former House member who went on to serve in an acting role at intelligence previously, he is the selection to run the CIA. Do you trust him to appropriately handle sensitive intelligence information?",
      "REP. HIMES: I do Margaret and just to be balanced here, since I was pretty strong in my opinions about the Attorney General and the DNI nomination, I actually had a really good day when Marco Rubio was nominated for Secretary of State, when John Ratcliffe was nominated for CIA and when Mike Waltz was nominated to be national security advisor. I would even add the nominee for the Southern District of New York, Jay Clayton. Those are good nominations, not necessarily the nominations I would have made if I were president. But these are serious people with real experience. They're not social media personalities. They haven't built their careers on lies and conspiracy. So look, some of these nominations I think are quite solid, and John Ratcliffe falls in that category for me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Last night, President elect Trump was at a UFC rally, and alongside him was someone who has had a lot of scrutiny, Elon Musk. He is a billionaire with extensive US government contracts, as I understand it, holds a security clearance himself. He has extensive business ties with China. Also had with him the Saudi Arabia private investment fund governor. They invest with his son in law, Jared Kushner, and they've held golf tournaments through the- one of their entities at Trump golf courses. Do you think that in this new Congress, there will be scrutiny of potential financial conflicts of interest around Mr. Trump?",
      "REP. HIMES: Well, of course there will be, right? I mean, this is, this is sort of not subject to debate. We saw Trump's first term, and the fact that that, you know, group of people weren't particularly concerned with financial conflicts of interest. And look, all- I don't know, Elon Musk, odd character, you know, you sort of have to respect what he's done to disrupt, you know, space launch, to disrupt, you know, the auto industry and whatnot. But, you know, early reviews are not good. I read his, you know, 12 point government waste manifesto, you know. And he said, look at all this money we're paying on interest on the debt. That's, you know, that's part of the wasteful spending. Guess what? You got to pay interest on the debt. And so, you know, I'm skeptical that he has any clue. Look, I- I live in Fairfield County, Connecticut. I know lots of wealthy people here, and there is a syndrome where very wealthy people who got wealthy in finance or as a tech entrepreneur decide that their heart surgeons and capable of running the United States. I think that's what's going on with Elon Musk. But, you know, again, early returns are not good with respect to his ability to understand the federal bureaucracy and make it more efficient, which is a laudable goal, but I'm going to reserve judgment",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And no offense to the Fairfield County residents who voted for you. I'm sure. On Saturday, President Biden was meeting with Xi Jinping, and they met for a little less than two hours. The White House says they did discuss that pervasive hacking of U.S. telecom companies that allowed them to steal customer call record data, compromise private communications of those involved in government and copy information related to law enforcement actions. Do you know and can you say if the hackers have actually been kicked out of U.S. infrastructure, or is China still embedded?",
      "REP. HIMES: Yeah, Margaret, that's not a question I can answer with an awful lot of specificity, but the fact that we obviously know about these- these hacks means that those particular hacks probably have been addressed in one way or another. But one thing I can say with great confidence, having worked in the intelligence world for some time now, is that, I promise you, they are out there in ways that we don't know about. So my hope is that the President made it very clear that this kind of behavior is not tolerable, and that he backs that up, and quite frankly, that Donald Trump, the next president, backs that up with action. You know, as Teddy Roosevelt said, the big stick, right? We're pretty good at hacking networks too, and I think it's really important for the Chinese to understand that we're not just going to name and shame the hackers and complain about it. But that we- that we are going to go into their networks and give as good as we got. I suspect that in this realm, they need to see that we are capable of inflicting a lot of damage if they continue their present behavior.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Noted. There will be some selections as we understand it, in the coming days in the financial space. You also sit on the Financial Services Committee. Trump backer, Elon Musk, yesterday blasted one of the hedge fund CEO Scott Bessent, a crypto currency skeptic, who is being considered for that role. Howard Lutnick, the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, apparently also being considered for that role. He is a crypto currency fan. Does either candidate stand out to you for a better pick? And what does it really project out to you about what's going to happen in this space for Mr. Trump?",
      "REP. HIMES: Well, you know, it's obviously up to the president to decide who he'd like as Treasury Secretary. You know, I would note that his first Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin- I certainly had disagreements with him on any number of topics, including desanctioning the Russian aluminum company. But you know, in the cast of characters in version 1.0 of the Trump administration, Steve Mnuchin was far from the creepiest and crawliest of them. So we'll see what he does on Treasury. What I will say is that, look crypto, you know, it's a little bit like the Gaetz ethics report. Crypto has yet to make an impact on most Americans' lives, and so I would just argue- and by the way, I'm open to crypto. I helped work on the legislation to regulate it, but this is not the determinative factor in our financial lives right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know it's a technical issue. I asked you to get to fairly quickly there, Congressman. I appreciate you weighing in and thank you for your time. \"Face the Nation\" will be back in a minute."

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Nov. 17, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by Kentucky governor Andy Beshear who joins us from Lexington. Good morning to you, governor. You're a blue governor in a very red state. How do you even begin to try uniting a country as united- as divided as this? Are there lessons we can learn from Kentucky?",
      "GOV. ANDY BESHEAR: I think there's absolute lessons that- that we can learn from Kentucky, a state where, last year, I won as a Democrat by five points and Donald Trump just won by 30. And I think it basically boils down to both running and governing, where people wake up in the morning and what they worry about when they go to bed at night. And that's not the next election. It's their job, and whether they make enough to support their family. It's the next doctor's appointment for themselves, their parents, or their kids. It's the roads and bridges they drive every day. It's that public school they drop their kids off at, and it's public safety in their community. The goal here is to focus on all of those things, where, if people don't feel secure in those areas, they don't get to anything else. They don't get to the crazy thing that some politicians said last night or this morning, they don't get to that next piece of policy that's out there. So it's a- it's about a relentless focus on people's everyday needs and their everyday life.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. We're going to take a break, come back and have the rest of the conversation on the other side of it. All of you, please stay with us. More from Andy Beshear in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Welcome back to \"Face The Nation.\" We return to our conversation with Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear. Governor, Kentucky has a lot of coal. It's got natural gas. Mr. Trump has selected Chris Wright, the CEO of Liberty Energy, to be the next Energy Secretary, if confirmed. He's also selected Doug Burgum, the governor of North Dakota, to run the Interior Department, and he's promised to open up more federal lands to drilling. Do you have any idea what the impact would be on your state from the signals being sent with these selections?",
      "GOV. ANDY BESHEAR: Well, we'll see. I mean, I saw the comments recently from the CEO of Exxon, which was a little different than what we might expect, talking about needing to move to greener forms of- of energy, regardless of what the policy of the day is. And I certainly see from companies that are coming into Kentucky each and every day, we just announced a new industrial battery facility that's going to create 1600 new jobs. They demand a certain portfolio of energy. Yes, the lights have to come on, but especially over time for their customers, they want a certain amount of renewables. So what I've seen as governor is a private sector push that I do not think is going to change demands placed on states, demands placed on utilities, and the private sector ultimately moving us to a more diverse and cleaner portfolio. So here in Kentucky, yes, we have many traditional forms of energy, and they have really good jobs, and we want to make sure that we never look down on and- and we support each of those jobs. But my goal is to diversify our production as much as we can so that we have the jobs of the present and those jobs of the future.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You said Kentucky has something like 10,000 jobs related to electric vehicles. You really made a big push on that during the campaign. Mr. Trump vowed to undo the \"electric vehicle mandate,\" that's what he called it, and he's going to, he says, repeal the law that includes credits for green projects. Do you know at this point if Republican leaders intend to keep parts of that? And are there projections on what repealing that law entirely would do to the job creation in your state?",
      "GOV. ANDY BESHEAR: Well, it's really concerning. You look at a state like Kentucky that voted for President-Elect Trump by 30 points, and it's 10,000 EV related jobs on the line, and those are only growing. Go up to Ohio and look at that $20 billion chips factory, which I'm a little bit jealous of, but happy for the people of Ohio and- and what that would mean in another state that voted for the president-elect. So you look at all of these jobs and jobs of the future that have come to what- what the administration will probably view as red states. It's important that these projects continue. Remember, a lot of the people taking these jobs, jobs that support their families, voted for President-Elect Trump because they thought that would improve their job, that he was focused on their job. So I hope that he will get good advice, and I'll do everything I can to get my message out through our federal delegation of how important these jobs are. And they're not in urban Kentucky. They're in rural Kentucky. They are game changing investments that- that have created a bright future here, and I'm certainly going to do everything I can as governor of Kentucky to protect them, and not because I'm a Democrat, but because I've shown my people that every single day I'm going to try to create a better life for them, and that's what those jobs do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, 14 billion between now and 2030 was what was promised to your state. I wonder if you just think Democrats didn't do a good job of explaining that?",
      "GOV. ANDY BESHEAR: Well, I certainly don't want to do any finger pointing, because the- the Vice President had 107 days, and she did her very best, and I proudly crisscrossed the country in support of her. But what I know is, going forward, over the next couple years, we have a chance every day, every moment, to show the American people that we are laser focused on jobs, on their health care, on their infrastructure, on their kids' education, just- just those everyday worries, and with this administration, at least right now selecting some very extreme appointees, it's a chance to make a real difference, to really show people that- that we're where their basic needs are.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, but there was, as you know, some analysis after the fact among Democrats about the focus on some culture war issues, or so to speak. Congressman Seth Moulton said, of transgender issues, \"I have two little girls. I don't want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete. But as a Democrat, I'm supposed to be afraid to say that.\" He says he's \"speaking authentically,\" and said Democrats should do more of it. Do you think Democrats have been out of touch on some of these things that obviously resonate in states like yours?",
      "GOV. ANDY BESHEAR: Well, I think that- that all candidates should stand up for- for their beliefs and that- and that we don't have to abandon those beliefs. You know, I vetoed one of the nastiest anti-LGBTQ bills that my state had ever seen in my election year, but- but I did two things. Number one, I talked about my why, for me, that's my faith, where I'm taught that all children are children of God. And I wanted to stick up for some children that were being picked on in a pretty rough bill. But the second thing is, the- the voters in my state knew the very next day, I was going to be working on jobs. I was going to be opening a new health clinic, first hospital in our largest African American neighborhood in 150 years, we just cut the ribbon on. We've created two pediatric autism centers in- in Appalachia, so that people don't have to drive two hours. So it's- it's both sharing your why and your authentic why for- for your views, but- but the other piece is about that focus. Because remember, if we're talking about this issue of the day, and then we're talking about what Donald Trump said last night, and then we're talking about jobs. We're only spending a third of the time talking about what people are worried about and what impacts their life the most.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, thank you for joining us today. We'll be right back."

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Sue Gordon, principal deputy director of National Intelligence in the first Trump administration, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Nov. 17, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by Sue Gordon. She served as the Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence during Donald Trump's first term in the White House. Good to see you here again.",
      "SUE GORDON: Great to see you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you personally briefed Donald Trump as President in the Oval Office. If this nominee to be Tulsi Gabbard becomes the Director of National Intelligence, and John Ratcliffe becomes the CIA director, are you confident that Mr. Trump will be told the information he needs to know, and not just what he wants to know?",
      "SUE GORDON: Well, I think that's the- I think that's the question of the day. Intelligence is weird",
      "because it's always uncertain, and you are always making an assessment so that a decision-maker can figure out what they're going to do with it. And so it's particular. And you- your only job is to ruthlessly report what you see, not what you prefer. So that's the primary job of the DNI, is to go in there and to be his principal advisor on intelligence. You're the first in, you're the last out. You cannot afford to, I'll say pander to preference. Loyalty doesn't serve you well in that job. You have to be so committed that you will say inconvenient things. I will say the former president would tell you that I would talk to him about Russian interference. I know he hated it, but Russia was in fact interfering, and he needed to hear that information. So do I believe that Tulsi and John can be that person? If they believe they must be, they can learn. If they lean on the women and men of the intelligence community, they will produce an assessment. But that's a hard day, and you better be good at it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You had to undergo an FBI background check to obtain a security clearance and to maintain it. You were a career official, 25 years at the CIA, then, as we said, moved on to national intelligence. The New York Times is reporting the Trump team may bypass the FBI process and just use a private firm to vet candidates. Then, when the president is sworn in, he can grant access to the nation's secrets rather than go through that screening. What risk is there in bypassing the FBI?",
      "SUE GORDON: Well, the first risk is that you will get an incomplete picture of the human that is carrying both the trust of the American people and the trust of our allies and partners and the trust of the women and men that are putting their lives on the line for that judgment, right? Everyone hates vetting. It's intrusive. It- you don't know why anyone should have to do it, because you know who you are. But the truth is, we know adversaries and competitors will exploit humans to be able to advance their interests, and you want to make sure that the people that hold the American people's trust and the most precious pieces of information we have of advantage, have no cracks in who they are. And so it seems expedient, but I think it will ultimately harm the institution. And by that I mean the institution of America, if you have people who we discover later that they should not have had access, or we discover later that they were vulnerable to the actions of our allies and of our adversaries and competitors\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Because of leverage on them--",
      "SUE GORDON: -- It is, I mean, that's, I mean, the craft of human intelligence is actually finding someone who has a weakness and getting them to be able to advance your interests, and it just- and what a really good day is when you find someone whose interests align with yours, and then you really push that. So a private firm isn't going to have the standards that we've had. I know it's inconvenient, but I think it's a bad strategy and risky for America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So CBS has also learned that, to date, the Trump team hasn't signed the paperwork that would start the process of the national security briefings, so that someone's not walking in cold they're briefed and up to speed, along with these background checks. The Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan group that helps with the transitions, confirmed that to CBS. Is there any good reason not to sign those papers, and what does it do for the officials who arrive without being read in on what's happening now?",
      "SUE GORDON: Yeah, I can't think of a- I can't think of a good reason. I think one of the great falsehoods that's been perpetrated on America is that our institutions are malfeasant. They need to be better, they need to be slimmer, they need to be more transparent, but they're not bummed. So you're not protecting anybody by not signing those papers, and especially with some of the nominees we have that don't have the really deep experience base, these are big jobs. I mean, intelligence is not just advising the president, it's also running a huge enterprise in a manner that allows our allies and partners to trust us with their most precious thing. So I can't think of a reason why that's not signed- signed, and to start your gig without any foundation at all, especially when the institutions are begging to give you that foundation just seems wrong-headed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're diplomatically referring to Tulsi Gabbard there, who doesn't have a background in intelligence. She also has a history of statements, of saying things that mirror the rhetoric of us adversaries, Vladimir Putin and Bashar al-Assad. There were at least two chemical weapons attacks in Syria that killed thousands of people, and the US intelligence community came to public assessments of high confidence. I imagine you saw all of that intelligence and you briefed on it.",
      "SUE GORDON: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So when she comes out and says that she doubts it. She's skeptical. How is that going to be received by the career professionals who work for her?",
      "SUE GORDON: Yeah I mentioned one of her jobs would be to be the senior advisor. The second is to be responsible for all intelligence sharing agreements so our allies and partners upon whom we rely, that Syria assessment, that was joint with our allies and partners. The one we had on Skripal was joint. Our assessment of Ukraine was joint\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013That was sorry, just to explain for our viewers, Skripal, you're talking about the killing on British soil of a former Russian by Russian intelligence.",
      "SUE GORDON: But all those were jointly done with our allies and partners. We need them. It's one of the greatest strengths of America, but they will make their own assessment over whether we can be trusted with their nation's interests, and whether she meant it or not, whether she was just ill-informed of that, she comes in with strikes against her in the trust perspective, can we trust her with our most sacred intelligence to represent that in a fair way. So I think it's a problem, whether it's judgment or any other thing that she has represented there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Another nerve in the intelligence community, of course, is Edward Snowden. Tulsi Gabbard, and the selection for the attorney general, Matt Gaetz, put forward resolutions to call for the charges to be dropped against him because he leaked classified national intelligence material. He's living in Russia these days. That kind of a position, how's that going to be received?",
      "SUE GORDON: It reflects a lack of understanding of who we are, and it reflects a lack of respect for what we do. Unauthorized disclosures of intelligence are always bad. Don't go with the good or bad, any good outcome or whether he was right or wrong. He had no authority, and he had different paths, and he harmed America. He not only harmed intelligence, he harmed our allies and partners, and he harmed our businesses by what it allowed China to assume about that. there is nothing justifiable about what he's done. None. And so if they vacate it, what they're basically saying is all those rules you follow in order to be able to serve America, they don't matter anymore.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sue Gordon, thank you for explaining this very opaque world of intelligence to us and for your analysis today. We'll be back in a moment."

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Dr. Deborah Birx, White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator in the first Trump administration, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Nov. 17, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Dr. Deborah Birx served as the White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator in Donald Trump's first term. She also had a long career in public health in the army, working on AIDS in Africa, at the State Department, as well as time at the CDC. Good morning. Welcome back.",
      "FORMER WHITE HOUSE COVID RESPONSE COORDINATOR DR. DEBORAH BIRX: Good morning, Margaret. Glad to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So Dr. Birx, I want to ask you about your views on public health, which we're looking at because of this nomination, potentially of Robert F Kennedy Jr. HHS has a wide portfolio here, vaccines, medicine, oversees Medicare, regulates food, beauty products, baby formula, reproductive health care. What would the impact be of having someone without government experience in that top job?",
      "DR. BIRX: Well, I think the most important thing is what team he would bring with him, because you're talking about really a large cap corporation with a highly diverse group, which you have to really bring together and, frankly, eliminate some of the duplication set between these agencies to really become more cost effective, and so really having a management person at his side, a chief of staff, perhaps that has really come out of industry that would know how to bring and look and bring those individuals together that are running the other agencies, because it's a very comp- HHS is probably one of our most complicated departments.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're saying people with experience around him, we need to look at those lower level appointees Mr. Trump might make. Well, what's so interesting with RFK Jr. is how he has, in some ways, tapped into this health movement in America. He's talking about more regulation, not less when it comes to American food, here's some of what he said:",
      "ROBERT F KENNEDY JR.: I'm just going to tell the- the cereal companies to take all the dyes out of their food. I'll get processed food out of school lunch immediately. 10 percent of food stamps go to sugar drinks to, you know, sodas. We're creating diabetes problem, and our kids are giving them food that's poison, and I'm going to stop that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Those sound like good goals. Can you actually take on big agriculture and get that through?",
      "DR. BIRX: I think because a lot of the people who are suffering the most from these additives are actually people in our rural areas. 16 percent of the Americans live in a rural area, but they are providing all of our oil and gas, all of our fiber, all of our cotton and all of our food. And the level of diabetes in these communities because of their access to certain foods is extraordinarily high. I just came out of the field, 58 percent of the adults in the town that I was just in had already diabetes or prediabetes, based on a household survey where we went house to house. This is the reality of America and so what I'm hoping is he brings his transparency for all Americans and we really start to tackle these issues one-by-one-by-one. I think everybody across America wants to have healthy kids that they know will grow up and not end up with the complications of diabetes or heart disease.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It was very hard for Michelle Obama, when she was first lady to get any of that done, and it might be hard for lawmakers who come from some of those agricultural states to vote against their own interests in terms of the farm subsidies and the like.",
      "DR. BIRX: Well, we're not talking about eliminating good food. We're talking about using all of their ingredients in a way that is more healthy for Americans and I think that's what people are calling for now. Europe did it years ago, and I think we're capable of doing that. We are really smart, high levels of technology, we can make food tasty without a lot of these additives, because we can see that other groups are doing it in a small way. So we're not talking about eliminating the need for wheats and grains. We're talking about putting those together in a healthy way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you as well about some of his- the things he said about vaccines. As you know, the vaccine- vaccination rates are declining in America. He said things like restoring transparency around them. It's not really clear what that means. Why do you think there's a decline in vaccination?",
      "DR. BIRX: I think there's two pieces to it. I think when we talk about things in public health, we don't acknowledge the concerns because when my children went to school, there was maybe one in 1000 kids with autism, diagnosed with autism. Now it's three per 100. So every mom is seeing a classroom of kindergarteners where one of the children has autism. That's scary to moms and dads, they want to know why. So it's not good enough for us to just say vaccines don't cause autism. It's us finding what is the cause of autism and reverse it\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I think a lot of people would absolutely agree that it is ridiculous that there isn't a lot of research and established causation for autism, but what he has said in the past is that autism is caused by vaccines and there's no scientific basis for that conclusion as I understand it.",
      "DR. BIRX: That's correct. And so that's why, when he talks about transparency, I'm actually excited that in a Senate hearing he would bring forward his data and the questions that come from the senators would bring forth their data. What I know for sure is he's a very smart man who can bring his data and his evidence base forward, and we can have a discussion that many Americans believe already is a problem. So until we can have that transparency and that open discussion from both sides, I know the members have incredible staffers who will bring great questions from their constituents, and that hearing would be a way for Americans to really see the data that you're talking about, that we can't see that causation right now, but what is causing it? And so you're absolutely right, addressing what the cause is will be critical and I think what has confused people is we weren't clear about what COVID vaccines do and don't. And so now people are questioning, well, what do my childhood vaccines do and don't, and they don't understand that some of the vaccines that their children are getting protect them from both disease and create herd immunity, and some of them that they get are just for their child, like H Flu and pneumovax to protect their child from getting very serious illness, and we're just not explaining all of this correctly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and that's why the messenger matters\u2013",
      "DR. BIRX: Yes, it does.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013so much on this, which is why his past statements are being scrutinized. You worked on AIDS for a good part of your career. He has said that he doesn't take a position on the relationship between HIV and AIDS, but then he laid out alternative theories in his book, and said Dr. Fauci never produced a study to demonstrate his hypothesis using \"accepted scientific proof.\" Do you agree with that assertion, and HIV and AIDS?",
      "DR. BIRX: Well, having spent a career in understanding how HIV and AIDS progresses, HIV virus is the cause of AIDS, there's a whole set of things that happen, and I think what HIV taught me is you have to- it's asymptomatic for 10 years, and we're finally recognizing how important asymptomatic disease progression and disease transmission is. That's what HIV taught us. But what other HIV taught us was the entire human immune system. So by investing in HIV research, we learned about CAR T-cells that we use today in cancer. So a lot of these research and investments pay off in other areas and I think once he's there at HHS, he'll see that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: If he's open to the data. Dr. Birx, thank you. We'll be right back."

    "published": "Sun, 17 Nov 2024 10:23:42 -0500",
    "summary": "The Wall Street Journal columnist talks about her new book, \"A Certain Idea of America,\" and why she believes Ronald Reagan would not recognize the Republican Party of Donald Trump.",
    "story": [
      "These days, you'll find Peggy Noonan in many places: in front of commencement crowds, at political round tables, and for the past quarter-century, in the opinion section of the Wall Street Journal. But when she was just starting out in Washington, D.C., you could find Noonan at the Off the Record Bar, near her job at the White House. \"I would sit over there by myself, I would order a beer or a glass of wine, and I'd just quietly sit and read,\" she said.",
      "In 1984, Noonan joined President Ronald Reagan's staff, after working at CBS in New York. At first, she felt like an outsider in the buttoned-up West Wing, but soon became an acclaimed speechwriter. Early on, she wrote Reagan's moving speech for D-Day's 40th anniversary.",
      "Then, when the Challenger shuttle tragically exploded, Noonan was given a tough assignment: write Reagan's address to a distraught nation. \"I had a feeling of, that didn't work, nothing worked, because nothing was worthy of that moment; nothing was worthy of that day,\" she said. \"But then Frank Sinatra called \u2013 he called that night to the White House to say, 'Mr. President, you just said what needed to be said.' And Frank didn't call after every speech!\"",
      "By the late eighties, Noonan had cemented a reputation as a wordsmith, and Reagan turned to her for his farewell address:",
      "\"We made the city stronger, we made the city freer. All in all, not bad, not bad at all.\"",
      "George H.W. Bush turned to Noonan, too, as he rallied Republicans on his way to the White House. \"You know, part of life is luck,\" she said. \"It was not lucky to follow dazzling Ronald Reagan and be plainer, seeming sturdy George H.W. Bush. But I believe history was not \u2013 certainly in his time \u2013 sufficiently fair to him.\"",
      "That opinion is one of many found in the pages of her new book, \"A Certain Idea of America,\" a collection of her recent work (to be published Tuesday by Portfolio).",
      "Asked what her idea of America is today, Noonan replied, \"Big, raucous, troubled, frayed.\"",
      "Noonan's columns often delve into questions of character and leadership. \"What I do not perceive now is many politicians who are actually saying, Guys, this is not good for the country. We've been given this beautiful thing called America. Shine it up! Keep it going!\"",
      "Costa said, \"You have a lot of fun in this book, doing what you call taking the stick to certain people from time to time.\"",
      "\"I don't mind the stick at all,\" said Noonan. \"When I see something that I think is just awful, I love to get mad at it. I got mad at John Fetterman.\"",
      "\"You don't like that he's wearing shorts?\"",
      "\"It's okay with me that he wears shorts,\" she replied, \"but he is not allowed to change the rules of the U.S. Senate to accommodate him in his little shorts and hoodie because he enjoys dressing like a child.\"",
      "Noonan, now 74, grew up in the Democratic strongholds of New York and New Jersey. \"And I was very happy with that, because Democrats were cooler than Republicans,\" she said. \"Democrats were little Bobby Kennedy, and Republicans were, like, Dick Thornburgh!\"",
      "But in Reagan, she saw something fresh. \"You looked at him, you saw his confidence, and it made you feel optimistic,\" she said.",
      "The Gipper, of course, no longer dominates the Republican Party, and President-elect Trump's victory could transform the GOP even more in the coming years. \"In terms of policy, the Republican Party has changed by becoming, not a standard, usual conservative party, but a populist party,\" Noonan said. \"Its issues have changed very much. But also, the edge of anger and resentment and, I'm afraid, a little paranoia that is in the Republican Party now would be something that Reagan did not recognize.\"",
      "At the Off the Record Bar, the faces on the wall \u2013 caricatures of politicians of the past \u2013 and at the tables still catch her eye. For Noonan, it's all part of the story \u2013 America's, and her own.",
      "Costa said, \"In a way, you're still the writer in the corner watching everybody at the bar in Washington.\"",
      "\"Yeah, I like to watch them, she said. \"They're human, and you bring a little warmth to it, a little humor, and always bring your stick and smack them when you need to! It's kind of nice.\"",

Mr. Biden was expected to urge Xi to dissuade North Korea from further deepening its support for Russia's war on Ukraine.",

      "Wright also has criticized what he calls a \"top-down\" approach to climate by liberal and left-wing groups and said the climate movement around the world is \"collapsing under its own weight.\"",
      "Consideration of Wright to head the administration's energy department won support from influential conservatives, including oil and gas tycoon Harold Hamm.",
      "Hamm, executive chairman of Oklahoma-based Continental Resources, a major shale oil company, is a longtime Trump supporter and adviser who played a key role on energy issues in Trump's first term.",
      "Hamm helped organize an event at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in April where Trump reportedly asked industry leaders and lobbyists to donate $1 billion to Trump's campaign, with the expectation that Trump would curtail environmental regulations if re-elected.",
      "The Energy Department is responsible for advancing energy, environmental and nuclear security of the United States. The agency is in charge of maintaining the country's nuclear weapons, oversees 17 national research laboratories and approves natural gas exports, as well as ensuring environmental cleanup of the nation's nuclear weapons complex.

      "Republican Sen. John Barrasso, who is expected to become chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said Trump promised bold choices for his Cabinet, and Wright's nomination delivers.",

      "Leavitt, 27, currently a spokesperson for Trump's transition, would be the youngest White House press secretary in history. Previously that distinction went to Ronald Ziegler, who was 29 when he took the position in 1969 in Richard Nixon's administration.",
      "\"Karoline Leavitt did a phenomenal job as the National Press Secretary on my Historic Campaign, and I am pleased to announce she will serve as White House Press Secretary,\" Trump said in a statement. \"Karoline is smart, tough, and has proven to be a highly effective communicator. I have the utmost confidence she will excel at the podium, and help deliver our message to the American People as we Make America Great Again.\"",
      "Leavitt replied in a post on X, formerly Twitter: \"Thank you, President Trump, for believing in me. I am humbled and honored. Let's MAGA,\" the acronym for \"Make America Great Again.\"",
      "The White House press secretary typically serves as the public face of the administration\u00a0and historically has held daily briefings for the press corps.",
      "Trump disrupted those norms in his first term, preferring to serve as his own chief spokesperson. While he was president from 2017 to 2021, Trump had four press secretaries but frequently preferred to engage directly with the public, from his rallies, social media posts and his own briefings.",
      "At a news conference this past August, Trump was asked if he'd have regular press briefings in his new administration. He told reporters, \"I will give you total access and you'll have a lot of press briefings and you'll have, uh, from me.\"",
      "When it came to a press secretary, he said: \"Probably they'll do something. If it's not daily, it's going to be a lot. You'll have more than you want.\"",
      "Leavitt, a New Hampshire native, is seen as a staunch and camera-ready advocate for Trump who is quick on her feet and delivers aggressive defenses of the Republican in television interviews.",
      "She worked as a spokesperson for MAGA Inc., a super PAC supporting Trump, before joining his 2024 campaign. In 2022, she ran for Congress in New Hampshire, winning a 10-way Republican primary\u00a0before losing to incumbent Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas.",
      "During Trump's first term in office, Leavitt worked in the White House press office. She then became communications director for New York Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik, whom Trump has tapped to serve as his U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.",
      "Trump's first press secretaries, Sean Spicer and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, were known for quarreling with reporters. Another, Stephanie Grisham, never held a briefing.

      "Ryan Walters, a Republican,\u00a0announced\u00a0the new office on Wednesday and on Thursday sent the email to school superintendents statewide.

      "\"In particular, I pray for President Donald Trump and his team as they continue to bring about change to the country,\" Walters said.",

      "Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party's\u00a0prodigious fundraising\u00a0operation raised more than $1 billion in her loss to Donald Trump, but the vice president is still pushing donors for more money after the election.",
      "Democrats are sending persistent appeals to Harris supporters without expressly asking them to cover any potential debts, enticing would-be donors instead with other matters: the Republican president-elect's\u00a0picks for his upcoming administration\u00a0and a handful of pending congressional contests where ballots are still being tallied.",
      "\"The Harris campaign certainly spent more than they raised and is now busy trying to fundraise,\" said Adrian Hemond, a Democratic strategist from Michigan. He said he had been asked by the campaign after its loss to Trump to help with fundraising.",
      "The party is flooding Harris' lucrative email donor list with near-daily appeals aimed at small-dollar donors \u2014 those whose contributions are measured in the hundreds of dollars or less. But Hemond said the postelection effort also includes individual calls to larger donors.",
      "One person familiar with the effort and the Democratic National Committee's finances said the Harris campaign's expected shortfall is a relatively small sum compared to the breadth of the campaign, which reported having $119 million cash on hand in mid-October before the Nov. 5 election. That person was not authorized to publicly discuss the campaign's finances and spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "But the scramble now underscores the expense involved in a losing effort and the immediate challenges facing Democrats as they try to maintain a baseline political operation to counter the Trump administration and prepare for the 2026 midterm elections. It also calls into question how Democrats used their resources, including hosting events with musicians and other celebrities as well as running ads in a variety of nontraditional spaces such as Las Vegas' domed Sphere.",
      "Patrick Stauffer, chief financial officer for the Harris campaign, said in a statement that \"there were no outstanding debts or bills overdue\" on Election Day and there \"will be no debt\" listed for either the campaign or the DNC on their next financial disclosures, which are due to the Federal Election Commission in December.",
      "The person familiar with the campaign and DNC's finances said it was impossible to know just where Harris' balance sheet stands currently. The campaign still is getting invoices from vendors for events and other services from near the end of the race. The campaign also has outstanding receipts; for example, from media organizations that must pay for their employees' spots on Air Force Two as it traveled for the vice president's campaign activities.",
      "Within hours of Trump picking\u00a0Florida Republican Matt Gaetz\u00a0for attorney general on Wednesday, Harris' supporters got an appeal for more money for \"the Harris Fight Fund,\" citing the emerging Trump team and its agenda.",
      "Gaetz, who resigned his House seat after the announcement, \"will weaponize the Justice Department to protect themselves,\" the email said. It said Democrats \"must stop them from executing Trump's plans for revenge and retribution\" and noted that \"even\u00a0his Republican allies\u00a0are shocked by this\" Cabinet choice.",
      "Another appeal followed Friday in Harris' name.",
      "\"The light of America's promise will burn bright as long as we keep fighting,\" the email said, adding that \"there are still a number of critical races across the country that are either too close to call or with the margin of recounts or certain legal challenges.\"",
      "The emails do not mention Harris' campaign or its finances.",
      "The \"Harris Fight Fund\" is a postelection label for the \"Harris Victory Fund,\" which is the joint fundraising operation of Harris' campaign, the DNC and state Democratic parties. Despite the language in the recent appeals, most rank-and-file donors' contributions would be routed to the national party, unless a donor took the time to contact DNC directly and have the money go directly to Harris or a state party.",
      "The fine print at the bottom of the solicitation explains that the first $41,300 from a person and first $15,000 from a political action committee would be allocated to the DNC. The next $3,300 from a person or $5,000 from a PAC would go to the Harris for President \"Recount Account.\" Anything beyond that threshold, up to maximum contribution limits that can reach into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, would be spread across state parties.",

      "The U.S. received written assurance from Iran before the presidential election that its leadership was not actively trying to assassinate President-elect Donald Trump, CBS News confirmed, according to a source with direct knowledge of the correspondence. The message arrived after the White House in September affirmed that killing a former U.S. president or former U.S. official would be seen by the Biden administration as an act of war.",
      "\"We consider this a national and homeland security matter of the highest priority, and we strongly condemn Iran for these brazen threats,\" National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett said in a statement in September.",
      "Iran said in its message, which was conveyed by a third party, that it understood this premise. The Wall Street Journal first reported Iran's message to the U.S.",
      "The Justice Department is currently prosecuting at least two individuals alleged to have been part of murder-for-hire plots to kill Trump while he was still a candidate. One operative working for Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps told federal investigators that he was tasked in September with \"surveilling, and, ultimately, assassinating\" Trump, according to court records unsealed last week.",
      "Prosecutors said Farhad Shakeri, who is believed to be residing in Iran, told investigators in a phone interview that unnamed IRGC officials pushed him to plan an attack against Trump to take place in October. If the plan could not come together in time, the Iranian officials directed Shakeri to delay the plot until after the election because the official \"assessed that [Trump] would lose the election,\" the charging documents said.",
      "In early August, a Pakistani national with alleged ties to Iran was arrested and charged with plotting a murder-for-hire scheme targeting U.S. government officials and politicians, according to charging documents unsealed Tuesday.",

      "In response to inquiries suggesting that \"Iran told U.S. it wouldn't try to kill Trump\", the Permanent Mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran said it would not comment on official messages between two countries.",
      "The mission said in a statement, \"The Islamic Republic of Iran has long declared its commitment to pursuing Martyr Soleimani's assassination through legal and judicial avenues, while adhering fully to the recognized principles of international law.\"",
      "Trump has raised the ire of Iranians for a few reasons. He exited the international Iran nuclear agreement, which had lifted some sanctions in exchange for restrictions on Iran's nuclear program. He also directed the 2020 airstrike that killed top Iranian commander Gen. Qasem Soleimani. Since then, some Trump administration officials and military officials received threats from the regime, among them, Robert O'Brien, who was national security adviser during the strike. His predecessor in the job, John Bolton, who was part of the maximum pressure campaign that exerted sanctions pressure on Tehran, has also received threats.",
      "In 2022, the U.S. intelligence community assessed that Iran would threaten Americans \u2014 both directly and via proxy attacks \u2014 and was committed to developing networks inside the U.S. Two persistent threat assessments submitted to Congress by the State Department in January 2022 cited a \"serious and credible threat\" to the lives of former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former Trump administration Iran envoy Brian Hook. The non-public assessments showed that throughout 2021 and again in 2022, the State Department determined that round-the-clock, U.S.-taxpayer-funded diplomatic security details were needed to protect both men. That continues today.",

They were found to have made extremist statements in posts or text messages or had ties with right-wing militia groups. In an interview with podcaster Shawn Ryan, Hegseth said he was one of the National Guard members removed from securing the inauguration.",

      "\"Deus Vult\" is the Christian motto that refers to divine providence. It originated as the rallying cry of the Crusaders. But experts in domestic violent extremism say the latin phrase has also been co-opted by some members of the far right in recent years.",
      "For example, Mauricio Martinez Garcia, the gunman behind the 2023 mass shooting in Allen, Texas, had a \"Deus Vult\" tattoo, according to the Anti-Defamation League, in addition to neo-Nazi tattoos. The group also says the phrase is \"commonly used as an anti-Muslim symbol.\"",

    "summary": "Scientists say they've discovered a \"mega coral\" three times bigger than the previous record holder - so huge they initially thought it was a shipwreck.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists say they have found the world's largest coral near the Pacific's Solomon Islands, announcing Thursday a major discovery \"pulsing with life and color.\" The coral is so immense that researchers sailing the crystal waters of the Solomon archipelago initially thought they'd stumbled across a hulking shipwreck.",
      "\"Just when we think there is nothing left to discover on planet Earth, we find a massive coral made of nearly one billion little polyps, pulsing with life and color,\" marine ecologist Enric Sala said.",
      "The standalone structure, formed from a \"complex network\" of tiny coral polyps, has likely been growing for 300 years or more, the researchers said.",
      "At about 111 feet wide and 104 feet long, the team said the \"mega coral\" was three times bigger than the previous record holder \u2014 a coral dubbed \"Big Momma\" in American Samoa. The massive coral is not a coral reef, structures that can be far larger but are comprised of many distinct coral colonies, they explained.",
      "\"While Big Momma looked like a huge scoop of ice cream plopped down on the reef, this newly discovered coral is as if the ice cream started to melt, spreading forever along the seafloor,\" said lead scientist Molly Timmers.",
      "It's longer than a blue whale and thought to be \"so colossal\" that it could be seen from space.",
      "The coral was discovered at the southeastern tip of the Solomon Islands, in an area known as the Three Sisters. It was spotted by a National Geographic team embarking on a scientific expedition in the region.",
      "Hotter and more acidic oceans have drained the life from corals in many of the region's tropical waters, a process called bleaching, including Australia's famed Great Barrier Reef. But this latest discovery offered a small glimmer of hope, the research team said.",
      "\"While the nearby shallow reefs were degraded due to warmer seas, witnessing this large healthy coral oasis in slightly deeper waters is a beacon of hope,\" said coral scientist Eric Brown.",
      "The lush rainforests and pristine waters of the Solomon Islands have long been celebrated for their ecological diversity. Wildlife observations made in the area in the 1920s helped prove a key part of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution.",
      "\"There is so much to learn about the richness of marine life and the ocean ecosystem, but this finding opens doors of knowledge,\" said top Solomon Islands official Collin Beck. \"More scientific research is needed to better understand our rich biodiversity and our planet.\"",
      "The discovery was announced as representatives from around the world meet in Baku, Azerbaijan for the COP29 United Nations summit on climate change.",
      "The Solomon Islands national climate minister, Trevor Manemahaga, told CBS News' partner network BBC News at the summit that his nation was proud to be the home of the massive, newly discovered coral.",
      "\"We want the world to know, that this is a special place, and it needs to be protected,\" he told the BBC. \"We rely mostly on marine resources for economic survival, so coral is very, very important.\"",
      "Small, low-lying island nations such as the Solomons are among the most vulnerable to the increasing effects of climate change and sea-level rise.",

    "summary": "Seal-shaped boards decked with bright horizontal lights were less likely to be attacked by great white sharks, researchers found.",
    "story": [
      "Covering your surfboard in bright lights sounds like an open invitation to great white sharks, but research released Tuesday by Australian scientists found it might actually stave off attacks.",
      "Biologist Laura Ryan said the predator often attacked its prey from underneath, occasionally mistaking a surfer's silhouette for the outline of a seal.",
      "Ryan and her fellow researchers showed that seal-shaped boards decked with bright horizontal lights were less likely to be attacked by great white sharks.",
      "This appeared to be because the lights distorted the silhouette on the ocean's surface, making it appear less appetizing.",
      "\"There is this longstanding fear of white sharks and part of that fear is that we don't understand them that well,\" said Ryan, from Australia's Macquarie University.",
      "The study, published in the journal Current Biology, was conducted in the waters of South Africa's Mossel Bay, a popular great white feeding ground.",
      "Seal-shaped decoys were strung with different configurations of LED lights and towed behind a boat to see which attracted the most attention.",
      "Brighter lights were better at deterring sharks, the research found, while vertical lights were less effective than horizontal.",
      "Macquarie University Professor Nathan Hart, one of the study's authors, said the lights caused a \"complex interaction\" with the shark's behavior.",
      "\"It's like an invisibility cloak but with the exception that we are splitting the object, the visual silhouette, into smaller bits,\" Hart said.",
      "The study's authors released a video showing some of the research in action.",
      "Ryan said the results were better than expected and is now in the process of building prototypes for use on the underside of kayaks and surfboards.",
      "Australia has some of the world's most comprehensive shark management measures, including monitoring drones, shark nets and a tagging system that alerts authorities when a shark is near a crowded beach.",
      "Ryan said her research could allow less invasive mitigation methods to be used.",
      "More research was needed to see if bull and tiger sharks -- which have different predatory behavior \u2014 responded to the lights in a similar way, the authors said.",
      "There have been more than 1,200 shark incidents in Australia since 1791, of which 255 resulted in death, official data shows.",
      "Great white sharks were responsible for 94 of those deaths.",
      "The overall number of deadly shark attacks worldwide in 2023 remained relatively low, but it was still twice the previous year's total, according to the latest iteration of the\u00a0International Shark Attack File\u00a0\u2014 a database of global shark attacks run by the University of Florida.",

    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 07:02:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Oil and natural gas companies will have to pay a federal fee if they emit methane above certain levels under a rule being finalized by the Biden administration that incoming Trump officials are likely to reverse.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Oil and natural gas companies for the first time will have to pay a federal fee if they emit dangerous methane above certain levels under a rule being made final by the Biden administration.",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency rule follows through on a directive from Congress included in the 2022 climate law. The new fee is intended to encourage industry to adopt best practices that reduce emissions of methane - the primary component of natural gas - and thereby avoid paying.",
      "Methane is a climate \"super pollutant\" that is far more potent in the short term than carbon dioxide and is responsible for about one-third of greenhouse gas emissions. The oil and natural gas sector is the largest industrial source of methane emissions in the United States, and advocates say reduction of methane emissions is a crucial way to slow climate change.",
      "The rule, set to be announced Tuesday at an international climate conference in Azerbaijan, comes hours after President-elect Donald Trump named former New York congressman Lee Zeldin to head the agency in Trump's second term. If confirmed by the Senate, Zeldin is expected to move to reverse or loosen dozens of environmental regulations approved under President Biden as Trump seeks to establish U.S. \"energy dominance\u2033 worldwide.",
      "Trump is likely to target the methane fee amid a flurry of expected actions he has promised to deregulate the oil and gas industry.",
      "As outlined by the EPA, excess methane produced in 2024 could result in a fee of $900 per ton, with fees rising to $1,200 per ton in 2025 and $1,500 per ton by 2026. Industry groups are likely to challenge the rule, including any effort to impose a retroactive fee.",
      "The rule wouldn't become final until early next year, following publication in the Federal Register.",
      "EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement that the rule will work in tandem with a new EPA rule on methane emissions imposed this year. The rule targets the U.S. oil and natural gas industry for its role in global warming as Mr. Biden seeks to secure his legacy on fighting climate change.",
      "The fee, formally known as the Waste Emissions Charge, will encourage early deployment of available technologies to reduce methane emissions and other harmful air pollutants, Regan said. The fee \"is the latest in a series of actions under President Biden's methane strategy to improve efficiency in the oil and gas sector, support American jobs, protect clean air and reinforce U.S. leadership on the global stage,\" he said.",
      "Industry groups and Republican-led states have challenged the earlier methane rule in court, but lost a bid for the Supreme Court to block the rule while the case continues before lower-level judges.",
      "Opponents argue that the EPA overstepped its authority and set unattainable standards with the new regulations. The EPA, though, said the rules are squarely within its legal responsibilities and would protect the public.",
      "Many large oil and gas companies already meet or exceed methane-performance levels set by Congress under the climate law, meaning they are unlikely to be forced to pay the new fee, Regan and other officials said.",
      "Even so, the EPA estimates that the rule will result in cumulative emissions reductions of 1.2 million metric tons of methane (the equivalent of 34 million metric tons of carbon-dioxide) through 2035. That figure is similar to clean-air gains from taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year, the EPA said. Cumulative climate benefits could total as much $2 billion, the agency said.",
      "Like the earlier methane rule, the new fee faces a near-certain legal challenge from industry groups. The American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's largest lobbying group, called a fee proposed earlier this year a \"punitive tax increase\" that \"undermines America's energy advantage.''",
      "The API said it looks forward to working with Congress to repeal the \"misguided new tax on American energy.\"",
      "Environmental groups, for their part, have hailed the impending methane fee, saying oil and gas companies should be held accountable for pollution that contributes to global warming. Oil and gas companies routinely calculate that it's cheaper to waste methane through flaring and other techniques than to make necessary upgrades to prevent leaks, they said.",
      "The EPA said it expects that over time, fewer oil and gas companies will be charged for excess methane as they reduce emissions in compliance with the rule.",

    "summary": "1970s-era U.S. spy satellite imagery has led archeologists to what they believe is the site of a seventh-century battle that was decisive in the spread of Islam in the region.",
    "story": [
      "Beirut \u2014 Declassified 1970s-era U.S. spy satellite imagery has led a British-Iraqi archeological team to what they believe is the site of a seventh-century battle that became decisive in the spread of Islam throughout the region.",
      "The Battle of al-Qadisiyah was fought in Mesopotamia \u2014 in present-day Iraq \u2014 in the A.D. 630s between Arab Muslims and the army of the Sassanid Persian dynasty during a period of Muslim expansion. The Arab army prevailed and continued on its march into Persia, now Iran.",
      "A joint team of archeologists from the U.K.'s Durham University and the University of Al-Qadisiyah stumbled across the site while undertaking a remote sensing survey to map the Darb Zubaydah, a pilgrimage route from Iraq's Kufa to Mecca in Saudi Arabia built more than 1,000 years ago. The findings were published Tuesday in the journal Antiquity.",
      "While mapping the route, the team noticed that a site some 20 miles south of Kufa in Iraq's southern Najaf province \u2014 a desert area with scattered plots of agricultural land \u2014 had features that closely matched the description of the al-Qadisiyah battle site described in historic texts.",
      "William Deadman, a specialist in archaeological remote sensing at Durham University, said the Cold War era satellite images are commonly used tools by archeologists working in the Middle East because the older images often show features that have been destroyed or altered and wouldn't show up on present-day satellite images.",
      "\"The Middle East has developed so much in the last 50 years, both agricultural expansion and urban expansion,\" he said. Some of the distinguishing features at the al-Qadisiyah site, such as a distinctive trench, were \"much more pristine and clear\" in the 1970s images, he said.",
      "A survey on the ground confirmed the findings and convinced the team that they had correctly identified the site.",
      "The key features were a deep trench, two fortresses and an ancient river that was reportedly once forded by elephant-mounted Persian troops, said Jaafar Jotheri, a professor of archeology at the University of Al-Qadisiyah who's part of the team that made the discovery. The survey team also found pottery shards consistent with the time period when the battle took place.",
      "A revealing, well-known battle",
      "Jotheri said Iraqis of his generation, who grew up under the rule of Saddam Hussein, were all familiar with the battle in minute detail, down to the names of the generals on both sides.",
      "The battle at the time had political connotations \u2014 Iraq was engaged in a devastating war with Iran through much of the 1980s. Saddam pointed to the Battle of Qadisiyah as a harbinger of victory for Iraq.",
      "Like most children growing up in that era, Jotheri said he'd watched a popular movie about the battle multiple times as it was on regular rotation on television.",
      "In the post-Saddam era, al-Qadisiyah has become something of a political litmus test. Iraqis' views of the battle vary depending on their feelings toward Iran, which has expanded its influence in the country since the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq that toppled Saddam.",
      "\"There is some political and religious context in this battle because now, of course, we have religious differences, ethnic differences, political differences in Iraq and we read or we view everything based on our \u2026 differences,\" Jotheri said. But he added, \"We all agree that it is a very important battle, a decisive one, and we all know about it.\"",
      "Discovery was part of a regional trend",
      "The team plans to begin excavations at the site in the coming year, Jotheri said.",
      "The discovery comes as part of a broader project launched in 2015 to document endangered archaeological sites in the region.",
      "It also comes at the time of a resurgence of archeology in Iraq, a country often referred to as the \"cradle of civilization,\" but where archeological exploration has been stunted by decades of conflict that halted excavations and led to the looting of tens of thousands of artifacts.",

In 2020, the Chang'e-5 spacecraft returned moon rocks from the near side, the first since those collected by NASA's Apollo astronauts and Soviet Union spacecraft in the 1970s. The Chang'e-4 spacecraft became the first to visit the moon's far side in 2019.",

    "published": "Wed, 13 Nov 2024 12:16:59 -0500",
    "summary": "Amazon rolls out a new shopping service, dubbed Amazon Haul, that sells items for $20 or less.",
    "story": [
      "Amazon on Wednesday debuted a new online shopping service called Amazon Haul that experts said could help the e-commerce giant compete with Chinese retailers Temu and Shein.",
      "Amazon Haul \u2014 whose name is a play on social media \"hauls,\" where people show off their purchases \u2014 focuses on selling items for $20 or less, or what Amazon calls \"crazy low prices.\" In a blog post, Amazon said the new service is available in its shopping app and mobile website.",
      "Temu and Shein have won over\u00a0many Gen Z shoppers and other bargain hunters by offering low-cost clothing, electronics and other items that typically ship directly from manufacturers in China. At the same time, U.S. consumers are still feeling the bite of inflation that hit a 40-year high in the pandemic, with many searching for deals as a result.",
      "\"Amazon Haul is a response to both the rise of low-price Chinese marketplaces and the fact that consumers are increasingly seeking value for money as they try to make their budgets stretch further,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director of market research firm GlobalData.",
      "He added, \"The value retail segment has been a major growth area over the past few years, and while the regular Amazon site has a good value-for-money reputation, its wide offer means that it is not primarily seen as an everyday low-price destination.\"",
      "What is Amazon Haul?",
      "Amazon Haul is an online storefront within the Amazon app that sells low-cost items, aimed especially at consumers who shop at discount retailers such as Temu and Shein.",
      "To find Amazon Haul, go to the Amazon app and search \"Haul\" in the search bar, or go to www.amazon.com/haul\u00a0on your browser.",
      "How much do Amazon Haul items cost?",
      "Amazon said everything on Amazon Haul costs less than $20, but most products are priced at $10 and less.",
      "Items available on Amazon Haul on Wednesday included a three-pack of fuzzy socks for $4.99 and a quilted tote bag for $7.99. The merchandise ranged from clothing to household items such as silicone baking mats and throw pillows.",
      "The company offers discounts on larger orders, such as 5% off orders above $50 and 10% off orders of $75 or more.",
      "What is the delivery time for Amazon Haul items?",
      "Longer than regular Amazon items, with the company noting that the goods are typically delivered within one to two weeks.",
      "What do the experts say?",
      "Amazon Haul could help the retailer appeal to younger shoppers, noted GlobalData's Saunders. But it also raises the risk that the low-cost shopping site could cannibalize sales from Amazon's main site, he added.",
      "Still, Saunders said, \"It is better that Amazon cannibalize its own sales than cede ground to rivals.\"",

      "Change is coming to Washington, along with chaos and the controversy typical of the former president's management style. Seats in Mr. Trump's Cabinet are filling up fast, and, this time, the president-elect is using his political capital to do things his way.",

      "DONALD TRUMP (Former President of the United States (R) and Current U.S. President-Elect): Forty-nine out of 50 states shifted toward the GOP, won the White House, recaptured the Senate, and now, as of today, recaptured the House.",

      "House Speaker Mike Johnson had said he would not interfere, but, following an overnight trip to Mar-a-Lago, he changed course.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON (R-Louisiana): I think we should stick to the tradition and not release a report on a former member of the House, because it would open a dangerous Pandora's box.",
      "CAITLIN HUEY-BURNS: Gaetz was also under investigation by the very Justice Department he was tapped to lead over whether he had violated sex trafficking laws, but no federal charges were filed. Gaetz has denied all of the allegations.",

      "And we are joined now by Republican Congressman French Hill. He joins us from his district in Little Rock.",
      "Good morning to you, Congressman.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL (R-Arkansas): Good morning, Margaret. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Glad to have you here.",
      "You served with Congressman Gaetz. You heard the speaker, who has said, while he doesn't want to specifically wade into the Ethics matter, he also thinks it would set a bad precedent to release a report on a former member.",
      "Do you think the Ethics Committee should make that decision for itself?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Well, I think the Ethics Committee does make that decision for itself. But I think Speaker Johnson makes an important point, which is, Mr. Gaetz has resigned from Congress. There are many investigations that the House Ethics Committee has done, and we don't want to set a precedent where we, under any circumstances, will release documents from that committee.",
      "But that decision is theirs. Speaker Johnson has made his views known, and now it will be up to the Senate to conduct their advise-and-consent confirmation process.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, CBS News reported back in June that four women informed that committee they were paid to go to sex and drug-fueled parties with Mr. Gaetz.",
      "Also, the Ethics Committee has Venmo transactions showing Gaetz's payments for the women. Since taxpayers paid money for this report to be conducted, and it was done, do you think, if you were a Senate, you would consider this material information to confirming the top lawmaker for the United States of America \u2013 law enforcement officer, I should say?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: No.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Like I say, I don't \u2013 I don't have \u2013 I don't personally know any details about the Ethics investigation or the allegations because I haven't \u2013 don't serve on that committee.",
      "But your point is, would the Senate Judiciary Committee ask to see that report? And that may well be a decision that they take. And the Ethics Committee has a decision that they have to make. And Mike Johnson's expressed his view on that as well.",
      "So, as I say, this is an important process that the Senate has to do advise and consent for all the nominations. And President Trump has the prerogative to nominate the people that he thinks can best lead the change that he believes the American people are seeking in each of the agencies of the federal government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have spoken to us before here on Face the Nation about your work around Syria and Bashar al-Assad's oppressive regime there. You actually visited Northern Syrian, an area that he wasn't in control of, back in 2017, the first lawmaker since John McCain to do so.",
      "Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, when she was in office, went to Syria and met with Mr. Assad himself. Then, publicly, she came out and questioned U.S. intelligence assessments of his chemical weapons attacks that were carried out on civilian areas, not just once, multiple times.",
      "These were high-confidence assessments by the intelligence community. Would you feel comfortable with her at the helm of all 18 of them?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Well, I serve on the House Intelligence Committee during this past Congress, and I know the important job that the DNI performs in coordinating, collecting and reporting on our intelligence.",
      "And I think, should Tulsi Gabbard be confirmed, she would know with high confidence as to precisely how we collect intelligence, how we coordinate and collaborate on it, and how we then report it to the president of the United States and to the two Intelligence Committees.",
      "So, again, this is an important assessment for the Senate to make. But I remind you, Margaret, Donald Trump won the election. He wants people that he has a good relationship with, that he trusts, that he believes can do a good job in the agencies to send the message that we want change in Washington.",
      "And the Senate too has their important job. And we're going to have to wait and see how the Senate handles each of these confirmations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, it was John McCain who went in 2017. You went in 2023. I may have misspoken there on the year.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Right. Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But \u2013 so you believe the U.S. intelligence community conclusions, though? You don't mean to question those?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: No, I don't.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: I'm simply saying, as a member of the committee, I don't question that public assessment that's been made in the public domain over many, many years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: And I have led the charge against the Assad regime.",
      "I do not support that the Arab League put him back into diplomatic standing by admitting him to the Arab League. And I think America has a lot to do to limit Assad's influence in the region, which is a partner with the Russians and the Iranians. And that's not in the interest of the United States, Iraq, Israel, or peace in the region.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have also been a supporter of Ukraine. And you have been trying to find some creative ways to help allow them to gain access to continued U.S. support.",
      "There was a tremendous attack just overnight there by Russia. The Biden administration wants to provide a $20 billion loan backed up by frozen Russian assets. Will the Congress give them permission to use that money for military assistance?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Well, the REPO Act that was included in the national security package I worked on very closely with Chairman Mike McCaul of the Foreign Affairs Committee gives the United States the authority to not only take frozen assets, but confiscate them and use them for the benefit of Ukraine.",
      "The loan you're referring to has been negotiated between the Europeans and the Americans to back the Ukrainian government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: I believe that will go through, in my judgment.",
      "But I would urge President Trump, as he takes office, to actually follow the law and confiscate those Russian assets, as I believe that gives both Ukraine, the United States, and Europe a much stronger negotiating position with Russia. And I don't believe Biden, nor the G7 countries have been tough enough on Russian on sanctions, on the delivery of weapons that were needed to have ended this war long ago.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're gesturing to what we know, which is that this is a pretty dangerous world right now.",
      "One of the selections that the president-elect has made to run the Pentagon at this time is Pete Hegseth. He would be the defense secretary, 44 years old, decorated Army vet, TV commentator. Do you think experience is necessary, or is on-the-job training OK at the Pentagon?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Well, again, I think this will be assessed by the Senate in their confirmation process.",
      "He has a distinguished background in the military. And that counts for a lot. And I think his plans, his thoughts, his leadership will be exposed when he goes through that Senate confirmation process.",
      "But, once again, I have to say, President Trump, when he came into office in 2017, had Cabinet members that he really had no personal relationship with, had no working background with. He wants to correct that this time by finding people that he has a good working relationship with, he knows how they think, they know how he thinks, because he thinks it will lead to better decision-making in his administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: He's got that prerogative to nominate those men and women, and the Senate will have their advice-and-consent function well underway.",
      "And Majority-Leader-to-be John Thune has said, look, he will be effective\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: \u2026 he will be speedy, he will take it done \u2013 get it done in the right course of action.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, thank you for your time today.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: You bet. Thank you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we turn now to Democratic Congressman Jim Himes. He is the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, and he joins us this morning from Stamford, Connecticut.",
      "Good morning to you.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES (D-Connecticut): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I feel like there is so much news, and I'm getting through a fraction of it, frankly, here.",
      "I want to pick up on Tulsi Gabbard, which we just \u2013 who we just discussed in the previous segment,. She was a Democratic colleague of yours for many, many years. You're the ranking member on the Intelligence Committee. She never served on that kind of committee. Do you think experience is necessary? Is she fit for the job?",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Margaret, how far we have come that, on a major news show, the question we're examining is, is experience necessary for one of the most powerful positions in the land?",
      "Of course it's necessary. It's a little bit like our obsession right now with the Ethics Committee report on Matt Gaetz.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: How is it that this is what we're focusing on?",
      "Matt Gaetz is, by any standard, completely unqualified to be the attorney general, and yet we're sort of focused on this cherry on the cupcake of the Ethics report.",
      "It sort of reminds me of Al Capone. In 1931, Al Capone is convicted of a couple of counts of tax evasion. Now, he was a killer and a rum runner and a mafioso, and yet he was convicted of tax evasion. This is what the conversation we're having about Matt Gaetz.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: You know, well, what about this Ethics report?",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: And so, no, these people are manifestly unqualified, and they're not prepared to run the very complicated organizations they have been asked to run.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have any suggestion from your Republican colleagues in the Senate that either of those two individuals will not be confirmed for those positions?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Look, all I would observe is that history is a harsh judge.",
      "And I understand what happens to Republicans who stand up to Donald Trump. Talk to Adam Kinzinger or Liz Cheney or many of the Republicans who voted for his impeachment who are now gone. I understand that.",
      "But history is a harsh \u2013 a hard judge. And a Republican senator who takes a vote to consent to the appointment of Matt Gaetz, a chaos agent, a performative social media, no respect for the rule of law, individual, the Republican senator who votes to confirm Matt Gaetz or Robert Kennedy or Tulsi Gabbard\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: \u2026 will be remembered by history as somebody who completely gave up their responsibility to Donald Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "Well, the speaker of the House called him one of the greatest minds in the United States or anywhere on another program this morning.",
      "On intelligence, though, because of your committee oversight, John Ratcliffe, another former House member who went on to serve in an acting role at intelligence previously, he is the selection to run the CIA. Do you trust him to appropriately handle sensitive intelligence information?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: I do, Margaret.",
      "And just to be balanced here, since I was pretty strong in my opinions about the attorney general and the DNI nomination, I actually had a really good day when Marco Rubio was nominated for secretary of state, when John Ratcliffe was nominated for CIA, and when Mike Waltz was nominated to be national security adviser.",
      "I would even add the nominee for the Southern District of New York, Jay Clayton. Those were good nominations, not necessarily the nominations I would have made if I were president, but these are serious people with real experience. They're not social media personalities. They haven't built their careers on lies and conspiracy.",
      "So, look, some of these nominations, I think, are quite solid, and John Ratcliffe falls in that category for me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "Last night, president-elect Trump was at a UFC rally, and alongside him was someone who has had a lot of scrutiny, Elon Musk. He is a billionaire with extensive U.S. government contracts, as I understand it, holds a security clearance himself. He has extensive business ties with China.",
      "He also had with him the Saudi Arabia private investment fund governor. They invest with his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and they have held golf tournaments through the \u2013 one of their entities at Trump golf courses.",
      "Do you think that, in this new Congress, there will be scrutiny of potential financial conflicts of interest around Mr. Trump?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, of course there will be, right? This is sort of not subject to debate.",
      "We saw Trump's first term and the fact that that group of people weren't particularly concerned with financial conflicts of interest. And, look, all \u2013 I don't know Elon Musk, odd character. You sort of have to respect what he's done to disrupt space launch, to disrupt the auto industry and whatnot, but early reviews are not good.",
      "I read his 12-point government waste manifesto, and he said, look at all this money we're paying on interest on the debt. That's part of the wasteful spending.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Guess what? You have got to pay interest on the debt. And so I'm skeptical that he has any clue.",
      "Look, I live in Fairfield County, Connecticut. I know lots of wealthy people here, and there is a syndrome where very wealthy people who got wealthy in finance or as a tech entrepreneur decide that they're heart surgeons and capable of running the United States.",
      "I think that's what's going on with Elon Musk. But, again, early returns are not good with respect to his ability to understand the federal bureaucracy and make it more efficient, which is a laudable goal. But I'm going to reserve judgment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And no offense to the Fairfield County residents who voted for you, I'm sure.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On Saturday, President Biden was meeting with Xi Jinping. And they met for a little less than two hours.",
      "The White House says they did discuss that pervasive hacking of U.S. telecom companies that allowed them to steal customer call record data, compromise private communications of those involved in government, and copy information related to law enforcement actions.",
      "Do you know and can you say if the hackers have actually been kicked out of U.S. infrastructure, or is China still embedded?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Yes, Margaret, that's not a question I can answer with an awful lot of specificity, but the fact that we obviously know about these hacks means that those particular hacks probably have been addressed in one way or another.",
      "But one thing I can say with great confidence, having worked in the intelligence world for some time now, is that I promise you they are out there in ways that we don't know about. So, my hope is that the president made it very clear that this kind of behavior is not tolerable and that he backs that up and, quite frankly, that Donald Trump, the next president, backs that up with action, as Teddy Roosevelt said, the big stick, right?",
      "We're pretty good at hacking networks too. And I think it's really important for the Chinese to understand that we're not just going to name and shame the hackers and complain about it, but we \u2013 but that we are going to go into their networks and give as good as we got. I suspect that, in this realm, they need to see that we are capable of inflicting a lot of damage if they continue their present behavior.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Noted.",
      "There will be some selections, as we understand it, in the coming days in the financial space. You also sit on the Financial Services Committee. Trump backer Elon Musk yesterday blasted one of the hedge fund CEOs, Scott Bessent, a cryptocurrency skeptic who's being considered for that role.",
      "Howard Lutnick, the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, apparently also being considered for that role, he is a cryptocurrency fan. Does either candidate stand out to you for a better pick? And what does it really project out to you about what's going to happen in this space for Mr. Trump?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, it's obviously up to the president to decide who he'd like as Treasury secretary.",
      "I would note that his first Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, I certainly had disagree with \u2013 disagreements with him on any number of topics, including de-sanctioning the Russian aluminum company. But in the cast of characters in version 1.0 of the Trump administration, Steve Mnuchin was far from the creepiest and crawliest of them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: So we will see what he does on Treasury.",
      "What I will say is that, look, crypto\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: \u2026 it's a little bit like the Gaetz Ethics report.",
      "Crypto has yet to make an impact on most Americans' lives.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: And so I would just argue \u2013 and, by the way, I'm open to crypto. I helped work on the legislation to regulate it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: But this is not the determinative factor in our financial lives right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know. It's a technical issue I asked you to get to fairly quickly there, Congressman. I appreciate you weighing in. And thank you for your time.",

      "Good morning to you, Governor.",
      "You're a blue governor in a very red state. How do you even begin to try uniting a country as united \u2013 as divided as this? Are there lessons we can learn from Kentucky?",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR (D-Kentucky): I think there's absolute lessons that we can learn from Kentucky,a state where last year I won as a Democrat by five points and Donald Trump just won by 30.",
      "And I think it basically boils down to both running and governing where people wake up in the morning and what they worry about when they go to bed at night. And that's not the next election. It's their job and whether they make enough to support their family.",

      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: The goal here is to focus on all of those things where, if people don't feel secure in those areas, they don't get to anything else. They don't get to the crazy thing that some politicians said last night or this morning. They don't get to that next piece of policy that's out there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: So it's a \u2013 it's about a relentless focus on people's everyday needs and their everyday life.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "We're going to take a break, come back, and have the rest of the conversation on the other side of it. All of you, please stay with us.",
      "More from Andy Beshear in a moment.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We return to our conversation with Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear.",
      "Governor, Kentucky has a lot of coal. It's got natural gas. Mr. Trump has selected Chris Wright, the CEO of Liberty Energy, to be the next Energy secretary if confirmed. He's also selected Doug Burgum, the governor of North Dakota, to run the Interior Department, and he's promised to open up more federal lands to drilling.",
      "Do you have any idea what the impact would be on your state from the signals being sent with these selections?",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: Well, we'll see. I mean, I saw the comments recently from the CEO of Exxon, which was a little different than what we might expect, talking about needing to move to greener forms of energy regardless of what the policy of the day is. And I certainly see from companies that are coming into Kentucky each and every day. We just announced a new industrial battery facility that's going to create 1,600 new jobs. They demand a certain portfolio of energy. Yes, the lights have to come on. But especially over time for their customers, they want a certain amount of renewables.",
      "So, what I've seen as governor is a private sector push that I do not think is going to change demands placed on states, demands placed on utilities, and the private sector ultimately moving us to a more diverse and cleaner portfolio.",
      "So here in Kentucky, yes, we have many traditional forms of energy, and they have really good jobs. And we want to make sure that we never look down on, and we support each of those jobs. But my goal is to diversify our production as much as we can so that we have the jobs of the present and those jobs of the future.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've said Kentucky has something like 10,000 jobs related to electric vehicles. You really made a big push on that that.",
      "During the campaign, Mr. Trump vowed to undo the electric vehicle mandate, that's what he called it, and he's going to, he says, repeal the law that includes credits for green projects.",
      "Do you know at this point if Republican leaders intend to keep parts of that? And are there projections on what repealing that law entirely would do to the job creation in your state?",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: Well, it's really concerning. You look at a state like Kentucky, that voted for President-elect Trump by 30 points. And it's 10,000 EV-related jobs on the line. And those are only growing.",
      "Go up to Ohio and look at that - I think $20 billion chips factory, which I'm a little bit jealous of, but happy for the people of Ohio, and what that would mean. Another state that voted for the president-elect.",
      "So, you look at all of these jobs, and jobs of the future, that have come to what the administration will probably view as red states. It's important that these projects continue.",
      "Remember, a lot of the people taking these jobs, jobs that support their families, voted for President-elect Trump because they thought that would improve their job, that he was focused on their job. So, I hope that he will get good advice, and I'll do everything I can to get my message out through our federal delegation of how important these jobs are.",
      "And they're not in urban Kentucky. They're in rural Kentucky. They are game-changing investments that have created a bright future here. And I'm certainly going to do everything I can as governor of Kentucky to protect them. And not because I'm a Democrat -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: But because I've shown my people that every single day I'm going to try to create a better life for them. And that's what those jobs do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, $14 billion between now and 2030 was what was promised to your state.",
      "I wonder if you just think Democrats didn't do a good job of explaining that.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: Well, I certainly don't want to do any finger pointing because the vice president had 107 days, and she did her very best. And I proudly crisscrossed the country in support of her.",
      "But what I know is going forward, over the next couple years, we have a chance every day, every moment to show the American people that we are laser focused on jobs, on their health care, on their infrastructure -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: On their kids' education. Just - just those everyday worries. And with this administration at least right now selecting some very extreme appointees -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: It's a chance to make a real difference, to really show people that - that we are where their basic needs are.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, but there was, as you know, some analysis after the fact among Democrats about the focus on some culture war issues or - so to speak.",
      "Congressman Seth Moulton said of transgender issues, \"I have two little girls. I don't want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete. But as a Democrat, I'm supposed to be afraid to say that.\" He says he's speaking authentically and said Democrats should do more of it.",
      "Do you think Democrats have been out of touch on some of these things that obviously resonate in states like yours?",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: Well, I think that all candidates should stand up for their beliefs, and that we don't have to abandon those beliefs. You know, I vetoed one of the nastiest anti-LGBTQ bills that my state had ever seen in my election year.",
      "But I did two things. Number one, I talked about my wife (ph). For me that's my faith, where I'm taught that all children are children of God. And I wanted to stick up for some children that were being picked on in a pretty rough bill.",
      "But the second thing is the voters in my state knew the very next day I was going to be working on jobs, I was going to be opening a new health clinic, first hospital in our largest African American neighborhood in 150 years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: We just cut the ribbon on. And we've created two pediatric autism centers in Appalachia so that people don't have to drive two hours. So, it's both sharing your why and your authentic why for - for your views.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: But the other piece is about that focus.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: Because, remember, if we're talking about this issue of the day -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: And then we're talking about what Donald Trump said last night -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: And then we're talking about jobs, we're only spending a third of the time talking about what people are worried about and what impacts their life the most.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "Governor, thank you for joining us today.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by Sue Gordon. She served as the principal deputy director of national intelligence during Donald Trump's first term in the White House.",
      "Good to see you here again.",
      "SUE GORDON (Former Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence): Great to see you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you personally briefed Donald Trump as president in the Oval Office. If this nominee-to-be, Tulsi Gabbard, becomes the Director of National Intelligence, and John Ratcliffe becomes the CIA director, are you confident that Mr. Trump will be told the information he needs to know and not just what he wants to know?",
      "SUE GORDON: Well, I think that's the - I think that's the question of the day. Intelligence is weird because it's always uncertain. And you are always making an assessment so that a decisionmaker can figure out what they're going to do with it. And so, it's particular. And you - your only job is to ruthlessly report what you see, not what you prefer. So that's the primary job of the DNI is to go in there and to be his principal adviser on intelligence. You're the first in. You're the last out.",
      "You cannot afford to I'll say pander to preference. Loyalty doesn't serve you well in that job. You have to be so committed that you will say inconvenient things. I will say the former president would tell you that I would talk to him about Russian interference. I know he hated it. But Russia was, in fact, interfering, and he needed to hear that information.",
      "So, do I believe that Tulsi and John can be that person if they believe they must be? They can learn. If they lean on the women and men of the intelligence community, they will produce an assessment. But that's a hard day, and you better be good at it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You had to undergo an FBI background check -",
      "SUE GORDON: I did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: To obtain a security clearance and to maintain it. You were a career official, 25 years at the CIA. Then, as we said, moved on to national intelligence.",
      "\"The New York Times\" is reporting the Trump team may bypass the FBI process and just use a private firm to vet candidate. Then when the president is sworn in, he can grant access to the nation's secrets, rather than go through that screening.",
      "What risk is there in bypassing the FBI?",
      "SUE GORDON: Well, the first risk is that you will get an incomplete picture of the human that is carrying both the trust of the American people and the trust of our allies and partners and the trust of the women and men that are putting their lives on the line for that judgment, right? Everyone hates vetting. It's intrusive. It - you - you don't know why anyone should have to do it because you know who you are.",
      "But the truth is, we know adversaries and competitors will exploit humans to be able to advance their interests, and you want to make sure that the people that hold the American people's trust and the most precious pieces of information we have of advantage have no cracks in who they are. And so it seems expedient, but I think it will ultimately harm the institution. And by that I mean the institutions of America, if you have people who we discover later that they should not have had access or we discover later that they were vulnerable to the actions of our allies and of our adversaries and competitors.",
      "And -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it's leverage on them?",
      "SUE GORDON: It is. I mean that's - I mean, the craft of human intelligence is actually finding someone who has a weakness and getting them to be able to advance your interests. And it just - and what a really good day is when you find someone whose interests align with yours, and then you really push that.",
      "So, a private firm isn't going to have the standards that we've had. I know it's inconvenient, but I think it's a bad strategy and risky for America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, CBS has also learned that to date the Trump team hasn't signed the paperwork that would start the process of the national security briefings so that someone's not walking in cold. They're briefed and up to speed. Along with these background checks. The Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan group that helps with the transitions, confirmed that to CBS.",
      "Is there any good reason not to sign those papers? And what does it do for the officials who arrive without being read in on what's happening now?",
      "SUE GORDON: Yes, I can't think of a - I can't think of a good reason. I think one of the great falsehoods that's been perpetrated on America is that our institutions are maleficent. They need to be better. They need to be slimmer. They need to be more transparent, but they're not bums, so you're not protecting anybody by not signing those papers.",
      "And especially some of the nominees we have that don't have the really deep experience base, these are big jobs. I mean intelligence is not just advising the president, it's also running a huge enterprise in a manner that allows our allies and partners to trust us with their most precious thing. So, I can't think of a reason why that's not signed. And to start your gig without any foundation at all, especially when the institutions are begging to give you that foundation, just seems wrong-headed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're diplomatically referring to Tulsi Gabbard there, who doesn't have a background in intelligence.",
      "SUE GORDON: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: She also has a history of statements of saying things that mirror the rhetoric of U.S. adversaries.",
      "SUE GORDON: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Vladimir Putin and Bashar al Assad. There were at least two chemical weapons attacks in Syria that killed thousands of people, and the U.S. intelligence community came to public assessments of high confidence.",
      "SUE GORDON: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I imagine you saw all of that intelligence and you briefed on it.",
      "SUE GORDON: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, when she comes out and says that she doubts it, she's skeptical, how's that going to be received by the career professionals who work for her?",
      "SUE GORDON: Yes, I mentioned one of her jobs would be to be the senior adviser. The second is to be responsible for all intelligence-sharing agreements. So, our allies and partners, upon whom we rely that Syia assessment, that was joint with our allies and partners. The one we had on Skripal was joint. Our assessment of Ukraine was joint.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That was - sorry, just to explain for our viewers, Skripal, you are talking about the killing on British soil of a former Russian by Russian intelligence.",
      "SUE GORDON: Yes. Right. Right. Yes, I'm sorry.",
      "But all those were jointly done with our allies and partners. We need them. It's one of the greatest strengths of America. But they will make their own assessment over whether we can be trusted with their nation's interests. And whether she meant it or not, whether she was just ill informed with that, she comes in with strikes against her in the trust perspective. Can we trust her with our most sacred intelligence to represent that in a fair way?",
      "So, I think it's a problem, whether it's judgment or any other thing that she has represented there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Another nerve in the intelligence community, of course, is Edward Snowden.",
      "SUE GORDON: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Tulsi Gabbard and the selection for the attorney general, Matt Gaetz, put forward resolutions to call for the charges to be dropped against him because he leaked classified national intelligence material. He's living in Russia these days. That kind of a position, how's that going to be received?",
      "SUE GORDON: It reflects a lack of understanding of who we are, and it reflects a lack of respect for what we do. Unauthorized disclosures of intelligence are always bad. Don't go with the good or bad any - good outcome or whether he was right or wrong. He had no authority, and he had different paths and he harmed America. He not only harmed intelligence, he harmed our allies and partners and he harmed our businesses by what it allowed China to assume about that.",
      "There is nothing justifiable about what he's done. None. And so if they vacate it, what they're basically saying is, all those rules you follow in order to be able to serve America, they don't matter anymore.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sue Gordon, thank you for explaining this very opaque world of intelligence to us and for your analysis today.",
      "We'll be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Dr. Deborah Birx served as the White House coronavirus response coordinator in Donald Trump's first term. She also had a long career in public health in the Army, working on Aids in Africa at the State Department, as well as time at the CDC.",
      "Good morning. Welcome back.",
      "DR. DEBORAH BIRX (Former White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator): Good morning, Margaret. Glad to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Dr. Birx, I want to ask you about your views on public health, which we're looking at because of this nomination potentially of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "HHS has wide portfolio here, vaccines, medicine, overseas, Medicare, regulates food, beauty products, baby formula, reproductive health care. What would the impact be of having someone without government experience in that top job?",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: Well, I think the most important thing is what team he would bring with him because you're talking about really a large cap corporation with a highly diverse group. What you have to really bring together - and frankly eliminate some of the duplications between these agencies to really become more cost effective. And so really having a management person at his side, a chief of staff perhaps, that has really come out of industry, that would know how to bring and look and bring those individuals together that are running the other agencies, because it's a very comp - HHS is probably one of our most complicated departments.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you're saying people with experience around him, we need to look at those lower level appointees Mr. Trump might make.",
      "What's so interesting with RFK Jr. is how he has, in some ways, tapped into this health movement in America. He's talking about more regulation, not less when it comes to American food.",
      "Here's some of what he's said.",
      "(BEGIN VC)",
      "ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR., HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY NOMINEE: I'm just going to tell the cereal companies, take all the dyes out of their food. I'll get processed food out of school lunch immediately.",
      "Ten percent of food stamps go to sugar drinks, to, you know, sodas. We're creating diabetes problems in our kids by giving them food that's poison. And I'm going to stop that.",
      "(END VC)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Those sound like good goals. Can he actually take on big agriculture and get that through?",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: I think because of a lot of the people who are suffering the most from these additives are actually people in our rural areas. You know, 16 percent of the Americans live in a rural area, but they are providing all of our oil and gas, all of our fiber, all of our cotton, and all of our food. And the level of diabetes in these communities because of their access to certain foods is extraordinarily high.",
      "I just came out of the field, 58 percent of the adults in the town that I was just in had already diabetes or prediabetes based on household survey where we went house to house. This is the reality of America.",
      "And so what I'm hoping is he brings his transparency for all Americans, and we really start to tackle these issues one by one by one. I think everybody across America wants to have healthy kids that they know will grow up, and not end up with the complications of diabetes or heart disease.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It was very hard for Michelle Obama, when she was first lady, to get any of that done. And it might be hard for lawmakers who come from some of those agricultural states to vote against their own interests in terms of the farm subsidies and the like.",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: Well, we're not talking about eliminating good food. We're talking about using all of their ingredients in a way that is more healthy for Americans. And I think that's what people are calling for now.",
      "Europe did it years ago. And I think we are capable of doing that. We are really smart, high levels of technology. We can make food tasty without a lot of these additives because we can see that other groups are doing it in a small way. So, we're not talking about eliminating the need for wheats and grains, we're talking about putting those together in a healthy way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you as well about some of his - the things he said about vaccines. As you know, the vaccine - vaccination rates are declining in America. He said things like restoring transparency around them. It's not really clear what that means. Why do you think there's a decline of vaccination?",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: I think there's two pieces to it. I think when we talk about things in public health, we don't acknowledge the concerns because when my children went to school, there was maybe one in 1,000 kids with autism, diagnosed autisms. Now it's three per 100. So, every mom is seeing a classroom of kindergarteners where one of the children has autism. That's scary to moms and dads. They want to know why. So, it's not good enough for us to just say, vaccines don't cause autism, it's us finding what is the cause of autism and reverse it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I think a lot of people would absolutely agree that it is ridiculous that there isn't a lot of research and established causation with autism.",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: Yes. Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But what he has said in the past is that autism is caused by vaccines. And there's no scientific basis for that conclusion, as I understand it.",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: That's correct. And so that's why, when he talks about transparency, I'm actually excited that in a Senate hearing he would bring forward his data and the questions that come from the senators would bring forth their data.",
      "What I know for sure is, he's a very smart man who can bring his data and his evidence base forward, and we can have a discussion that many Americans believe already is a problem. So, until we can have that transparency and that open discussion from both sides, I know the members have incredible staffers who will bring great questions from their constituents, and that hearing would be a way for Americans to really see the data that you're talking about, that we can't see that causation right now. But what is causing it? And so you're absolutely right, addressing what the cause is will be critical.",
      "And I think what has confused people is we weren't clear about what Covid vaccines do and don't. And so now people are questioning, well, what do my child vaccines do and don't. And they don't understand that some of the vaccines that their children are getting protect them from both disease and create herd immunity, and some of them that they get are just for their child. Like H flu (ph) and pneumo vax (ph) to protect their child from getting very serious illness. And we're just not explaining all of this correctly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and that's why the messenger matters so much on this.",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: Yes, it does.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Which is why his past statements are being scrutinized.",
      "You worked on Aids for a good part of your career. He has said that he doesn't take a position on the relationship between HIV and Aids, but then he laid out alternative theories in his book and said, \"Dr. Fauci never produced a study to demonstrate his hypothesis using accepted scientific proof.\"",
      "Do you agree with that assertion on HIV and Aids?",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: Well, having spent a career in understanding how HIV and Aids progresses, HIV virus is the cause of Aids.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Period.",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: There's a whole set of things that happen, and I think what HIV taught me is you have to - it's asymptomatic for ten years. And we're finally recognizing how important asymptomatic disease progression and disease transmission is. That's what HIV taught us.",
      "But what other HIV taught us was the entire human immune system.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: So, by investing in HIV research, we learned about CAR T- cells that we use today in cancer.",
      "So, a lot of these research and investments pay off in other areas. And I think once he's there at HHS, he'll see that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. If he's open to the data.",
      "Dr. Birx, thank you.",
      "We'll be right back.",

    "title": "Combating Parkinson's with rock climbing",
    "published": "Sun, 17 Nov 2024 10:51:24 -0500",
    "summary": "There is currently no cure for Parkinson's Disease. But some with Parkinson's are finding that an unusual therapy \u2013 rock climbing \u2013 is helping them improve their balance, mobility, strength and cognition.",
    "story": [
      "We were amazed at what we were seeing on a sweltering summer's day, when a group of people with Parkinson's Disease began rock-climbing on the Carderock Cliffs of Maryland. Yes, rock-climbing!",
      "It's all part of their therapy, says Molly Cupka, the no-nonsense instructor and cheerleader for this community of courageous climbers.",
      "She started this program, called UpENDing Parkinsons, as a non-profit twelve years ago.",
      "\"There's a lot of balance involved, mobility involved, strength, cardio, and then there's the cognitive part, where you have to look at the hold, and figure out how to get your body to move to get to that hold,\" she said.",
      "How often do they fall? \"Falling is definitely part of climbing,\" said Cupka. But they never really fall, because they wear a harness that provides a layer of safety. \"You're always on the rope. You fall, but you don't fall far. We always say if you're not falling, you're not trying hard enough!\"",
      "There's no cure for Parkinson's, which usually affects mobility, coordination, balance, and even speech. Jon Lessin was diagnosed in 2003. He was once an all-around athlete. About 12 years ago he retired as a cardiac anesthesiologist because of Parkinson's. His daughter, Brittany, watched his steady decline, until he discovered climbing walls as high as 60 feet!",
      "\"My dad has a hard time walking across the room, but he can make it to the top of this giant wall,\" Brittany said. \"There's a lot that he's had to give up because of his disease. But this is something that he found through it, which is really cool.\"",
      "Jon said, \"I get to the top and I feel like I've conquered something. And I feel like the wall can't beat me. I can beat the wall.\"",
      "Full disclosure: This story is very personal to me. My late husband, Aaron Latham, had Parkinson's, and boxed as a way to fight the symptoms, as he explained on \"Sunday Morning\" in 2015. \"Boxing's just the opposite of Parkinson's,\" said Latham. \"Everything's designed, instead of to shrink you, everything's designed to pump you up.\"",
      "Jon Lessin said Parkinson's \"makes you feel very small. You make small movements, you're hunched over. And [rock climbing] makes you feel like you can accomplish the world.\"",
      "It was Lessin who first had that big idea to use rock climbing as a therapy for Parkinson's. \"I wanted to do big-movement exercise,\" he said. \"And I found Molly at this gym.\"",
      "Lessin proposed the idea to Molly Cupka, who runs the Sportrock Climbing Center in Alexandria, Virginia. She thought it was worth a try, given the sport requires participants to plan ahead, to know where to position their hands and feet. \"I wish I could go into the brain and see what's happening while people climb,\" Cupka said.",
      "Some people with Parkinson's, like Vivek Puri, get dyskinesia (involuntary jerking motions). Puri said he's usually unaware of his. He runs a home building company in the D.C. area, and was only 38 when he found out he had Parkinson's. \"Fine motor skills have kind of really suffered dramatically,\" he said. \"When I don't climb for some periods of time, I get worse.\"",
      "But once he gets on the wall, he calls himself Spider-Man.",
      "\"Honestly, I climb like a monkey,\" he said. \"I get my finger strength moving, which gets my fine motor skills \u2013 maybe not back, but kind of keeps that in motion.\"",
      "There's no evidence climbing slows the progress of Parkinson's, but Cupka joined forces with Marymount University last year to study patients climbing for the first time. \"We have people literally walking and carrying weights, you know, walking and looking, multitasking,\" she said.",
      "The study found that, in so many words, if you climb, you may walk better.",
      "Marymount University's Center for Optimal Aging study on physical and psychosocial effects of rock climbing on individuals with Parkinson's disease",
      "Marymount University's Center for Optimal Aging study on physical and psychosocial effects of rock climbing on individuals with Parkinson's disease",
      "Mark de Mulder, a musician and former director of the National Geospatial Program, doesn't need a study to prove what climbing does for him. \"It allows me to say, 'All right, take that, Parkinson's! I'm doing this!' It just makes me feel stronger, and I'm fighting it. I'm doing something about it.\"",
      "Many of the climbers have become friends who climb together several times a week; and they've become a support group, Parkinson's Pals, who encourage each other.",
      "\"When I reach the top, I can turn around and look and wave, and see my wife and my friends, and that's the reward,\" said de Mulder. \"It's really wonderful.\"",
      "There's no real understanding of how these people can do this, but you can certainly understand why. An emotional Vivek Puri said, \"It's nice to be good at something.\"",

      "A return to Madison Square Garden meant revisiting the place where a comedian caused an uproar at a Trump rally last month by likening Puerto Rico to a \"floating island of garbage.\" Yet Trump continues to relish visits to New York, where he lived for decades, before moving to his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida.",
      "UFC aired a video package of Trump's road to reclaiming the White House, calling it, \"The great comeback in American History,\" while fans stood and applauded. Trump, wearing a red tie, pumped his fist toward the crowd when the video ended.",
      "The president-elect also had his clenched fists pumping back and forth and briefly danced to the Village People's \"YMCA\" just outside the cage. He later again thrust his fist skyward as \"Takin' Care of Business\" played.",
      "Elon Musk, picked by Trump to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency, and House Speaker Mike Johnson, joined the president-elect and White at the Garden, as did Robert Kennedy Jr., Trump's choice to lead the Department of Health and Human Services in his incoming administration and Tulsi Gabbard, who Trump said last week he would nominate to be director of national intelligence. House Speaker Mike Johnson, who was selected last week by the Republican conference to be their leader for the 119th Congress, was part of the entourage at the rally with Trump, Musk, RFK Jr. and Gabbard.",
      "Trump shook hands with the UFC broadcast team that included Joe Rogan. Rogan hosted Trump on his podcast for hours in the final stages of the campaign ahead of his election win last week. The announcers for the pay-per-view audience later declared, \"Festive doesn't even begin to describe\" the scene before later proclaiming, \"47's in the building. Let's go.\"",
      "The MSG crowd chanted \"USA! USA!\" right before the main card was about to start and then again throughout the action. After a year delay, Stipe Miocic is getting his shot at a third heavyweight championship reign when he battles current champion Jon Jones in the main event at UFC 309.",
      "Trump is a longtime UFC enthusiast and frequent attendee of major fights. He made promoting hypermasculine tones a signature of his campaign \u2014 as he looked to further widen the gap among male voters between himself and his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "Trump and his top supporters embraced alpha-male terms and often accentuated them with vulgar and demeaning language.",
      "While campaigning, Trump appeared frequently on podcasts, gaming platforms, and with key supporters who described a vote for Trump as a way to demonstrate true manliness. While Trump taped a podcast with Rogan, who himself has spoken about hypermasculinity, Harris failed to do a similar appearance, citing scheduling conflicts.",
      "Trump's son, Don Jr., also attended the fight.",
      "Except for a day trip to Washington this week to meet for nearly two hours with President Biden and separately address House Republicans, Trump has been spending his time since his Election Day victory at Mar-a-Lago. The club has hosted galas and conservative events throughout the week.",
      "Trump has been close to White for more than two decades.",
      "White hosted a 2001 UFC battle at Trump Taj Mahal, a former casino-hotel in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and Trump has frequently attended UFC matches since \u2014 including during his 2024 campaign. Trump has turned up at fights recently with famous entourages, including White, musician Kid Rock and former Fox News Channel host Tucker Carlson.",
      "In 2018, during Trump's first term, he and White starred in a UFC video where the then-president was called the \"Combatant In Chief.\"",
      "As Trump has strengthened his grip on the national Republican Party over the last near-decade, White's personal political profile has grown exponentially.

    "published": "Sun, 17 Nov 2024 09:25:46 -0500",
    "summary": "The former president proudly wears the title of \"citizen,\" which is also the title of his new book, \"Citizen: My Life After the White House.\" He talks about making a difference outside of elected office, and the prospects of a second Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "They don't play \"Hail to the Chief\" when President Bill Clinton shows up anymore, but there is an equally welcome sound he still hears all the time. \"We love you!\" shouts one bystander in Harlem.",
      "Here, a walk through the streets with Clinton feels a lot like a victory lap. The former president set up shop here shortly after he left office. Back then, he was only 54, newly unemployed, but determined to use his influence, contacts and know-how to make a difference as a private citizen.",
      "He even said so in his final address to the nation: \"In the years ahead, I will never hold a position higher or a covenant more sacred than that of President of the United States. But there is no title I will wear more proudly than that of citizen.\"",
      "In the 24 years since he made that speech, Citizen Clinton has accomplished enough to fill several lifetimes \u2013 and the pages of a new book: \"Citizen: My Life After the White House\"\u00a0(to be published Tuesday by Knopf).",
      "Asked what he was most proud of that he'd done in your time out of the White House, Clinton replied, \"I think the thing I'm most proud of is that I proved that you can make a big difference as a private citizen.\"",
      "By any measure, he's done that. Through his Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative, which partners business leaders with nonprofits, he's helped fund projects worldwide \u2013 to name a few, a program to help combat HIV/AIDS in South Africa, and a massive clean water project in Rwanda. Closer to home, his foundation helped with everything from the energy-saving retrofit of the Empire State Building in New York, to fighting drug overdoses in the heartland, to an upgrade of street lights in Los Angeles. They also helped fund construction jobs to rebuild crumbling infrastructure.",
      "\"We raised $16 billion from union pension funds to put people to work,\" he said. \"It was the biggest in the country at the time. That's what I'm proud of, 'cause I think people are happy when they do things that actually make things better.\"",
      "The president also hit the road for the Harris-Walz ticket in the final weeks of the campaign, and says he was disappointed, but not entirely surprised, by the result.",
      "I asked, \"Do you think part of the issue is that America is just not ready for a female president?\"",
      "\"Maybe,\" Clinton replied. \"I think in some ways we've moved to the right as a reaction to all the turmoil. And I think if Hillary had been nominated in 2008, she would've walked in, just like Obama did.\"",
      "\"Has the country changed?\"",
      "\"Well, I think all these cultural battles that we're fighting make it harder in some ways for a woman to run.\"",
      "\"So, you think it has more to do with party than gender?\"",
      "\"No,\" he said. \"Although I think it would probably be easier for a conservative Republican woman to win.\"",
      "\"Than a Democrat woman?\"",
      "\"Uh-huh. Because, I mean, that's what Maggie Thatcher did,\" said Clinton. \"But I still think we'll have a female president pretty soon.\"",
      "\"How soon? Within your lifetime?\"",
      "\"Oh yeah. Well, I don't know how long I'm gonna live. You're askin' an old man that question!\" he laughed. \"I hope I'm around for the next time. But now it's President Trump's turn in the barrel. It depends on what he does and how it plays.\"",
      "We spoke this past week as the president-elect was in the process of naming his new cabinet, shaking up Washington, D.C., and beyond.",
      "I asked, \"Are the guardrails off?\"",
      "\"Well, there's no obvious guardrail,\" Clinton replied. \"The Senate's shown some indigestion about some of these suggested appointments. We'll see what happens there. You know, somewhere along the way, [Trump will] have to think about whether, at this chapter of his life, he still thinks the most important thing is to have unquestionable domination, 'cause that's not what a democracy is about.\"",
      "\"So you're saying President Trump might have a change of heart?\"",
      "\"He might. I was raised in the Baptist Church. I believe in deathbed conversions! I think you can't give it up,\" Clinton said. \"But I think the rest of us just have to be diligent, watch the signs, and be willing to stand up for what we think is right, even if they take a piece outta our hide.\"",
      "In his book, the president writes candidly about his health issues, including his battle with weight. But he couldn't resist stopping into the famed soul food restaurant Sylvia's, if only for a cup of coffee.",
      "I asked, \"If you were eating here, what would you get?\"",
      "\"In the middle of the afternoon? I would get some piece of pie.\"",
      "\"I know you talk about this in your book. You have to watch your diet a little bit now?\"",
      "\"A lot,\" Clinton said. \"It's unbelievable how low your metabolism gets.\"",
      "If he's candid about his health, he's just as open about past controversies. Clinton writes about Monica Lewinsky, applauding her recent work on bullying.",
      "Why make a point of doing that? He said, \"Because I thought I needed to say something about it, and I wanted to be as helpful as I could to let her turn the page. I think she should be given a chance to build a life that is about her and the future, and not, you know, being whiplashed into an old story.\"",
      "So, while he's mindful of the past, Bill Clinton keeps moving forward, making connections big and small, still trying \u2013 and often succeeding \u2013 in his bid to change the world.",
      "\"I don't mind it when people jump on me; I just talk to 'em,\" he said. \"And I don't turn 'em all. You don't have to turn everybody; you just got to get enough.",
      "\"We just all need to loosen up and get back in the game. \u2026 There's one other thing, and I say this in the book many times: We all keep score. You've been doing this for a long time. You're keeping score in your mind about this interview compared to 15 others you've done. And I think the way I keep score is: Are people better off when you quit than when you started? Do children have a brighter future? And are we coming together instead of being torn apart? So, for me, it's enough if I can answer yes to those three things.",
      "\"I know there are no permanent victories or defeats in politics,\" said Clinton. \"And I have no interest in being an armchair quarterback except to help my team perform better. And I think they have enormous talent. So, I wish 'em all well, and I'll try to help. But meanwhile, I'm gonna just suit up and do what I'm doing.\"",

    "story": [
      "In early 2018, I was deplaning after an 18-hour flight when Steve Hartman called. He had an idea: to photograph the still-intact bedrooms of kids who had been killed in school shootings.",
      "It's a headful. And six years later, I still don't have an \"elevator pitch\" for the project \u2014 but then, I don't often talk about this project. It is by far the most difficult I have ever worked on.",
      "When Steve, my friend of about 25 years, asked me if I would like to be involved, I said yes without hesitation \u2014 even though I didn't think we would get any families to agree. There is no way that I would have said no to partnering with him on this.",
      "Emotionally, I was not sure how I would get through it. Within a few months I was on my way to Parkland, Florida. Alone. I'm not sure that I realized that I would be on my own.",
      "But here I was. An on-location commercial photographer who focuses on people and pets to create compelling, honest, textural and connective moments for large brands, per my LinkedIn professional profile, on a project where there is no one to take photos of \u2014 for the most brutal of reasons.",
      "How do you make a portrait of a child who is not there?",
      "In each of these children's rooms \u2014 the most sacred of places for these families \u2014 there was the sense that the child had just been there, and was coming right back. It was as if they'd just left their room like that when they went to school in the morning and were returning in the afternoon.",
      "I wanted to capture that essence.",
      "Most kids' bedrooms are their very own special places, and these were no different. I looked everywhere, without touching anything. I photographed inside trash cans, under beds, behind desks. Their personalities shone through in the smallest of details \u2014 hair ties on a doorknob, a toothpaste tube left uncapped, a ripped ticket for a school event \u2014 allowing me to uncover glimpses as to who they were.",
      "Click here to explore the interactive feature.",
      "But there was an emotional challenge in addition to that creative one. Over the course of more than six years, we visited with many families around the country. The parents I spoke with seemed grateful that I was there. But each time I received a call or text from Steve about a new family, my heart sank.",
      "It meant another family had lost a child.",
      "I find it unfathomable that children being killed at school is even an issue. It makes no sense. It's impossible to process. The night prior to each one of the family visits, I didn't sleep. And I knew I wouldn't going into the project. It's not a self-fulfilling prophecy. It is nerves. And empathy. And sorrow. And fear.",
      "In my notes from early on in the project, back in 2018, writing in seat 6H on the flight back from Nairobi, I reflected on the emotional task ahead.",
      "\"This is going to be one of the most difficult things ever, emotionally, for me, and not just work related. As I read my research documents, I get visibly emotional,\" I wrote, noting my gratitude that the dark cabin prevented the other passengers from seeing me.",
      "The prospect brought my own fears to the fore, both for myself \u2014 \"I can't help thinking about Rose,\" my daughter, \"and what if. I've lost sleep over envisioning the what-ifs well before Parkland\" \u2014 and about and for meeting the families in the project: \"When I read about April & Phillip and Lori's plight, I somehow, for some reason put myself in their emotional position even though that is impossible, I have no idea, it's beyond comprehension, I do not know what they feel. I do not know what I am going to say to them, I'm scared beyond belief. And alone.\"",
      "But just days later, I was photographing the first assignment for the project: Alyssa Alhadeff's room. She was just 14 years old when she walked out of that room to head to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. I was shaky meeting the family friend who greeted me at the house. Her daughter was Alyssa's best friend, and a photo of the two girls was on the table.",
      "According to my notes, \"The room was a beautiful teenager's messy room. My emotions were kept in check the way that they usually are; By hiding behind the camera. I removed my shoes before entering. My heart was pounding and it reverberated through my body and soul, I felt like I was in one of the most sacred and special places on Earth. I was so careful not to touch anything.\"",
      "I left feeling ready to explode in sadness and anger.",
      "Later that day, I photographed Carmen Schentrup's room. Her younger sister had survived the Parkland shooting, but 16-year-old Carmen was killed in her AP Psychology class. Meeting her parents, April and Phillip, was what I was most scared of.",
      "\"I feel so much pain and compassion for them and I don't want to say the wrong thing, drop cliches etc.,\" I wrote at the time. \"I spoke to Steve for guidance. He said, just be you. That's all I can do. Just be me. He was right, those three words helped carry me through this entire project. Just be me.\"",
      "April let me in, and I worked quickly, only meeting Phillip as I was leaving. \"The conversation felt like we all three were just trying to hold it together. I cannot imagine what they are going through, my heart hurts for them. This was / is such a painful project, and reconciling it will be impossible.",
      "\"I think about how anything can happen at any time to any of us. Literally. You never know,\" I wrote.",
      "After only about 16 hours on the ground in Florida, I was done with the first portion. I felt the project was a must, but I also dreaded the next call from Steve about the next family. I didn't know when that call would come \u2014 many years later, or the very next day, possibly never.",
      "But last month, we \u2014 and the documentary crew that filmed us working \u2014 completed this project.

      "I never wanted to be this kind of reporter, knocking on the door of someone who lost a child in a school shooting. And yet there I stood, knocking, nonetheless.",
      "I found myself here, standing on the threshold of grief across the country, after years of pent-up frustration. By 2018, America's school shooting epidemic had taken a toll on me. There were so many that the news coverage felt like a treadmill. It seemed to me the country had grown numb and lost its empathy for the victims and the families. I wanted to do something.",

      "\"We had a chance to have her for 9 and a half years, and that was far better than not having her at all,\" Chad said.",
      "But their goodbye isn't quite complete. They're still living with her bedroom.",

      "\"It just makes everything more real for the public, for the world,\" Gloria said. \"Her room completely just speaks of who she was.\"",
      "In Jackie's room, we saw the chocolate she saved for a day that never came, evidence of the dream vacation she never got to take, and the pajamas she never wore again.",

      "Frank and Nancy Blackwell lost their 14-year-old son Dominic in the Saugus High School tragedy near Los Angeles. That was 2019, but inside his room, it felt like it was yesterday.",
      "\"We just decided to keep everything as it was from when he last went to school that day,\" Frank said. \"He didn't prepare his room to be photographed. He didn't put away his stuffed animals because he was worried about who might see it. He woke up, he got dressed, and he left to go to school. And he thought he was coming back.

      "The decision to either keep a room as it was or pack it up and repurpose it tortures many parents.",

      "According to Sgt. Michael Harding, one of the lead detectives, Alyssa pulled into her usual parking space at around 9 a.m.",

      "But fearing it was an active shooter situation, they stayed inside, and the attacker launched into a rabid killing frenzy \u2014 plunging his knife into flesh and bone again and again. Incredibly, Alyssa was still breathing when her assailant fled.",

      "One of her colleagues made this call to 911:",
      "911 DISPATCHER: 911, what is the address of the emergency?",
      "CALLER: Someone came up and just shot my \u2014 my assistant manager.",

      "Peter Van Sant: They start working on her right here.",
      "Darin Ickeler: Immediately. Yeah. And it was too late. She was gone.",
      "Alyssa had been stabbed and slashed a total of 44 times. Alyssa's mother immediately gave the police a name, and it wasn't a Black man; it was Andrew Beard.",
      "Teresa Collard (police bodycam video): (Crying) I know he did this \u2026 he is an evil person.",
      "Collard told detectives that Andrew Beard and Alyssa were in the throes of an ugly custody battle over their 1-year-old daughter, Willow Ann \u2014 a battle that began when Alyssa was still pregnant says her friend, Brandi Reagan.",
      "Brandi Reagan: He initiated by asking her if he could have full custody of the baby after the baby was born.",
      "Peter Van Sant:\u00a0 And what did Alyssa have to say to his idea of him getting full custody?",
      "Brandi Reagan: \"You better be effing kidding me ...\"",
      "Alyssa and Beard were worlds apart from the beginning. He was almost nine years older, established with a good job at a tool company, a nice house, and even had a plane. She was 22, loved eating turkey legs at state fairs and was still figuring life out. After meeting on a dating app, they had a fling, nothing serious. But then she found out she was pregnant says her friend and roommate, Shelbie Wright.",
      "Shelbie Wright: I'll never forget. \u2026 she's just standing there, hysterically crying, um, and upset. \u2026 She couldn't even speak, and she hands me a pregnancy test that said positive. And I honestly had no words for her.",
      "But as the pregnancy progressed, Alyssa's fears turned to excitement, says Wright \u2014 especially when she learned it was a girl. On July 23, 2019, Alyssa gave birth to a baby girl she named Willow.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And when you saw them together \u2026 Alyssa and Willow, what was that experience like?",
      "Shelbie Wright: Amazing. Motherhood looked great on her. Yes (laughs).",
      "Madison Grimes: Just looking at the two of them \u2026 you could tell that their relationship was I mean \u2026 everything.",
      "Madison Grimes is Alyssa's younger sister.",
      "Madison Grimes: Willow clung to her every second, every day. And I think that tells you a lot about the mother Alyssa was.",
      "Alyssa went back to college and got a good job as an assistant property manager.",
      "Madison Grimes: I think everything she did at that point in her life was for Willow. She wanted to be successful for Willow. She didn't want Willow to grow up and struggle. She just wanted Willow to have an easy life.",
      "Beard, who had joint custody, had Willow a few days every week. But he kept pushing for primary custody, dragging Alyssa in and out of court hearings \u2014 emptying her bank account.",
      "Madison Grimes: She was terrified. \u2026 Willow at this point was the most important thing in her life. And when she you know \u2026 looked at the bigger picture \u2026 Andrew, he made more money than her \u2026 you know he had a house, he had all of the nice things that she didn't have. \u2026 So she was afraid that you know \u2026 he wanted Willow and he was gonna get her.",
      "Beard's mother, Lizette Bowers, says her son was acting out of love, not malice.",
      "Lizette Bowers: My son Andrew Beard is a loving, warm individual who always operated from his heart, from his core center. \u2026 When he had Willow, she was constantly strapped to the front of him. He was reading to her \u2026 He wanted her to see the whole world, every day.",
      "Lizette Bowers: He just felt that he could provide her more stability.",
      "In March 2020 when Willow was 8 months old, things seemed to change for the better. The feuding parents found common ground, finally reaching an agreement on visitation and child support.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And so things seemed to calm down?",
      "Madison Grimes: Things, calm down. Yeah.",
      "But a gathering storm was about to come barreling in.",
      "\"SHE WAS GENUINELY SCARED\"",
      "In the spring of 2020, it looked like the bitter custody battle between Alyssa and Beard had finally come to an end. Alyssa had a new guy named Ben. And Beard fell hard for a woman named Holly Elkins, someone his mom was thrilled about.",
      "Lizette Bowers: I adored her from minute one. She just has this charm and energy \u2026 I warmed to her very quickly.",
      "Teresa Collard: Alyssa was happy that he started dating someone else.",
      "Madison Grimes: I guess, hopeful that Holly would help this situation, that Holly would be supportive of the mother that's involved.",
      "Elkins sent this text to Alyssa: \"\u2026 look forward to having a super healthy relationship with you and Ben!\" Alyssa responded, \"\u2026 I hope your influence helps because I'd love nothing more for us all to have a healthy relationship \u2026\"",
      "Despite Elkins' message, Beard suddenly became hostile with Alyssa. He was once again demanding primary custody of Willow, dragging Alyssa back into court.",
      "Teresa Collard: He was always very short, very rude, very hateful. \u2026 it just totally changed \u2026 the way that they communicated together.",
      "Alyssa couldn't shake this uneasy feeling that she was being watched and began telling family and friends that Beard always seemed to know what she was doing.",
      "Teresa Collard: He knew where she was. He knew where Willow was. He knew \u2026 just other places that she had been.",
      "Shelbie Wright: I remember one night she was out with one of her friends and, they were at a bar in downtown Dallas. \u2026 And she's like, texted me, \"oh my gosh, Andrew is here.\" And in my mind, I'm like \u2026 the odds of that happening \u2014 are slim to none \u2026 you know she didn't know how he was tracking her she just knew that she was being tracked.",
      "Peter Van Sant: How would you describe what she went through?",
      "Teresa Collard: Hell \u2026 I mean, every day you feel like you're having to watch over your shoulder. \u2026 that's how I felt she lived \u2026",
      "Grimes found a video after Alyssa's death. It was never posted.",
      "ALYSSA BURKETT (video): Hi everyone, my name's Alyssa. So this past year, I have been going through a custody battle. A very ugly one. I have a 1-year-old child. It's taken a toll on my mental and physical health. \u2026 With that being said, I've become a lot stronger in the process. \u2026 And I guess just my message is no matter what you're going through, stick it out. You can do it. And stay strong.",
      "But Alyssa would continue to be tested. In September 2020, one month before her murder, it reached a whole new level. A man, who said his name was Frank Marrow, called 911 and reported that Alyssa was selling drugs out of the trunk of her car at work.",
      "CALLER: I saw \u2026 what I thought looked like someone just selling some drugs out of \u2026 their trunk. And I could smell it and I could see it.",
      "911 DISPATCHER OK, what kind of vehicle is it?",
      "CALLER: \u2026it's a little Toyota Corolla ... I have a license plate if that helps.",
      "911 DISPATCHER: OK, Frank. ...what was your last name?",
      "CALLER: Marrow.",
      "Acting on this tip, Carrollton Police officers descended on the Greentree Apartments leasing office and confronted Alyssa. She gave them the keys to her car, and they opened the trunk. Inside, they discovered drugs, a pistol, and some cash exactly where the caller said they would be.",
      "Peter Van Sant: So your daughter suddenly now looks like a drug dealer, and a dangerous one as well. She's armed.",
      "Teresa Collard: Yes.",
      "Peter Van Sant: I mean, is Alyssa \u2026 worried that she's gonna get arrested? Lose her job?",
      "Teresa Collard: Yes. All of the above. She's worried about her job. She thinks, yeah, she's gonna be arrested. Now, he's gonna use this in court. So she's for sure gonna lose Willow.",
      "After questioning Alyssa, it was clear to police that she knew nothing about the drugs and pistol in the trunk of her car. They concluded those items had been planted. The caller had tried to frame her. Alyssa knew in her gut that caller was Andrew Beard. Later that day, she texted her roommate Shelbie.",
      "Shelbie Wright: Alyssa messaged me and said \u2026 \"he is going to try to get someone to kill me next.\"",
      "Peter Van Sant: And when you read those words?",
      "Shelbie Wright: My heart dropped.",
      "Brandi Reagan: That wasn't who she was. She wasn't a fearful person. ... showing and asking for help shows me that she was genuinely scared.",
      "Shelbie Wright: She knew that, you know, whatever was coming next was going to be serious.",
      "The once fearless young woman had become scared for her life. These are some of the texts she sent to her sister Madison:",
      "\"Come over while I walk inside\"",
      "\"Lock the door behind you\"",
      "\"Do you see anyone around you\"",
      "And Alyssa wasn't the only one who was terrified.",
      "Madison Grimes: ... it kept progressing. Each thing that he would do just kept getting worse. And after this point framing her and she didn't get arrested, I thought, well, what else is there to do besides kill her?",
      "ZEROING IN ON ANDREW BEARD",
      "One month after the drugs and gun were planted in Alyssa Burkett's car, she was dead.",
      "TERESA COLLARD (police bodycam video): I knew that it was him when \u2014 when the drugs didn't work in the car for him to get the baby \u2026",
      "Det. Jeremy Chevallier: Once we talked to Alyssa's mom \u2026 we had an idea who we were looking for.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And who is that person?",
      "Det. Jeremy Chevallier: That person was Andrew Beard.",
      "And to Collard's horror, he had visitation with Willow that day. The baby was with him.",
      "TERESA COLLARD (police bodycam video): ... yes \u2014 I want my grandbaby away from him.",
      "Madison Grimes: My first thoughts were \u2026 he's gonna kill Willow.",
      "Within hours of the murder, the police pulled over Beard's F-150 pickup truck for an alleged traffic violation. Beard and his fianc\u00e9e, Holly Elkins, were asked to get out the vehicle.",
      "OFFICER (bodycam video): The daughter is in the car seat in the back seat.",
      "OFFICER (bodycam video): They've been pretty cooperative.",
      "Beard seemed unfazed by the whole thing, says Harding.",
      "Sgt. Michael Harding: He was very calm. \u2026 he wasn't amped up \u2026 he \u2014 he didn't seem nervous.",
      "OFFICER 2 (bodycam video): My part was to just find you. That's all they asked me to do.",
      "Ultimately Beard and Elkins were allowed to go, and because he had court mandated visitation rights, take Willow with them. But the police seized his F-150 pickup and instructed him not to return home. Beard, Elkins, and Willow went to a hotel. That night, a search of Beard's house turned up critical evidence, such as an envelope scribbled with incriminating notes.",
      "Sgt. Michael Harding: Upon reading the notes, we realized those were tied to \u2014 the Frank Marrow 911 call.",
      "Frank Marrow \u2014 that caller who had reported Alyssa was selling drugs out of her car.",
      "Sgt. Michael Harding: Alyssa's license plate number, the color, and model of the vehicle \u2026 Frank Marrow \u2026 everything that he needed to make that 911 call was on this back of this envelope.",
      "Peter Van Sant: It's like you discovered the screenplay to this \u2014 phony call to 911.",
      "Sgt. Michael Harding: Yes.",
      "Sgt. Michael Harding: I was kind of shocked. I was like, he \u2014 he kept this?",
      "Also in plain view, says Jeremy Chevallier, another lead detective, charging stations and batteries that matched the tracking device detectives discovered on Alyssa's car after the murder.",
      "Det. Jeremy Chevallier: That was all part of his plan to \u2014 to catch her doing something that he believed that she \u2014 shouldn't be doing. \u2026 to gain an advantage in that \u2026 child custody dispute.",
      "A search of that F-150 seized at the traffic stop turned up more jaw-dropping evidence.",
      "Det. Jeremy Chevallier (holding a vial): So this is \u2014 one of the makeup vials that were recovered from inside one of the bags in the F-150.",
      "It was a foundation called Java.",
      "Det. Jeremy Chevallier: It's really dark. Very dark.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And the purpose of that was what do you believe?",
      "Det. Jeremy Chevallier: Was to \u2026 disguise Andrew Beard's face, to make him look like an African American.",
      "The police found the knife sheath at the scene but never found the knife or the gun. But the day after the homicide they found something just as important: that black SUV. They learned Beard had bought it specifically to commit the murder. And there it was \u2014 abandoned less than a mile from Beard's house.",
      "Det. Jeremy Chevallier: \u2026 he drove it to that location, and he fled back to his house the \u2026 the morning of the murder.",
      "Beard is captured on a home security camera fleeing through the neighborhood.",
      "Det. Jeremy Chevallier: He is \u2014 doing the bigfoot run from this vehicle.",
      "Peter Van Sant: What'd you find when you guys processed the inside of this vehicle?",
      "Det. Jeremy Chevallier: We were able to recover multiple spots where blood was recovered. that was later tested to be Alyssa's blood.",
      "They also found another part of his disguise: a fake beard.",
      "Peter Van Sant: That looks like a Halloween kind of beard.",
      "Det. Jeremy Chevallier: Exactly, he \u2014 had purchased a Halloween costume.",
      "Det. Jeremy Chevallier: So, that's what led us to get the arrest warrant for Andrew Beard.",
      "Beard, who still had Willow, had been staying in an Airbnb with his fianc\u00e9e, Holly Elkins, and his mother, Lizette Bowers.",
      "Lizette Bowers: When we were at the Airbnb, he got a call \u2026 he was going to be arrested \u2026",
      "Just three days after Alyssa was killed, Willow was sent back to Collard and Beard turned himself in to the police. He was charged with murder.",
      "Lizette Bowers: I was confident \u2026 they had the wrong man.",
      "So was Holly Elkins. She volunteered to speak to the police \u2014 incredulous that the man she planned to marry was capable of murder.",
      "HOLLY ANN ELKINS (police interview): So I just told all my friends and family that I'm engaged to the most wonderful man on the planet.",
      "DET. CHEVALLIER: Yeah.",
      "HOLLY ANN ELKINS: And now people want me to believe that he's not that.",
      "DET. CHEVALLIER: There \u2014 and there are so many emotional roadblocks for you to try to believe that. I get that.",
      "HOLLY ANN ELKINS: I can't believe that my fianc\u00e9 would do something like that to a woman or to anybody, but a woman.",
      "Chevallier and Harding interviewed Elkins for about an hour, hoping to turn her into a witness for the prosecution.",
      "DET. CHEVALLIER: I'm telling you there is a side of him you do not know.",
      "But Elkins stood by Beard, insisting that he had an alibi: he was home with her when the murder took place.",
      "DET. CHEVALLIER: There are a few hours that you know he was not in that house.",
      "HOLLY ANN ELKINS: You cannot tell me that I feel that way, sir.",
      "DET. CHEVALLIER: I can \u2014 I can tell you that because I know that for a fact that he was out of the house, Holly.",
      "HOLLY ANN ELKINS: I don't know that for a fact.",
      "Elkins remained adamant that she would have known if he had left.",
      "HOLLY ANN ELKINS: I am a total stage 5 clinger girlfriend. I'm always up his ass. I find it hard to believe ...",
      "The interview ended with Elkins standing by her man. She and Beard's mom continued living together in an Airbnb. They became extremely close and bonded over their shared belief that Beard was innocent, says Bowers.",
      "Lizette Bowers: We stayed so close. We were just connected at the hip and made agreements to never go anywhere without one another.",
      "Finally, after two weeks behind bars, Beard was released on bond. Bowers was overjoyed. Elkins, as Bowers would soon discover, not so much.",
      "Lizette Bowers: They've told us he's coming home tomorrow.

What \u2014 why are you choosing now? \u2026 during this scary, scary time \u2026 for \u2014 in his life. \u2026 She'd already ordered \u2026 her \u2014 her Uber and never came back.",
      "Chevallier says he was so worried about Willow's safety he reached out to the federal government to take the case under federal firearm laws. Because an unregistered silencer was found in Beard's home, the feds agreed. Beard was rearrested eight days after he bonded out.",
      "Det. Jeremy Chevallier: Ultimately, at that point, our goal was to get him back into custody.",
      "Beard was ultimately charged with cyberstalking using a dangerous weapon resulting in death. One year and eight months after Alyssa's murder, Beard called his mother with unimaginable news.",

And it was stupidly done and he's not stupid. So it never was him.",
      "But she would learn it was him. He admitted he did it. He killed the mother of his child.",
      "Lizette Bowers: I have physically dropped to my knees, sometimes feeling like I've gotten punched in the stomach. And I have to tell myself \u2014 I have to tell myself that that was, um, a moment, a heinous, awful out-of-character broken moment.",

      "Elkins began playing her game of cat and mouse.",
      "ANDREW BEARD (FBI interview): It was made very clear to me that your previous methods aren't working, this is what you're gonna do now in order to prove that, um \u2014 that \u2014 that \u2014 that you're \u2014 basically you're worthy.",

      "In July 2023, almost three years after Alyssa's death, Holly Elkins was arrested by federal agents at the Miami Airport as she was returning from a trip to the Dominican Republic. An arrest a long time coming for Alyssa's family.",
      "Madison Grimes: I thought \u2014 we were never gonna see that happen. \u2026 I felt relief.",
      "Elkins, who pleaded not guilty, was charged with conspiracy to stalk and stalking using a dangerous weapon resulting in death. The FBI had built a compelling case against her, says Chevallier.",
      "Det. Jeremy Chevallier: Holly's phone really had a lot of stuff on it. \u2026 searching for tracking devices \u2026 there were indications that they were together, whenever the ammunition \u2026 and the knife were purchased.",
      "And they also tied Elkins to the makeup Beard used to disguise himself as a Black man.",
      "ANDREW BEARD (FBI interview): It was, um, you're going to dress \u2014 dress up as a \u2014 as a, uh, different person, essentially. You're gonna wear this dark makeup. \u2026 That was her plan \u2026 \u00a0that was how it's gonna be done.",
      "While Beard seems harmless while being questioned, never forget that he was the one who chased Alyssa down like a hunter tracking a wounded animal. He furiously stabbed her with a brutality these detectives had never seen.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Andrew ends up saying about why he came back to finish her. What did he say?",
      "Det. Jeremy Chevallier: His statement to us during the interview with Agent Hanson was that he did it out of mercy, that he knew that she was still alive, and he was somehow doing her a favor \u2026 by \u2014 by killing her.",
      "Beard may have committed the murder alone, but according to the U.S. Attorney's Office, he didn't plan it alone. In April 2024, Holly Elkins went on trial as a co-conspirator. In the courtroom where no cameras were permitted, one of the prosecutors put it like this, says Harding: \u00a0\"Andrew Beard is a monster, but he was Holly Elkins' monster.\"",

      "Sgt. Michael Harding: 100% I do \u2026 she orchestrated this whole thing.",

      "Peter Van Sant: What if these two had never come together, Holly and Andrew. Would Andrew have committed this murder?",
      "Sgt. Michael Harding: I don't think they would have. I 100% believe that if Holly and Andrew had never met that Alyssa Burkett would be alive today.",
      "After a one-week trial, the case went to the jury.",

      "Two families are left to grapple with the wreckage Elkins and Beard left behind. Lizette Bowers will forever be known as the mother of a murderer.",
      "Lizette Bowers: He killed someone. And that is beyond awful. \u2026 It's the worst thing anyone can do. But that's not who I love.",
      "And Collard and Grimes must try to make sense of a world without Alyssa in it.",
      "Madison Grimes: We don't get to live the normal life anymore. \u2026 It was always me and her \u2026 my best friend, like \u2026 that was my person, and only getting to be with her for 20 years, that's not \u2014 just not fair.",
      "After the trial, Collard was allowed to take Alyssa's things out of her car.",
      "Teresa Collard: It was pretty emotional for all of us actually \u2026 this was the mirror that she used so she could see Willow from the driver's seat ... you know, just knowing that was the last place she was sitting when it happened.",

      "Betsy Jeansonne: Yes.",
      "David Begnaud: And tried to cover it up.",
      "Betsy Jeansonne: Yes.",
      "There were questions about Dustin's alibi. Jeansonne says he told three different stories to three different people about where he was when Steve Ducote called him, but according to Megan's family, Knight never resolved those conflicting stories.",

      "According to Ducote, Dustin and the boys were living in Steve and Missy's house at the time \u2014and he didn't want his son-in-law knowing they were investigating him. So, Ducote says he asked Schaub not to talk to Dustin until they had more evidence.",

The lab found no evidence of murder, or any evidence Dustin was there when the gun went off.

He says experts from the State Police and the Jefferson Parish crime labs were going to be called by the defense and told him they would be testifying that the blood spatter on Dustin's shorts did not prove he was present when the gun went off. And then there was Megan's note to her sons. A handwriting expert hired by Steve Ducote was going to testify that it was most likely written by Megan. But Riddle says he was prepared to argue that it was not a suicide note.",

      "President Biden has given the OK to lift restrictions that will allow Ukraine to use U.S.-provided long-range weapons to strike deep into Russian territory, a U.S. official confirmed to CBS News on Sunday. The move is a significant change to U.S. policy in the ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict.",
      "The easing of restrictions would allow Kyiv to use the Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMS, to hit targets inside Russia. The move also comes as some 10,000 North Korean troops were sent to Kursk near Ukraine's northern border to help Russian forces retake territory.",

      "The U.S. decision could help Ukraine at a moment when Russian forces appear to be making gains and could put Kyiv in a better negotiating position when and if peace talks happen.",

    "story": [
      "A German soccer club is leaving X because of the increase in hate speech and disinformation on the social media platform that it claims could undermine the snap elections in the country.",
      "FC St. Pauli announced the decision on Thursday, saying billionaire owner Elon Musk has turned the platform into a \"hate machine\" since he took over the company in 2022.",
      "\"Racism and conspiracy theories are allowed to spread unchecked and even curated,\" St. Pauli said in a statement. \"Insults and threats are seldom sanctioned and are sold as freedom of speech.\"",
      "The club said it had already limited posts on X and increased \"political statements in support of diversity and inclusion to make a stand against hate.\"",
      "Named after Hamburg's St. Pauli district, the club, which plays in the Bundesliga, is known among soccer fans for its left-leaning supporter base. Fan groups often chant anti-racist slogans and promote diversity within the club.",
      "St. Pauli also underlined Musk's role in last week's U.S. presidential election, and alleged his platform could affect the outcome of the snap elections in Germany, which are scheduled to take place next February, by \"manipulating the public discourse.\"",
      "\"Musk was a major backer of the Trump campaign and also used X for this purpose,\" the club said. \"It is to be assumed that X will also promote authoritarian, misanthropic and far-right content during the forthcoming German election campaign.\"",
      "St. Pauli said it would no longer share content on X but it will not deactivate the account. The club urged supporters to follow its updates on Bluesky, an alternative social media platform that has observed a surge of new members after President-elect Donald Trump's election victory last week.",
      "Musk was a key figure in Trump's third election campaign, donating millions of dollars and promoting content for his message on X. Trump announced this week that he will be part of the cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency alongside fellow billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy, an entrepreneur who sought the Republican Party's nomination.",
      "On Nov. 6, the German coalition government collapsed after Chancellor Olaf Scholz dismissed the finance minister, who represented the pro-business Free Democratic Party. The chancellor will seek a vote of confidence at the German Bundestag in December.",
      "St. Pauli aims to migrate its nearly 250,000 followers ahead of February's snap elections in Germany in which the center-right opposition Christian Democratic Union is expected to make significant gains.",
      "The far-right Alternative for Germany party has also gained popularity. With 76 seats, it is the fifth largest party in the Bundestag. In September's Thuringian state election, the AfD became the first far-right party in Germany to have won an election since World War II.",

    "summary": "Tropical Storm Sara developed in the Caribbean on Thursday, threatening parts of Central America with life-threatening and potentially catastrophic rain.",
    "story": [
      "Tropical Storm Sara formed in the Caribbean on Thursday, becoming the 18th named storm of the 2024 Atlantic Hurricane Season. The system, previously called Tropical Depression 19, developed in the western Caribbean earlier this week and intensified while traveling westward on a path toward Central America.",
      "Sara had sustained winds of 45 mph and was located around 105 miles north-northwest of the Nicaragua-Honduras border and 105 miles east-southeast of the Honduras island of Guanaja, moving west at 10 mph, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said\u00a0in a 10 p.m. ET update. A weather system is considered a tropical storm when its sustained wind speeds reach at least 39 mph.",
      "The storm is expected to linger in the Caribbean through the weekend and slowly move into the Gulf of Mexico early next week. After that, its path is less clear. CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan said a lot of the models are now trending towards it dissipating either after it enters the Gulf of Mexico or over Mexico, but several still have it aiming towards Florida.",
      "\"Florida residents should closely monitor the forecast updates as they come in,\" Nolan advised.",
      "The Atlantic Hurricane Season\u00a0officially runs from June 1 until Nov. 30, with activity typically peaking between mid-August and mid-October. An average season brings 14 named storms, seven hurricanes, and three major hurricanes, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which did predict the 2024 season would produce \"above average\" numbers.",
      "What is the projected path of Tropical Storm Sara?",
      "Sara was forecast to move closer to the northern coast of Honduras through early Saturday and then approach Belize on Sunday, the Hurricane Center said.",
      "Sara could potentially bring catastrophic rainfall to parts of Central America. Between 10 and 20 inches of heavy rainfall are possible in Honduras early next week, forecasters warned, with up to 30 inches accumulating in some places.",
      "Forecasters at the hurricane center said they expected \"life-threatening and potentially catastrophic\" flash floods to hit Honduras and persist through the weekend. The hurricane center also warned of potentially disastrous mudslides caused by the storm, especially in the mountainous area along and near Sierra La Esperanza on the country's northeastern coast. They estimated those conditions would persist through the weekend.",
      "The rest of Honduras, Belize, El Salvador, eastern Guatemala and western Nicaragua will likely receive between 5 and 10 inches of rainfall as the storm runs its course through that region, but up to 15 inches are possible.",
      "Governments across Central America have issued various watches and warnings as people brace for Sara's effects. Honduras' northern coast and its Bay Islands were under a tropical storm warning Thursday night.",
      "Will Tropical Storm Sara become a hurricane?",
      "It remains to be seen whether Sara will grow into a hurricane. A tropical storm becomes a hurricane when its sustained winds reach at least 74 mph, making it a Category 1 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.",
      "Forecasters also cautioned residents of Belize and Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula to be ready for possible impacts of Sara early next week.",
      "Will Tropical Storm Sara hit Florida?",
      "After entering the Gulf of Mexico, some forecast models suggested the storm could make a right-hand turn and heading toward Florida by late next week, though Nolan noted that conditions can quickly change. Other models had the storm potentially heading into the central part of the Gulf and possibly dissipating.",
      "Air Force hurricane hunters that flew into the area to investigate the strength and structure of the developing weather system located Sara Thursday night along Hondruras' northeastern coast, the hurricane center said.",
      "Forecast models take in the current environmental factors along with historical data to compute \"spaghetti plots\" of where systems may track. Each model uses different computations, and the forecast track is an output of the consensus from those models.",
      "\"It is too soon to determine what impacts the system could bring to portions of the eastern Gulf of Mexico, including Florida, the Florida Keys, and Cuba during the middle portion of next week,\" the hurricane center said Thursday. \"Residents in these areas should regularly monitor updates to the forecast.\"",

      "Thick smog blanketed India's capital Thursday as the annual ritual of choking on incredibly polluted winter air took hold of New Delhi yet again.

    "summary": "India's Supreme Court has warned state authorities that bulldozing illegally constructed homes in an \"arbitrary pick and choose\" way is an abuse of their powers.",
    "story": [
      "New Delhi \u2014\u00a0India's Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that authorities demolishing illegally-constructed homes and other properties belonging to suspected criminals is unconstitutional and must cease. The practice is allegedly used widely by several state governments to punish suspects outside the court justice process, and is commonly known as \"bulldozer justice.\"",
      "\"The executive can't become a judge and decide that a person accused is guilty and, therefore, punish him by demolishing his properties. Such an act would be transgressing [the] executive's limits,\" the court said in a 95-page judgement.",
      "The court issued its ruling in response to several petitions over a spate of home demolitions targeting suspected criminals in states governed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in recent years. Critics have accused the BJP state administrations of using bulldozer justice primarily to\u00a0target Muslims \u2014 an accusation the party has repeatedly denied.",
      "BJP state officials have argued that due process of law has been followed in carrying out the demolitions, but the court said authorities had adopted a \"pick and choose\" attitude toward illegally constructed homes, singling out those belonging to Muslims suspected of other crimes while sparing similar, but non-Muslim-owned illegal dwellings in the same area.",
      "\"In such cases, where the authorities indulge in arbitrary pick and choose of structures and it is established that soon before the initiation of such an action an occupant of the structure was found to be involved in a criminal case, a presumption could be drawn that the real motive for such demolition proceedings was not the illegal structure, but an action of penalizing the accused without even trying him before the court of law,\" the court said.",
      "One of the petitions to the Supreme Court was filed over the April 2022 demolition of dozens of homes belonging largely to Muslims following sectarian clashes in Delhi's Jahangirpuri neighborhood, which drew allegations of religious discrimination and extrajudicial punishment.",
      "\"The chilling sight of a bulldozer demolishing a building\u2026 reminds one of a lawless state of affairs,\" Justices B.R. Gavai and K.V. Viswanathan said in the court's Wednesday judgment. \"Our constitutional ethos and values would not permit any such abuse of power and such misadventures cannot be tolerated by the court of law.\"",
      "The court warned state authorities it would take action against officials found guilty of \"such highhanded and arbitrary\" actions and issued detailed guidelines for the demolition of homes constructed without the required permits.",
      "The new guidelines make it mandatory for authorities to give at least 15 days' advance notice to an occupant before an illegal home is demolished and to explain the reason for the building being razed.",
      "The new guidelines state that occupiers of such properties must be given sufficient time to either remove the construction or challenge the demolition order in a court.",

      "\"Even at the darkest moments in that town, when I really didn\u2019t have anything happening, you sort of have to lie to yourself, at least a little bit, and act like this is that chapter of the story where things just aren\u2019t going right,\" Powell said.",
      "\"You have to believe in the Hollywood legends of those people that you admire, the people that you\u2019re chasing, that had those long stretches of famine as well,\" he added. \"I\u2019m very grateful about getting a chance to understand a lot about writing. I had to occupy different types of jobs that allowed me to understand how to finance things, and produce things. I started understanding a facet of this business that\u2019s really serving me right now.\"",
      "Powell, who recently produced and starred in the action comedy \"Hit Man,\" told Vanity Fair that he learned to be proactive during his early years in the business.",
      "\"I\u2019d hit random people up and I\u2019d try to drum up money for other people\u2019s shorts to turn them into features, or I\u2019d try to hunt down stuff and pitch people to get a small role in things,\" he said. \"In LA, you are really just hustling to just try to be a part of the experiment at all. People are like, \u2018Oh man, auditioning must be tough.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, 'No, auditioning is a luxury.'",
      "\"Finding an agent, finding anybody to talk to you at a damn party, having enough money to pay for headshots, these are the things that no one talks about,\" Powell continued. \"Trying to pay for acting class, and trying to get better.\"",
      "\"Auditioning feels like you\u2019re at the party. You\u2019ve gotten past the velvet rope. You may not be able to afford a drink at the party, but you\u2019re in it, you can taste it. But so often in Hollywood, most of the time you are outside that velvet rope. Most of the time the bouncer is not even allowing you anywhere in the vicinity.\"",
      "Powell said he would hide a flask in his boot because he couldn't afford to pay for drinks when he went out. (Mike Marsland/WireImage)",
      "For many years, Powell supported himself by taking on small roles in movies and making guest appearances in TV shows. However, he told Vanity Fair that changes in the industry have presented even greater challenges for up-and-coming actors.",
      "\"The business no longer supports struggling actors the way it did when I was kind of coming up,\" he said. \"I would do an episode of \u2018NCIS,\u2019 and that would keep me afloat for a year.\"",
      "However, Powell explained that he was only able to stay afloat during that time by living frugally.",

You\u2019re not necessarily able to afford anything significant in that town, but you are able to stay there. Those little jobs, like getting a commercial, keep life in the system.\"",
      "The actor's circumstances began to improve in 2014 when he landed the role of hacker Thorn in the star-studded action blockbuster \"The Expendables 3.\" Powell became a main cast member in the TV show \"Scream Queens's\" first season and returned on a recurring basis in the second season.",
      "In 2016, Powell starred as part of the ensemble cast in Richard Linklater's movie \"Everybody Wants Some!!\" Linklater and Powell reunited for \"Hit Man,\" which was directed by the Oscar-nominated filmmaker.",
      "Powell made his breakthrough when he starred alongside Tom Cruise in \"Top Gun: Maverick.\" (Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images for Paramount Pictures)",
      "He won his first role as a leading man in the 2018 Netflix romantic comedy \"Set It Up\" opposite Zoey Deutch. Powell went on to play Lt. Jake 'Hangman' Seresin in the highly-anticipated \"Top Gun\" sequel \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" starring Tom Cruise.",

      "While speaking with Vanity Fair, Powell reflected on staying true to himself while navigating fame.",
      "\"I\u2019ve failed for a lot longer than I\u2019ve succeeded,\" he said. \"I\u2019ve really gotten a chance to see other people do it. And what I realized is, I think the trap is trying to fit into the mold of something like that where it\u2019s inauthentic.\"",

      "\"Little confused by that myself,\" another responded. \"I thought if the answer was a word in a title, the answer needed to be the title word, not a version thereof.\"",

      "\"My interpretation of this ruling is: If the clue specifically wanted the full title and he wrote \u2018My Heart\u2019s in the Highland\u2019, that would be incorrect. But since they just wanted the word rather than the full title, they\u2019ll take singular or plural.\"",

(turns out that phrase actually comes from a Wordsworth poem, so swing and a miss) Which to go with? I figured with FJ, they can't ask me to be more specific, so less is more and I'll leave the judges to decide, and this time I got lucky. They didn't have to stop and confer; it pretty much played out as you saw it so they must have anticipated that potential answer.\"",

      "But one enterprising North Carolina lawmaker thinks his minority party should look across the pond to the United Kingdom for the answer to \"go toe to toe\" with Trump. Rep. WIley Nickels, D-N.C., has proposed that Democrats create a \"shadow cabinet\" to organize the opposition and challenge each decision by the government.",
      "\"Across the Atlantic, the British have something we don\u2019t: a team from the opposition that mirrors the government\u2019s cabinet members. They watch the cabinet closely, publicly challenging, scrutinizing and offering new ideas. It\u2019s another form of checks and balances \u2014 a quiet guardrail that keeps power accountable,\" Wiley argues in an op-ed for the Washington Post.",
      "His proposal is to appoint 26 Democratic leaders in Congress to mirror Trump's Cabinet-level officials and challenge each initiative of the incoming administration. Sen.-elect Adam Schiff, D-Calif., for instance, could be a shadow attorney general who would call out Trump's efforts to replace career Justice Department attorneys with those loyal to the president. Or Rep. Gregory W. Meeks, D-N.Y., might be a shadow Secretary of State who would loudly oppose potential action by the Trump administration that would decrease support for Ukraine in its war with Russia.",

      "\"We have to step up our game. We have to go toe to toe with Trump. And it's not just about saying, you know what, what we're against. It's about saying what we're for and putting our best messengers out there,\" Nickel told CNN's Laura Coates in a recent interview.",
      "In the U.K., a shadow cabinet is a team of opposition leaders that reflect the ruling party's cabinet members. The shadow cabinet has a counterpart for every minister in the ruling coalition's government.",

      "There are key differences between the U.S. and U.K. governments that might complicate this idea. The most obvious being that the U.K. uses a parliamentary system, where multiple parties form coalition governments as opposed to the dual party system Americans have. The U.K. prime minister is the head of government and leads the Cabinet, which exercises the executive power.",
      "The American founders intentionally created a different system. The U.S. Constitution invests the legislative power in Congress and the authority to enforce laws in the Executive Branch, which is led by the president.

      "\"This is about putting a point person for advocacy groups, for the public, a lead messenger \u2026 we need to organize our opposition,\" Nickel said. \"We can do our own American version of a [shadow cabinet] that will help Democrats do the thing we didn\u2019t do, which is get out our positive message and talk about the things that folks are rightly concerned about.\"",

      "2. Use a VPN: A virtual private network (VPN) encrypts your internet traffic, making it harder for hackers, ISPs or other third parties to track your online activity and searches.

    "story": [
      "A VPN could be your secret weapon to protect your identity and finances.",
      "Many people turn to VPNs \u2014 virtual private networks \u2014 for added privacy and security online, only to find that their internet speeds suddenly slow to a crawl. But what exactly does a VPN do, and why might it cause this slowdown?",
      "A VPN works by creating a secure, encrypted pathway between your device and the internet, keeping your data private from hackers, advertisers and anyone else trying to monitor your activity. This encryption process also allows you to browse as if you\u2019re in a different location, which can help access content that may be restricted where you are.",

VPNs are fantastic tools for safeguarding data and unlocking restricted content, but that extra layer of protection and location masking can sometimes slow things down. The good news? There are several ways to keep your VPN running smoothly without sacrificing security.\u00a0 Let's dive in.",
      "A woman using a VPN on her laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Make sure it's actually the VPN",
      "Before we blame the VPN, let's make sure it's really the culprit. Here's a quick test:",
      "1. Disconnect from your VPN: Close your VPN application completely or turn off the VPN connection in your device settings.",
      "2. Run a speed test at Speedtest.net and note the results: Click the \"Go\" button and wait for the test to complete. Write down your download and upload speeds, as well as the ping.",
      "3. Connect to your VPN: Open your VPN application and connect to your preferred server. Wait until the connection is fully established.",
      "4. Run the speed test again: Refresh the Speedtest.net page to ensure it detects your new location, then run the test again. Note down the new results.",
      "If your VPN-connected speeds are less than about 60% of your normal speeds, then Houston, we have a VPN problem. If the difference is minimal, you may just need to optimize your base internet connection first.",

      "TOP 6 HIDDEN WAYS A VPN CAN SAVE YOU MONEY NOW",
      "Fixing VPN speed issues",
      "When encountering slow speeds while using a VPN, it's crucial to approach the problem systematically. Assuming the VPN is indeed the bottleneck in your connection, there are several steps you can employ to potentially boost your speeds and improve your overall experience.",
      "The physical distance between you and the VPN server location plays a significant role in connection speeds. Opting for a server closer to your geographical location can often result in a noticeable improvement. If you need to connect to a specific country for content access or other reasons, experiment with different cities within that country. Many VPN providers offer multiple server options in popular locations. Additionally, some VPNs display server load information, which can be incredibly useful. Connecting to a less crowded server typically yields faster speeds, as you're sharing fewer resources with other users.",
      "CLICK HERE FOR MORE U.S. NEWS",
      "Various server locations available on VPN. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Adjusting your VPN settings can lead to performance enhancements. If your VPN service allows for customization, consider lowering the encryption level from 256-bit to 128-bit AES. While 256-bit encryption is incredibly secure, it can sometimes impact speed. The 128-bit AES encryption is still considered very secure for most purposes and may offer a speed boost. Another setting to look for is the WireGuard protocol. If your VPN provider offers this newer protocol, enabling it could significantly improve your connection speed, as it's designed to be both faster and more efficient than older protocols. For those using the OpenVPN protocol, switching from TCP to UDP can often result in faster speeds. However, approach these changes cautiously, especially if you're not entirely sure about their implications. Avoid disabling critical security features in your quest for speed.",
      "Different protocols offer varying levels of speed and security. Generally, protocols like PPTP, L2TP and IKEv2 are known for their speed but may not provide the highest level of security. OpenVPN is often the default choice as it strikes a good balance between speed and security. If you decide to stick with OpenVPN, which is recommended for most users, try switching from TCP to UDP. This simple change can potentially provide a noticeable speed boost without compromising security.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Keeping your VPN application up to date is essential for ensuring optimal performance and security. VPN providers frequently release updates that not only enhance the overall functionality of their software but also address any bugs or vulnerabilities that may have been discovered. An outdated VPN app can lead to compatibility issues with your operating system, which can hinder performance and reduce connection speeds. Therefore, it is advisable to regularly check for updates within your VPN app's settings or visit the provider's official website to download the latest version. Additionally, many VPN services offer an automatic update feature, which you should enable to ensure that you are always using the most current version of the software without having to remember to do it manually.",
      "To improve your VPN speed, it is important to minimize the load on your device by closing unnecessary applications running in the background. Many applications consume bandwidth and processing power, which can significantly affect your VPN's performance. For instance, streaming services, file-sharing programs or even software that automatically updates can slow down your connection. Before connecting to your VPN, take a moment to close these apps and consider disabling any auto-sync features temporarily.\u00a0Also, restarting your device before initiating a VPN connection is also a good practice, as it clears temporary files and frees up memory, allowing for a smoother experience.",
      "If you have tried various troubleshooting methods and your current VPN service still fails to deliver satisfactory speeds, it may be time to explore other options. The market is filled with numerous VPN providers that emphasize speed and reliability, so conducting thorough research is essential. Look for services that boast a large network of servers strategically located around the world, as this can significantly enhance connection speeds. Many top-tier VPN providers offer free trials or money-back guarantees, allowing you to test their performance without any financial risk. When evaluating potential new services, consider not only their speed but also their security features, privacy policies and customer support options. By making an informed choice, you can find a VPN that meets both your speed requirements and security needs effectively.",
      "Remember, while these strategies can help optimize your VPN speed, it's important to have realistic expectations. Your base internet speed, provided by your internet service provider (ISP), will always be the ultimate limiting factor. No VPN can make your connection faster than the maximum speed your ISP provides. However, by implementing these techniques, you can ensure that you're getting the most out of your VPN connection and minimizing any unnecessary slowdowns.",

      "According to French\u00a0cybersecurity company Sekoia, it all starts with an email containing a link to a Google Meet. The email can come from any address and may be socially engineered to look like it's related to your organization. It could link to a Google Meet invite for a meeting, webinar, online collaboration or something similar. When you click on the link, you\u2019ll be directed to a fake Google Meet page, which will soon display a warning claiming there\u2019s an issue with your PC. It might say your microphone or camera isn't working or there's a problem with your headset.",

Once the code is on your computer, hackers can gain access to your cryptocurrencies, sensitive files and personal information.",

If you call any phone number they provide you, they will also connect your phone number with your email address so they can continue to update their information on you.",

    "summary": "Kurt \u201cCyberGuy&quot; Knutsson says there\u2019s been a rise in cybercriminal services using hacked police and government emails to send subpoenas and data requests to U.S. companies.",
    "story": [
      "Scammers often ask for answers to secret questions for crucial information needed to access accounts.",
      "Phishing emails are one of the most common tricks scammers use, but they\u2019re usually easy to catch if you pay attention. Awkward grammar, random details and, most importantly, an unofficial email address are dead giveaways. For example, you might get an email saying your Apple ID\u2019s been disabled, but the sender\u2019s email won\u2019t actually be from Apple. Now, though, scammers are finding ways to get around this.",
      "According to the FBI, there\u2019s been a recent rise in cybercriminal services using hacked police and government email accounts to send fake subpoenas and data requests to U.S.-based tech companies.",
      "I\u2019M GIVING AWAY A $500 GIFT CARD FOR THE HOLIDAYSEnter by\u00a0signing up for my free newsletter!",
      "Illustration of a scammer at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "The\u00a0FBI has seen a spike in criminal forum posts about emergency data requests and stolen email credentials from police departments and government agencies. Cybercriminals are getting into compromised U.S. and foreign government email accounts and using them to send fake emergency data requests to U.S.-based companies, which exposes customer data for further misuse in other crimes.",
      "In August 2024, a popular cybercriminal on an online forum advertised \"high-quality .gov emails\" for sale, meant for espionage, social engineering, data extortion, emergency data requests and more. The listing even included U.S. credentials, and the seller claimed they could guide buyers on making emergency data requests and even sell real stolen subpoena documents to help them pose as law enforcement.",
      "Another cybercriminal boasted about owning government emails from over 25 countries. They claimed anyone can use these emails to send a subpoena to a tech company and get access to usernames, emails, phone numbers and other personal client info. Some con artists are even hosting a \"masterclass\" on how to create and submit their own emergency data requests to pull data on any social media account, charging $100 for the full rundown.",
      "Illustration of a scammer at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "WINDOWS FLAW LETS HACKERS SNEAK INTO YOUR PC OVER WI-FI",
      "How this phishing scam works",
      "When law enforcement, whether federal, state or local, wants information about someone\u2019s account at a tech company, like their email address or other account details, they typically need a warrant, subpoena or court order. When a tech company receives one of these requests from an official email address, they\u2019re required to comply. So, if a scammer gets access to a government email, they can fake a subpoena and get information on just about anyone.",
      "To bypass verification, scammers often send emergency data requests, claiming that someone\u2019s life is at risk and that the data is needed urgently. Because companies don\u2019t want to delay in case of an actual emergency, they may hand over the information, even if the request turns out to be fake. By portraying it as a life-or-death situation, scammers make it harder for companies to take time to verify the request.",
      "For example, the FBI reported that earlier this year, a known cybercriminal posted pictures on an online forum of a fake emergency data request they\u2019d sent to PayPal. The scammer tried to make it look legitimate by using a fraudulent mutual legal assistance treaty, claiming it was part of a local investigation into child trafficking, complete with a case number and legal code for verification. However, PayPal recognized that it wasn\u2019t a real law enforcement request and denied it.",

      "CYBERSCAMMERS USE AI TO MANIPULATE GOOGLE SEARCH RESULTS",
      "What can companies do to avoid falling for these phishing scams?",
      "1) Verify all data requests: Before sharing sensitive information, companies should verify every data request, even those that look legitimate. Establish a protocol for confirming requests directly with the agency or organization that supposedly sent them.",
      "2) Strengthen email security:\u00a0Use email authentication protocols like DMARC, SPF and DKIM to block emails from unauthorized sources. Implement anti-phishing filters to detect suspicious content in messages.",
      "3) Train employees on phishing awareness: Regular training sessions on phishing scams can help employees recognize red flags, such as urgent language, unusual requests or emails from unknown addresses. Employees should be encouraged to report suspicious emails.",
      "4) Limit access to sensitive data: Restrict who can view or share sensitive customer data. Fewer people with access means fewer chances for accidental or intentional data leaks.",
      "5) Implement emergency verification procedures: Have a clear verification process in place for \"emergency\" data requests, including steps for double-checking with higher management or legal teams before responding to any urgent request for customer information.",
      "Illustration of a scammer at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Is there something you need to do?",
      "This particular phishing scam mostly targets big tech companies, so there\u2019s not much you can do directly. However, it\u2019s a reminder that you shouldn\u2019t automatically trust an email, even if it comes from a .gov address. Here are some steps you can take to stay safe.",
      "1) Double-check email addresses and links: Even if an email looks official, take a moment to check the sender\u2019s email address and hover over any links to see where they actually lead. Be cautious if anything looks off. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Use\u00a02FA for all sensitive accounts. This extra layer of security helps protect you even if your login credentials are compromised.",
      "3) Stay updated on phishing scams:\u00a0Keep an eye on the latest phishing tactics, so you know what to look out for. Regular updates help you spot new types of scams before they affect you.",
      "4) Verify suspicious requests:\u00a0If you get an unexpected email asking for sensitive info, contact the sender directly through an official channel to confirm the request.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Scammers are taking phishing emails to a whole new level. I often recommend checking the email carefully when you receive anything suspicious to see if it\u2019s legit. But now, since scammers can even access government emails, you need to be extra cautious. This phishing scam seems to target mostly big tech companies, so it\u2019s on them to strengthen their security and verify every request thoroughly before sharing any user information. It's also up to governments worldwide to protect their digital assets from being compromised.",

The most effective solution seems to be using Siri Shortcuts or Voice Control, as these methods create unique commands that are less likely to be misinterpreted across devices. It's worth noting that voice assistant technology is continually improving. In the future, we may see more sophisticated context recognition that can better distinguish between similar names on different devices. Until then, these workarounds should help Mike avoid any more awkward explanations to his colleague Terry!",

    "summary": "Shameless scammers trick veterans into giving personal info or cash. Tech expert Kurt \u201cCyberGuy&quot; Knutsson explores five common scams.",
    "story": [
      "Chef Robert Irvine of the Robert Irvine Foundation speaks with Fox News Digital about the importance of supporting veterans and first responders this Veterans Day and some unique ways to do so.",
      "Cyberscammers are some of the most heartless people out there. They don\u2019t even spare our military heroes.",
      "Last year, these criminals stole $477 million from veterans, military personnel and their spouses, according to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). That\u2019s a $63 million jump from 2022, showing that the military community is a big target for scammers. The number of military members who lost money to these attacks went up by 7% to 30,948, per the FTC\u2019s latest data.",
      "These scammers use all kinds of tricks to get veterans to hand over personal info or hard-earned cash, including veterans' benefit scams and IRS scams. I break down five of the most common scams targeting our military heroes and how to stay safe from them.",
      "I\u2019M GIVING AWAY A $500 GIFT CARD FOR THE HOLIDAYSEnter by\u00a0signing up for my free newsletter!",
      "Image of military personnel (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Romance scams",
      "Romance scams have become an increasingly painful reality for veterans, as scammers target them through fake online relationships to exploit their emotions and financial stability. Often, these scammers pose as attractive, understanding individuals on dating apps, social media platforms or even support forums specifically tailored for veterans. They\u2019ll build a relationship over weeks or months, using flattery and fabricated stories to create a strong emotional connection with their target.",
      "Once the scammer believes they\u2019ve gained enough trust, they\u2019ll ask for money, typically by inventing a sudden, urgent situation. It might be a \"medical emergency,\" a supposed travel expense to come to visit or even a claim that they need help with a legal matter. The requests start small but can quickly escalate as the scammer continues to manipulate the victim's emotions.",
      "This continues to be the most common fraud targeting veterans, costing them and their families over $40 million in 2020, according to Aura. Among all romance scam victims, those ages 50-69 were hit the hardest, losing $179.65 million in just the first three quarters of 2022. That figure has almost certainly surged in 2024.",
      "Image of military personnel supporting one another (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "NEARLY 1 MILLION MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES FACE DATA BREACH",
      "Veterans benefit scams",
      "Some scammers pretend to offer help with veterans' benefits. They promise to help increase benefits or expedite claims, but they\u2019re really after personal information or a fee. A scammer might claim you\u2019re eligible for new or additional benefits, contacting you by phone, email or text. When dealing with unsolicited advice, remember that if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Phishing scams from fake government agencies",
      "Phishing scams are a social engineering trick where scammers send emails that look like they\u2019re from official places, like the government or your bank. These legit-looking emails act as bait, but the real goal is to grab your banking or credit card info.",
      "Sometimes, these scam emails will ask you to click a link or download an attachment, which can install malware on your device. Scammers are also known to send phishing links through LinkedIn, Facebook or other social media.",
      "One classic example is the IRS scam. Though it targets everyone, military members are prime targets. Scammers pretend to be IRS agents, threatening jail time, fines or other penalties if they don\u2019t get immediate payment. They even spoof IRS caller IDs to make their calls look real.",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "Rental property scams",
      "Rental property scams are a common way scammers try to exploit people looking for a place to rent. In these scams, fraudsters often post fake listings for apartments or houses on popular rental websites or social media platforms. The listing might look too good to be true, like a beautiful place at an unbelievably low price.",
      "The scammer will usually claim to be out of town or unavailable to meet in person, asking potential renters to send a deposit or rent payment upfront to \"secure\" the property. In some cases, they may even send fake lease agreements or claim that the property is already rented, but they can still \"help\" find a similar place.",
      "BEWARE OF THIS SOCIAL SECURITY SCAM BY CROOKS TRYING TO TRICK YOU",
      "Car sales and financing scams",
      "Car sales and financing scams targeting veterans are unfortunately common. Scammers know that veterans may have limited experience with certain financial deals, so they exploit that by offering unrealistic car sales or financing options. These scams can take various forms, and the result is often financial loss and stress.",
      "Image of military personnel honoring our troops (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "6 ways veterans can protect themselves from scams",
      "1) Be cautious with unsolicited offers: Whether it\u2019s a phone call, email or text, if someone claims to offer help with veterans' benefits or promises something too good to be true, don\u2019t take the bait. Verify the legitimacy of any offer directly through official channels like the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) or trusted veteran organizations.",
      "2) Watch out for emotional manipulation in online relationships: Romance scammers often prey on veterans' emotions. Avoid sharing personal or financial details with people you meet online, especially if the relationship feels rushed or too perfect. If someone asks for money after just a few weeks or months, it\u2019s likely a scam.",
      "3) Verify government communications: Scammers often impersonate government agencies like the IRS or VA. If you get a message that threatens penalties or asks for personal information, don\u2019t respond. Instead, contact the agency directly using official contact details to confirm whether the message is legitimate.",
      "4) Be skeptical of rental or car sale deals that seem too good to be true: If a rental listing or car sale seems too cheap or perfect to be true, it probably is. Always visit the property or dealership in person, and never send money upfront without seeing the product or having a signed agreement.",
      "5) Protect your personal information: Avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from unknown sources. Scammers use phishing emails and fake websites to steal personal and financial information. Ensure your devices have updated security software and be extra cautious when handling sensitive data online.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6)\u00a0Invest in data removal services: Consider using data removal services to protect your personal information from being harvested by scammers. These services can help remove your data from public databases and people-search websites, reducing the risk of identity theft and unwanted solicitations.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Scammers rely on misinformation to trick you. However, by staying informed and being extra careful when navigating the internet, you can stay safe. These bad actors are constantly finding new ways to target veterans, from romance scams to fake government offers. Being cautious, verifying offers and keeping your data secure are the best ways to avoid falling victim to these heartless fraudsters.",

      "\"Kill List\" follows Carl Miller's saga investigating a fake hitman-for-hire site on the dark web. (Wondery)",
      "The series covers some of the 175 kill orders that Miller\u2019s team turned over to police, The Hollywood Reporter said. According to the outlet, that information has led to 32 convictions and over 150 years of prison time.",
      "\"Some of these kill orders would go on, page after page,\" Miller recalled. \"The instructions were really practical, like, \u2018The target tends to leave at this time in the morning. This is their car and this is where they work. Be careful, they have a dog.\u2019 There were lots of instructions about how to get the hit done.",
      "\"It also moved to justifications for why the person needs to die,\" he shared. \"We had to comb through these carefully because they were our best clues as to who might be taking out the order. \u2026 It is a very difficult thing to do, peering straight into the mind of someone who wants \u2026 someone else killed. And that is not a place that I think most people have to confront in their day-to-day lives.\"",
      "Carl Miller, a U.K.-based tech journalist, is the host of \"Kill List.\" (Wondery)",
      "The saga began in 2020 when Chris Monteiro, an IT technician and hacker, was browsing the site and found a security vulnerability that gave him complete access to it, The Guardian reported. According to the outlet, he found a \"kill list,\" a spreadsheet listing hundreds of people from all over the world whom clients wanted eliminated.",
      "\"We were intending to do a podcast, which was supposed to look back at dark net assassinations over the last few years,\" Miller explained. \"We didn\u2019t anticipate it, but Chris began to send us these live kill orders. Most of the story of the podcast is us scrambling to try and deal with all of that, trying to make sense of it and trying to react in a responsible way.\"",
      "With Monteiro\u2019s help, Miller was able to review private messages between clients and the website\u2019s owner. According to The Guardian, the website was a scam run by a Romanian crook who had no intention of providing the sinister services. Instead, the fraudster pocketed the payment.",

      "\"People believed the site was real, and it isn\u2019t,\" Miller explained. \"The hitman-for-hire site is not sending out assassins. It has no interest in sending out assassins. The Romanian cybercriminals have an interest in taking the money from the perpetrators \u2014 that\u2019s all. And we realized that very early on. As soon as we started intercepting these kill orders, we could read that none of the assassinations were happening.",
      "\"If they were real assassins, they were the most incompetent assassins you would ever come across,\" Miller added. \"They kept getting lost, they\u2019d lose their gun, the target would be too well protected or they would be in a different country. These were just beyond incompetent because there was no hitman. The Romanian cybercriminals were just trying to extort as much money as they could. And, then, they would just ignore the person from then on.",

      "The price for death varied, said Miller.",
      "\"There was a case in the U.K., a love triangle,\" he explained. \"There was a manager in a store who was having an affair with two employees. One of those employees tried to kill the other one. The order was only for about 100 pounds ($126.38). That\u2019s the smallest that we saw. But then there was a U.S. doctor who paid over $50,000 for the hit. We saw everything in between. There were a lot of orders in the $10K-$40K range.\"",

      "\"I think they were worried that I was mad,\" said Miller. \"Once they were convinced that I was not, in fact, mad, they took it seriously. But the problem was that these orders were spread all over the world. We had cases in Russia, Finland, Spain, the U.S. \u2026 We were laughed out of a police station in Spain. That\u2019s on tape, police laughing at us.",
      "\"In America, police told one of the targets that he thought we were the scammers. In Switzerland, the police told one of the targets they suspected we were running the site for a story. There was no evidence that any of that was true.",
      "\"I would say that was probably the lowest and most difficult time in this whole investigation for us.\"",
      "When Miller and his team felt they weren\u2019t being taken seriously by police, they reached out to the targets themselves in hopes of warning them. They were also willing to provide the targets with whatever they needed to inform law enforcement.",

      "\"It\u2019s very unusual to step out of a normal role as a journalist,\" said Miller. \"Journalists report. They wait. They watch. But they don\u2019t step in. And I think if there was any other way of us intervening in another way that would have kept these people safe, we would have done that first. But we could not think of any other way that would\u2019ve been effective. \u2026 You had the Romanian cybercriminals that were trying to stay hidden from us, but you also had police who weren\u2019t believing us. \u2026 That\u2019s why we did it.\"",
      "At first, Miller was worried about reaching out to the targets, wondering if those who would want them taken out would panic and \"take matters into their own hands.\" He also didn\u2019t want those on the receiving end to \"go into a panic attack.\"",

One of the women I spoke to was so unruffled by the news that she didn\u2019t even change her plans for the evening. She went to see her friend who lives right next to her estranged husband.",
      "\"One guy from Wisconsin asked very reasonable questions. But when we spoke to him a week later, he told me that he was surrounded by a constant sense of unsafety.

    "published": "Sun, 17 Nov 2024 04:00:50 -0500",
    "summary": "Following Trump\u2019s victory, the Mexican government, led by President Claudia Sheinbaum, is considering reassessing some of its policies to navigate the anticipated challenges.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News' Brooke Singman reports the latest on the president-elect's Cabinet picks.",
      "Mexico City - President Claudia Sheinbaum\u2019s administration is considering adjusting certain policies in response to the anticipated challenges posed by President-elect Trump\u2019s return to office, seeking to safeguard Mexico\u2019s economic interests and manage immigration effectively.",
      "Fearing that measures from the coming Trump administration might be harmful to Mexico, Sheinbaum and other officials have expressed a commitment to maintaining a positive bilateral relationship while emphasizing Mexico\u2019s sovereignty. At a recent press conference, she reassured Mexicans that there is \"no reason for concern\" regarding the election outcome, indicating confidence in the stability of bilateral relations. \"We will work with dialogue and respect for our sovereignties,\" she said.",
      "Rodrigo Montes de Oca, a scholar at the Baker Institute Center for the U.S. and Mexico, talked to Fox News Digital and said that \"the bilateral relationship will no longer be reduced to a single issue but will be addressed in a broader manner.\" He explained that \"former President L\u00f3pez Obrador \u2013 AMLO, was very skillful in being able to concentrate the entire bilateral relationship on a single issue: immigration.",
      "MIGRANT CENTER LEADER HOPES TRUMP DOESN'T BRING BACK 'REMAIN IN MEXICO'",
      "He continued, \"If AMLO cooperated on immigration, the Biden administration turned the other way on important issues such as security and fentanyl trafficking and all the antidemocratic policies that Mexico was and is promoting. Now with the coming Trump administration, everything is going to be much more complex because they will not only focus on immigration but also on trade and security. That is why Trump went so far as to say during the campaign that if Mexico did not cooperate on these issues, he would make public the U.S. government's intelligence information on politicians in Mexico who are related to drug cartels. The relationship is going to be approached in a more comprehensive way. I don't see that the Mexican government is preparing for that.\"",
      "With Trump\u2019s plans for mass deportations and more immigration controls, Mexico is expected to strengthen its immigration policies. This may involve increased enforcement at its southern border and expanded cooperation with U.S. authorities to manage migration flows effectively. Such measures aim to address U.S. concerns while upholding Mexico\u2019s sovereignty and humanitarian commitments.",
      "Sheinbaum has continued Mexico\u2019s existing strategies to manage and discourage migrant caravans traveling toward the United States. These measures include the deployment of the National Guard and other security forces to intercept and disperse migrant groups at the southern border. This approach aims to prevent large caravans from forming and progressing northward.",
      "INCOMING LEFT-WING MEXICAN PRESIDENT COULD BE 'BAD NEWS' FOR US ON BORDER CRISIS: EXPERT",
      "The Mexican government has organized flights to repatriate migrants to their countries of origin, seeking to reduce the number of individuals attempting to cross Mexico en route to the U.S. Mexico continues to work closely with U.S. authorities to manage migration flows, including accepting certain deported migrants and implementing policies to control the surge of individuals seeking entry into the United States.",
      "Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs on Mexican exports, particularly in the automotive sector, have prompted Mexico to consider reciprocal measures. Economy Minister Marcelo Ebrard indicated that Mexico might impose its own tariffs on U.S. imports if such U.S. tariffs are enacted, emphasizing the potential economic repercussions for both nations.",
      "Montes de Oca told Fox News Digital that \"Mexico needs to prepare a comprehensive plan to address the current violence in the country; otherwise, it may face economic repercussions that could affect the renegotiation of the USMCA trade deal in 2026.\"\u00a0 In response to Trump\u2019s previous threats of military action against drug cartels, Mexico might enhance its security strategies to mitigate the risk of unilateral U.S. interventions, which the Mexican government fears.",

      "The president of the Mexican Senate, Gerardo Fern\u00e1ndez Noro\u00f1a, said, \"Donald Trump is a difficult guy, but he does not eat fire, he knows very well the importance of the relationship with our country, he knows very well the importance of the Mexican community in the United States and that he had very important support from Mexicans during the election.\" He added, \"Claudia Sheinbaum has the ability, firmness, character, preparation and the popular support to get along with him correctly.\"",
      "Mexican Congressman Ra\u00fal Torres told Fox News Digital: \"Claudia Sheinbaum's administration will have to reinforce the security strategy on the southern border by deploying the National Guard and strengthening the presence of the National Migration Institute. Likewise, she must change the narrative and a new way of negotiating with the U.S. given the upcoming negotiation of the USMCA trade deal. She must put at the center an economic agenda to empower Mexicans in the United States, whose weight is increasing every day since many of them open businesses, generate jobs and voted for Donald Trump.\"",

      "Experts consider it is still early and uncertain to know the extent to which Sheinbaum\u2019s government will be open to changing certain positions and policies to benefit the relationship with the United States. Mainly in security, they predict, since her predecessor preferred to protect criminal groups instead of fighting them. She promised continuity in everything, and security policy could be the point of most tension with the coming Trump administration.",

      "\"Make the wise choice,\" he cautioned. \"Keep exploring the right way for two major countries to get along well with each other.\"",
      "Without mentioning Trump\u2019s name, Xi appeared to signal his concern that the incoming president\u2019s protectionist rhetoric on the campaign trail could send the U.S.-China relationship into another valley.",
      "\"China is ready to work with a new U.S. administration to maintain communication, expand cooperation and manage differences so as to strive for a steady transition of the China-U.S. relationship for the benefit of the two peoples,\" Xi said through an interpreter.",

      "Xi, who is firmly entrenched atop China\u2019s political hierarchy, spoke forcefully in his brief remarks before reporters. Biden, who is winding down more than 50 years of public service, talked in broader brushstrokes about where the relationship between the two countries has gone.",
      "He reflected not just on the past four years but on the decades the two have known each other.",
      "\"We haven\u2019t always agreed, but our conversations have always been candid and always been frank. We\u2019ve never kidded one another,\" Biden said. \"These conversations prevent miscalculations, and they ensure the competition between our two countries will not veer into conflict.\"",
      "Biden urged Xi to dissuade North Korea from further deepening its support for Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine. The leaders, with top aides surrounding them, gathered around a long rectangle of tables in an expansive conference room at a Lima hotel.",
      "They had much to discuss, including China\u2019s indirect support for Russia, human rights issues, technology and Taiwan, the self-ruled democracy that Beijing claims as its own. On artificial intelligence, the two agreed on the need to maintain human control over the decision to use nuclear weapons and more broadly improve safety and international cooperation of the rapidly expanding technology.",

      "In a congratulatory message to Trump after his victory over Vice President Kamala Harris, Xi called for the U.S. and China to manage their differences and get along in a new era. In front of cameras Saturday, Xi spoke to Biden \u2014 but it was unmistakable that his message was directed at Trump.",
      "\"In a major flourishing sci-tech revolution, neither decoupling nor supply chain disruption is a solution,\" Xi said. \"Only mutual, beneficial cooperation can lead to common development. \u2018Small yard, high fence\u2019 is not what a major country should pursue.\"",
      "Biden administration officials have said they would advise the Trump team that managing the intense competition with Beijing will likely be the most significant foreign policy challenge they will face.",
      "On Saturday, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Biden had reinforced to Xi \"that these next two months are a time of transition\" and that the president would like to pass off the U.S.-China relationship \"in stable terms\" to the new administration.",
      "Biden has viewed his relationship with Xi as among the most consequential on the international stage and put much effort into cultivating it. The two first got to know each other on travels across the U.S. and China when both were vice presidents, interactions that both have said left a lasting impression. They last met a year ago on the APEC sidelines in Northern California.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping meets with President Joe Biden during a bilateral meeting, Saturday, in Lima, Peru.\u00a0 (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)",

      "Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., on Sunday defended Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s choice to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, saying that Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic, is \u201cextremely intelligent when it comes to\u201d vaccines and questioned levels of autism in the United States.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve sat down and had a long conversation with [Kennedy], and I actually find the guy extremely intelligent when it comes to this stuff. And some of this stuff does raise a lot of questions,\u201d Mullin told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d when asked whether Kennedy\u2019s history of questioning the efficacy of vaccines is a deal-breaker for the Oklahoma senator.",
      "\u201cI have said that there\u2019s some positives to vaccinations. I\u2019ve also questioned the vaccines multiple times, and I think they should be questioned,\u201d Mullin told moderator Kristen Welker before baselessly linking vaccines to autism, something that Kennedy has repeatedly done for years, even though there is no evidence that vaccines cause the condition.",
      "\u201cFor instance, why is America highest in autism? What is causing that? Is it our diet, or is it some of the stuff we\u2019re putting in our children\u2019s system?\u201c Mullin said, adding: \u201cWhat is causing that? And if it isn\u2019t vaccines, there\u2019s nothing wrong with actually taking a hard look and finding out, is that\u2019s what\u2019s causing it? Is it something else that we\u2019re putting in our systems? We do know we\u2019re not as healthy as we should be right now.\u201d",
      "While it is true that autism spectrum disorder has been diagnosed at increasing levels \u201cmost years since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began tracking ASD in 2000,\u201d according to the CDC, the agency notes that \u201cthe studies continue to show that vaccines are\u00a0not\u00a0associated with ASD.\u201d",
      "The agency points to two studies, one from the National Academy of Medicine and one from the CDC that found that vaccines do not cause autism. The first reviewed the safety of eight individual vaccines for children and adults. The second study reviewed antigens given to children during the first two years of life. Both studies found that vaccines are safe and do not cause autism.",
      "Kennedy has a long history of baselessly questioning the efficacy of vaccines and has also promoted conspiracy theories about fluoride, heavy metals in food and pesticides.",
      "Mullin also spoke on Sunday about some of Trump\u2019s other cabinet nominees, like former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who was nominated to be the next attorney general, and Fox News host Pete Hegseth, who was selected to be the next secretary of defense.",
      "Mullin agreed that he and Gaetz, who once served together in the House, \u201chave had our differences,\u201d but he added, \u201cMoving forward, I do, I do respect President Trump\u2019s right to appoint these individuals. But underneath Article Two, Section Two [of the U.S. Constitution], Congress has to advise and consent, and Matt Gaetz is going to go through the same scrutiny as every other individual, and I\u2019m going to give him a fair shot, just like every individual.\u201d",
      "Gaetz has long faced scrutiny from his colleagues and outsiders about\u00a0a years-long federal investigation launched by the Department of Justice, looking into allegations that he may have been involved in human trafficking or had sex with a minor.",
      "Gaetz has denied the allegations and the investigation ended with the Justice Department opting not to charge him.",
      "The House Ethics Committee launched its own investigation into Gaetz, but with his resignation from the House this week, it is unclear whether their report will ever be publicly released.",
      "Several senators, on both sides of the aisle,\u00a0have asked to see the report\u00a0as they consider how to vote on Gaetz\u2019s nomination and others still are skeptical that Gaetz will ever garner enough votes to be confirmed.",
      "Last week, an attorney for the 17-year-old who said she had sex with Gaetz while she was a minor called on the committee to release,\u00a0writing in a post on X\u00a0that \u201cshe was a high school student and there were witnesses\u201d when the alleged incident occurred.",
      "Also last week, a lawyer for another woman interviewed by the committee\u00a0said that his client\u00a0\u201ctestified to the House Ethics Committee\u00a0that she witnessed Rep. Gaetz having sex with a minor at a house party in Orlando in 2017.\u201d",
      "On Sunday, Mullin told Welker that the findings in the report \u201cshould be definitely part of our decision making\u201d as the Senate weighs whether to confirm Gaetz.",
      "\u201cI believe the, I believe the Senate should have access to that. Now, should it be released to the public or not? That, that\u2019s, I guess that will be part of the negotiations, but that should be definitely part of our decision making,\u201d Mullin said.",
      "He also defended Hegseth, who is facing a\u00a0newly-resurfaced allegation\u00a0of sexual assault. Hegseth has denied the allegation and has not been charged with a crime.",
      "In a statement to NBC News, Timothy Parlatore, Hegseth's attorney, denied the allegations but confirmed payments made to the accuser, saying in a statement that, \"This is a situation where a consensual encounter occurred and, unfortunately, the woman had to come up with a lie to explain why the woman had not come back to her husband\u2019s room that night. It wasn\u2019t reported until days later until there was pressure from her husband. It was fully investigated by police and video surveillance as well as multiple eyewitness statements show that she was the aggressor.\"",
      "\"Mr. Hegseth is completely innocent. It wasn\u2019t until a couple of years later after she lost her job that she began trying to squeeze Mr. Hegseth for money,\" Parlatore added. \u201cIn 2023, Hegseth paid the complainant as part of a civil confidential settlement agreement and maintains his innocence.\"",
      "\u201cI think he\u2019s a good pick,\u201d Mullin told Welker. \u201cBut once again, as allegations come out, we\u2019ll figure out if, as, as the Senate moves forward with the advise and consent to the President of the United States and doing our constitutional duties, we\u2019ll figure out if he can get confirmed or not, and, and I do think that Pete\u2019s a good pick for this position.\u201d",
      "Mullin also indicated that he would support Trump pursuing confirmation of some of his picks via the recess appointment process, something that Trump said he would ask of the Senate majority leader in a post on Truth Social before Senate Republicans elected Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., as their new majority leader last week.",
      "A recess appointment process would allow the president to place the House and Senate into recess so that he could appoint his nominees without having to go through the traditional Senate confirmation process.",
      "It\u2019s something that the Senate strives to avoid, and it\u2019s why the chamber gavels into pro forma sessions even while it\u2019s in recess.",
      "Mullin acknowledged that it is a \u201cvery difficult\u201d process and recalled that President Barack Obama tried to use the recess appointment process and was rebuked by the Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019d be the absolute last resort,\u201d Mullin told Welker. \u201cBut if that\u2019s what we have to do to get the confirmation through, then absolutely, let\u2019s do it. But I would say that would be last option.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Multiple current and former senior Justice Department and FBI officials have begun reaching out to lawyers in anticipation of being criminally investigated by the Trump administration, according to three people with knowledge of their deliberations.",
      "Following Trump\u2019s decisive election victory, many DOJ officials and career staffers were already nervous about the possibility that they would be targeted by Trump loyalists, particularly members of Congress. But the selection of former Rep. Matt Gaetz, a firebrand Trump ally who was the subject of a recent FBI investigation, to lead the department has sharply increased the sense of alarm, the sources said.",
      "\u201cEverything we did was aboveboard,\u201d said a former senior FBI official who has started contacting lawyers because he expects to be prosecuted himself. \u201cBut this is a different world.\u201d",
      "The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of becoming even more of a target, doesn\u2019t believe any attempt to prosecute him will be successful. Judges and juries have the power to throw out cases or find defendants innocent if they deem prosecutions to be baseless.",
      "But like many other current and former Justice Department officials, he is bracing for a potentially long and costly legal battle, as well as the possibility of protracted congressional investigations, after Trump takes office in January.",
      "Career FBI employees are especially vulnerable, the official added. Since they make less money than they would in the private sector, they rely on the pensions they receive after 20 years.",
      "\u201cAgents have to do 20 years,\u201d the former senior FBI official said. \u201cThese people don\u2019t have options.\u201d",
      "A former senior DOJ official who served during Trump\u2019s first term said he, too, saw Gaetz\u2019s nomination as a sign of the seriousness of the president-elect\u2019s vow to exact revenge on those who investigated him.",
      "\u201cHe needs to be able to control the department, which he can do through a loyal AG beholden to him,\u201d the former DOJ official said.",
      "Gaetz, who was the subject of a federal sex trafficking investigation that\u00a0ended without charges, \u201cunderstands that he owes everything to Trump, who can protect Gaetz as well through his pardon power,\u201d the former official added. \u201cTrump is confident that Gaetz will do whatever Trump tells him to do.\u201d",
      "Trump and his supporters have consistently argued that all of the criminal investigations against him have been politically motivated, and that DOJ and FBI officials deserve to be prosecuted.",
      "Weeks before Election Day, Steven Cheung, a spokesman for Trump, called for the Jan. 6 charges and all federal and state criminal charges against Trump to be dropped.",
      "\u201cThis entire case is a sham and a partisan, Unconstitutional Witch Hunt that should be dismissed entirely \u2014 as should ALL of the remaining Democrat hoaxes,\u201d Cheung said.",
      "Legal experts say Trump\u2019s goal in investigating his investigators is simple: intimidate anyone who dares to probe Trump\u2019s conduct.",
      "\u201cTrump aims to neutralize sources of power that may impede him,\u201d said Stephen Gillers, an ethics professor at New York University Law School. \u201cThat includes the law and legal institutions. He will tolerate no interference when the department\u2019s decisions will benefit Trump and his buddies or when its power can be deployed to retaliate against his enemies.\u201d",
      "Shock inside the DOJ",
      "DOJ officials, including Attorney General Merrick Garland, were shocked by Trump\u2019s decisive election win. For the last four years, Garland has argued that strictly following post-Watergate norms that require the DOJ to work in a nonpartisan manner in criminal investigations would restore public trust in the DOJ.",
      "Instead, some career DOJ officials wept after the election, dismayed by the fact that large numbers of Americans apparently continue to believe Trump\u2019s claims that the department is a cesspool of corruption.",
      "DOJ and FBI officials say that the Trump investigations were carried out properly. DOJ prosecutors secured indictments from federal grand juries against Trump for his mishandling of classified documents and his efforts to reverse the 2020 election results.",
      "They expressed bafflement at what criminal charge could be brought against them as a result. \u201cThere\u2019s no crime,\u201d said a current law enforcement official. \u201cWhat\u2019s the crime?\u201d",
      "Mike Davis, a conservative lawyer and Trump ally, has argued that special counsel Jack Smith could be prosecuted for breaking one of the laws that Smith accused Trump of breaking regarding the 2020 election: conspiracy against rights.",
      "The statute says it is illegal for anyone to deny a person a federal right, such as voting. Smith argued that Trump\u2019s attempt to reverse the 2020 election results denied voters in multiple states the right to have their votes accurately counted.",
      "Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University, said he did not see how Smith could be charged with denying Trump a federal right.",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s absurd,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see any legitimate charge that can be brought against Smith.\u201d",
      "Somin\u00a0warned that a prosecutor\u00a0can\u00a0investigate an individual over a long period\u00a0and find that they had broken unrelated federal laws that cover minor offenses.",
      "If Trump\u2019s attorney general, for example, appoints a special prosecutor to examine the federal criminal investigations of Trump, they could find that a DOJ or FBI official broke a federal law that does not relate to the Trump probes, such as a tax or drug infraction.",
      "\u201cIf you think about it, a majority of adult Americans have probably violated federal laws, such as smoking marijuana, at some point in their lives,\u201d Somin said.",
      "Special counsel Robert Mueller, during his investigation of whether Trump campaign officials coordinated with Russia during the 2016 campaign, charged multiple Trump associates with unrelated crimes. Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, was sentenced\u00a0to just under four years\u00a0in prison after being convicted of tax and bank fraud.",
      "A special counsel appointed by Attorney General Bill Barr, John Durham, then spent years scrutinizing the actions of the CIA and FBI in connection with Russia\u2019s 2016 election interference efforts, only to net a single guilty plea from an FBI lawyer who lied on a document.",
      "But many of those investigated by Durham had to spend thousands of dollars on legal fees. Now, a new group of DOJ and FBI officials are facing the prospect of hefty legal fees as well.",
      "Gillers, the NYU professor, said that he believes Trump\u2019s nomination of Gaetz was the beginning, not the end, of his efforts to exact revenge on the department.",
      "\u201cElevating Gaetz is in part payback for Jack Smith\u2019s two indictments,\u201d Gillers said. \u201cThe Justice Department is Trump\u2019s white whale, and like Captain Ahab, Trump is determined to get even.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "For President-elect Donald Trump, there\u2019s a clear story that runs through each of the seven battleground states that he swept on his way to recapturing the White House.",
      "He managed to drive up even further what were already sky-high margins with his white, blue-collar base while harnessing historically broad nonwhite voter support to erode the Democratic base in cities and diversifying suburbs.",
      "And for Vice President Kamala Harris, the battleground picture is one of regression \u2014 a widespread failure to match Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 performance, with her gains largely isolated to areas centered on the wealthier, college-educated white voters who increasingly make up her party\u2019s backbone.",
      "With the final votes now largely tallied, we dug into the county-level, demographic and exit poll data to identify the key voter trends in the states that decided the 2024 presidential election.",
      "Arizona",
      "Result: Trump 52.2%; Harris 46.7%",
      "Margin: Trump +186,138",
      "Two counties in Arizona make up the lion\u2019s share of the population.",
      "The biggest by far is Maricopa County, which is basically Phoenix and its sprawling metro area. More than six out of every 10 votes in the state come from here. Its Republican lean has been the foundation of the party\u2019s steady statewide success for decades. But when Biden won Arizona by a razor-thin 10,457 votes four years ago, he became the first Democrat since Harry Truman in 1948 to win Maricopa.",
      "That breakthrough now looks more like a one-off, with Trump reclaiming the county by more than 70,000 votes this time around.",
      "New Hispanic support played a central role. After losing Arizona\u2019s Latino vote by 24 points to Biden, Trump slashed his deficit to just 10 points this time. That was enough to swing Maricopa, where a third of the population is Hispanic.",
      "It also boosted Trump south of Phoenix in Pima County, home to about 15% of the state\u2019s voters. Anchored by the college town of Tucson, Pima is a blue county, but Trump managed to reduce Democrats\u2019 advantage from 18 points down to 15 \u2014 yielding a net shift of about 20,000 votes.",
      "There was another, albeit smaller, factor in Trump\u2019s Arizona victory: New support from Native Americans. They make up only about 5% of Arizona\u2019s population, but there are two counties in the northeast corner of the state that are nearly half Native American.",
      "Navajo County includes the Hopi Reservation, with the Navajo Nation encompassing much of the rest of the county, as well as next-door Apache County. Apache is also home to the Fort Apache Reservation. They have a combined population of about 175,000 (by comparison, Maricopa\u2019s is 4.4 million), but the results in each are telling.",
      "In Apache, what had been a 34-point margin for Biden plummeted to 19 points for Harris. And in Navajo, Trump more than doubled his 8-point victory from four years ago, besting Harris by 17 points.",
      "Georgia",
      "Result: Trump 50.7%; Harris 48.5%",
      "Vote margin: Trump +115,100",
      "The key to Biden\u2019s narrow Georgia victory in 2020 was a group of nine population-dense metro Atlanta counties, where he drove up even further what had already been overwhelming Democratic margins.",
      "This \u201cblue blob\u201d makes up more than 40% of all votes statewide. It\u2019s anchored by Atlanta, a near-majority Black city that\u2019s long been a Democratic bastion, and its suburbs are marked by some of the most dramatic population growth and demographic turnover in the nation.",
      "Back in 2012, then-President Barack Obama carried the blob counties by 18 points, and by 2020, the margin had exploded to 37 points for Biden. To win Georgia this time around, Harris needed this momentum to continue.",
      "Instead, it stalled. Overall, she won these nine counties by 35 points, garnering about 5,000 fewer net votes than Biden. This is the first time in 20 years that the blob trended away from the Democrats in a presidential election.",
      "There\u2019s a twist, though. In some of these counties, Harris actually did improve on Biden\u2019s performance, significantly.",
      "Harris\u2019 gains in Douglas, Henry, Newton and Rockdale are about the only bright spots for her in Georgia. In fact, they are among the only counties in the country that actually got bluer between 2020 and 2024.",
      "Demographics help explain this: The surge in growth in each of these counties comes heavily from Black residents who moved from out of state and brought strong Democratic allegiances with them. Unlike other nonwhite groups, the shift of Black voters away from Democrats this election was very slight, allowing these counties to defy the national trend.",
      "The problem for Harris is that these gains were more than offset by her regression in the higher-population blob counties of Fulton, Gwinnett and DeKalb, where there are concentrations of nonwhite demographic groups that moved significantly toward Trump. In Gwinnett, for example, nearly one-third of its 1 million residents are either Hispanic or Asian American.",
      "And Harris\u2019 overall decline in the biggest metro Atlanta counties left her vulnerable to Trump\u2019s slightly improved performance in the GOP-friendly exurbs (most notably, high-population Cherokee and Forsyth counties) and across wide swaths of small-town and rural Georgia.",
      "Overall, Trump improved on his 2020 showing in 153 of Georgia\u2019s 159 counties.",
      "Michigan",
      "Result: Trump 49.6%; Harris 48.2%",
      "Margin: Trump +80,324",
      "On paper, Michigan appeared to be a heavy lift for Trump as the battleground state he lost by the widest margin in 2020 \u2014 154,188 votes, or about 3 percentage points.",
      "So, what happened this time? Well, let\u2019s start with another question: Is there anywhere in the state where Harris was able to improve on Biden\u2019s performance? The answer is yes, in three counties in the northern Lower Peninsula.",
      "Hours away from the population center of southeast Michigan, these four picturesque counties along the \u201cMidwest Coast\u201d have become magnets for higher-income retirees, second-home owners and summer resortgoers. Leelanau, where you\u2019ll find a flourishing wine industry (yes, Michigan has one), and Grand Traverse, where charming Traverse City sits on a bay that leads out to Lake Michigan, have among the highest median incomes in the state.",
      "Demographically, it\u2019s an area that\u2019s only getting friendlier to Democrats. But that was it for her. In the state\u2019s other 80 counties, she lost ground compared to Biden, and Democrats\u2019 154,000-vote advantage from 2020 evaporated quickly.",
      "The damage for Harris was particularly dire in Wayne, the state\u2019s largest county. Four years ago, Biden carried it 68%-30%, a margin of 332,617 votes. Harris, though, only won Wayne by 29 points, a margin of 247,803 votes. That\u2019s a net reduction of about 85,000 votes for Democrats from their biggest single source of votes on the map.",
      "Harris underperformed in heavily Black Detroit, Wayne\u2019s principal city, where turnout was down by about 10,000 votes compared to four years ago. But the bulk of Wayne\u2019s population is outside of Detroit\u2019s borders, where Harris\u2019 troubles extended.",
      "Dearborn and Dearborn Heights have among the highest concentrations of Arab Americans anywhere in the country (Dearborn, in fact, is America\u2019s only Arab-majority city). Biden carried both by landslide margins in 2020, but Harris suffered massive defections (presumably due to the Israel-Hamas war) and outright lost each city to Trump. Democratic support similarly collapsed in the Muslim-majority city of Hamtramck. And Harris lost significant ground in Canton, with a sizable Asian American population, and Melvindale, where 1 in 4 residents are Hispanic.",
      "Just north of Detroit, Harris also suffered losses in massive Oakland County, where four-year college degrees are abundant and incomes are far above the state average. But Oakland\u2019s Hispanic and Asian American populations are also growing, and what had been a 108,000-vote Biden margin fell to just 82,000 for Harris. Meanwhile, next door in Macomb County, with its blue-collar cities and suburbs, Trump expanded his winning margin by 30,000 votes compared to 2020.",
      "This was the story of Michigan, where increased blue-collar strength and new nonwhite voter support added hundreds of thousands of votes to Trump\u2019s column. With her gains limited to wine country and resort towns, Harris simply couldn\u2019t keep pace.",
      "Nevada",
      "Result: Trump 50.6%; Harris 47.5%",
      "Margin: Trump +46,193",
      "The political geography of Nevada isn\u2019t complicated. About 70% of all the vote comes from Clark County, which takes in Las Vegas and its ever-expanding suburbs and planned communities. After decades of toss-up status, the county flipped to the Democrats in 1992 and hasn\u2019t looked back, with its racial diversity (about 90% of Nevada\u2019s Black residents live here), service worker economy and strong union presence powering the party\u2019s candidates.",
      "But Trump\u2019s breakthrough performance with two nonwhite demographic groups produced a decisive shift in Clark \u2014 not enough to put it back in the Republican column, but closer than any GOP presidential candidate has come since 1988. One-third of Clark\u2019s population is Hispanic and another 10% is Asian American.",
      "The statewide exit poll \u2014 which overwhelmingly comprises Clark residents \u2014 recorded just how much ground Trump gained with these voters. Trump and Harris tied among Nevada\u2019s Hispanic voters after Biden won them by 26 points in 2020. And Trump carried Asian American voters in the state by 3 points after losing them by 29 points four years ago.",
      "After losing Clark by 9.4 points to Biden four years ago, Trump fell only 2.6 points short this time around. This amounted to a net improvement of about 64,000 votes in the county \u2014 or twice the margin of Trump\u2019s statewide defeat in 2020.",
      "About 450 miles northwest of Vegas, in the state\u2019s other major population center, in and around Reno in Washoe County, Trump also made strides. Washoe is a quarter Hispanic and has a much smaller Asian American population than Clark, but the demographics were friendly enough that Trump only lost it by a point. That\u2019s better than his 4.5-point loss four years ago.",
      "The rest of Nevada tends to be heavily rural, white and blue collar. In these places, Trump built slightly on what were already landslide margins.",
      "That all led to Trump becoming the first Republican presidential candidate since 2004 to carry Nevada \u2014 and the first from either party to win the state while still losing both Clark and Washoe counties.",
      "North Carolina",
      "Result: Trump 51.0%; Harris 47.8%",
      "Vote margin: Trump +183,527",
      "Similar to Georgia, Democrats failed to expand their support in the major population centers that have become the backbone of their coalition.",
      "In North Carolina, there are several Democratic-friendly hubs across the state, with larger concentrations than the statewide average of either Black residents (21%) or white adults with four-year degrees (25%), or both.",
      "Cumulatively, these eight counties make up just under 40% of the statewide vote, and as with the \u201cblob\u201d in Georgia, they inched away from Democrats, with Harris netting around 25,000 fewer votes from them than Biden did.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump saw his margins tick slightly upward across most of small-town and rural North Carolina. He made particularly notable gains in rural counties with significant Black populations (10 points or higher than the statewide average of 21%), improving his margins there by about 25,000 votes compared to 2020. And in four counties with a large Native American population \u2014 the Lumbee Tribe in Robeson, Hoke and Scotland counties; and the Eastern Cherokee in Swain County \u2014 his margins increased by roughly 6,000 votes.",
      "Harris showed measurable improvement over Biden around Asheville in the mountains of western North Carolina, netting nearly 10,000 additional votes in Buncombe County and several surrounding counties. But she only built on Biden\u2019s performance in a few other counties. Given that she started out in a 75,000-vote hole (Trump\u2019s winning margin in 2020), it wasn\u2019t nearly enough.",
      "Pennsylvania",
      "Result: Trump 50.4%; Harris 48.6%",
      "Vote margin: Trump +125,325",
      "Overall, Pennsylvania shifted 3 points to Trump between 2020 and 2024. But the movement was most pronounced in the eastern part of the state, where Trump posted seven of his 10 biggest county-level improvements compared to four years ago.",
      "Key to this: Deep inroads with Latino voters that helped Trump erode the massive advantage that Democrats depend on in cities throughout the region.",
      "In Philadelphia itself, Harris won by 59 points, 79%-20%. But that was down from Biden\u2019s 81%-18% win four years ago, amounting to a net reduction in the Democratic margin of around 50,000 votes. That drop-off alone effectively erased more than half of Biden\u2019s 81,000-vote statewide margin. Sixteen percent of Philadelphia residents are Latino, and a review of precinct-level results from NBC News\u2019 Decision Desk found that Trump\u2019s gains in the city were heavily concentrated in majority-Latino neighborhoods.",
      "In smaller, Latino-heavy cities in eastern Pennsylvania, Trump made big strides, including double-digit improvements in the state\u2019s three Hispanic-majority cities.",
      "Puerto Ricans are the main Hispanic subgroup in Allentown and Reading, while Dominicans are heavily concentrated in Hazleton, a city that was less than 5% Hispanic just 25 years ago.",
      "Also crucial for Trump: He clawed back support from white blue-collar voters who rallied to him in 2016 but defected to Biden in 2020. This was most notable in Lackawanna County, which is 82% white and home to Biden\u2019s native Scranton. After Obama carried it by 28 points in 2012, Hillary Clinton won it by just 3 points in 2016. Biden managed to increase Democrats\u2019 margins there by 9 points in 2020, but Harris carried it by 3 points this year.",
      "Trump also flipped Bucks County, which has a larger share of white voters without college degrees than the other three Philadelphia collar counties. And he drove up what were already robust margins in Pike County, where growth has been fueled by in-migration from New Jersey and New York residents.",
      "Democrats, meanwhile, were banking on even deeper support in the giant, higher-end Philadelphia suburbs. While Chester and Montgomery counties each went for Harris by double digits, her margin fell several points short of Biden\u2019s in both. Her campaign had also identified emerging suburbs in the south-central part of the state, near Harrisburg, as growth targets. Instead, Harris merely treaded water in them.",
      "Wisconsin",
      "Result: Trump 49.6%; Harris 48.8%",
      "Margin: Trump +29,687",
      "The vote shifts in Wisconsin were momentous, but compared to the rest of the battlegrounds, they were also small, with Trump turning what was a 20,682-vote loss in 2020 into a 29,687-vote victory in 2024. In both races, less than 1 percentage point separated the two candidates.",
      "Trump managed to turn the tables with marginal gains across rural Wisconsin, newfound strength in the state\u2019s (relatively few) Latino-heavy pockets, and by slowing defections from Milwaukee\u2019s big Republican suburbs.",
      "Harris, meanwhile, was done in by her party\u2019s increasing reliance on a narrow geographic base that just didn\u2019t pack the punch her campaign was depending on.",
      "Perhaps nowhere in the country has the march of rural blue-collar voters from the Democratic Party to the Trump-led GOP been more dramatic than in Wisconsin. Nearly half of the state\u2019s counties \u2014 32 of 72 \u2014 can be labeled \u201cTrump surge\u201d counties. These tend to be rural and have smaller populations, with very high concentrations of white adults without four-year college degrees.",
      "When Obama was re-elected in 2012, he carried 15 of these counties, some by blowout margins. But they all shifted at least 20 points toward the GOP from 2012 to 2020. And this year, Trump made further gains in every one of them, winning all but one. Cumulatively, this added up to a net shift of about 20,000 votes in Trump\u2019s direction \u2014 nearly half of what he gained statewide.",
      "Wisconsin has a small Hispanic population overall. But Trump still registered a net gain of more than 17,000 votes from five areas in the state with a significant Hispanic population.",
      "Key to the Harris strategy in Wisconsin were the three population-rich suburban Milwaukee counties. While they\u2019ve remained solidly Republican in the Trump era, the party\u2019s margins declined in 2016 and 2020. But the further erosion Democrats needed didn\u2019t materialize to the degree they hoped it would.",
      "These small shifts in the \u201cWOW\u201d counties added up to a net improvement of just 2,705 votes for Harris. And that was entirely offset by small Trump gains in the large, blue-collar \u201cBOW\u201d counties (Brown, Outagamie and Winnebago) near Green Bay and Appleton.",
      "After that, all that was left for Harris was Dane County, which now rivals Milwaukee as her party\u2019s biggest vote hub in the state. Home to Madison and its well-to-do suburbs, Democrats had managed to attain increased pluralities here in every election this century, with Biden carrying it by 181,000 votes over Trump (or 76%-23%).",
      "Harris did manage to squeeze even more out of Dane, winning it by 188,000, but it would have taken a lot more than that to undo the damage she endured throughout the rest of the state."

      "The election showed voters are increasingly split by education level and angry about the economy even as college costs ease.",
      "This \u201cdiploma divide\u201d is now a defining feature of American politics. It comes at a time when earning a degree remains among the surest paths toward a higher income and when the costs of embarking on it are falling. But many don\u2019t seem to notice.",
      "The net costs students pay for four-year degrees have been declining for years, College Board data shows. When adjusted for inflation, in-state students now pay an average of $2,480 in tuition and fees at public four-year colleges this academic year, down 43% from a peak of $4,340 in 2012-13. At pricier four-year private institutions, the net tuition and fees students pay has declined a more modest 15%, to $16,510 from a 2006-07 peak of $19,330.",
      "State and local government funding per student has been growing or holding steady since 2012, the data shows, helping drive costs lower. And institutional grant aid rose by an inflation-adjusted $19.6 billion between the 2013-14 school year and 2023-24. Yet only a quarter of adults see a college degree as critical to landing a well-paying job, a Pew survey this year found, and nearly half say that\u2019s less important today than it was two decades ago."

      "The easing of longtime restrictions comes as North Korea has deployed thousands of troops to the Kursk region of Russia to support Russian troops fighting Ukrainian forces.",
      "The new authority applies to Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, which Ukrainian officials have sought from the Biden administration. U.S. officials had resisted, citing concerns over limited stockpile, the repositioning of Russian assets outside of ATACMS range\u00a0and because Ukraine has been using other assets, primarily drones, with success, making ATACMS less critical to the fight.",
      "But the change comes after Biden officials have condemned the North Korean deployment as a possible expansion of the war. The ATACMS could be used where the Russian and North Korean troops are concentrated.",
      "The Pentagon and White House both declined to comment.",
      "In May, Biden secretly gave Ukraine permission to use American weapons to strike Russia just over the border. At the time, Ukraine was prohibited from using longer-range weapons to strike deeper into the country, sources told NBC News.",

      "The U.S. has provided $175 billion in aid to Ukraine \u2014 more than any other country \u2014 making American support crucial to Ukraine\u2019s defense against Russia. A withdrawal of support could deal a major blow to Ukraine\u2019s ability to resist Russia\u2019s attacks.",

      "Johnson joined the app in 2009 when he was a teenager. Last week, he signed up for an alternative app, Bluesky. \u201cEveryone is on the same page of what we don\u2019t want to see.\u201d",
      "Elon Musk\u2019s involvement in Trump\u2019s campaign and his changes to the social media platform have prompted many people to abandon X in his two years as owner of the company. More than 115,000 accounts deactivated on the day after the election, the most dropped accounts in a single day since Musk acquired the platform, according to data from Similarweb, a third-party company that tracks social media analytics, shared with NBC News this week. Like many others, Black users have been eyeing an exit from the app since 2022, but users told NBC News that this mass exodus feels more permanent.",
      "X did not return a request for comment on this story. Earlier this week, a spokesperson for X cited record engagement on the platform during Election Day.",
      "The move away from X coincides with the platform adopting a new terms-of-service policy as of Friday that states users\u2019 posts will be used to train artificial intelligence. Users could have previously opted out of this AI machine learning, but the new policy states that all users agree simply by having an X account.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not interested in having my content feed that monster,\u201d Crawley, 44, said. He criticized the functionality of the app and said it will suffer without a mass of Black users.",
      "Many have opted to join Bluesky, with others considering Meta-owned Threads or the Black-owned social media site Spill. More than 1 million people joined Bluesky in the past week, the platform said, bringing its user base to more than 15 million people. There were about 429 million X accounts worldwide at the beginning of 2024, according to Statista.",
      "Bluesky spokesperson Emily Liu said the company does not collect information on users\u2019 race, but is pleased to see so many new accounts. \u201cIn many ways, Black Twitter was one of the cornerstones of Twitter, and we\u2019re eager to welcome this community to Bluesky,\u201d Liu said in an email to NBC News.",
      "The exodus has been a long time coming. Researchers tracked an uptick in hate speech after Musk acquired the site in 2022 and began changes to its algorithm. Users told NBC News that X has become less user-friendly. The app\u2019s default \u201cFor You\u201d feed, teeming with bots and ads, has made it harder to interact with their friends, they said. It has also become more difficult to block users for good. Some said Musk himself was the reason for their departure.",
      "And now, prominent figures like Gabrielle Union and Don Lemon have left the platform, saying they\u2019d no longer contribute to the Musk-run site and lamenting the new terms of service.",
      "Musk has transformed the site into a Republican media hub and an overall echo chamber amplifying right-wing ideologies, according to academic research, public opinion surveys, various X data and reports about X working directly with Trump\u2019s campaign. This week, the president-elect announced Musk will co-lead a new \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d with Republican businessman Vivek Ramaswamy.",
      "Musk was \u201cthe main reason\u201d Joella Still, a 37-year-old education consultant from Los Angeles, left, she said, noting that the owner and executive chairman supported Trump\u2019s presidential run. \u201cAnd he used Twitter to help do that. I just can\u2019t contribute to something that is part of my demise.\u201d",
      "She added, \u201cI\u2019m seeing his tweets, which are pushing a bunch of misinformation and straight-up lies, basically. I\u2019m seeing that, but I\u2019m not seeing people I follow.\u201d",
      "Johnson, Crawley, Still and others have joined Bluesky and cited its user-friendly interface, its moderation lists, and its \u201canti-toxicity\u201d safety features to combat harassment. \u201cIt feels like a very welcoming, safe space,\u201d said Pariss Chandler, the organizer of Black Tech Twitter and the founder of the recruitment platform Black Tech Pipeline. \u201cI wonder if that\u2019s because they have lots of regulations and safety protections on that platform. They provide something Twitter no longer does.\u201d",
      "Although Chandler is enjoying Bluesky, she said she plans to keep her Twitter account, while planning to be less active there.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really just because Twitter is where I mobilize my community. It\u2019s where I made tons of different connections, and that\u2019s where everything started for me and my business,\u201d Chandler said. \u201cI know a lot of people are migrating to different platforms, but they\u2019re still going to stay on Twitter.\u201d",
      "Black users on Bluesky are already working to build a community on the site. One user, Rudy Fraser, launched Blacksky, a collection of curated, Black-centered feeds that filter out racism and misogyny to provide a safe, inclusive experience for users. The day after the presidential election, Fraser said, the feed was viewed or refreshed a record 100,000 times.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think Black Twitter can be re-created. It was its own thing,\u201d said Fraser, who works as an enterprise technology consultant and is a self-described activist and technologist. \u201cBut I have taken a lot of inspiration and learnings from what was done.\u201d",
      "While Black Twitter engagement has at times been associated with celebrities and influencers, for example, \u201cthere\u2019s really no gatekeeping\u201d on Blacksky, said Fraser, and Bluesky recommends the feed to new users when they sign up.",
      "Bluesky\u2019s content moderation tools are also community-owned and community-focused: Users can report guideline abuses to moderators, rather than a team of employees, for swifter action. Fraser, who praised Bluesky\u2019s \u201cstackable\u201d approach to moderation, has enlisted a couple of his own moderators for an extra layer of protection on Blacksky. Crucially, he can also prevent bad actors from viewing the feed altogether \u2014 a stark contrast from X, which recently informed users that public posts are now accessible to the people they block.",
      "After its record-setting day last week, Blacksky had reached 600,000 total views, Fraser said.",
      "One million views is on the horizon, Fraser said. \u201cPeople seem to be really receptive to the experience that they can get with the feed and having a good time.\u201d",
      "Whether it\u2019s Threads, Spill or elsewhere, Johnson, who migrated to Bluesky, said the vibes from Black Twitter will find a new home.",
      "\u201cThose of us who make up Black Twitter,\u201d he said, \u201cwill just end up going to different social media platforms and re-creating the good parts of what we had.\u201d"

      "The introduction of the technology to the hiring and recruiting process comes as job searching reaches record highs: More than 28% of Americans were searching for a new job as of Aug. 28. As the use of AI in hiring and applying increases, many job seekers are having to go to extra lengths to stand out.",
      "\u201cYou have to be willing to be f-----g crazy,\u201d content creator Jeff said in a TikTok describing his AI-powered preparation process for a series of job interviews. The creator said that to land the job, he used ChatGPT at every stage of his application \u2014 to help craft his application, connect with current employees and practice interview questions.",
      "On the other side of the table, recruiters and hiring staff have mixed feelings about AI.",
      "\u201cWhat AI is doing is actually just creating more noise. \u2026 Normal people who are not using AI are hurting in the job market, and then they have to go start using AI to apply to jobs to be competitive,\u201d Maddie Macho, a reverse recruiter (a service provider for applicants who manages applications and communications with companies), said in a TikTok video.",
      "With the help of new AI software, applicants can now revise their resumes and cover letters, receive live interview scripts and launch chatbots to submit thousands of applications almost instantly.",
      "To some, AI usage is seen as a helpful tool that enhances applications in a competitive job market. To others, it raises questions around applicant credibility and the integrity of the hiring process.",
      "Chantal Cowie, a self-described \u201czillennial,\u201d started searching for a new job as AI software like ChatGPT and Gemini first began to take off.",
      "\u201cI was working like 60 hours a week at the time, so any time I could save was precious,\u201d she said.",
      "As Cowie applied to jobs, she fed ChatGPT her experience and used the AI tool to write cover letters and answer application questions, which she said allowed her \u201cto apply to more [jobs] in a shorter period of time.\u201d",
      "Though she landed a job, she was laid off and re-entered the job market nine months later. By that point, AI had advanced significantly. She was able to use more specialized AI platforms like Teal to build her resume and Claude to analyze company websites and job descriptions.",
      "\u201cI would make it further in interview rounds. I was making it to the second-to-last round or the last round for most of the interviews that I had,\u201d Cowie said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s because I was able to come to them so prepared because of the extra tools that I had.\u201d",
      "Cowie took to social media to explain her AI-powered process that she said landed her a \u201csix-figure, fully remote job.\u201d",
      "\u201cAI is going to be integrated in our lives at every level, and it\u2019s here to stay,\u201d she told NBC News. \u201cYou might as well learn how to use it to your advantage and add a new skill set.\u201d",
      "As the usability and popularity of artificial intelligence grows, more platforms have found success in catering to job applicants.",
      "LazyApply, Simplify and AI Hawk are all AI services that launch assistants to help collect applicant information and submit automated job applications through sites like LinkedIn and Indeed. Using the tools, job seekers can save hundreds of hours \u2014 and apply to up to thousands of jobs a day, according to the services.",
      "AI Apply, which claims its users are \u201c80% more likely to get hired,\u201d offers tools like a cover letter and resume builder, an auto-apply feature, an interview practice generator and a specialized interview buddy. A premium membership starts at $38 a month, according to the website \u2014 a cost AI Apply notes is much lower and more accessible than the cost of a career counselor.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re doing what every job seeker is told to do by a career coach, and that is customize and tailor your resume to every job you\u2019re applying to,\u201d AI Apply CEO Aidan Cramer told NBC News.",
      "Watchdogs have warned about the risk of hallucination and error with AI tools, but Cramer says AI Apply is specifically designed to translate skill sets into language that\u2019s the best fit for a given application \u2014 not make up experiences.",
      "\u201cAI is prone to hallucination,\u201d Cramer explained. \u201cIf someone was using ChatGPT to update their resume, you\u2019re giving it a very small amount of context. It\u2019s more prone to make stuff up, because it doesn\u2019t really understand exactly what you\u2019re trying to do.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe way we\u2019ve tried to build it is that when you put in the job description, that acts as some kind of grounding. So the level of hallucination is a lot lower,\u201d he added.",
      "A spokesperson for OfferGoose, a company that claims to have a 300% higher-than-normal success rate with its AI interview aid features, echoed that view.",
      "\u200b\u200b\u201cWe believe it\u2019s important to clarify that AI is a tool designed to assist and enhance human capabilities,\u201d the spokesperson said in an email interview with NBC News. \u201cThe quality and accuracy of AI-generated content largely depend on its training data and how it is used.\u201d",
      "\u201cEmployers should not fear this tool, nor should they resist it as a form of cheating,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWe encourage job seekers to discuss their use of OfferGoose with potential employers.\u201d",
      "According to the company\u2019s respective websites, OfferGoose has helped applicants land over 17,000 job offers, and AI Apply has over 340,000 \u201cfreelancers and job seekers\u201d using the service.",
      "Nevertheless, many companies have enlisted additional safeguards to detect the use of AI. Some employers now require e-confirmation codes to submit applications and prevent automated submissions. Others have added prompts asking AI bots to use specific words like \u201cbanana\u201d in responses to catch chat-generated application answers, according to longtime job recruiter and tech agency director of talent Mike Peditto.",
      "But job seekers are not the only party using AI in the application process, according to a recent University of Washington study. The researchers estimated that \u201c99% of Fortune 500 companies are already using some sort of AI assistance when making hiring decisions,\u201d and found that resume-screening tools have an incredible bias toward white, male applicants \u2014 with the large language models favoring white-associated males roughly 85% of the time and disadvantaging Black males in \u201cup to 100% of cases.\u201d",
      "The use of AI by both applicants and employers has created a distinct dynamic, in which applicants are using AI, but are also reticent about employers screening them with AI.",
      "A Capterra study found 58% of job seekers use AI in their job search, and 83% of these same respondents also used AI to \u201cexaggerate or lie about their skills.\u201d But around 66% of Americans say \u201cthey would not want to apply for a job with an employer who uses AI to help with hiring decisions,\u201d according to a 2023 Pew Research study.",
      "\u201cThe mission is all about helping give job seekers a leg up in a world where they kind of have been fighting against AI tools that have been screening them out,\u201d Cramer told NBC News, encouraging hiring managers to \u201crethink the automatic pre-screening processes\u201d and\u00a0\u201cgive people more of a chance to get in front of them and to shine as a human.\u201d",
      "Raechel Boston, a retail product manager whose social media presence is dedicated to informing potential applicants on the possibilities of AI, explained that such technology takes the labor out of hand-tailoring resumes or cover letters.",
      "\u201cTo get past [applicant tracking software], you have to have a specific type of catered resume to match up with the job qualification and job description,\u201d Boston told NBC News. \u201cTo do that manually, one by one, with every single freaking job application would take hundreds and hundreds of hours that even someone who is unemployed is going to get exhausted from.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf I was unemployed and had the means to pay for a tool and a service that would get me ahead, I, no-brainer, would do it,\u201d she added.",
      "Ruth Edwards, head of the New York office of Tiger Recruitment who has over 20 years of experience in senior commercial recruiting, expressed excitement surrounding the potential of AI in her workplace.",
      "\u201cEighteen months ago, I think people were quite daunted by the idea of AI,\u201d she told NBC News, adding that AI quickly became \u201cpart of the day to day.\u201d",
      "Though Tiger Recruitment does not use AI to screen personal information such as resumes due data privacy concerns, the company does use it to assess diversity demographics and create competitive salary benchmarks.",
      "\u201cThe whole hiring process for [clients] has now become more time-efficient and more cost-effective,\u201d she added.",
      "But recruiters also warn that using the software incorrectly could drastically hurt applicants looking to get hired.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not that you\u2019re being eliminated for using AI, it\u2019s [that] you\u2019re being eliminated because you didn\u2019t use AI well,\u201d Peditto, better known as @realisticrecruiting to his almost 150,000 TikTok followers, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cYou will only get so far if you try and manipulate the AI tool,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cYou notice certain keywords, key phrases that tend to pop up when something is artificially generated.\u201d",
      "Peditto, who screens and hires job applicants for a living, emphasizes the need to use AI cautiously to help \u2014 and not harm \u2014 your chances at getting noticed by a company. He recognizes the use of AI as a good \u201cstarting spot,\u201d but recommends that applicants always review generated responses, noting that \u201cAI misses things, too.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re just letting AI do 100% of it, I think it is going to hurt you in the applications,\u201d he said. \u201cAI is not perfect. I think that you have to go through and make sure that you\u2019re talking to the right people and still looking for things that it\u2019s missed.\u201d"

    "published": "Sat, 16 Nov 2024 19:42:26 GMT",
    "summary": "The U.S. has reported its first case of a more aggressive strain of mpox. The WHO declared the virus' spread a public health emergency in August.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. on Saturday reported its first case of a more aggressive strain of mpox: an individual in California who had recently traveled from Eastern Africa.",
      "The case was confirmed by the California Department of Public Health and reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The person was treated in San Mateo County based on their travel history and symptoms and is now isolating at home and recovering, the state's health department said in a press release. Public health workers are contacting people who had close contact with the patient, \"but there is no concern or evidence\" that the strain is currently spreading in California or the U.S., the statement said.",
      "The U.S. is the sixth country outside of Africa to have detected the strain, according to the CDC, which can cause more severe disease than the version of the virus that spread widely in 2022.",
      "This strain\u2019s spread across several African countries prompted the World Health Organization to declare a global public health emergency in August, the second time for mpox in two years.",
      "Mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, is a viral infection that causes painful lesions, often accompanied by flu-like symptoms. It is classified into two distinct groups: the more aggressive strain, clade I, and a somewhat milder strain, clade II.",
      "Clade II was behind the global outbreak in 2022, which resulted in at least 32,000 infections and 58 deaths in the U.S.",
      "Until recently, clade I had not spread beyond Central Africa, where it is considered endemic, and East Africa. But an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo has led to cases in eight other African countries this year. In August, the first known case outside of Africa was confirmed in Sweden. Several days later, Thailand confirmed a case. Both patients had spent time in Africa.",
      "Traveled-related cases have also been detected in Germany, India and the United Kingdom, according to the CDC.",
      "Mpox spreads through direct contact with an infected person, animal or contaminated items like clothing or bedding. The version of clade II that spread in 2022 was passed primarily through sexual contact, particularly among men who have sex with men.",
      "In the current outbreak, clade I has been spreading largely through contact with infected animals and transmission within households, according to disease experts. Two-thirds of the suspected cases from January 2023 to April 2024 were among children ages 15 and under, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But a version of the strain, clade Ib, has also spread through sexual contact among female sex workers and men who have sex with men in Congo.",
      "It\u2019s unclear what transmission pathways might look like in the U.S., but some experts anticipate that clade I could spread among the same sexual networks as in 2022.",
      "\u201cI do expect that we will see cases,\" said Dr. Marc Siegel, an associate professor of medicine at the George Washington School of Medicine and Health Sciences. \"I think it will more likely be in the same population that was more at risk in the 2022-2023 outbreak. For the general population, I think this poses very little risk.\"",
      "Past mpox outbreaks of clade I in Africa have killed up to 10% of people who got sick, but the current outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo has a fatality rate of around 5%. That\u2019s compared to a 0.2% global fatality rate for the 2022 outbreak.",
      "However, health officials have said there\u2019s reason to believe that clade I could pose a milder threat in the U.S. than it has in African countries this year, given that malnutrition rates are lower and the health care system is more robust.",
      "The U.S. is also more prepared for an outbreak than it was in 2022. The CDC has instructed doctors to test for mpox and is scanning for both clades at wastewater sites across the country, including some airports.",
      "Additionally, the country has an adequate supply of the two-dose Jynneos vaccine, which is available to men who have sex with men and other high-risk groups. The Department of Health and Human Service says two doses of the vaccine or a previous infection should protect against severe illness from clade I.",
      "The U.S. administered around 1.2 million vaccine doses from May 2022 to January 2023. Health officials hope to expand that coverage, since just 23% of the population at significant risk has been fully vaccinated.",
      "Mpox typically starts with a rash that progresses to small bumps on the skin, followed by fluid-filled blisters that eventually scab over. People may also experience a fever, headache, muscle aches, back pain, low energy or swollen lymph nodes.",
      "Some people infected by clade II in the U.S. have described the lesions as exceedingly painful. They have historically appeared on the face, chest, palms of the hands and the soles of the feet, but during the 2022 outbreak, people developed lesions around the genital and anal region or inside the mouth and throat."

      "\u201cWicked\u201d director Jon M. Chu reflected on how the feature film might have greater meaning in the wake of the election.",
      "In an interview with NBC News, he pointed out that Oz works have always come out during times of national change and reckonings: World War I, 9/11 and now the 2024 election. He said he hopes people can glean a message of resilience and belonging.",
      "\u201c\u2018The Wizard of Oz\u2019 was always sort of prophetic in a way,\u201d Chu said. \u201cIt was written at a time of America in transition. At that point, the Depression had just finished and they\u2019re about to go into war. And so it\u2019s always a question of about what the American dream looks like when the road ends and what are the possibilities of the next thing.\u201d",
      "\u201cWicked,\u201d starring Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, is an adaptation of the hit Broadway musical, which is loosely based on the 1995 novel of the same name. The film and the novel expand on the 1900 novel \u201cThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz\u201d and its 1939 film adaptation, \u201cThe Wizard of Oz.\u201d",
      "NBC News and NBCUniversal, the distributor of \u201cWicked,\u201d share Comcast as a parent company.\u00a0\u201cWicked\u201d gives a sympathetic revision to the Wicked Witch of the West, named Elphaba, who seeks to take on the Wizard and his propaganda against her and the animals of Oz.",
      "Born with green skin, Elphaba endures a life of discrimination until she befriends Glinda, the Good Witch, and embarks on an adventure to meet the Wizard \u2014 only to find herself branded as evil and ostracized once again when she rejects his request to do his magical biddings she finds immoral.",
      "Chu said the musical adaptation, which premiered on Broadway in 2003, was also coincidentally released during a momentous time.",
      "\u201cWhen \u2018Wicked\u2019 came around, it was a re-examination of that,\u201d Chu said. \u201cThat was right after 9/11 and about to go into war. So another time where America is in transition.\u201d",
      "The upcoming film\u2019s release comes on the heels of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s election victory, which Chu said amplifies the film\u2019s message.\u201cThis is the road we travel,\u201d Chu said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no yellow brick road and then maybe no wizard. Being uncomfortable, maybe yelling at each other a little bit, forgiving each other, having some grace for each other is the only way out.\u201d",
      "Chu also said he was surprised by the project\u2019s timing when it came to him.",
      "\u201cWhen this came to my desk, it was during the pandemic and I felt like, wow, this thing is so prophetic,\u201d Chu said. \u201cHow does it know that we would be going through this? We were questioning all the stories of America, of the world. Who\u2019s in control? Who\u2019s telling it? What does a hero look like? What does a villain look like?\u201d"

U.S. officials had resisted, citing concerns over limited stockpile, the repositioning of Russian assets outside of ATACMS range\u00a0and because Ukraine has been using other assets, primarily drones, with success, making ATACMS less critical to the fight.",

    "title": "Are Black Friday deals worth waiting for? Here\u2019s what to expect this year",
    "published": "Sun, 17 Nov 2024 16:19:18 GMT",
    "summary": "Typically, the five days beginning Thanksgiving Day and ending Cyber Monday are some of the busiest shopping days of the year.",
    "story": [
      "Typically, the\u00a0five days\u00a0beginning Thanksgiving Day and ending Cyber Monday are some of the busiest shopping days of the year.",
      "This year, the number of people shopping in stores and online during that period could hit a new record, according to the National Retail Federation\u2019s\u00a0annual survey.",
      "But consumers trying to make the most of the\u00a0Black Friday sales\u00a0may not be getting the best prices of the season.",
      "According to WalletHub\u2019s 2023\u00a0Best Things to Buy on Black Friday\u00a0report, 35% of items at major retailers offered no savings compared with their pre-Black Friday prices. The site compared Black Friday advertisements against prices on Amazon earlier that fall.",
      "\u201cSome Black Friday deals are misleading as retailers may inflate original prices to make a deal look like a better value,\u201d said consumer savings expert Andrea Woroch.",
      "This year, in particular, some of the deals are already as good as they are going to get.",
      "\u201cThose holidays have gotten a little watered down because retailers want to maximize the selling days,\u201d said Adam Davis,\u00a0managing director\u00a0at\u00a0Wells Fargo Retail Finance.",
      "\u201cCompounding the importance of stretching the holiday season, retailers are facing a shorter selling season between Thanksgiving and Christmas \u2014 almost a week shorter in 2024,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will force the retailer\u2019s hand to be pretty promotional in November.\u201d",
      "Concerns about shipping",
      "There\u2019s another good reason to shop early.",
      "Consumers are increasingly concerned that their online orders may not arrive in time for the holiday \u2014 and rightfully so.",
      "DHL Supply Chain\u2019s new CEO for North America, Patrick Kelleher,\u00a0recently told CNBC\u00a0that\u00a0items may arrive later than in years past, especially those ordered around big dates such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday.",
      "Retailers plan to deliver your holiday deals a little slower this year.",
      "In a period of such high volume, third-party shippers are particularly strained, according to Lauren Beitelspacher, a professor of marketing at Babson College. An ongoing labor shortage also means that some companies simply cannot hire enough workers to sort, transport and deliver packages on time.",
      "\u201cWe are very spoiled; we got to the point where we think of something we want and it magically appears,\u201d Beitelspacher said. But at the same time, \u201cwe\u2019ve learned how fragile the supply chain is.\u201d",
      "When there are more packages to ship, shipping times increase, which can also boost the chance they may get damaged, lost or stolen en route \u2014 not to mention the risk of \u201cporch piracy\u201d once an item is delivered.",
      "What discounts to expect on Black Friday",
      "\u201cYou are easily going to see 20% to 30% off,\u201d Davis said \u2014 but \u201cnot necessarily storewide.\u201d",
      "Depending on the retailer, some markdowns could be up to 50%, according to Beitelspacher. However, premium brands \u2014 including high-end activewear companies such as Nike, Alo or Lululemon \u2014 likely will not discount more than 20% or 30%, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a fine balance with maintaining the premium brand integrity and offering promotions.\u201d",
      "As in previous years, these companies are aware of how price sensitive consumers have become.",
      "\u201cThe holidays are a time people want to treat themselves, but they also want to make their dollar last longer,\u201d Beitelspacher said.",
      "To that end, retailers will also try to lure shoppers to spend with incentives, such as a free gift card with a minimum purchase, Woroch said. \u201cMany stores will also offer bonus rewards when you spend a certain amount on Black Friday.\u201d",
      "What not to buy on Black Friday",
      "Typically, Black Friday is a great time to find rock-bottom prices on fall clothing \u2014 including flannels, denim, coats and accessories \u2014 as well as televisions and consumer electronics.",
      "But hold off on beauty and footwear, which are typically better buys on Cyber Monday, Woroch said.",
      "For those planning a trip, \u201cTravel Tuesday\u201d is a good time to snag discounts on airfares, cruises and tour packages, with many hotels offering 20% to 30% off best available rates. Travelers can check out\u00a0Travel Tuesday deals from 2023\u00a0to get an idea of what to expect this year.",
      "With toys, it could pay to hold out until the last two weeks of December, and holiday decorations are cheaper the last few days before Christmas or right after, according to Woroch.",
      "Exercise equipment, linens and bedding tend to be marked down more during January\u2019s \u201cwhite sales,\u201d she said, and furniture and\u00a0mattress deals are often better over other holiday weekends throughout the year, such as Presidents\u2019 Day, Memorial Day and Labor Day weekends.",
      "How to get even lower prices",
      "Woroch recommends using a price-tracking browser extension such as\u00a0Honey or Camelizer to keep an eye on price changes and alert you when a price drops. Honey will also scan for applicable coupon codes.",
      "If you are shopping in person, try the ShopSavvy app for price comparisons. If an item costs less at another store or popular site, often the retailer will match the price, Woroch said.",
      "Further, stack discounts: Combining credit card rewards with coupon codes and a cash-back site such as CouponCabin.com will earn money back on those\u00a0purchases. Then, take pictures of your receipts using the Fetch app and get points that can be redeemed for gift cards at retailers such as Walmart, Target and Amazon.",
      "Finally, pay attention to price adjustment policies. \u201cIf an item you buy over Black Friday goes on sale for less shortly after, you may be able to request a price adjustment,\u201d Woroch said. Some retailers such as Target have season-long policies that may apply to purchases made up until Dec. 25."

      "Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., on Sunday defended Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s choice to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, saying that Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic, is \u201cextremely intelligent when it comes to\u201d vaccines and questioned levels of autism in the United States.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve sat down and had a long conversation with [Kennedy], and I actually find the guy extremely intelligent when it comes to this stuff. And some of this stuff does raise a lot of questions,\u201d Mullin told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d when asked whether Kennedy\u2019s history of questioning the efficacy of vaccines is a deal-breaker for the Oklahoma senator.",
      "\u201cI have said that there\u2019s some positives to vaccinations. I\u2019ve also questioned the vaccines multiple times, and I think they should be questioned,\u201d Mullin told moderator Kristen Welker before baselessly linking vaccines to autism, something that Kennedy has repeatedly done for years, even though there is no evidence that vaccines cause the condition.",
      "\u201cFor instance, why is America highest in autism? What is causing that? Is it our diet, or is it some of the stuff we\u2019re putting in our children\u2019s system?\u201c Mullin said, adding: \u201cWhat is causing that? And if it isn\u2019t vaccines, there\u2019s nothing wrong with actually taking a hard look and finding out, is that\u2019s what\u2019s causing it? Is it something else that we\u2019re putting in our systems? We do know we\u2019re not as healthy as we should be right now.\u201d",
      "While it is true that autism spectrum disorder has been diagnosed at increasing levels \u201cmost years since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began tracking ASD in 2000,\u201d according to the CDC, the agency notes that \u201cthe studies continue to show that vaccines are\u00a0not\u00a0associated with ASD.\u201d",
      "The agency points to two studies, one from the National Academy of Medicine and one from the CDC that found that vaccines do not cause autism. The first reviewed the safety of eight individual vaccines for children and adults. The second study reviewed antigens given to children during the first two years of life. Both studies found that vaccines are safe and do not cause autism.",
      "Kennedy has a long history of baselessly questioning the efficacy of vaccines and has also promoted conspiracy theories about fluoride, heavy metals in food and pesticides.",
      "Mullin also spoke on Sunday about some of Trump\u2019s other cabinet nominees, like former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who was nominated to be the next attorney general, and Fox News host Pete Hegseth, who was selected to be the next secretary of defense.",
      "Mullin agreed that he and Gaetz, who once served together in the House, \u201chave had our differences,\u201d but he added, \u201cMoving forward, I do, I do respect President Trump\u2019s right to appoint these individuals. But underneath Article Two, Section Two [of the U.S. Constitution], Congress has to advise and consent, and Matt Gaetz is going to go through the same scrutiny as every other individual, and I\u2019m going to give him a fair shot, just like every individual.\u201d",
      "Gaetz has long faced scrutiny from his colleagues and outsiders about\u00a0a years-long federal investigation launched by the Department of Justice, looking into allegations that he may have been involved in human trafficking or had sex with a minor.",
      "Gaetz has denied the allegations and the investigation ended with the Justice Department opting not to charge him.",
      "The House Ethics Committee launched its own investigation into Gaetz, but with his resignation from the House this week, it is unclear whether their report will ever be publicly released.",
      "Several senators, on both sides of the aisle,\u00a0have asked to see the report\u00a0as they consider how to vote on Gaetz\u2019s nomination and others still are skeptical that Gaetz will ever garner enough votes to be confirmed.",
      "Last week, an attorney for the 17-year-old who said she had sex with Gaetz while she was a minor called on the committee to release,\u00a0writing in a post on X\u00a0that \u201cshe was a high school student and there were witnesses\u201d when the alleged incident occurred.",
      "Also last week, a lawyer for another woman interviewed by the committee\u00a0said that his client\u00a0\u201ctestified to the House Ethics Committee\u00a0that she witnessed Rep. Gaetz having sex with a minor at a house party in Orlando in 2017.\u201d",
      "On Sunday, Mullin told Welker that the findings in the report \u201cshould be definitely part of our decision making\u201d as the Senate weighs whether to confirm Gaetz.",
      "\u201cI believe the, I believe the Senate should have access to that. Now, should it be released to the public or not? That, that\u2019s, I guess that will be part of the negotiations, but that should be definitely part of our decision making,\u201d Mullin said.",
      "He also defended Hegseth, who is facing a\u00a0newly-resurfaced allegation\u00a0of sexual assault. Hegseth has denied the allegation and has not been charged with a crime.",
      "In a statement to NBC News, Timothy Parlatore, Hegseth's attorney, denied the allegations but confirmed payments made to the accuser, saying in a statement that, \"This is a situation where a consensual encounter occurred and, unfortunately, the woman had to come up with a lie to explain why the woman had not come back to her husband\u2019s room that night. It wasn\u2019t reported until days later until there was pressure from her husband. It was fully investigated by police and video surveillance as well as multiple eyewitness statements show that she was the aggressor.\"",
      "\"Mr. Hegseth is completely innocent. It wasn\u2019t until a couple of years later after she lost her job that she began trying to squeeze Mr. Hegseth for money,\" Parlatore added. \u201cIn 2023, Hegseth paid the complainant as part of a civil confidential settlement agreement and maintains his innocence.\"",
      "\u201cI think he\u2019s a good pick,\u201d Mullin told Welker. \u201cBut once again, as allegations come out, we\u2019ll figure out if, as, as the Senate moves forward with the advise and consent to the President of the United States and doing our constitutional duties, we\u2019ll figure out if he can get confirmed or not, and, and I do think that Pete\u2019s a good pick for this position.\u201d",
      "Mullin also indicated that he would support Trump pursuing confirmation of some of his picks via the recess appointment process, something that Trump said he would ask of the Senate majority leader in a post on Truth Social before Senate Republicans elected Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., as their new majority leader last week.",
      "A recess appointment process would allow the president to place the House and Senate into recess so that he could appoint his nominees without having to go through the traditional Senate confirmation process.",
      "It\u2019s something that the Senate strives to avoid, and it\u2019s why the chamber gavels into pro forma sessions even while it\u2019s in recess.",
      "Mullin acknowledged that it is a \u201cvery difficult\u201d process and recalled that President Barack Obama tried to use the recess appointment process and was rebuked by the Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019d be the absolute last resort,\u201d Mullin told Welker. \u201cBut if that\u2019s what we have to do to get the confirmation through, then absolutely, let\u2019s do it. But I would say that would be last option.\u201d"

      "\u201cOh my god, I said the name of the bloody movie! Shut up, that\u2019s f------ funny,\u201d Charli XCX said before she started to cackle at her own joke.",
      "Other auditions included Devon Walker as Shannon Sharpe, Bowen Yang as Fran Lebowitz for the role of Madame Morrible, Fineman as Sydney Sweeney, Sarah Sherman as Bernie Sanders for the Mayor of Munchkinland, and Marcello Hern\u00e1ndez\u00a0as Sebastian Maniscalco for Doctor Dillamond.",

      "\u201cSome people are born wicked, while others have wickedness thrust upon them,\u201d Fineman said in Stewart\u2019s signature deadpan delivery. \u201cYou know, someone thrust upon me once, a wonderful Irishman.\u201d",
      "Yang reprised his Charli XCX impression from earlier in the season alongside the singer herself, who portrayed her \u201cSweat\u201d tour co-headliner Troye Sivan from his \u201cGot Me Started\u201d music video. The dynamic duo auditioned for the roles of Glinda and Elphaba.",
      "\u201cCan I call you Elphie?\u201d Yang asked, to which Charli XCX replied in an Australian accent, \u201cNo.\u201d",
      "Yang continued reading lines, adding, \u201cI only bullied you because I\u2019m a b---- and you\u2019re a witch? I\u2019m confused.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not a witch,\u201d Charli XCX clarified. \u201cI\u2019m a top.\u201d",
      "The sketch continued with more auditions, including Dana Carvey as Al Pacino, Fineman as Leslie Mann for Glinda, Hernandez as Bad Buddy, and Ego Nwodim as Janet Jackson, who immediately said that she didn\u2019t \u201cwant to be in this\u201d after hearing what the audition was for.",
      "In true \u201cWicked\u201d fashion, the sketch concluded with everyone trying to hit Elphaba\u2019s note at the end of \u201cDefying Gravity,\u201d which consisted mostly of yelling and some wine drinking for Charli XCX's Adele.",
      "A failed auditions sketch is tradition for \u201cSNL,\u201d which previously created fake celebrity auditions for movies including \u201cBack to the Future,\u201d \u201cStar Wars,\u201d \u201cTop Gun,\u201d \u201cJurassic Park,\u201d and more.",

      "The sketch featured Chloe Fineman doing her Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet impression, Sarah Sherman as John Mulaney, and former cast member Molly Kearney as the Kevin James meme."

      "In a \u201cWeekend Update\u201d appearance, cast member Sarah Sherman took on the role of Peanut\u2019s widow to share her thoughts on his untimely death. Dressed from head to tail in a realistic squirrel costume, Sherman\u2019s squirrelly look was accented with a black woven shawl and pill box hat as she continued to mourn the loss of her husband, Peanut.",
      "Colin Jost thanked Sherman for being there, referring to her as Mrs. Nut before she insisted that he just simply call her Hazel.",
      "Jost asked Sherman how she was handling Peanut's death, causing her to open up about how hard it was to be \u201cthrust in the media spotlight.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m used to doing regular squirrel stuff, like chasing my own tail or running into the middle of a street, seeing a car, and then,\u201d she explained, before she started to panic and shake and then froze and stared straight ahead.",
      "Sherman recalled the day that she and Peanut had first met, sharing that she was minding her own business near a tree as she was \u201csqwerking.\u201d",
      "When Jost questioned the act, Sherman explained, \u201cIt\u2019s when a squirrel shakes their entire body to attract a mate like this.\u201d She then demonstrated the act by standing up and shaking her body uncontrollably as she panted.",
      "Jost pointed out that she \u201clooked a little nuts,\u201d which caused her to freak out and yell, \u201cNuts? Where?\u201d before shaking violently again in excitement.",
      "When prompted by Jost to share more about Peanut\u2019s demise, Sherman explained, \u201cWell, the cops raided our house and then Peanut bit one like a damn hero.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnyways, then they abducted Peanut and chopped his head off in a rabies test, that\u2019s how they really test for rabies, Colin,\u201d Sherman added.",
      "Jost tried to provide comfort to Sherman during her time of mourning, expressing that he hoped she could find closure and move on after Peanut\u2019s death.",
      "\u201cOh, what life? I\u2019m a widow at four, Colin,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cI\u2019m so old, that the only person that wants to hit it is Jake Paul.\u201d",

    "published": "Sun, 17 Nov 2024 15:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Kennedy Ryan just rereleased her 2021 book \"Reel\" with a new cover and epilogue. She tells TODAY.com about her publishing journey and the importance of the romance genre.",
    "story": [
      "Does Kennedy Ryan like making her readers cry?",
      "Technically, yes, she says.",
      "The bestselling author, who\u2019s celebrating the rerelease of her novel \u201cReel,\u201d loves writing emotionally charged journeys.",
      "\u201cI like creating stories where people are going to feel things deeply. Writing is not just vocational. I see it as a calling,\u201d Ryan tells TODAY.com. \u201cI see my purpose for being here on Earth to write stories that crater in people\u2019s hearts. And when something has that kind of emotional impact, it lasts.\u201d",
      "\u201cReel,\u201d which was self-published by Ryan in 2021, is the first book in her \"Hollywood Renaissance\" series. It follows Broadway actor Neevah Saint and director Canon Holt as they film a biopic of fictional Harlem Renaissance entertainer Dessi Blue. During production, the two begin to fall in love and must navigate the adversities that arise when their professional and personal relationships intertwine.",
      "The book is a fan-favorite in the romance space, and in 2022, Ryan and her narrators became the first Black recipients of the romance category Audie, a prestigious award in audio publishing.",
      "Now, the book is being republished (with a brand new cover and epilogue!) by the Hachette Book Group\u2019s Forever imprint \u2014 part of Ryan\u2019s efforts to take her stories centering Black and brown women \u201cas far as they possibly could,\u201d Ryan says.",
      "'Reel' is a love letter to the Harlem Renaissance \u2014 and Black creatives",
      "Ryan remembers the exact moment she was inspired to write most of her books. But for \u201cReel,\u201d it was just there, she says.",
      "\u201c\u2018Reel\u2019 is the only book I can\u2019t remember how I decided to write it. And I think that\u2019s part of why it was so special,\" she says.",
      "The Harlem Renaissance, a period from the 1910s to mid-1930s that saw the meteoric rise of Black artistry, inspired much of \"Reel\" and the character of Dessi Blue.",
      "\u201cMy favorite people to write about are creatives, so this series is like a playground for me,\u201d Ryan says.",
      "The 1999 biopic \u201cIntroducing Dorothy Dandridge,\u201d starring Halle Berry, was the catalyst for Dessi Blue\u2019s character. Dandridge, who was an actor and singer, was the first African American woman to be nominated for best actress at the Academy Awards for her role in 1954\u2019s \u201cCarmen Jones.\u201d (Berry would go on to win the award for her role in 2001\u2019s \"Monster\u2019s Ball\" and remains the only Black woman to have done so.)",
      "Ryan notes that before that film, many people weren't familiar with Dandridge, inspiring her to explore the unsung accomplishments of Black creatives through Dessi's biopic.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s how I started contextualizing \u2018Reel\u2019 as a love letter to Black creatives who, not just during the Harlem Renaissance, but throughout history, have done so much and contributed so much and not been acknowledged,\" Ryan says. \"Black music, I would hazard to say, is the most influential in culture. We wouldn\u2019t have most of the music that we have in this country without Black creatives, so I wanted to lean into that excellence.\u201d",
      "Dessi Blue is inspired by an amalgamation of artists from the Harlem Renaissance, such as Billie Holiday, Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith. And though her character is fictional, Ryan says she does receive messages from fans saying they\u2019ve tried to look up Dessi Blue.",
      "\u201c(Dessi's story) is just their real experiences fictionalized,\u201d Ryan says. \u201cEven the fact that she\u2019s bisexual. That was something that some of those women navigated during that time, and I wanted that representation as a part of her story as well.\u201d",
      "Kennedy Ryan's road to traditional publication",
      "\u201cReel\u201d is just one of Ryan\u2019s many books to be picked up for distribution from a traditional publisher.",
      "\u201cYou know, a lot of people don\u2019t realize that I had a four-book series that I published traditionally. That was my debut series,\" she says.",
      "But when self-publishing was starting to flourish, Ryan, who describes herself as a go-getter, decided to try her hand at it because she wanted creative control of her work.",
      "\u201cI wanted the autonomy to build my own brand based on my values, aesthetically and just what I wanted it to be,\" she says.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re a self-published author, you do (almost) everything,\" she adds. \"You are responsible for everything. It\u2019s a business and that really tapped into something that I love.\u201d",
      "Traditional publishers were knocking on Ryan\u2019s door for years before she decided to return, she says. She knew she wanted her stories that center around Black and brown women to reach a wide audience and saw traditional publishing as a path to accomplishing that goal.",
      "\u201cI knew that the brand that I was building was centering Black and brown women very explicitly. I wanted to see them on shelves at Target. I wanted to see them at Barnes & Noble. I wanted to see them at indie bookstores. I wanted to see them on billboards,\" she says. \"These Black women with these big afros, just unapologetically gorgeous, because that\u2019s something that defies what culture tells us about ourselves. I wanted those stories to go as far as they possibly could.\"",
      "Kennedy Ryan always wants to get it right",
      "Like her character Canon in \"Reel,\" Ryan is an obsessive creative and tends to get lost in studying. She says that about 60% of her creative process is just made up of research, and when she\u2019s writing one book, she's usually reading five or six more around the same time. To make \u201cReel\u201d feel as authentic as possible, Ryan went on a deep dive on all things movie-making.",
      "\u201cI blocked off maybe a month to five weeks where I did nothing but watch MasterClasses,\" she says, referring to the online learning streaming platform. \"I just subscribed, and I watched all the greats who have MasterClasses: directors, cinematographers, writers, actors. I just consumed that world.\u201d",
      "Ryan's books often contain elements that do not come from her lived experiences. So she makes it a point to conduct thorough interviews and deep conversations with individuals who have had those experiences, she says. In addition, she says she involves sensitivity readers throughout the writing process.",
      "It\u2019s part of her personal \u201cHippocratic Oath\u201d of writing: \u201cIf you\u2019re writing a great book, but you\u2019re harming a community that\u2019s vulnerable, that\u2019s marginalized, that\u2019s not your lived experience in the process \u2014\u00a0I don\u2019t want it. That\u2019s my philosophy,\" she says.",
      "In \"Reel,\" Ryan's character Neevah lives with lupus, an autoimmune disease that involves the body\u2019s immune system attacking healthy tissue and organs. Ryan says she conducted multiple interviews with people who have lupus to develop a complete understanding of what it\u2019s like to live with the chronic disease.",
      "She also wanted to ensure women like Neevah felt seen.",
      "\u201cI wanted women who are living with chronic illness, specifically lupus, to feel beautiful, to feel loved, to feel like they weren\u2019t too much,\" she says.",
      "This is particularly highlighted in what Ryan calls \u201cthe hottest scene in the book\u201d \u2014 the bathtub scene.",
      "\u201cI wanted women who are navigating that to know you\u2019re still beautiful, you\u2019re still sexy... there\u2019s still someone who is completely drawn to you no matter what,\" she says.",
      "Having hard and honest conversations \u2013 via romance",
      "It\u2019s no secret that the romance genre has been historically looked down upon. Ryan believes animosity toward the romance genre is rooted in patriarchy and misogyny.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s rooted in the resistance of anything that centers women\u2019s pleasure, that centers our agency, that esteems our wishes, anything that is counter cultural. There is a broader cultural resistance to what we\u2019re doing,\u201d she says.",
      "Ryan also believes that people underestimate what romance is capable of. She describes her books as \u201cTrojan horses\u201d to \u201csmuggle in discourse\u201d and start difficult conversations readers may not usually have.",
      "\u201cThe reason I say that (romance) is the safest place to have hard discussions is because you know you\u2019re going to get a happily ever after. We might unpack some really hard things, but it\u2019s going to be OK in the end,\u201d she says.",
      "She says she strives for her books to be both \"trauma-informed\" and \"trauma-responsive.\"",
      "\u201cAnd what that means is there\u2019s a path that\u2019s laid for healing,\" she says. \"When you approach writing difficult circumstances that way, it\u2019s a safer space to have those discussions, and it can be really healing for readers, especially who have experienced some of those things.\u201d",
      "What\u2019s next for the Hollywood Renaissance series?",
      "Just a few months after the rerelease of \"Reel,\" Ryan will publish the third and final book in her \"Skyland\" series, \"Can't Get Enough,\" out May 2025. That series kicked off with \"Before I Let Go\" in 2022.",
      "After wrapping \"Skyland,\" Ryan says she will be focusing on the next installment in the \"Hollywood Renaissance\" series, \u201cScore.\u201d \u201cScore\u201d will be a second-chance romance that focuses on the film\u2019s music supervisor and screenwriter, Monk and Verity.",
      "\u201cIt is a book that I have wanted to write for about three years, you know? When I wrote \u2018Reel\u2019 originally, I was going to go right into writing \u2018Score,\u2019 but then I got a book deal to write the \u2018Skyland\u2019 series. So I\u2019ve been in 'Skyland' for three years, and I\u2019m really just itching to write Monk and Verity\u2019s story,\u201d Ryan says.",
      "\u201cThey have a very complex history, and I look forward to unpacking how complex and angsty it is,\" she adds.",
      "As for any adaptations on the horizon? While \"Before I Let Go\" is currently being adapted for television, she\u2019s also hoping to find a production partner who shares her vision and wants to bring \u201cReel\u201d to the big screen.",
      "\u201cWhen people ask me, \u2018Which of your books do you most want to see on screen?\u2019 I always say \u2018Reel.' It\u2019s the book that so many readers ask me for on screen,\" Ryan says. \"So I\u2019m working on it. Fingers crossed.\u201d"

      "\"Usually with a lot of shows, you\u2019ll have a big beginning and then you have to get all the way to the finale to get the cliffhanger. This series is a cliffhanger after each and every episode,\" Morgan explains.",
      "\"Beauty in Black\" follows the Bellaire family as they navigate family rifts, infidelity and a lawsuit against their hair care company. Along the way, several members of the family find themselves mixed up with a corrupt strip club that has trapped its employees in an endless cycle of illegal sex work.",

      "Throughout the first half of the season, Olivia\u2019s ex-husband Horace (Ricco Ross) has been frequenting a local strip club. Though he requests private time with a female exotic dancer named Kimmie (Taylor Polidore Williams), he really has his sights set on a male dancer named Angel (Xavier Smalls).",
      "As he gets to know Kimmie and learns that her friend Rain (Amber Reign Smith) is in the hospital, he agrees to go visit her since Kimmie's pimp forbids her from seeing her. Meanwhile, Kimmie arranges for Angel to dance privately for Horace.",
      "When Kimmie goes to Horace's house one day, she realizes he's rich and suspects that he's involved in the strip club operations since he's pictured with her pimp who manages the club.",
      "Kimmie later finds out from patients at the hospital that Rain has died and she suspects that Horace never visited her.",
      "Frustrated by the news, Kimmie agrees to Angel's idea to rob Horace so they can both escape their torturous lives at the strip club. However, their plans are short-lived after a group of masked men enter Horace's house while he's entertaining Angel and Kimmie.",
      "Horace shoots the invaders before they can rob his safe and demands answers from Angel and Kimmie, since he thinks they're involved. They explain that they work for a pimp named Jules (Charles Malik Whitfield) who has forced them into sex work to repay their debts since he got them out of past legal trouble.",
      "Horace then lets them go and calls Jules, who also happens to be his security guard. He asks him about a judge he once knew, presumably the one who helped Jules get his dancers pardoned from legal charges.",
      "When Kimmie returns to her motel room, she encounters Body (Tamera Kissen), a stripper and low-level boss who works at the strip club with her.",
      "Body, who is convinced that Kimmie is trying to take her place, reveals that she's kidnapped Kimmie's teenage sister and will be making her work for her. As she sees her sister being driven away, Kimmie starts fighting Body and then runs over to her car, where she jumps in and drives it into her nemesis.",
      "Early on in the season, Body encourages Rain to get a Brazilian butt lift from a shady lady who performed Body's procedure. The surgery goes horribly wrong and Rain ends up in the hospital. When Kimmie goes to visit her one day, other patients who were in the same hall as Rain say that she died.",
      "As Kimmie prepares to rob Horace, she gets a call from Rain and is shocked to hear that her friend is still alive. Rain is in a top-notch hospital (all thanks to Horace) and Angel and Kimmie eventually go visit her there.",
      "Mallory has been sneaking around with her driver Calvin (Shannon Wallace) and her husband Roy (Julian Horton) begins to suspect something when they're in the car together and he notices that his wife isn't wearing underwear.",
      "On the ride home, they come across an accident and Mallory realizes that it's Charles' car that's on fire. She then calls her father-in-law to come to the scene.",
      "When does 'Beauty in Black' Part 2 air ?",
      "With so many unanswered questions looming, Morgan understands why viewers are so eager to see Part Two of Season One, which will premiere in the spring and feature another eight episodes.",
      "\u201cTyler knows his audience and he has his pulse on what his loyal and faithful fans want to watch. And it\u2019s always these over the top, thrilling, sitting on the edge of your seat waiting to see what\u2019s going to happen next (moments),\" she says.",
      "What happens in Part 2 of 'Beauty in Black'?",
      "Though it's still uncertain what will happen in the Season One, Part Two of \"Tyler Perry's Beauty in Black,\" Morgan teases that as the season progresses, viewers will get to see more of Olivia.",
      "\"This role is so delicious, so juicy,\" she tells TODAY.com. \"And for an actor, it\u2019s always so much more fun to play a bad, flawed character. But also in playing a character like this, I wanted to make sure that you saw there was a soft spot somewhere, some vulnerability.\"",
      "\"And you see that with her love for Charles in protecting him,\" she adds.",
      "After the finale aired, viewers began to share memes of the characters on social media. Several X users applauded Morgan's performance, including one who wrote, \"OLIVIAAAAA! I just love seeing Debbi Morgan on my screen & I better see more of her in season 2.\"",
      "Another shared the following reaction alongside a GIF of her character: \"Debbi Morgan has been pretty all her life. She IS #BeautyInBlack.\"",
      "Morgan is entertained by fans' reaction to the series and that some have went as far to share memes of her on social media.",
      "\u201cI think anything that keeps the audience interested and entertained that they want to be making all of these memes (is wonderful). It just (shows) how addicted they are to the show, which is great. That's exactly what we all want,\" she says.",
      "As is often the case, the show has received some mixed reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes gave it a score of 51% and Decider called the show \"about a subtle as a slap in the face.\"",
      "Essence, meanwhile, bemoaned the series' sexual content, saying it \"often feels unneeded,\" and said \"much of the series can feel hollow.\"",
      "Morgan says she doesn't let the critic reviews get to her.",
      "\u201cTo me, it\u2019s not about the critics. It\u2019s about what the fans love, what they want to see,\" she says. \"It seems to me you shouldn\u2019t necessarily ignore (viewers' opinions) if people are loving the show (just) because it\u2019s not a show for you. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not a good show.\""

      "Her decision came down to Chock Chapple, a 60-year-old insurance executive from Wichita, Kansas, and Guy Gansert, a 66-year-old ER doctor from Reno, Nevada. Ultimately, she chose Chock \u2014 the man who said, over and over, he was \"crazy about her.\"",
      "Joan, who lost her husband John to pancreatic cancer in 2021, was previously a contestant on \u201cThe Golden Bachelor.\u201d She departed the season voluntarily to care for her daughter, who had recently given birth.",
      "\"I feel happy about my future now that it looks a lot brighter. Chock is the reason for all of this,\" Joan said in a confessional interview.",
      "What happened in the 'Golden Bachelorette' finale?",
      "Chock emerged as a frontrunner early on, but his connection with Joan was cemented after meeting her adult children.",
      "The meeting was emotional \u2014 Joan's son Nick seemed to initially balk when Chock kissed Joan on the lips as a way of a greeting.",
      "But her kids came around. Chock promised that he was not here to \"replace\" their late father in any \"way shape or form.\"",
      "Joan and her kids also marked the difficulty of her moving on romantically. \u201cIf I loved Dad so much, would I be able to fall in love again?\u201d Joan questioned. Nick cheered her on, saying he and his sister were \"proud\" to see her \"take risks,\" and proud of the \"incredible strength\" she demonstrates.",
      "Chock, on his end, said he had a \"great time,\" calling her family \"good people.\"",
      "After the date, Chock declared his love for Joan. While Joan didn't respond, it was enough for her to decide that Chock would be her future husband. She realized was worthy of love \u2014 which came into question following her breakup with contestant Pascal Ibgui.",
      "The episode before the finale, Pascal, a salon owner from Chicago, broke up with Joan in an emotional boat cruise in Tahiti, telling her that he didn\u2019t feel a strong connection.",
      "\"It just makes me feel like I'm unlovable,\" Joan said at the time of the breakup. \"If he couldn't love me, how could anybody love me?\"",
      "And so, before Guy had the opportunity to meet Joan's family, Joan broke up with him. During the \"After the Final Rose\" special, she clarified that she was \"getting there\" with Guy, but they needed more time.",
      "\"It was really, really hard at the end to say goodbye to you because in any other situation, I would have been with you because we would have had more time,\" she said. \"It was absolutely nothing you did. I have missed you. It's been really hard to be away from you.\"",

      "In his proposal, Chock said he was \"so absolutely happy\" to be in her life, and have her in his. He acknowledged their late partners and said he would \"honor\" John by \"loving her every day.\"",
      "Joan, similarly, acknowledged the difficulty of having Chock step away from filming because his mother passed away. This, she said, was the moment she knew she couldn't complete the show's journey without him.",
      "\"We are living proof that no matter what life throws at you, there is still hope, even at our age,\" Joan said, proceeding to tell Chock she loved him for the first time.",
      "And with that, Chock got down on one knee and proposed with a Neil Lane ring (naturally). She gave him the final golden rose.",
      "After the proposal, the happy couple FaceTimed with Joan's mom from the beach, who expressed her shock and delight at meeting her daughter's new partner.",
      "\"I never in a million years thought I'd feel love like this again. Ever,\" Joan said.",

      "The couple confirmed it in an interview.",
      "\"This feels so good. I'm looking at our family and friends who we've never gotten to be with together, so it's so nice to finally be able to share our love and our story and our future with them,\" Joan said to her loved ones, who were sitting in the audience.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t be happier and I want the world to know it,\u201d Chock said. He then spoke up for his fianc\u00e9e for her behavior on the show. \u201cI want to tell the world, the fans, how classy Joan is and the respect she gave all the other guys,\u201d he added.",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 17:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "\"Cobra Kai\" Season 6, Part 2, premiering on Netflix on Nov. 15, provides new developments in the backstory for Mr. Miyagi, the late Pat Morita's \"Karate Kid\" character.",
    "story": [
      "Warning: Spoilers below for \u201cCobra Kai\u201d Season 6, Part 2.",
      "After three movies and several TV seasons, Ralph Macchio's Daniel LaRusso is still learning more about his mentor and sensei, Mr. Miyagi.",
      "Pat Morita originated the role in the 1984 film that started it all, \"The Karate Kid.\" He returned for \"The Karate Kid Part II,\" \"The Karate Kid Part III\" and the Hilary Swank-led \"The Next Karate Kid.\"",
      "Daniel's story picked up back up in 2018 with the premiere of \"Cobra Kai.\" While Morita died in November 2005, his character has appeared in the Netflix spinoff show through archival footage.",
      "Fans of the show know that Mr. Miyagi has become an almost omnipresent figure, guiding Daniel even in death as Daniel tries to take up the mantle of sensei for the next generation of Los Angeles karate prodigies. He names his dojo Miyago-Do and tries to pass on the teachings of his late mentor, often running up against rival Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka).",
      "But Season 6 complicates what Daniel knew about Mr. Miyagi's past. For a quick refresher, in the original \"Karate Kid\" film, Mr. Miyagi tells a young Daniel that he served in World War II and his wife died in childbirth at a U.S. internment camp. \"The Karate Kid Part II\" dove deeper into his past in Okinawa, revealing that Miyagi left Japan for Hawaii after a falling out with his best friend Sato, the uncle of Chozen (Yuji Okumoto).",
      "Flash forward to Season 6 of \"Cobra Kai.\" In Part 1 \u2014 which comprises the first five episodes of the season \u2014 Daniel unearths a box that belonged to Mr. Miyagi. Inside, he finds boxing gloves, a passport, a piece of fabric and a newspaper clipping with the headline \"Police search for assailant,\" dated to 1947. The passport features a photo of Mr. Miyagi next to the name \"Keisuke Miyagi,\" rather than Nariyoshi, the first name Daniel knew him to have. The clipping also reveals that Keisuke Miyagi was accused of violent robbery and assault.",
      "The boxing gloves and passport address lead Daniel to a gym. A man, purporting to be the grandson of the gym's original owner, says Mr. Miyagi was a silent partner in the gym. The man also reveals that Mr. Miyagi at one point fled the United States.",
      "In the last scene of Episode 5, Daniel realizes the significance of the headband. After Miyagi-Do qualifies for an international karate tournament in Barcelona, the Sekai Taikai, Daniel realizes the fabric matches the headbands awarded to team captains. The moment implies that Mr. Miyagi has a history at the Sekai Taikai, sending Daniel on a mission to learn more about his mentor's past \u2014\u00a0and all its dark twists and turns.",
      "Macchio describes the box and its revelations as something that \"unravels\" Daniel.",
      "\"He\u2019s kind of chasing the past instead of focusing on the present, let alone the future, for his students and everyone else,\" Macchio tells TODAY.com.",
      "Digging into Mr. Miyagi's past in Part 2, which consists of Episodes 6-10 and dropped on Netflix Nov. 15, will bring new obstacles. But his character can't help but investigate, Macchio says.",
      "\"When you have loss in your life, whether it\u2019s a parent or a mentor or a brother or sister, and you have something unknown, you grasp it, wanting to understand,\" Macchio says. \"It\u2019s important to go through that to get to the other side, to the resolve of what that is.",
      "\"In Part 2, it\u2019s the deepest and darkest dive for him that gets him a bit in trouble,\" Macchio adds.",
      "What is Mr. Miyagi's secret in 'Cobra Kai' Season 6?",
      "Once the Miyagi-Do crew arrives in Barcelona for the Sekai Taikai, Daniel starts asking organizers if they recognize Mr. Miyagi's headband. In Episode 6, a woman representing the company that makes the tournament's official apparel tells Daniel that Miyagi's headband was likely from the \"1950s era, maybe even 1940s,\" meaning Mr. Miyagi was likely involved in the Sekai Taikai after World War II.",
      "The headband is coated in dried blood, and one of the organizers reveals that the Sekai Taikai tournaments \"were even more brutal back then.\"",
      "Daniel's search for more info about Miyagi's background with the tournament hits a snag in Episode 7. After following a lead to speak with a Mr. Serrano, a former champion old enough to potentially have more information, Daniel falls into a trap and ends up caged. He eventually escapes and fights his way out in direct combat with a man with a snake \u2014 specifically the Cobra Kai symbol \u2014 tattooed on his arm.",
      "Shenanigans ensue, including the return of the No. 3 most villainest \"Karate Kid\" universe villain according to TODAY.com, Terry Silver (Thomas Ian Griffith), who was responsible for kidnapping Daniel. At the end of Episode 9, Silver, now associated with the defending champions, the Iron Dragons dojo, gives Daniel a manila envelope.",
      "\"A gift, from me to you,\" Silver says.",
      "Inside is a piece of paper, purportedly the Sekai Taikai record from the year Mr. Miyagi competed. The spreadsheet shows that Miyagi faced someone named Claramunt. In the final score column, it simply says, \"Death.\"",
      "\"He killed his opponent,\" Daniel says in shock.",
      "The Part 2 finale opens with Daniel dreaming. In the sequence, he faces a young Mr. Miyagi, as someone from the crowd shouts, \"Kill him, Miyagi-san.\"",
      "The fight starts, and the young Miyagi gets off the first and second points. \"If this is a lesson, I'm not getting it,\" Daniel says.",
      "\"Lesson?\" the dream Miyagi responds in Japanese.",
      "\"There's so much you never told me,\" Daniel says next. \"I just need to understand why.\"",
      "\"That was always your problem, Daniel-san. So eager to understand, but not willing to accept,\" Miyagi says.",
      "Daniel, now lying on his back, looks up at Miyagi before the final hit. He blinks, and a face resembling Morita's looks back at him and says, \"Miyagi never tell you everything, Daniel-san, because you were never strong enough to accept truth.\"",
      "After waking up, Daniel goes back to the tournament organizers, and they authenticate the sheet of paper with the record of Mr. Miyagi's fight.",
      "\"Sadly, the rare death did occur in that era,\" the organizer says. \"It was a different time.\"",
      "Johnny suggests it might have been a \"freak accident.\"",
      "The Part 2 finale ends before Daniel can uncover more details about Mr. Miyagi's past. By Episode 10, both Miyagi-Do and Cobra Kai are in the semifinals of the Sekai Taikai. Team captains from the remaining dojos \u2014\u00a0including Miyagi-Do's Robby (Tanner Buchanan) and Sam (Mary Mouser) and Cobra Kai's Tory (Peyton List) and Kwon (Brandon H. Lee) \u2014 have to fight in one-on-one matches to qualify for the championship.",
      "In the middle of Robby's match against one of the Iron Dragons, an eliminated team attacks an organizer, starting a brawl between all of the dojos. During the fight, Kreese tries to go after Silver with an eunjangdo, a small knife, before realizing he had dropped it on the mat.",
      "Kwon finds the knife and tries to use it while fighting with one of the Iron Dragons. Instead, after getting his leg swept in midair, he falls on his stomach, landing on the knife. Daniel rolls Kwon over, the blade sticking out of his chest.",
      "So death in the Sekai Taikai might not just be a thing of the past. Similarly, the death that resulted from Mr. Miyagi's fight in the Sekai Taikai might not be so straightforward.",
      "Macchio tells TODAY.com that a resolution to the Miyagi mystery will occur in \u201cthe full course of Season 6,\u201d which consists of 15 episodes in total. Part 3 of \u201cCobra Kai\u201d Season 6 is expected in 2025.",
      "Miyagi's backstory also \"opens up more into the Miyagi-verse,\" Macchio says, which is notably expanding in May 2025 with the film \"Karate Kid: Legends,\" starring Macchio and Jackie Chan.",
      "While it's unclear how everything will shake out, Macchio notes that Season 6 won't \"taint\" the Mr. Miyagi that fans know and love.",
      "\"We never want to taint who the essence of that character was,\" Macchio says. \"But we\u2019re all human, and everyone has flaws.\u201d",

      "From the moment he arrives home, Drew Scott says, he plays a \u201cWhere\u2019s Waldo?\u201d-like game with son Parker and his 5-month-old daughter, Piper, both of whom he shares with wife Linda Phan.",
      "\u201cTheir playroom is up on the upper level, and then there\u2019s the living room \u2026 so whenever I come home, because I give Linda a heads-up when I\u2019m almost home, inevitably, they\u2019re at one of the windows,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s just, for me, is always a sweet thing.\u201d",

So if I\u2019m looking closely, I\u2019ll find him,\u201d he describes. \u201cAnd he\u2019s tapping on the window, it's this little soft tap.

      "Israel\u2019s war against the Lebanese militia group Hezbollah has killed more than 3,200 people and displaced more than a million others in Lebanon according to local officials, as its military vows to end Hezbollah\u2019s ability to launch rocket and other attacks into northern Israel, which has forced around 60,000 Israelis to flee their homes near the border.",
      "But the conflict is also taking a devastating toll on Lebanon\u2019s unique and ancient heritage, with airstrikes wiping out centuries-old villages and endangering fragile, millennia-old archaeological sites, like the celebrated Roman ruins of Baalbek, designated a World Heritage site by United Nations body UNESCO.",
      "The historic village of Mhaibib, home to an ancient shrine, and the town of Nabatiyeh, which had a centuries-old souk, have been completely destroyed, according to social media reviewed by NBC News and interviews with former residents.",
      "Lebanon, a tiny country of around 5 million people in the eastern Mediterranean, is steeped in history and boasts five other World Heritage Sites.",
      "The country has been at the crossroads of ancient civilizations, having hosted Phoenician, Egyptian, Greek, Persian and Roman towns, temples and monuments. Later, Christian crusaders built citadels along the coast that went on to be repurposed by Muslim Ottoman rulers.",
      "Some sites date back to the\u00a0Paleolithic period, hundreds of thousands of years ago, when humans first learned to use stone tools.",
      "Satellite images show Israeli forces have leveled several southern towns and villages near the border with Lebanon, while near-daily airstrikes also pound alleged Hezbollah targets in southern Beirut, causing windows and walls to shake across the city.",
      "Attacks have also targeted the region of Baalbek in eastern Lebanon, home to one of the world\u2019s most spectacular Roman sites, featuring colossal imperial temples and an amphitheater featuring colossal imperial temples still used for modern-day concerts.",
      "Singers have included Arab luminaries such as Fairuz and Umm Kulthum, and Western artists such as Nina Simone, Placido Domingo, Massive Attack and Deep Purple.",
      "An airstrike in early November flattened a building and destroyed buses yards away from one of the Roman structures, adding to mounting alarm among Lebanese lawmakers, who called for international intervention.",
      "\u201cThis appeal goes beyond physical preservation. It is about safeguarding the traditions, stories and values these sites represent, legacies that connect our past to our future,\u201d Lebanese lawmaker Najat Saliba told an emergency news conference earlier this month.",
      "\u2018Enemy like Israel\u2019",

      "According to biblical tradition, King Hiram of Tyre sent materials and craftsmen to help with the construction of Solomon\u2019s Temple in Jerusalem around 957 B.C., a key moment in Jewish history.",
      "\u201cI am crying. \u2026 If we have an enemy like Israel, what can we do with him? What can we do?\u201d said Siklaoui, who oversees heritage sites in southern Lebanon, speaking to NBC News at the national museum in the capital Beirut.",
      "Blasts from Israeli airstrikes a short drive away in the city\u2019s southern suburbs could be felt and heard during the interview.",
      "The museum\u2019s enormous Roman sarcophagi featuring reliefs of scenes from the Trojan War \u2014 like the king of Troy begging the Greek hero Achilles for his son Hector\u2019s body \u2014 attest to Lebanon\u2019s cultural treasures, some of which remain buried in and around ancient sites, archaeologists say.",
      "Israel\u2019s military says it only targets Hezbollah, but accuses the group of embedding itself in and near civilian infrastructure, including heritage sites.",
      "But even if a site isn\u2019t directly targeted, the fighting can be devastating.",
      "Lebanese archaeologist Tania Zaven, regional director of archaeological sites in northern Mount\u00a0Lebanon, said the vibrations from airstrikes can crack and even topple delicate ancient structures, and destroy artifacts in the ground that are yet to be excavated.",
      "She said she was also worried that historical sites are increasingly becoming casualties of war, citing the Islamic State militant group\u2019s destruction of ancient structures and statues in northern Iraq and Syria between 2013 and 2019, as well as the Taliban\u2019s destruction of Afghanistan\u2019s Bamiyan Buddhas in 2001.",
      "The lawlessness that followed the United States\u2019 2003 Iraq invasion saw its national museum looted, and U.S. and Iraqi government offensives against the Islamic State saw much of the old city of Mosul reduced to rubble.",

      "William has thought about how he might make his mark and approach things differently in both his current role as the Prince of Wales and, one day, as king, NBC\u00a0News royal commentator\u00a0Daisy McAndrew said.",
      "\u201cHe will be all too aware of how dangerous it is for the royal family to be seen to be out of touch or aloof and hence the emphasis on empathy and emotional intelligence,\u201d she said.",
      "British tabloids offered positive coverage, with The Mirror describing William's comments as a \"huge royal shake-up\" and The Sun splashing: \"MONARCHY WITH EMPATHY.\"",
      "But the comments have not received a universally warm response.",
      "Graham Smith, CEO of the anti-monarchy campaign group Republic, told NBC News of the heir to the throne: \u201cHis \u2018r\u2019 couldn\u2019t get any smaller, to be honest. He barely does anything at all. He\u2019s an incredibly lazy man who manages to get a pretty small splashing of engagements to look like he is busy.\u201d",
      "Prince Harry\u2019s decision to step away from royal duties and his subsequent move to the United States has fueled a public conversation about the monarchy's relevance and future in Britain.",
      "\u201cWhat Harry has done is shown that royals can walk away and do the right thing under their own steam. They can fund their own lifestyles and get celebrity endorsements and do just fine,\u201d Smith said.",
      "\u201cSo why his brother feels that he needs to hang on to the titles and the status and the public money, I think, is a question that is only highlighted by Harry\u2019s departure,\u201d he added.",
      "Kensington Palace did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Dressing down",
      "William\u2019s effort to appear less formal even extends to his choice of clothes, McAndrew suggested.",
      "He sparked a debate on social media during his South Africa trip when he wore white trainers and an open-necked shirt.",
      "Royal fashion is a subject of intense scrutiny, so \u201cbeing out of touch also extends to actions as well as words and even to what clothes the royals wear,\u201d McAndrew said.",
      "\u201cDressing down ticks two boxes \u2014 less extravagant and more \u2018normal\u2019. But, some members of the public actively want their royals to be as glamorous\u00a0as possible, so it\u2019s a fine line,\u201d she added.",
      "But for Smith, this highlights a broader contradiction.",
      "Because their status comes from the institution itself, the public\u2019s interest in the royals isn\u2019t about seeing them as regular people, he  said.",
      "\u201cI guess what he\u2019s trying to say is he wants to look less royal. But, you know, if you look less royal, then what\u2019s the point of being a royal?\u201d Smith said.",
      "William's comments about changing the royals' approach follow a particularly difficult time for the family.",
      "He also spoke last week about how \u201cbrutal\u201d the past year has been, with his wife and his father diagnosed with cancer.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been dreadful. It\u2019s probably been the hardest year in my life,\u201d he told Sky News.",

      "The easing of longtime restrictions comes as North Korea has deployed thousands of troops to the Kursk region of Russia to support Russian troops fighting Ukrainian forces.",
      "The new authority applies to Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, which Ukrainian officials have sought from the Biden administration. U.S. officials had resisted, citing concerns over limited stockpile, the repositioning of Russian assets outside of ATACMS range\u00a0and because Ukraine has been using other assets, primarily drones, with success, making ATACMS less critical to the fight.",
      "But the change comes after Biden officials have condemned the North Korean deployment as a possible expansion of the war. The ATACMS could be used where the Russian and North Korean troops are concentrated.",
      "The Pentagon and White House both declined to comment.",
      "In May, Biden secretly gave Ukraine permission to use American weapons to strike Russia just over the border. At the time, Ukraine was prohibited from using longer-range weapons to strike deeper into the country, sources told NBC News.",
      "This marks a U.S. policy shift coming at the tail end of Biden's time in office. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to limit U.S. support for Ukraine and end its war with Russia.",
      "The U.S. has provided $175 billion in aid to Ukraine \u2014 more than any other country \u2014 making American support crucial to Ukraine\u2019s defense against Russia. A withdrawal of support could deal a major blow to Ukraine\u2019s ability to resist Russia\u2019s attacks.",

      "KYIV \u2014 Russia unleashed its largest air strike on Ukraine in almost three months on Sunday, launching 120 missiles and 90 drones that killed at least seven people and caused severe damage to the power system, officials said.",
      "Ukrainians had been bracing for weeks for a renewed Russian attack on an already hobbled energy system, fearing long winter blackouts and mounting psychological pressure almost\u00a01,000 days\u00a0after Russia launched its\u00a0full-scale invasion.",
      "The strikes, which caused numerous power cuts, came at a time when the impending U.S. presidency of\u00a0Donald Trump, who has pledged to end the war without saying how, has raised the prospect of a push for negotiations.",

      "The extent of the damage was hard to assess. After repeated Russian attacks on the power grid, officials reveal little detailed information about the outcome of strikes and the state of the network.",
      "Officials confirmed damage to \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d or power cuts in regions from Volyn, Rivne, Lviv in the west to Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia in the southeast.",

      "Ukrainian troops are meanwhile trying to hold an area of land that they seized in Russia\u2019s Kursk region in August, something Kyiv has said could one day be a bargaining chip.",
      "Sybiha said the strike appeared to be Moscow\u2019s \u201ctrue response\u201d to leaders contacting President Vladimir Putin, an apparent swipe at\u00a0German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who called the Russian leader on Friday for the first time in two years.",
      "Though Scholz urged Putin to pull out his troops, which occupy a fifth of Ukraine, Kyiv bridled at a call that it said reduced Putin\u2019s isolation.",

      "Bela Karolyi helped build USA Gymnastics into an Olympics and international competition powerhouse starting in the 1980s and extending through the 2010s, when his wife had taken over many of his leadership duties.",
      "After success with Nadia Com\u0103neci in Romania, the couple helped to launch the athletic careers of U.S. Gymnastics Hall of Fame inductees Dominique Dawes, Phoebe Mills, Betty Okino, Kerri Strug, Mary Lou Retton and Kim Zmeskal.",
      "They found early fame in Retton, the first American woman to win an Olympic individual all-around gold, which she accomplished at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics.",
      "Retton was a fan of Com\u0103neci\u2019s, and found herself embedded in the program of the Karolyis in Houston in the early 1980s. She has said she didn't expect much from the experience she otherwise cherished.",
      "In an interview with USA Gymnastics in 2016, Retton described her first American Cup competition under the Karolyis.",
      "\"I figured I\u2019m just going to sit in the stands at Madison Square Garden and just shoot the breeze,\" she said. \"It would be a learning experience for me because I had never been up against the Russians and the top girls in the world.

      "The Karolyis defected from Romania, a gymnastics powerhouse, during a U.S. exhibition tour for the sport in 1981 as their homeland experienced economic decline amid the Cold War, according to USA Gymnastics.",
      "They settled in Oklahoma before moving to Houston to set up a gym that became a magnet for American women hoping to compete on the world stage.",
      "Bela eventually served as national team coordinator before stepping down in 2001. M\u00e1rta, 82, took over the role until her retirement in 2016, giving the couple a historic span of influence that included M\u00e1rta's work with Simone Biles.",
      "In 2016, USA Gymnastics purchased Karolyi Ranch and celebrated the couple\u2019s influence on American competitors.",
      "The couple was inducted into the U.S. Gymnastics Hall of Fame as part of its class of 2000.

      "The Karolyis' time as top coaches for USA Gymnastics overlapped with the tenure of former team doctor Larry Nassar, who is serving time in federal prison after he pleaded guilty in 2017 to federal charges stemming from his handling of thousands of images of child pornography.",
      "The former doctor was also convicted in Michigan of molesting young girls under the guise of treatment, with more than 265 people, including USA Gymnastics national team stars Biles, McKayla Maroney, Aly Raisman and Gabby Douglas, saying Nassar victimized them.",

      "\u201cThat\u2019s awful,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I would say even if they have big names or no names, any child who was violated by Nassar, it\u2019s a crime.\u201d",
      "She emphasized that Nassar was USA Gymnastics\u2019 hire and said that although the facilities bear the couple\u2019s name, USA Gymnastics was its ultimate operator. Bela Karolyi said the couple was unaware of complaints Nassar harassed or assaulted women in the program.",
      "Karolyi said he didn\u2019t like Nassar. \u201cI had the feeling of a snake coming to bite you,\u201d he said.",
      "In 2018, USA Gymnastics terminated its contract with Karolyi Ranch and closed the facility in Walker County, Texas.",
      "Gymnasts who trained with Karolyi offered heartfelt memories of their time with the star coach, though some of those experiences were admittedly conflicted.",
      "Hall of Fame gymnast Dominique Moceanu, a member of the squad that achieved the United States' first women's team gold medal at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, said life training under Karolyi came with challenges.",

      "LUCKNOW, India \u2014 A fire tore through a neonatal intensive care unit in a hospital in northern India, killing 10 newborn babies and injuring 16 others, authorities said.",
      "The fire occurred late Friday at a hospital in Jhansi city in India\u2019s Uttar Pradesh state. Officials said the blaze spread quickly through the ward, where 55 infants were being treated. Forty-five babies were rescued and are receiving medical care, said Bimal Kumar Dubey, a local official.",
      "An initial investigation points to lapses in safety protocols, including expired fire extinguishers and non-functional fire alarms, which officials say delayed rescue efforts. Authorities are conducting a thorough probe to determine the cause of the fire and those responsible.",

Rescuers had to break through windows to reach the newborn babies. Eyewitnesses said the rescue operation began about 30 minutes after the fire erupted, delaying evacuation efforts.",
      "Praminder Singh Chandel, a paramedic at the hospital, said that since the ward was located on the ground floor, firefighters managed to rescue several newborn babies.

    "published": "Sat, 16 Nov 2024 19:42:26 GMT",
    "summary": "The U.S. has reported its first case of a more aggressive strain of mpox. The WHO declared the virus' spread a public health emergency in August.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. on Saturday reported its first case of a more aggressive strain of mpox: an individual in California who had recently traveled from Eastern Africa.",
      "The case was confirmed by the California Department of Public Health and reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The person was treated in San Mateo County based on their travel history and symptoms and is now isolating at home and recovering, the state's health department said in a press release. Public health workers are contacting people who had close contact with the patient, \"but there is no concern or evidence\" that the strain is currently spreading in California or the U.S., the statement said.",
      "The U.S. is the sixth country outside of Africa to have detected the strain, according to the CDC, which can cause more severe disease than the version of the virus that spread widely in 2022.",
      "This strain\u2019s spread across several African countries prompted the World Health Organization to declare a global public health emergency in August, the second time for mpox in two years.",
      "Mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, is a viral infection that causes painful lesions, often accompanied by flu-like symptoms. It is classified into two distinct groups: the more aggressive strain, clade I, and a somewhat milder strain, clade II.",
      "Clade II was behind the global outbreak in 2022, which resulted in at least 32,000 infections and 58 deaths in the U.S.",
      "Until recently, clade I had not spread beyond Central Africa, where it is considered endemic, and East Africa. But an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo has led to cases in eight other African countries this year. In August, the first known case outside of Africa was confirmed in Sweden. Several days later, Thailand confirmed a case. Both patients had spent time in Africa.",
      "Traveled-related cases have also been detected in Germany, India and the United Kingdom, according to the CDC.",
      "Mpox spreads through direct contact with an infected person, animal or contaminated items like clothing or bedding. The version of clade II that spread in 2022 was passed primarily through sexual contact, particularly among men who have sex with men.",
      "In the current outbreak, clade I has been spreading largely through contact with infected animals and transmission within households, according to disease experts. Two-thirds of the suspected cases from January 2023 to April 2024 were among children ages 15 and under, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But a version of the strain, clade Ib, has also spread through sexual contact among female sex workers and men who have sex with men in Congo.",
      "It\u2019s unclear what transmission pathways might look like in the U.S., but some experts anticipate that clade I could spread among the same sexual networks as in 2022.",
      "\u201cI do expect that we will see cases,\" said Dr. Marc Siegel, an associate professor of medicine at the George Washington School of Medicine and Health Sciences. \"I think it will more likely be in the same population that was more at risk in the 2022-2023 outbreak. For the general population, I think this poses very little risk.\"",
      "Past mpox outbreaks of clade I in Africa have killed up to 10% of people who got sick, but the current outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo has a fatality rate of around 5%. That\u2019s compared to a 0.2% global fatality rate for the 2022 outbreak.",
      "However, health officials have said there\u2019s reason to believe that clade I could pose a milder threat in the U.S. than it has in African countries this year, given that malnutrition rates are lower and the health care system is more robust.",
      "The U.S. is also more prepared for an outbreak than it was in 2022. The CDC has instructed doctors to test for mpox and is scanning for both clades at wastewater sites across the country, including some airports.",
      "Additionally, the country has an adequate supply of the two-dose Jynneos vaccine, which is available to men who have sex with men and other high-risk groups. The Department of Health and Human Service says two doses of the vaccine or a previous infection should protect against severe illness from clade I.",
      "The U.S. administered around 1.2 million vaccine doses from May 2022 to January 2023. Health officials hope to expand that coverage, since just 23% of the population at significant risk has been fully vaccinated.",
      "Mpox typically starts with a rash that progresses to small bumps on the skin, followed by fluid-filled blisters that eventually scab over. People may also experience a fever, headache, muscle aches, back pain, low energy or swollen lymph nodes.",
      "Some people infected by clade II in the U.S. have described the lesions as exceedingly painful. They have historically appeared on the face, chest, palms of the hands and the soles of the feet, but during the 2022 outbreak, people developed lesions around the genital and anal region or inside the mouth and throat."

    "title": "With dengue cases at an extreme high, research points to climate change's role",
    "published": "Sat, 16 Nov 2024 19:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Dengue fever has spread at alarming rates this year. New research attributes nearly a fifth of the existing dengue burden to climate change.",
    "story": [
      "The Summary",
      "Nearly 12 million cases of dengue fever have been recorded in the Americas this year, close to triple last year\u2019s total.New research suggests that climate change is responsible for nearly a fifth of the world\u2019s dengue burden.That share is likely to rise significantly in the future, according to the findings.",
      "Nearly 12 million cases of dengue fever have been recorded in the Americas this year, close to triple last year\u2019s total.",
      "New research suggests that climate change is responsible for nearly a fifth of the world\u2019s dengue burden.",
      "That share is likely to rise significantly in the future, according to the findings.",
      "It has been an exceptionally bad year for dengue fever: Nearly 12 million cases were recorded in the Americas through October, close to triple last year\u2019s total of 4.6 million.",
      "Research being presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene on Saturday quantifies the role that climate change has played in the trend, attributing nearly a fifth of the existing dengue burden to rising temperatures.",
      "By 2050, the research predicts, climate change could be responsible for a 60% increase in the incidence of dengue if emissions continue at pace, with some places \u2014 like parts of Peru, Mexico, Bolivia and Brazil \u2014 seeing spikes of up to 200%.",
      "Public health experts have long warned that global warming enables mosquito-borne diseases to spread to new places because it expands the geographic range where the insects that serve as vectors live and thrive. Mallory Harris, a co-author of the new research and a postdoctoral associate in the University of Maryland\u2019s biology department, said her team\u2019s findings build evidence for the significant role climate change has played in dengue\u2019s spread. More broadly, she said, the research highlights the connection between greenhouse gas emissions and specific health consequences.",
      "\u201cDengue is a growing health threat that can cause really severe consequences. It\u2019s something that we need to be preparing for,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWe should be expecting these sorts of large epidemics in the future and thinking about ways to then respond to them.\u201d",
      "In the United States and its territories, more than 7,200 dengue cases have been tallied so far this year \u2014 more than double last year\u2019s total and the highest since 2013.",
      "In June, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a health advisory warning of an increased risk of dengue infections. After two locally acquired cases were detected in the Florida Keys, the Monroe County Department of Health issued an alert of its own the next month. To date, 53 locally acquired cases \u2014 meaning they were not associated with travel to a country where dengue is prevalent \u2014\u00a0have been recorded in Florida, according to the CDC. California has recorded 15 such cases.",
      "But the vast majority of U.S. cases this year have been in Puerto Rico, which declared a public health emergency in March amid an alarming rise in dengue infections. More than 4,500 locally acquired dengue cases have been reported in Puerto Rico, compared to less than 1,300 last year and even fewer the year before.",
      "The new research, which has not yet been published or peer-reviewed, analyzed temperature records and incidence data on dengue across 21 countries in Asia and the Americas over an average of 11 years. The researchers compared the data to a simulation of what would have happened during that time period without human-caused climate change.",
      "The resulting estimates are likely at the low end of the spectrum, according to a news release about the findings, because of a lack of dengue data from some areas, such as sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Plus, predictions for the southern U.S. are difficult to make, given that the virus has only recently emerged as a local threat.",
      "The researchers found that the mosquitoes that carry dengue \u2014 called\u00a0Aedes aegypti \u2014 transmit the virus most efficiently when temperatures are between 68 and 82 degrees Fahrenheit. They concluded that even if global greenhouse gas emissions are significantly reduced, the majority of the countries analyzed would still see climate-driven increases in dengue.",
      "\u201cThe risks of this are going to increase regardless, so we need to be thinking about mitigation,\u201d Harris said, suggesting a focus on vaccines and efforts to curb mosquito populations.",
      "The maker of the only Food and Drug Administration-approved vaccine for dengue discontinued it earlier this year, according to the CDC.",
      "More than half of people who contract dengue, a viral fever, are asymptomatic. Most of the rest experience mild cases, with symptoms that can include a fever, headache, joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Severe infections \u2014 about 2% of cases in U.S. territories from 2010 to 2020, according to the CDC \u2014 can cause bleeding under the skin, in the nose or in urine or stool, as well as a sudden drop in blood pressure or even death.",
      "The disease is most common in places with humid, tropical climates across Latin America.",
      "Derek Cummings, a professor of epidemiology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who was not involved in the new research, said it takes \u201csomething that we all knew \u2014 that the temperature is important \u2014 but quantifies how much and how important it is to the changes we\u2019re seeing.\u201d",
      "Cummings, who has published his own research on dengue, added that on a global scale, he foresees a need to prioritize vaccinates, better manage mosquito populations and ensure hospitals and health care providers prepare for a rise in dengue cases.",
      "Harris emphasized that the new research shows how climate change\u2019s consequences affect various parts of the world differently.",
      "\u201cThe greatest impacts of historic climate change on dengue burden were in places like Peru, Bolivia, Mexico, which are not necessarily the places that are the overall hottest. They\u2019re not necessarily the places that are having the greatest increases in heat deaths,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are effects that you might experience in places that are marginally cooler that also need to be taken into account.\u201d"

      "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has sent thousands of soldiers to Russia, the U.S. and others say, stepping up his assistance against Ukraine as he and Russian President Vladimir Putin strengthen security ties.",
      "With victory still elusive as the war nears the end of its third year, Putin welcomes more help from North Korea, which has already been providing weapons, experts say. But the inexperience of the North Korean soldiers as well as the language barrier between them and their Russian counterparts are likely to minimize their impact on the battlefield, military analysts told NBC News.",
      "\u201cThe average Russian soldier is going to say, what are they doing here? I\u2019m having to hold their hand. I\u2019m tripping over their bodies,\u201d said Sydney Seiler, the U.S. national intelligence officer for North Korea from 2020 to 2023.",
      "The State Department said Tuesday that most of the more than 10,000 North Korean soldiers sent to Russia had started fighting in the Russian region of Kursk, where Ukrainian forces launched an offensive in August.",
      "South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service also said this week that North Korean soldiers deployed to Russia had started engaging in combat.",
      "Putin did not deny the presence of North Korean troops in Russia when asked by NBC News last month, while North Korea has not confirmed it but said it would be in line with international law.",
      "The North Korean troops could give a boost to Russia\u2019s depleted forces as they try to retake control of Kursk, which is the first Russian territory to be occupied by a foreign military since World War II.",
      "\u201cEvery North Korean soldier that can dig a latrine, guard an intersection, seize and hold a building allows one more Russian soldier to go to the front line,\u201d said Seiler, who is now the Korea chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank in Washington.",
      "North Korea-Russia cooperation was the issue \u201caddressed most in-depth\u201d at a meeting on Friday between President Joe Biden and the leaders of two key U.S. allies at risk from Pyongyang, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, a senior administration official said.",
      "\u201cThere was tremendous convergence on just how destabilizing this growing nexus between Moscow and Pyongyang is for the region,\u201d the official said of the meeting, which took place on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Lima, Peru.",
      "The U.S. and others say that Kim, who on Monday ratified a mutual defense pact that he and Putin signed in June, was already supplying Russia with millions of artillery rounds, possibly in exchange for Russian technical assistance with his nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Both Pyongyang and Moscow deny any arms transfers.",
      "The North Korean troops, some of whom South Korea says are part of Pyongyang\u2019s special operations force, could now be used to form combat units or operate that artillery, analysts say.",
      "They are unlikely to make a meaningful difference on the front lines, however. Though North Korea has the world\u2019s fourth-largest army, the deployment in Kursk is the first major combat its soldiers have seen since the 1950-53 Korean War.",
      "\u201cKim Jong Un is selling North Korean soldiers as cannon fodder mercenaries,\u201d South Korean Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun said last month.",
      "It\u2019s an entirely new environment for the North Korean soldiers, who live in one of the most isolated and repressive countries in the world. The Pentagon said last week that it was unable to confirm reports that North Korean troops unused to unfettered internet access were spending much of their time consuming online pornography, Politico reported.",
      "There is also the risk that North Korean soldiers could defect or be taken as prisoners of war, either of which could prove embarrassing for Kim and Putin.",
      "Even if that doesn\u2019t happen, the North Koreans could end up being less help than hindrance, Seiler said.",
      "\u201cThere is a lot of skepticism and questioning now that are these troops even viable?\u201d he said.",
      "Mismatched skills and missing camaraderie",
      "The Russians\u2019 frustration was on display last month in what Ukrainian military intelligence said were intercepted audio messages between members of a Russian unit in Kursk.",
      "In the messages, Russian soldiers appear to complain about their North Korean counterparts, referred to as the \u201cK Battalion,\u201d with one soldier saying he doesn\u2019t know \u201cwhat the f--- to do with them.\u201d",
      "NBC News has not independently authenticated the audio, and the Russian Ministry of Defense has not publicly commented on it.",
      "There is also the matter of the language barrier, which will be \u201ca significant hurdle,\u201d said John Hardie, deputy director of the Russia program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based think tank.",
      "Communication difficulties between Russian and North Korean soldiers will \u201ccomplicate command and control, especially if Russia attempts to integrate the North Koreans into lower echelons,\u201d he said.",
      "The Russian military is teaching the North Korean soldiers about 100 key military terms, but \u201cNorth Koreans are having a difficult time learning Russian,\u201d South Korean lawmakers Lee Sung-kwon and Park Sun-won said last month.",
      "While translators and some basic vocabulary may help, combat operations \u201crequire constant and specific communications to be really successful, not just some senior officer pointing in a direction and telling the North Koreans to attack there,\u201d said Bruce Bennett, an adjunct senior researcher at the California-based nonprofit think tank Rand Corp.",
      "Communication is not the only issue that could keep Russian and North Korean forces from fighting together effectively. North Korean soldiers\u2019 inexperience could be another point of friction and a major factor in how they are deployed.",
      "\u201cNorth Korean troops will likely have had limited exposure to some of the capabilities and tactics, techniques and procedures that have evolved during the war in Ukraine,\u201d Hardie said. \u201cThere will be a lot of learning on the job.\u201d",
      "Given these constraints, Bennett said, the Russian military might revive a strategy it used in the Cold War: forming what is known as an operational maneuver group (OMG), which goes farther across enemy lines than traditional units and includes elite soldiers who can cripple the enemy\u2019s defenses from inside.",
      "\u201cThe Russians may be thinking of using part of the North Korean force to carry out massed attacks, hoping to overwhelm Ukraine\u2019s defenders,\u201d Bennett said. The rest, he said, could become part of an OMG that goes deep into Ukrainian-held territory.",
      "For Putin, this could provide a \u201cstrategic breakthrough\u201d against Ukraine\u2019s defenses and create conditions to end the war with a Russian \u201cvictory,\u201d he said.",
      "Though the North Korean troops are unlikely to make much difference in Putin\u2019s overall strategy in the Ukraine war, they could help him prolong it, said Edward Howell, a North Korea expert at Chatham House, a London-based think tank.",
      "Their presence could also bring continued goodwill from the Russian president.",
      "\u201cEven if the Ukraine war were to end, the relationship between North Korea and Russia now seems to have reached new heights,\u201d Howell said.",
