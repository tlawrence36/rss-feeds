      "\u201cI didn\u2019t expect this, actually,\u201d said Anderson, accepting the award. \u201cI started to think I didn\u2019t know what was going on.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Tollywood, the Telugu-language film industry, is rapidly gaining global attention, challenging Bollywood's dominance",
      "HYDERABAD, India -- A fast-rising parallel film industry in India is competing with Bollywood's musicals and action-packed films and has taken the world by storm: It\u2019s called Tollywood.",
      "As Mumbai is to Hindi films \u2014 or Bollywood \u2014 the southern Indian city of Hyderabad is to movies made in Telugu, one of the country\u2019s most widely spoken languages. Tollywood films like \u201cRRR\u201d and \u201cBaahubali\u201d have achieved international acclaim at the box office and on the awards stage.",
      "The Telugu-language film industry, widely known as Tollywood, is one of India\u2019s many regional movie-producing centers. But it's drawn national and global audiences with its high-adrenaline action movies, mythic storylines and grand visual style. It has carved out its own identity separate from Hindi-language Bollywood by leaning toward star-driven spectacle and large-scale epics.",
      "Tollywood primarily operates out of Hyderabad, which is home to Ramoji Film City. The 1,666-acre (674-hectare) facility, recognized by Guinness World Records as the world\u2019s largest film studio complex, houses massive film studio complexes, dozens of production houses, warehouses, movie sets and post-production facilities. The industry churns out around 300 films every year \u2014 fewer than Bollywood but still enough to make it one of India\u2019s largest regional industries.",
      "Tollywood\u2019s growing exposure was in large part sparked by the coronavirus pandemic, as the rapid expansion of streaming services in India allowed regional films to find wider audiences. That expansion also coincided with Bollywood\u2019s struggle to lure audiences back to theaters amid repetitive storylines and rehashes of hits from other languages.",
      "What has also worked in favor of Tollywood is that it offers a rare balance of high-octane action films and nuanced movies charged with real human drama.",
      "\u201cTelugu people have a lot of interest in movies. The Telugu audience watch and accept all kind of movies. They are cinema lovers,\u201d says filmmaker T.V. Ravi Narayan, who is working on a biopic based on an 18th-century social activist. \u201cBecause they are cinema lovers, be it \u2018Baahubali,\u2019 \u2018Pushpa\u2019 or \u2018RRR,\u2019 be it big budget or small budget, be it realistic or biopics or fantasy movies, the audiences accept it.\u201d",
      "Tollywood is known for its high-energy storytelling, big action set pieces and grand spectacle that are heavy on visual effects. It often blends family drama, action and mythology into movies, increasingly marketed as \u201cpan-India\u201d releases and dubbed in multiple regional languages.",
      "The films, like other big Indian productions, have crowd-pleasing visuals and feature viral songs and dances central to the narrative and usually presented as grand performance set pieces.",
      "Many Tollywood films are also remade in Bollywood, which has become a proven formula to expand Telugu cinema across India. Dubbing \u2014 where actors record voice-overs in Hindi or a professional voice artist replaces the track \u2014 is also a standard and tested practice that has made Tollywood more accessible.",
      "The industry does also produce smaller, low-budget films that tend to focus on stories rooted in Telugu culture. Most of them are set in rural landscapes and explore themes such as social issues, regional cultures and class inequality. Some of those films are sent straight to streaming platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime, where they enjoy a wide reach across India.",
      "Many Tollywood movie stars like Mahesh Babu, Allu Arjun, Prabhas, Ram Charan and N.T. Rama Rao Jr. command a near-godlike following, with devoted fan bases that cut across generations. Their movie releases are often tied to regional religious festivals and are preceded by carefully marketed music launch events and dance performances that are a spectacle in itself. Tens of thousands of fans attend such events, as they did recently with the first look of S.S. Rajamouli's \u201cVaranasi.\u201d",
      "The industry has also led to a massive fan club culture, predominantly centered around male film stars. Some fans are so invested in their favorite stars that they often organize charitable drives and blood donation camps in their names. It is not unusual for fans to perform acts of literal worship, washing male stars' cardboard cutouts or statues with milk \u2014 a ritual usually reserved for Hindu gods.",
      "In theaters across Hyderabad, viewers will commonly dance, whistle and throw confetti in the air during releases of films. Outside, billboards of major stars are a frequent sight in the city.",

After sweeping state elections, he became the chief minister.",

      "Just like Bollywood, the Telugu film industry also draws its revenue from theatrical releases, television and music rights, overseas distribution and brand partnerships. It is widely regarded as India\u2019s second-highest-grossing film industry, trailing only Bollywood.",
      "Even though the industry is largely controlled by some regionally influential film families and businessmen that have power over movie distribution and screenings, huge marketing campaigns have carried Telugu films across India and beyond.",

      "An AI-generated country song, \u201cWalk My Walk,\u201d recently topped Billboard's country digital song sales chart",
      "LOS ANGELES -- When an AI-generated country song called \u201cWalk My Walk\u201d hit No. 1 on Billboard's country digital song sales chart this month, it was credited to a fictional artist named Breaking Rust \u2014 a white, digitally generated avatar that didn't exist two months ago.",
      "But the song's vocal phrasing, melodic shape and stylistic DNA came from someone who does exist: Grammy-nominated country artist Blanco Brown, a Black music artist who has worked with Britney Spears, Childish Gambino and Rihanna.",
      "And he had no idea.",
      "\u201cI didn't even know about the song until people hit me up about it,\u201d said Brown, whose 2019 country rap hit \u201cThe Git Up\u201d helped usher in a new, hybrid era of country crossover. He didn't learn about the chart-topping AI track until his phone was flooded with messages from friends.",
      "\u201cMy phone just kept blowing up,\u201d he said. \u201cSomebody said: 'Man, somebody done typed your name in the AI and made a white version of you. They just used the Blanco, not the Brown.\u201d",
      "The moment is the latest example of how generative AI is upending the music industry, giving anyone the ability to instantly create seemingly new songs by typing prompts into a chat window, often using models trained on real artists' voices and styles without their knowledge.",
      "The credits for the grit-filled, chant-heavy track \u201cWalk My Walk\u201d list Aubierre Rivaldo Taylor as one of the song's creators, with streaming platforms such as Apple Music and Spotify identifying him as both the songwriter and producer. In recent months, Taylor has also been credited on streaming platforms as the songwriter and producer behind Defbeatsai \u2014 one of several X-rated, AI-generated country artists that exploded across social media last year.",
      "The Defbeatsai ecosystem, however, connects back to another figure in Brown's past: Abraham Abushmais, a collaborator Brown once jokingly called \u201cAbe Einstein\u201d for his sharp studio instincts. Abushmais co-wrote a couple of songs on Brown's 2019 album \u201cHoneysuckle & Lightning Bugs\u201d and is listed as the developer of Echo, an obscure AI-powered music generator app promoted on one of Defbeats.ai's Instagram pages with a link encouraging users to \u201cmake your own hit country song.\u201d",
      "Brown said he wasn't notified about their involvement in the AI hit, and the collaborator he once mentored has since become unreachable.",
      "\u201cAbe\u2019s number changed,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe used to talk. I ain\u2019t heard from him in a year or two.\u201d",
      "The AP reached out to Abushmais for comment but did not receive a response.",
      "The digital avatar fronting \u201cWalk My Walk,\" a white, AI-generated country singer built with a vocal approach modeled on Brown's sound, is where the moment shifted from eerie to uncomfortable.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a white AI man with a Black voice,\u201d Brown said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s singing like a Negro spiritual.\u201d",
      "For Brown, the shock quickly gave way to action. He went into the studio and recorded his cover of the song, which was released last week. He's also putting out a reworked derivative of the track on Monday with new lyrics and a new arrangement.",
      "Brown's management said his response to the song is a direct challenge to the legal, ethical and policy void surrounding AI-generated music. He wants to use his own lived experience to force the industry and lawmakers to confront who owns art and what happens when technology outpaces the rights of the human creators it imitates.",
      "\u201cIf someone is going to sing like me, it should be me,\u201d he said.",
      "For musicians and educators, the success of \u201cWalk My Walk\u201d made one thing clear: AI-generated music has leapt from internet experiment to commercial disruptor.",
      "\u201cWe are entering a very strange and unprecedented period of both creation and industry,\u201d said Josh Antonuccio, director of the Ohio University Music Industry Summit. \u201cAI has essentially democratized the act of music creation itself.\u201d",

      "\u201cThese companies trained their platforms on a volume of recorded music without permission,\u201d Antonuccio said. \u201cIt leaves creators in this strange purgatory where they're not getting compensated.\u201d",
      "Some labels have now shifted from lawsuits to negotiation. Universal Music Group recently settled a copyright infringement lawsuits with Udio and signed a new licensing agreement with the platform. Warner Music Group followed with its own deal on Tuesday, partnering with Suno in what the companies called a \u201cfirst-of-its-kind\u201d agreement to develop licensed AI music that both compensates and protects artists.",

      "The sudden success of \u201cWalk My Walk\u201d also raises questions about the tools enabling it. Educators say most chart-ready AI vocals today are generated through systems like Suno and Udio, which let users create full songs by prompting musical genres, vocal styles and lyrical ideas.",

      "He spent years navigating country music as a Black artist who blends gospel, hip-hop, pop and twang. He's been nominated for a Grammy and embraced by the Recording Academy, but country radio hasn't given him consistent traction.",
      "Meanwhile, an AI song built on his vocal identity and paired with a white avatar went straight to No. 1, a dynamic he says reflects a familiar pattern in Nashville: innovation from Black artists being reattributed.",
      "\u201cHe created something with my tone and gave it a white face,\u201d Brown said. \u201c(Race) is an understatement in Nashville.\u201d",

      "Brown insists he's not anti-AI. He's not even angry with Abushmais. He's proud that his sound inspired someone, but he understands what the moment exposes.",
      "For him, the arrival of an AI artist built on his tone only underscored something he has learned repeatedly in Nashville: talent is one thing, but how the industry assigns value is often something else.",
      "\u201cI go through this every day with real people who steal and borrow from what I do,\u201d Brown said. \u201cSo I don't care if it's a robot or a human. They're not giving me credit anyway.\u201d",
      "In a fast-changing landscape, Brown said artists will have one final advantage that machines can't mimic.",

      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has replaced the head of his controversial vaccine advisory committee",
      "NEW YORK -- U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s controversial vaccine advisory committee will be meeting later this week under a new chairperson, federal officials announced Monday.",
      "Martin Kulldorff is leaving the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to take a leadership role within the Department of Health and Human Services, officials said.",
      "Dr. Kirk Milhoan, who has blamed vaccines for causing cardiovascular disease, will become the new chair. He had been appointed to the committee in September.",
      "Later this week, the committee is scheduled to discuss the pediatric vaccine schedule and hepatitis B shots given to newborns.",
      "HHS officials issued a press release praising Kulldorff and his work while leading the panel but did not answer additional questions about the changes. Kulldorff did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment.",
      "The committee makes recommendations to the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on how already-approved vaccines should be used. CDC directors almost always adopted the committee's recommendations, which were widely heeded by doctors and guide vaccination programs.",
      "Kennedy, a leading anti-vaccine activist before becoming the nation\u2019s top health official, fired the entire 17-member panel earlier this year and replaced it with a group that includes several anti-vaccine voices. He also named Kulldorff as chairman.",
      "Under Kulldorff's leadership, the group made several decisions that angered major medical groups.",
      "At a June meeting, the panel recommended that a preservative called thimerosal be removed from doses of flu vaccine even though some members acknowledged there was no proof it was causing harm.",
      "In September, the group recommended new restrictions on a combination shot that protects against chickenpox as well as measles, mumps and rubella. The panel also took the unprecedented step of not recommending COVID-19 vaccinations \u2014 not even for high-risk populations like seniors \u2014 instead making it a matter of personal choice.",
      "Several doctors\u2019 groups said the changes were not based on good evidence, and advised doctors and patients to follow guidance that was previously in place.",
      "Kulldorff's departure leaves the vaccine committee with 11 members.",
      "It will now be led by Milhoan, a pediatric cardiologist who with his wife operates a medical missionary organization called For Hearts and Souls. He appeared at a 2024 congressional hearing at which he said an increase in cardiovascular disease in older teens and young adults should be attributed to vaccines.",
      "Kulldorff is a Swedish-born biostatistician who was a co-author of the Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 letter maintaining that pandemic shutdowns were causing irreparable harm.",
      "During his time as ACIP chair, the committee abandoned its traditional \"evidence-to-recommendation\" framework, which involved many months of analysis and discussion before proposals came before the full committee for a vote.",
      "In his new role, Kulldorff will become chief science officer within the HHS planning and evaluation office. Officials described the office as the department's \u201cin-house think tank.\u201d",

      "But it's unclear exactly what the committee plans to vote on. HHS officials have not responded to repeated questions seeking details.",
      "The current recommendations call for a first dose to be given to newborns within 24 hours of birth.",
      "Last week, 15 state governors submitted public comments suggesting the committee was hurting public trust in vaccines and the ability of people to get affordable shots.",
      "In adults, the virus is spread through sex or through sharing needles while injecting drugs. But the virus can also be passed to a baby from an infected mother, and as many as 90% of infected infants go on to have chronic infections that can lead to a lifetime of health issues.",
      "A hepatitis B vaccine was first licensed in the U.S. in 1981. In 2005, the ACIP recommended a dose within 24 hours of birth for all medically stable infants who weigh at least 4.4 pounds (2 kilograms).",
      "The infant shots are 85% to 95% effective in preventing chronic hepatitis B infections, studies have shown.",
      "The vaccinations are considered a success, and experts say no recent peer-reviewed research shows any safety problem with giving kids the shots on their first day of life.",
      "But in September, Kennedy\u2019s ACIP members discussed whether to recommend delaying that initial vaccination \u2014 something doctors and parents already can choose to do. The panel pulled back from taking a vote amid criticism from independent pediatric and infectious disease specialists who say the vaccine is safe and has helped infant infections drop sharply.",

      "A new type of lens approved by the FDA promises to slow nearsightedness in children",
      "WASHINGTON -- For many children, the experience of getting their first pair of glasses is an inevitable milestone, the first in a lifetime of visits to the eye doctor.",
      "But what if those lenses could actually help preserve the child\u2019s vision and reduce the chances for more serious eye problems in adulthood?",
      "That\u2019s the promise of a new type of lens approved by the Food and Drug Administration in September. While the technology has previously been available in Europe, Asia and other parts of the world, it\u2019s now rolling out in the U.S.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the new approach.",
      "Myopia, commonly called nearsightedness, is when people can clearly see objects at close range but struggle with distant objects, which often appear blurry or indistinct.",
      "Studies conducted around the world have shown rising rates of myopia, which researchers have associated with increased time indoors looking at screens, books and other objects held close to the eyes.",
      "In the U.S., 30% to 40% of children will have myopia by the time they finish high school, according to Dr. Michael Repka, a professor and pediatric ophthalmologist at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.",
      "Until now, doctors had few options for treating the condition.",
      "\u201cIt was typically and simply: \u2018Your child needs to wear glasses and they\u2019ll live with it,\u2019\u201d Repka said. \u201c'It will be lifelong and it will likely get worse over the next few years.\u2019\u201d",
      "The specialized glasses, sold under the brand Essilor Stellest, are approved by the FDA to slow nearsightedness in 6- to 12-year-olds.",
      "The FDA said it cleared the lenses based on company data showing children experienced a 70% reduction in the progression of their myopia after two years.",
      "Over time, myopia causes the eye to grow longer, worsening vision and increasing the risk of tears to the retina \u2014 the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye that is essential for vision.",
      "The new lenses use 11 concentric rings filled with tiny raised dots to refocus light onto the retina in a way that is believed to slow elongation of the eye.",
      "\u201cWhether this hypothesis is ultimately proven to be true, of course, matters only in part,\u201d Repka said, noting that the lenses appear to work regardless of how the underling science works.",
      "In the company study, children wearing the lens showed a 50% reduction in eye lengthening when measured after two years. Currently, researchers in the U.S. and other countries are conducting their own independent studies to confirm those results.",
      "Ophthalmologists say the potential benefits go beyond preserving vision to heading off some long-term consequences of severe myopia, which can include cataracts, glaucoma and retinal detachment that can lead to blindness.",

      "Major U.S. vision insurance providers are expected to cover the lenses for children who meet the prescribing criteria.",
      "The only other FDA-approved product to slow myopia are contact lenses made by a company called MiSight. The daily disposable lenses, approved in 2019, use a similar approach intended to slow the progression of nearsightedness in children ages 8 to 12.",
      "But Gupta says many parents and physicians are likely to prefer the glasses.",
      "\u201cA lot of people might be hesitant to put a child as young as 8 in contact lenses, so the glasses offer a really nice alternative,\u201d she said.",
      "Some doctors prescribe medicated eye drops intended to slow myopia, but those are not approved by the FDA.",
      "Under the FDA\u2019s approval decision, the lenses can be prescribed to any child with myopia who\u2019s within the recommended age range. There were no serious side effects, according to FDA, although some children reported visual disturbances, such as halos around objects while wearing the lenses.",

      "After 15 days at Banadir Hospital, the child was deemed out of danger.",
      "\u201cWhere I come from, there is no hospital,\u201d Bulle said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I am here.\u201d",
      "One of the world\u2019s poorest countries faces a crisis of health care exacerbated by the Trump administration's dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development this year. The loss of USAID funding has disheartened many Somalis who believe they can\u2019t depend on their own government, which focuses mostly on defeating the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab.",
      "Somalia's deputy health minister, Mohamed Hassan Bulaale, told The Associated Press that the U.S. cuts led to over 6,000 health workers losing their jobs while up to 2,000 health facilities were affected \u2014 a massive hit in a country that the Center for Global Development this year said was among the world's most likely to suffer as donors draw back.",
      "Bomb and gun attacks by the militants \u2014 including against health centers \u2014 have reduced in frequency and intensity in recent months, leading some to see success in President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud\u2019s \u201ctotal war\u201d against al-Shabab.",
      "But hospital administrators, civic leaders and others say the latest push to defeat al-Shabab has come at the expense of health care and other public services.",
      "Somalia's Ministry of Health was allocated $91 million of a national budget exceeding $1 billion this year, with those funds tied mostly to projects backed by outside groups. That's a significant improvement from last year's $52 million, but almost all of that increase came from donors, said Mahad Wasuge, who runs the Somali Public Agenda think tank.",
      "And as the United States has shown, donor money comes and goes.",
      "Even with major setbacks in overall foreign support this year, including from other key benefactors such as Britain, \u201csecurity remains the first priority\u201d for Somali authorities, Wasuge told the AP.",
      "Many areas outside Mogadishu don\u2019t have functioning public hospitals, he said, with people forced to trek through often insecure areas to receive care at the ones still functional.",
      "Such facilities in the capital include Banadir Hospital, built with Chinese support in 1977, and De Martino Hospital, established in 1922 by Italian colonialists.",
      "During an AP visit, officials at those hospitals said much of their work would stop without assistance from the United Nations and international groups.",
      "Even at Banadir, Mogadishu\u2019s main public referral hospital, expectations of the Somali government aren\u2019t high. The unit looking after malnourished children depends entirely on donor funds channeled through the humanitarian group Concern Worldwide, said supervisor Dr. Mohamed Haashi.",
      "After 37 people employed in the unit lost their jobs with this year's U.S. aid cuts, Concern Worldwide still pays the salaries of 13 others in addition to milk and food for mothers and babies, Haashi said.",
      "At De Martino Hospital, director Dr. Abdirahim Omar Amin said he worries what will happen when contracts with two other humanitarian groups expire at the end of 2025.",
      "The hospital was looking after dozens of children suffering from diphtheria, an infectious disease of the throat preventable by vaccination but now spreading in rural areas. Parents are not taking their kids for routine vaccinations because they are afraid of militant attacks, Amin said.",

      "In some ways, De Martino Hospital's history mirrors Somalia's scars. It once sheltered displaced people after the fall in 1991 of Siad Barre, a dictator whose removal triggered fighting by warlords from different clans. Many public facilities across Somalia were destroyed in years of civil war.",
      "Somalia\u2019s federal government, now based in a heavily fortified area near the airport in Mogadishu, struggles to assert itself despite support from African Union peacekeepers, U.S. airstrikes targeting al-Shabab and security consultants from nations jockeying for influence in a country with strategic access to the Indian Ocean and Gulf of Aden.",

      "Palestinians in the West Bank are living in fear of more attacks by armed Israeli settlers",
      "TURMUS AYYA, West Bank -- The fear is palpable in this Palestinian village. It\u2019s clear in how farmers gather their harvests quickly, how they scan the valley for movement, how they dare not stray past certain roads. At any time, they say, armed Israeli settlers could descend.",
      "\u201cIn a matter of minutes, they get on their phones. They gather themselves, and they surprise you,\u201d said Yasser Alkam, a Palestinian-American lawyer and farmer from the village of Turmus Ayya. \u201cThey hide between the trees. They ambush people and beat them up severely.\u201d",
      "In recent months, Alkam says Turmus Ayya has weathered near-daily attacks by settlers, especially after they set up an outpost that the anti-settlement watchdog group Peace Now says is on his village\u2019s land.",
      "Alkam says he can\u2019t reach his own fields for fear of being assaulted. In a particularly gruesome attack, he watched a settler beat a Palestinian woman unconscious with a spiky club.",
      "The fear is shared throughout the West Bank. During October's olive harvest, settlers across the territory launched an average of eight attacks daily, according to the United Nations humanitarian office, the most since it began collecting data in 2006. The attacks continued in November, with the U.N. recording at least 136 more by Nov. 24.",
      "Settlers burned cars, desecrated mosques, ransacked industrial plants and destroyed cropland. Israeli authorities have done little beyond issuing occasional condemnations of the violence.",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the attackers as a minority that did not represent most settlers in the West Bank, where settlements are considered illegal by most of the international community. But their continued expansion of outposts \u2014 conducted in public with seemingly few legal repercussions \u2014 and the violence have cemented a fearful status quo for their Palestinian neighbors.",
      "While driving in fields east of Turmus Ayya on Oct. 19, Alkam saw Afaf Abu Alia, a grandmother from a nearby village, harvesting a grove of olive trees. They were loaned to her after the Israeli military bulldozed her own 500 trees this year, she said.",
      "She worked until she heard yelling in Hebrew. Settlers descended on the road nearby. Suddenly, one ran toward her with a club.",
      "\u201cThe monsters started beating me,\u201d she told The Associated Press three weeks after the attack. \u201cAfter that, my memories get all blurry.\u201d",
      "Video of the attack obtained by the AP shows a settler beating Alia with the jagged club, even after she was motionless. She was hospitalized for four days, requiring 20 stitches on her head, she said.",
      "Asked for comment on the attack, the military said its troops and police had \u201cdefused\u201d a confrontation in which Israeli civilians were torching vehicles and using violence.",
      "Police arrested a man named Ariel Dahari for beating Abu Alia. An Israeli court charged him later with terrorism.",
      "Dahari is being represented by Honenu, an organization that provides legal aid to settlers, who say the West Bank is part of the biblical Jewish homeland and often cast attacks as self-defense. According to an article about Dahari on the group's website, he has received at least 18 administrative orders since 2016 that included house arrest and confinement to his town in Israel.",
      "He told the Israeli news site Arutz Sheva in 2023 that he had been kicked out of the territory twice. It is not clear how he was able to return.",
      "Palestinians and human rights workers say Israeli soldiers and police routinely fail to prosecute attacks by violent settlers. Their sense of impunity has deepened under Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, a settler, and Defense Minister Israel Katz, who in January released settlers from administrative detention, Israel\u2019s practice of detaining individuals without charge or trial.",

      "Pope Leo XIV has prayed at the site of the 2020 Beirut port explosion, urging justice for the 218 victims",
      "BEIRUT -- BEIRUT (AP) \u2014 Pope Leo XIV prayed Tuesday at the site of a deadly 2020 Beirut port explosion that has become a symbol of dysfunction and official impunity and called for justice to prevail, as he offered words of consolation to Lebanon\u2019s people \u2014 including in the war-battered south \u2014 on the final day of his first overseas trip.",
      "Relatives of some of the 218 people killed by the blast held up photos of their loved ones as Leo arrived at the scorched site. They stood side by side as Leo prayed silently first at a monument to the dead, then greeted each one, grasping their hands.",
      "The emotional encounter took place next to the shell of the last grain silo standing at the site destroyed by the Aug. 4, 2020, blast and the piles of burned cars torched in its wake. The explosion did billions of dollars in damage as hundreds of tons of ammonium nitrate detonated in a port warehouse.",
      "Five years on, the families of those killed are still seeking justice. No official has been convicted in a judicial investigation that has been repeatedly obstructed, angering Lebanese for whom the blast was just the latest evidence of impunity after decades of corruption and financial crimes.",
      "\u201cThe visit clearly sends the message that the explosion was a crime,\" said Cecile Roukoz, whose brother, Joseph Roukoz, was killed and who was on hand to meet the pope. \"There should be a message, the country should end impunity and ensure justice is served.\u201d",
      "When he arrived in Lebanon on Sunday, Leo urged the country's political leaders to pursue the truth as a means of peace and reconciliation. In a homily Sunday after praying at the site, Leo referred explicitly to the blast and called for Lebanon to be a place of justice.",
      "An estimated 150,000 worshippers packed the Beirut waterfront for Leo's final Mass, which he celebrated immediately after praying at the nearby blast site.",
      "In his homily, Leo named the many problems the Lebanese people have faced, from economic crises to the blast and renewed fears of war. He said it\u2019s natural to feel \u201cparalyzed by powerlessness in the face of evil and oppressed by so many difficult situations.\u201d",
      "But he urged them not to be resigned, and to find ways to remain hopeful and grateful. He insisted, though, that justice was part of the equation.",
      "\u201cLet us cast off the armor of our ethnic and political divisions, open our religious confessions to mutual encounter and reawaken in our hearts the dream of a united Lebanon,\u201d he said. \u201cA Lebanon where peace and justice reign, where all recognize each other as brothers and sisters.\u201d",
      "\u201cLebanon, stand up! Be a home of justice and fraternity! Be a prophetic sign of peace for the whole of the Levant!\u201d",
      "The American pope opened his final day in Lebanon with an emotional visit to the De La Croix hospital, which specializes in care for people with psychological problems. Awaiting him were some familiar-looking faces: young boys dressed up as Swiss Guards and cardinals, and even one dressed as the pope himself in all white.",
      "The mother superior of the congregation that runs the hospital, Mother Marie Makhlouf, was overcome as she welcomed the pope, telling him that her hospital cares for the \u201cforgotten souls, burdened by their loneliness.\u201d",
      "Leo said the facility stands as a reminder to all of humanity. \u201cWe cannot forget those who are most fragile. We cannot conceive of a society that races ahead at full speed clinging to the false myths of well-being, while at the same time ignoring so many situations of poverty and vulnerability,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cFor Lebanon, (the visit) means a lot,\" said pilgrim Maggie Claudine, who was waiting for Leo at the hospital. \"We hope that peace will prevail, and that is what we wish for. We want to live in comfort.\u201d",
      "Leo has sought to bring a message of peace to Lebanon as it copes with the economic crises, the aftermath of last year's devastating war between Hezbollah and Israel and the fallout from the port blast.",
      "Among those on hand to welcome Leo at the blast site was Lebanon Social Affairs Minister Haneen Sayed, whose mother was killed. Another was Mireille Khoury, whose 15-year-old son, Elias, was killed.",

      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- Two former apartheid-era police officers in South Africa were found guilty of murder Tuesday in the 1987 killing of activist and student leader Caiphus Nyoka.",
      "Nyoka's fatal shooting at his family home near Johannesburg during the period of white minority rule was one of many alleged abuses by apartheid police that went unpunished for decades.",
      "Abraham Engelbrecht and Pieter Stander, who prosecutors said are both in their 60s, were convicted by a judge in the Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg. They will be sentenced later. A third former police officer was acquitted.",
      "They were brought to trial after another ex-police officer confessed publicly to Nyoka's killing in 2019 \u2014 more than 30 years later. Johan Marais, who was a member of a special police unit called the Reaction Unit, pleaded guilty to murder in Nyoka's killing and was sentenced to 15 years in prison in July.",
      "Nyoka, a local anti-apartheid activist, was shot at least 12 times when officers from the notorious Reaction Unit and Special Branch unit stormed his family home in the predawn hours, according to a 1988 pathology report and court records. The pathologist found that he was likely shot in the head, neck and shoulder while sitting up in bed and was then shot multiple times in the chest, arms and hands after he fell back.",
      "At the time, police were cleared of wrongdoing after claiming they acted in self-defense. It was common during apartheid for authorities to clear the police of any blame to cover up political killings.",
      "Nyoka's case was reexamined in 1997 by South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, an inquiry set up after white minority rule ended in 1994 to expose apartheid-era abuses and give perpetrators the chance to confess and apply for amnesty in an effort at reconciliation. No one came forward then to accept responsibility for Nyoka's killing.",

A new inquest into the 1967 death of Albert Luthuli, the then-leader of the African National Congress anti-apartheid movement, ruled in October that he was beaten to death, likely by security police, and rejected a finding by an apartheid-era inquest that he died as a result of being hit by a freight train.",
      "Authorities have also said they will hold a new investigation into the 1977 death in police custody of iconic anti-apartheid figure Steve Biko, whose killing sparked a renewed global outcry against South Africa's brutal system of forced segregation.",
      "Another inquiry will examine if South Africa\u2019s democratic post-apartheid governments that were led by the ANC deliberately blocked investigations into killings, as some families of victims alleged.",

      "As Hong Kong mourns after a high-rise fire killed at least 151 people, anger is mounting over building safety lapses and government oversight",
      "HONG KONG -- Uncomfortable questions are being raised over who is to blame for Hong Kong\u2019s deadliest blaze in decades.",
      "As the territory mourns over the high-rise apartment fire that killed at least 151 people, anger and frustration are mounting over building safety lapses, suspected construction corruption and lax government oversight.",
      "But bigger issues are at play. Some political analysts and observers say the tragedy could be the \u201ctip of an iceberg\u201d in Hong Kong, a city whose skyline is built on high-rise buildings. Suspicions of bid-rigging and use of hazardous construction materials in renovation projects across other housing estates have left many worried the disaster could be repeated.",
      "Police and the city's anti-corruption body have arrested 14 people so far in a wide-ranging probe into a multi-million dollar renovation project at the Wang Fuk Court apartment complex, where the fire broke out on Wednesday. Those detained include scaffolding subcontractors, directors of a construction company and a consultancy, many of them on suspicion of manslaughter and gross negligence.",
      "\u201cThe question (one) should be asking, really is that, what happened at Wang Fuk Court, can it happen elsewhere?\u201d said Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London.",
      "Hong Kong officials initially said tests of green netting covering bamboo scaffolding at the housing complex in suburban Tai Po showed that it met fire safety codes, but highly flammable foam panels used to seal windows during the repairs, aided by strong winds, caused the blaze to spread swiftly between seven of the eight towers in the complex.",
      "But on Monday, Eric Chan, Hong Kong\u2019s chief secretary, said that seven of 20 additional samples collected later from the site failed to meet safety standards. Authorities said there was evidence contractors cut costs by using cheaper substandard netting along with standard materials to pad their profits, after a typhoon in July damaged some of the netting originally installed.",
      "Some fire alarms failed to sound when the fire broke out, residents and officials said.",
      "\u201cIt did open a Pandora\u2019s box,\u201d said John Burns, an honorary professor of politics and public administration at the University of Hong Kong (HKU).",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got all of these issues which have been swept under the table,\u201d said HKU\u2019s Burns. \u201cBecause of all that we now know -- or believe we know -- about bid-rigging, collusion, corruption, no fire alarms, government negligence, all of these things have come out.\u201d",
      "As a precaution, authorities suspended work on renovations at 28 other projects managed by the same construction company. With residents of high-rises worried, contractors were removing foam boards and netting used to cover scaffolding at other projects.",
      "The netting \u201cis not a one particular estate problem. It\u2019s a much wider general problem,\u201d said Tsang of SOAS.",
      "Government oversight also has come into question. Residents of Wang Fuk Court had been voicing safety concerns to the authorities about construction materials such as netting used in the renovations, according to documents reviewed by The Associated Press.",
      "The Labor Department said it reviewed netting's product quality certificate and found it \u201cin line\u201d with standards. It also said it had conducted 16 inspections at the complex since last year -- most recently about a week before the fire -- and had warned contractors repeatedly they had to ensure they met fire safety requirements.",

      "Responding to public pressure, the territory\u2019s chief executive, John Lee, said Tuesday that an independent committee of inquiry led by a judge will investigate the fire. He brushed aside a question from a reporter on if he should keep his job.",

That is exactly why we must act seriously to ensure that all these loopholes are plugged,\u201d he said, adding that the \u201cwhole building renovation system\u201d will also be reformed to prevent any further such disasters.",

      "Critics say bid-rigging and other collusion, inflated costs and a lack of transparency are common in Hong Kong projects. Multi-layered subcontracting chains, which are common for big projects, raise the risks for substandard work and limited oversight, said Jason Poon, a contractor turned activist who has exposed problems at other Hong Kong construction projects.",

      "As Generation Z and millennials incorporate sustainability into events like weddings and birthdays, some are growing their own bouquets or picking wildflowers straight from local fields",
      "Instead of hiring a florist for her October wedding, Emily Day decided to grow her own flowers in her front yard in Calgary, Canada \u2014 a creative challenge that turned into a lesson on the hidden climate costs of the global flower industry. She said her homegrown arrangements were just as beautiful as store-bought ones and cost a fraction of the price.",
      "Day and her fiance built garden boxes out of wooden shipping containers in March and filled them with blooms like yarrow, feverfew, strawflowers and statice. They harvested and dried them in midsummer ahead of fall frosts. On her wedding day, her bouquets featured autumn shades accented by blue echinops from a local farmer and tansy she foraged from roadside ditches.",
      "Because her flowers were dried, they\u2019ll last far longer than a typical wedding arrangement. In total, she spent about 1,300 Canadian dollars ($925), a fraction of what many couples pay florists. Day said growing her own flowers made her think more about the environmental costs behind imported blooms \u2014 from the plastic packaging they arrive in, to the fuel used to fly them across continents.",
      "As Generation Z and millennials incorporate sustainability into weddings and other special events, some are growing their own bouquets, picking wildflowers or using potted plants. Businesses are sourcing their flowers locally and collecting and repurposing flowers when the event\u2019s done.",
      "The path many imported fresh flowers take to North America often begins in South America and involves a supply chain full of carbon emissions, said Kai Chan, professor of sustainability science at the University of British Columbia.",
      "Flowers perish quickly when they are cut, so they are refrigerated and transported on planes, both of which require energy and release planet-warming gases. Growing massive fields of roses, or any other single plant, typically requires clearing trees and other natural vegetation. This practice, known as monoculture, harms the environment by depleting soil nutrients and making the area more vulnerable to pests.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of antithetical to the way that ecosystems work \u2026 you\u2019re fighting against nature at every turn,\u201d Chan said.",
      "He said buying flowers from local, small-scale farmers is generally favorable because the blooms don't travel as far and the farmers typically follow practices attuned to the local environment.",
      "Holly Lukasiewicz, who owns District 2 Florals in Omaha, Nebraska, incorporates sustainable practices such as sourcing locally and avoiding the green foam blocks that are used to anchor arrangements but typically aren't biodegradable. For an extra fee, she\u2019ll pick up the flowers and compost them. She also presses and preserves flowers for clients.",
      "\u201cWhen I started my business, I knew that I wanted to recycle everything that I could, compost what I could, repurpose what I could,\u201d Lukasiewicz said.",
      "Lukasiewicz hopes more clients will embrace seasonal and local selections rather than expecting any flower, any time of the year.",
      "For decades, much of the flower industry moved abroad because of trade policies and lower costs. Imported flowers are often cheaper, especially when customers want something that can't be grown locally.",

      "Students applying to college know they're not supposed to use AI chatbots to write their essays",
      "Students applying to college know they can\u2019t \u2014 or at least shouldn\u2019t \u2014 use AI chatbots to write their essays and personal statements. So it might come as a surprise that some schools are now using artificial intelligence to read them.",
      "AI tools are now being incorporated into how student applications are screened and analyzed, admissions directors say. It can be a delicate topic, and not all colleges are eager to talk about it, but higher education is among the many industries where artificial intelligence is rapidly taking on tasks once reserved for humans.",
      "In some cases, schools are quietly slipping AI into their evaluation process, experts say. Others are touting the technology\u2019s potential to speed up their review of applications, cut processing times and even perform some tasks better than humans.",
      "\u201cHumans get tired; some days are better than others. The AI does not get tired. It doesn\u2019t get grumpy. It doesn\u2019t have a bad day. The AI is consistent,\u201d says Juan Espinoza, vice provost for enrollment management at Virginia Tech.",
      "This fall, Virginia Tech is debuting an AI-powered essay reader. The college expects it will be able to inform students of admissions decisions a month sooner than usual, in late January, because of the tool's help sorting tens of thousands of applications.",
      "Colleges stress they are not relying on AI to make admissions decisions, using it primarily to review transcripts and eliminate data-entry tasks. But artificial intelligence also is playing a role in evaluating students. Some highly selective schools are adopting AI tools to vet the increasingly curated application packages that some students develop with the help of high-priced admissions consultants.",
      "The California Institute of Technology is launching an AI tool this fall to look for \u201cauthenticity\u201d in students who submit research projects with their applications, admissions director Ashley Pallie said. Students upload their research to an AI chatbot that interviews them about it on video, which is then reviewed by Caltech faculty.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a gauge of authenticity. Can you claim this research intellectually? Is there a level of joy around your project? That passion is important to us,\u201d Pallie said.",
      "The prevalence of AI usage is difficult to gauge because it is such a new trend, said Ruby Bhattacharya, chair of the admission practices committee at the National Association for College Admission Counseling. NACAC updated its ethics guide this fall to add a section on artificial intelligence. It urges colleges to ensure the way they use it \u201caligns with our shared values of transparency, integrity, fairness and respect for student dignity.\u201d",
      "The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill faced a barrage of negative feedback from applicants, parents and students after its student newspaper, The Daily Tar Heel, reported in January the school was using AI to evaluate the grammar and writing style of applicants' essays.",
      "The university declined to comment for this article and referred to its admissions website, which it updated after the criticism. \u201cUNC uses AI programs to provide data points about students\u2019 common application essay and their school transcripts,\u201d the website says. Every application \u201cis evaluated comprehensively by extensively trained human application evaluators.\u201d",
      "At Virginia Tech, Espinoza said he has been contacted by several colleges that are interested in the new technology but wary of backlash. \u201cThe feedback from a lot of colleagues is, \u2018You roll this out, we\u2019re watching you, and we\u2019ll see how everyone\u2019s reacting,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "He stressed the AI reader his school spent three years developing is being used only to confirm human readers' essay scores.",
      "Until this fall, each of the four short-answer essays Virginia Tech applicants submit was read and scored by two people. Under the new system, one of those readers is the AI model, which has been trained on past applicant essays and the rubric for scoring, Espinoza said.",

      "A second person will step in if the AI and human reader disagree by more than two points on a 12-point scoring scale.",
      "Like many colleges, Virginia Tech has seen a huge increase in applications since making SATs optional. Last year, it received a record 57,622 applications for its 7,000-seat freshman class. Even with 200 essay readers, the school has struggled to keep up and found itself notifying students later and later.",
      "The AI tool can scan about 250,000 essays in under an hour, compared with a human reader who averages two minutes per essay. Based on last year\u2019s application pool, \u201cWe\u2019re saving at least 8,000 hours,\u201d Espinoza said.",
      "The messaging is sensitive for colleges, many of which now have students certify that they have not used AI unethically for essays and other parts of the application. But schools say AI tools can help admissions offices eliminate errors in tasks like uploading transcripts and can simplify the process for students.",
      "Georgia Tech this fall is rolling out an AI tool to review the college transcripts of transfer students, replacing the need for staff to enter each course manually into a database. It will allow the school to inform applicants more quickly how many transfer credits they'll receive, cutting down on uncertainty and wait times, said Richard Clark, the school's executive director of enrollment management.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one more layer of delay and stress and inevitable errors. AI is going to kill that, which I\u2019m so excited about,\u201d Clark said. The school hopes to expand the service soon to all high school transcripts. Georgia Tech also is testing out AI tools for other uses, including one that would identify low-income students who are eligible for federal Pell Grants but may not have realized it.",
      "Stony Brook University in New York is also using artificial intelligence to review applicants' transcripts and testing AI tools for a variety of tasks, like summarizing student essays and letters of recommendation to highlight things an admissions officer should consider, said Richard Beatty, the school\u2019s senior associate provost for enrollment management.",
      "\u201cMaybe a student was fighting a disease sophomore year. Or maybe a parent passed away, or they\u2019re taking care of siblings at home. All these things matter, and it allows the counselors to look at the transcript differently,\u201d Beatty said.",
      "Colleges are interested in AI summaries of transcripts, extracurricular activities and letters of recommendation that tell human readers the students\u2019 story in a more digestible way, said Emily Pacheco, founder of NACAC\u2019s special interest group for AI and admission.",
      "\u201cHumans and AI working together \u2014 that is the key right now. Every step along the way can be greatly improved: transcript reading, essay reviews, telling us things we might be missing about the students,\u201d said Pacheco, a former assistant director of admission at Loyola University Chicago. \u201cTen years from now, all bets are off. I\u2019m guessing AI will be admitting students.\u201d",

      "Set yourself up for success as the year winds down",
      "As 2025 winds down, here are some moves to help you finish the year strong financially. Morningstar\u2019s director of personal finance and retirement planning, Christine Benz, discusses strategies.",
      "This interview has been edited for length and clarity.",
      "Q: What are the benefits of portfolio rebalancing, and who most needs to do it?",
      "A: The main benefit of rebalancing is risk reduction. You trim securities that have performed really well, presumably ones with higher valuations today. And you redirect the money into securities where returns have lagged, but valuations might be more attractive. It\u2019s also important to rebalance on an ongoing basis as you get closer to your spending target.",
      "As retirement approaches, we need to spend that money, so you want to de-risk your portfolio and build safer asset reserves. Investors age 50 and above really need to take notice of rebalancing. It\u2019s time to take some winnings and build safer assets that you could access if you needed to spend from your portfolio. Moving money into high-quality bonds removes risk and takes advantage of current attractive yields.",
      "Q: What do you recommend for people who are still working and saving for retirement?",
      "A: They should rebalance as well, but their main consideration should be their U.S. versus non-U.S. exposure. Most investors are underallocated in international stocks. Consider your style diversification as well, paying attention to underperforming areas.",
      "Review your retirement contributions, to see if you can boost or even max out your company retirement plan for the year. People over 50 can make catch-up contributions, and there are special catch-up contributions this year for people between 60 and 63. You can contribute to IRAs and HSAs until the tax filing deadline.",
      "Q: How can people over 73 connect their RMDs with portfolio rebalancing?",
      "A: Required minimum distributions must be taken on time, but they can also help meet your rebalancing. By using appreciated securities to meet your RMD, you de-risk your portfolio, satisfy the IRS\u2019 obligations, and may free up assets to supply your cash flow needs for next year.",
      "Q: Is it also a good time to look at your insurance coverage?",
      "A: Whether you are doing open enrollment for employer-provided health care or for Medicare, it\u2019s important to shop around. Take stock of what has changed in your situation, and in the plans on offer. This is particularly important for employer-provided plans, which change frequently. Married couples often select whichever spouse\u2019s plan looks better and most affordable, but sometimes it\u2019s more cost-effective for each partner to be covered by their own company\u2019s plan.",
      "Q: How can charitable donations connect with RMDs and lessen your portfolio risk?",
      "A: Investors with highly appreciated holdings in taxable accounts should consider giving appreciated assets directly to charity or sending them to a donor-advised fund. You can disburse from the donor-advised fund to charities over multiple years. Donating removes a highly appreciated asset from your portfolio, which can lessen risk, and removes the tax liability associated with that holding. You won\u2019t owe taxes on donated funds, and you could get a tax deduction.",

      "The ministry said the app, which is available to India\u2019s 1.2 billion smartphone users, was essential in \u201ccurbing misuse of telecom resources for cyber frauds and ensuring telecom cyber security.\u201d But privacy advocates say the order marks an effort to erode user privacy and consent.",
      "\u201cThis is the beginning. It is government testing the waters,\u201d said Nikhil Pahwa, a digital policy expert and founder of the tech site MediaNama. \u201cOnce a government app is forcibly pre-installed on our devices, what\u2019s to stop them from pushing future apps that could be used for surveillance?\u201d",
      "The \u201cSanchar Saathi\u201d app, which was released in January, was designed to let users block and track lost or stolen phones and to identify and shut down fraudulent mobile connections. Since its launch, it has drawn more than 5 million downloads and helped recover more than 700,000 lost devices, according to government data.",
      "Pahwa said the main concern is that the app\u2019s role could eventually expand, giving authorities greater ability to \u201caccess device status.\u201d He said the order also removes user consent as a choice.",

      "Hong Kong authorities say the netting on buildings that caught fire last week did not meet codes for fire resistance",
      "HONG KONG -- Hong Kong officials said Monday that their investigation into a deadly blaze that killed at least 151 has revealed netting that covered scaffolding used in renovations was not up to fire-safety codes, as a wave of public sympathy and support was met by government moves to stifle criticism.",
      "Wednesday\u2019s blaze, which took until Friday to fully extinguish, started on the lower-level netting around one building in the Wang Fuk Court complex. It then swept inside as the foam panels caught fire and blew out windows. Winds carried flames from building to building. Soon, seven of the eight apartment towers were ablaze.",
      "Initial tests of the netting showed it was up to code, but subsequently investigators collected 20 samples from all areas, including higher floors, and found seven failed safety standards, suggesting contractors skimped to make greater profits, said Eric Chan, Hong Kong\u2019s Chief Secretary.",
      "\u201cThey just wanted to make money at the expense of people\u2019s lives,\u201d he told reporters.",
      "Chris Tang, Hong Kong\u2019s Secretary for Security, said investigators initially hadn\u2019t been able to reach certain areas, which led to the new findings.",
      "\u201cBecause the fire is now out, we have been able to get to places that were not easily accessible before to take samples,\u201d",
      "Donations for survivors of the fire had reached 900 million Hong Kong dollars (US$115 million) as of Monday, authorities said, as a steady stream of people placed flowers, cards and other tributes at a makeshift memorial near the burned out block of buildings.",
      "\u201cWhen something happens, we come out to help each other, \u201d said Loretta Loh, after paying her regards at the site. \u201cI have a heavy heart.\u201d",
      "Some 4,600 people lived in the Wang Fuk Court complex in the suburb of Tai Po.",
      "Hong Kong police Disaster Victim Identification Unit staff went through five of the burned buildings but only made partial progress through the remaining two, said Tsang Shuk-yin, head of Hong Kong police\u2019s casualty enquiry unit. Teams were assessing the safety of the other buildings, including the one that caught fire first and suffered the worst damage.",
      "On Monday they recovered another eight bodies, including three firefighters found earlier but could retrieve. Dozens of people remain unaccounted for, but some are likely among the 39 bodies not yet identified, Tsang said.",
      "\u201cWe will have to wait until we get through all seven blocks before we can make a final report,\u201d she said.",
      "The donations and 300 million Hong Kong dollars ($38.5 million) in start-up capital from the government will be used to help victims rebuild their homes and provide long--term support, local officials said. The government has also given survivors cash subsidies to help with expenses, including funerals, and is working to find them housing.",
      "By Monday, 683 residents had found places in local hotels and hostels, and another 1,144 moved into transitional housing units. Two emergency shelters remained open for others, authorities said.",

The latest inspection was just a week before the fire.",

      "Dissent in the city has been muzzled since hundreds of thousands took to the streets in 2019 against government plans to allow extradition to mainland China. Hong Kong now virtually bans mass protests and bars opposition political figures from running in legislature elections.",

      "Organizers say that interest in local, grassroots initiatives to meet community needs has been growing",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 \u201cTimes are tough. We take care of us.\"",
      "In early November, Kashish Ali posted those words to her Instagram story as part of a yearslong practice she's had to fundraise for food and drop it off at community fridges in Atlanta, where she's from, and now in New York, where she lives. Ali, who is 32 and a first generation Pakistani immigrant, estimated that her friends and family have trusted her with thousands of dollars over the past couple of years.",
      "For her, it's a practice of giving back and creating connection. It's also part of a growing interest in grassroots efforts to meet community needs that many call \u201c mutual aid.\u201d Often, mutual aid just comes down to neighbors helping neighbors, and as many face high prices, cuts to government programs and political uncertainty, organizers say interest has swelled. Donating effort or time to mutual aid organizing is also another way to mark GivingTuesday, which falls on Dec. 2 this year, and has become a major day to support nonprofits.",
      "Ali first noticed a fridge on the street outside of a brewery in Atlanta in 2021 and got in touch with the organizers via social media. She completed a brief volunteer orientation, joined a group text chat and then posted on her Instagram that she would buy and drop off groceries.",
      "\u201cI ended up raising $700 in like three to four hours, which was insane,\u201d she said.",
      "Now, Ali doesn't think of her grocery runs as volunteering but rather as a habit engrained in her life that directly connects to those around her. She said when she starts putting granola bars, fruit or yogurt into a fridge, people immediately come around to look, chat and grab something to eat.",
      "Afterwards, Ali posts her grocery receipts and photos of the filled fridge to her Instagram account.",
      "\u201cWhat I noticed was a lot of my friends and family and coworkers and colleagues, they all want to get involved. They want to give back,\" she said. \"But sometimes donating your cash or money to whatever organization, you don\u2019t really see what happens with it per se, especially not immediately. So this was a way to get almost instant gratification.\"",
      "One of the principles of mutual aid is that it welcomes everyone. There's no need to show an ID or prove income or residency, and most often, the organizers of these types of very local projects are all volunteers. Organizers are also often recipients, with many groups seeking to remove the distinction entirely between those who give help and those who need it.",
      "The low barriers to entry and lack of hierarchy are also part of what distinguishes this approach from the work of nonprofits, organizers said. A mantra of mutual aid is, \u201csolidarity not charity.\u201d",
      "Interest in mutual aid organizing often spikes in response to crises, like the COVID-19 pandemic and now, economic and political uncertainty under the second Trump administration.",
      "Aaron Fernando, who works as an organizer for Shareable, which publishes resources about mutual aid and cooperatives, said they saw huge interest in the Mutual Aid 101 webinars they launched earlier this year. Some 1,100 people attended the first one, up from around 70 attendees at a typical webinar.",
      "\u201cIt just is and continues to be a disempowering and scary time for a lot of populations,\u201d said Fernando, which he said encourages people to seek new options to find resources and keep their communities safe.",

Formerly a merchandiser in fashion, Nu\u00f1ez and her fellow organizers specialize at finding free stuff.",
      "Her group started hearing from friends working in the service industry about which restaurants were throwing food away. Now, they have arrangements with Trader Joe\u2019s and Wegmans to pick up food that would otherwise go to waste. They put produce and prepared foods in community fridges outside their Brooklyn storefront and it\u2019s taken almost immediately.",
      "\u201cWe thought, we need to organize and see how we could help each other.\u201d Nu\u00f1ez said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s literally the whole thought process behind it is like, we\u2019re scared and we need to huddle in and help each other.\u201d",

      "\u201cUsually, we want people to branch off and make their own groups because if we all have groups, it just makes us stronger,\u201d she said.",

But they make decisions collectively and rely extensively on volunteers, though they do pay some staff members, including Georgina Edmonds, who has lived in the neighborhood for more than 30 years.",
      "At a recent food distribution where they were handing out lentils, tofu, carrots, potatoes, onions, cabbage and apples, Edmonds said the group empowers its member to make decisions and shape the direction of their work. For example, she wants to start a project with a community garden nearby to grow medicinal herbs from seeds.",

      "NEW YORK -- Starbucks will pay about $35 million to more than 15,000 New York City workers to settle claims it denied them stable schedules and arbitrarily cut their hours, city officials announced Monday.",
      "The company will also pay $3.4 million in civil penalties under the agreement with the city's Department of Consumer and Worker Protection. It also agrees to comply with the city's Fair Workweek law going forward.",
      "A company spokeswoman said Starbucks is committed to operating responsibly and in compliance with all applicable local laws and regulations in every market where it does business, but also noted the complexities of the city\u2019s law.",
      "\u201cThis (law) is notoriously challenging to manage and this isn\u2019t just a Starbucks issue, nearly every retailer in the city faces these roadblocks,\u201d spokeswoman Jaci Anderson said.",
      "Most of the affected employees who held hourly positions will receive $50 for each week worked from July 2021 through July 2024, the department said. Workers who experienced a violation after that may be eligible for compensation by filing a complaint with the department.",

      "The city began investigating in 2022 after receiving dozens of worker complaints against several Starbucks locations, and eventually expanded its investigation to the hundreds of stores in the city. The probe found most Starbucks employees never got regular schedules and the company routinely reduced employees\u2019 hours by more than 15%, making it difficult for staffers to know their regular weekly earnings and plan other commitments, such as child care, education or other jobs.",
      "The company also routinely denied workers the chance to pick up extra shifts, leaving them involuntarily in part-time status, according to the city.",
      "The agreement with New York comes as Starbucks\u2019 union continues a nationwide strike at dozens of locations that began last month. The number of affected stores and the strike's impact remain in dispute by the two sides.",

      "Hondurans say security and jobs remain their top priorities, despite an economy that has strengthened during Castro\u2019s administration.

      "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- As Missouri launches sports betting Monday, people will be able to wager on how many points a particular athlete will score in a game \u2014 so long as it doesn't involve a Missouri college or university.",
      "The restriction on \" proposition bets,\" though less sweeping than in some states, highlights an area of rising concern as legal sports betting spreads to its 39th state in a steady expansion since the Supreme Court cleared the way for it in 2018.",
      "In the weeks leading up to Missouri's betting debut, one scandal after another has rocked the sports world. Two Cleveland Guardians pitchers were charged with taking bribes to throw certain pitches. An NBA player was arrested over an alleged scheme to provide inside information to gamblers. And the NCAA revoked the eligibility of six men\u2019s college basketball players accused of manipulating their performance in games.",
      "All centered around the outcome of prop bets, a popular type of wager often focused on what individual players will do in a game \u2014 like achieving a certain number of strikeouts in baseball, racking up a certain amount of points and rebounds in basketball, or surpassing a particular passing yardage in football.",
      "For bettors, a lot can ride on one player, putting those athletes at risk of threats or enticements to rig their performance.",
      "Sports betting operators took in over $11 billion through the first three-quarters of this year, up more than 13% from the same span last year, according to the American Gaming Association, which represents the industry.",
      "Though national data is lacking about the prevalence of prop bets, they are \u201can increasingly popular way in which to provide for engagement for any type of fan,\u201d said Joe Maloney, the association's senior vice president of strategic communications.",
      "West Virginia, which was among the first to allow sports betting after the court ruling, now is collecting a trove of data from the industry. During a roughly one-month period this summer, prop bets comprised more than half of all wagers made through one of the largest sports betting platforms, said Brad Humphreys, an economics professor and director of the Center for Gaming Research and Development at West Virginia University.",
      "Additionally, he said, almost all bets involved parlays, where two or more wagers are grouped together under the umbrella of a larger bet. To win, a person must be right on each prong in the bet, making the odds of success longer and the potential payout larger.",
      "Because prop bets \u201cspeed up the ability to make multiple bets,\u201d they carry a higher risk of developing addictive behavior for some bettors, said Rachel Volberg, a research professor of epidemiology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who has spent decades studying gambling.",
      "Most states provide some money for problem gambling services. Missouri's new sports betting program allots at least $5 million annually for that purpose.",
      "Prop bets on professional athletes are currently allowed in every state that has legalized sports betting, though legislation proposed in New Jersey would ban them. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine has urged state regulators to end player-specific micro betting and told The Associated Press recently he regrets signing the law that legalized sports gambling in his state.",
      "States have widely differing rules for bets on college athletes. More than a dozen states place no limits on collegiate prop bets while an equal number prohibit all such bets. Other states fall somewhere in between. Missouri is one of over a half-dozen states with a prop bet prohibition pertaining only to games involving college teams from their states.",

      "A blanket ban on prop bets likely would drive people to illegal and unregulated sportsbooks, placing bettors at greater risk and making it harder to flag problems, the Sports Betting Alliance said.",
      "Others doubt that Missouri's narrowly tailored prop bet restrictions will have much impact in an Internet-connected society where people can easily bet on athletes playing anywhere in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s going to be a Band-Aid on a dam that\u2019s breaking here,\u201d said Nathan Novemsky, a professor of marketing and psychology at Yale University, \"because folks will just make those bets on other teams.\u201d",

      "But the job of detecting fraudulent bets falls largely to sports betting operators working with sports leagues and law enforcement agencies. After the recent indictment of two Guardians pitchers, Major League Baseball announced an agreement with leading sportsbooks to cap bets on individual pitches at $200 and exclude them from parlays.",

      "WASHINGTON -- For many children, the experience of getting their first pair of glasses is an inevitable milestone, the first in a lifetime of visits to the eye doctor.",
      "But what if those lenses could actually help preserve the child\u2019s vision and reduce the chances for more serious eye problems in adulthood?",
      "That\u2019s the promise of a new type of lens approved by the Food and Drug Administration in September. While the technology has previously been available in Europe, Asia and other parts of the world, it\u2019s now rolling out in the U.S.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the new approach.",
      "Myopia, commonly called nearsightedness, is when people can clearly see objects at close range but struggle with distant objects, which often appear blurry or indistinct.",
      "Studies conducted around the world have shown rising rates of myopia, which researchers have associated with increased time indoors looking at screens, books and other objects held close to the eyes.",
      "In the U.S., 30% to 40% of children will have myopia by the time they finish high school, according to Dr. Michael Repka, a professor and pediatric ophthalmologist at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.",
      "Until now, doctors had few options for treating the condition.",
      "\u201cIt was typically and simply: \u2018Your child needs to wear glasses and they\u2019ll live with it,\u2019\u201d Repka said. \u201c'It will be lifelong and it will likely get worse over the next few years.\u2019\u201d",
      "The specialized glasses, sold under the brand Essilor Stellest, are approved by the FDA to slow nearsightedness in 6- to 12-year-olds.",
      "The FDA said it cleared the lenses based on company data showing children experienced a 70% reduction in the progression of their myopia after two years.",
      "Over time, myopia causes the eye to grow longer, worsening vision and increasing the risk of tears to the retina \u2014 the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye that is essential for vision.",
      "The new lenses use 11 concentric rings filled with tiny raised dots to refocus light onto the retina in a way that is believed to slow elongation of the eye.",
      "\u201cWhether this hypothesis is ultimately proven to be true, of course, matters only in part,\u201d Repka said, noting that the lenses appear to work regardless of how the underling science works.",
      "In the company study, children wearing the lens showed a 50% reduction in eye lengthening when measured after two years. Currently, researchers in the U.S. and other countries are conducting their own independent studies to confirm those results.",

      "Major U.S. vision insurance providers are expected to cover the lenses for children who meet the prescribing criteria.",
      "The only other FDA-approved product to slow myopia are contact lenses made by a company called MiSight. The daily disposable lenses, approved in 2019, use a similar approach intended to slow the progression of nearsightedness in children ages 8 to 12.",

      "\u201cA lot of people might be hesitant to put a child as young as 8 in contact lenses, so the glasses offer a really nice alternative,\u201d she said.",

      "Since it started as a hashtag in 2012, GivingTuesday, the Tuesday after Thanksgiving, has become one of the biggest fundraising days of the year for nonprofits in the U.S. This year, nonprofits face uncertainty about how donors may respond to a range of changing factors.",
      "High prices may affect how much small dollar donors give this year or how many charities they will support. But President Donald Trump\u2019s tax and spending legislation, which passed in July, also included a new charitable deduction of up to $1,000 for individuals and $2,000 for married couples for the majority of tax filers. That could incentivize more households to give.",
      "For larger donors, a strong stock market usually indicates they will give generously. These major donors also make up an increasingly important share of overall charitable donations and are more likely to give than less economically well off households, according to a study from the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy in partnership with Bank of America.",
      "Nonprofits are also letting potential supporters know about a range of new challenges this year, with many human service organizations seeing higher demand while facing cuts to government grants, especially last month's freeze of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits. And many charities are highlighting programs that will match or multiply donations \u2014 even up to a factor of five at some nonprofits \u2014 to showcase increased impact.",
      "Altogether, that sets up GivingTuesday, which falls on Dec. 2 to be a high stakes fundraising day for U.S. nonprofits.",
      "The #GivingTuesday hashtag started as a project of the 92nd Street Y in New York in 2012 and became an independent organization in 2020. It\u2019s grown into a worldwide network of local organizations that promote giving in their communities, often on different dates that have local relevance, like holidays.",
      "Now, GivingTuesday, the nonprofit, also convenes researchers working on topics about everyday giving. It also collects data from a wide range of sources like payment processors, crowdfunding sites, employee giving software and institutions that offer donor-advised funds, a kind of charitable giving account.",
      "The hashtag was started to promote generosity and the nonprofit continues to promote giving in the broadest sense.",
      "For nonprofits, the point of GivingTuesday is to raise money and engage their supporters. Many will be familiar with the barrage of email and mail appeals that coincide on the Tuesday after Thanksgiving. Essentially all major American nonprofits will organize fundraising campaigns and many smaller, local groups also participate.",
      "Nonprofits don\u2019t have to be affiliated in any way with GivingTuesday, the organization, to run a fundraising campaign. They can just do it, though GivingTuesday does provide graphics and advice. In that way, it remains a grassroots effort with groups and donors participating however they like.",

      "You could consider giving to organizations based in your community, whose impact will be felt locally. You could also choose to support a nonprofit that works on a cause you have a personal connection to. There are also many organizations that rate nonprofits or offer analysis about which organizations are most effective, though you will see a range of opinions on what it means to be effective.",
      "Many nonprofits appreciate donors committing to give smaller gifts each month rather than one lump sum at the end of the year. These regular donations help them plan ahead.",
      "You can also consider giving directly to people on crowdfunding sites or through mutual aid networks, which are often small, informal groups that organize to meet local needs.",
      "That depends on how success is measured, but it certainly has grown far beyond the initial effort to promote giving on social media. The day has become an enduring and well-known event that seeks to center charitable giving, volunteering and civic participation in the U.S. and around the world.",

Some say that Rixi Moncada, LIBRE\u2019s candidate, would have suffered even without Trump\u2019s attacks and warning that she would take Honduras down the same path as Venezuela. After all, Trump said the same about Nasralla, and he was only a few hundred votes behind Asfura with ballots from about 57% of polling places counted Monday.",

      "However, it remained unclear if Asfura\u2019s early edge in the preliminary results would hold. He predictably enjoyed heavy support in the capital, whose tallies were among the first to arrive. But as the count inched along, Nasralla pulled even Monday with about 39% of the vote. The candidate who wins the most votes wins the presidency, even if the total is less than 50%.",
      "Ana Paola Hall, president of the National Electoral Council, said via the social platform X Monday afternoon, that the preliminary rapid reporting system that began providing results Sunday night had reached its conclusion with votes from 57% of polling places tallied.

      "Organizers say that in response to government funding cuts, high prices and political uncertainty, interest in mutual aid efforts has picked up",
      "When major disruptions happen in communities, often the first people to respond are the residents themselves and their neighbors. When the pandemic shut down daily life or after a disaster like a hurricane or wildfire, people get together to take care of each other.",
      "Even outside of a crisis, some who struggle to meet their needs may turn to mutual aid, the practice of finding resources from within a community and exchanging them for free.",
      "Now, in response to government funding cuts, high prices and political uncertainty, especially targeting immigrants, interest in mutual aid projects has picked up, organizers and participants say.",
      "\u201cThe exciting part about mutual aid is that you can really get together and help people in a really meaningful way just by pooling resources and being willing to reach out,\u201d said Mary Zerkel, who lives in the Rogers Park neighborhood in Chicago.",
      "Mutual aid practices have a long history, especially among immigrant and Black communities in the U.S., like the Black Panther\u2019s Survival Programs or informal pooled savings circles.",
      "Examples include sharing food, exchanging household goods and clothes or organizing shared items like tools. In recent years, groups have helped people access reproductive healthcare, including abortions, and coordinated collective responses to immigration arrests under the umbrella of providing mutual aid.",
      "In 2019, Zerkel helped start a shared artist and community space in her neighborhood along with a local chapter of Food Not Bombs, a longstanding mutual aid group that distributes food. When the pandemic hit, they cleared out the art supplies.",
      "\"All of a sudden, we had six fridges in there and we were feeding and delivering meals to 400 families,\u201d Zerkel said.",
      "Over time, the organizers adapted to changing needs. When they realized people needed items beyond food, they started a \"free store,\" where people can donate things they don't need. They trained volunteers in de-escalation techniques to diminish the possibility of ever calling the police. Later, they sourced naloxone, which reverses opioid overdoses, and held trainings on how to use it.",
      "\u201cThe main thing is that you\u2019re not trying to be an institution,\" Zerkel said. \"You\u2019re trying to be a neighbor helping a neighbor, so you can do the best that you can and try to be responsible and loving to your neighbors and build something slowly.\u201d",
      "Many mutual aid networks are not incorporated as formal organizations or nonprofits. Giving to them won't offer a tax deduction, but organizers say that because they are all volunteers, any donations they receive go directly to meeting real community needs.",
      "\u201cPeople are less suspicious of our intention. We are getting food and giving it out. We don\u2019t have any salaried employees,\u201d said Nicholas Grosso, who has organized with Sunnyside and Woodside Mutual Aid in Queens, New York.",

      "He also sees mutual aid filling in where formal systems break down. For example, they take food from companies that would otherwise throw it away and give it almost immediately to people who need it.",
      "\u201cWhether it\u2019s red tape, whether it\u2019s bureaucracy or whether it\u2019s not cost efficient for companies to connect back to the community,\u201d he said, the mutual aid group has become a bridge to the people who need things.",
      "Mutual aid projects often specifically try to avoid hierarchies and make decisions collectively. Taylor Dudley, director of coalition building at the Center for Disaster Philanthropy, said, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of community accountability to mutual aid. Often times in nonprofits, rather than having the community accountability at the center, there\u2019s accountability to donors,\u201d or to administrative or legal considerations.",
      "Mutual aid efforts are built on trust and the relationships between organizers and their communities.",
      "Aaron Fernando, who works for Shareable, which publishes resources about mutual aid and cooperatives, said the small scale of many groups helps to hold people accountable. Over time, organizers know who is reliable and who has integrity. But there is a risk that opportunists take advantage of what is being offered.",
      "Often, mutual aid groups collect money and distribute it to people who need it or use it to buy things. Groups should consider how to handle those funds as sometimes they can be flagged as income by a payment processor. The Sustainable Economies Law Center has a guide that lays out multiple scenarios that mutual aid groups might encounter. Mohini Mookim, an attorney with the center, said rules around giving money with no strings attached are generally promising for mutual aid groups.",
      "\u201cWhen people are acting motivated by love, the tax code calls it generosity or feelings of generosity, then oftentimes, there are less legal, especially tax law, implications of what you\u2019re doing,\u201d they said.",
      "Another potential risk has to do with privacy or surveillance. For example, if a group is dropping food of at someone's home, they should think carefully about who has access to those addresses.",
      "There are also examples of mutual aid groups facing charges or being asked to stop handing out food by police. Fernando, of Shareable, said that often has less to do with concerns about people getting sick from the food and more about businesses or residents nearby not wanting the food distribution to happen there.",

      "MILAN -- The last person to get their hands on a painting attributed to Leonardo da Vinci shelled out more than $450 million at auction. Now, Italian cultural officials are making it possible to purchase a limited edition, certified digital copy of the Renaissance genius\u2019 \u201cLady with Disheveled Hair\u2019\u2019 for roughly the price of a Lamborghini.",
      "The Italian nonprofit Save the Artistic Heritage with its technical partner Cinello are providing well-heeled collectors the possibility of owning a literal projection of original Italian masterpieces, sized and framed to match the museum experience.",
      "Participating museums sign a certificate of authenticity, and in return receive 50% of the profits.",
      "\u201cWe don't want to sell a piece of technology. We want to sell a piece of artwork,'' said John Blem, the Italian-born Danish entrepreneur who founded the initiative and who serves as chairman of Cinello and vice president of the nonprofit.",
      "The revenue sharing is integral to the project, which aims to help cash-strapped museums access new income streams, and a key part of the sales pitch, Blem said. Over the last two years, Save the Artistic Heritage has contributed 300,000 euros ($347,000) to its Italian museum partners, with prices of the digital masterpieces ranging from 30,000 euros to 300,000 euros.",
      "Contributing to the value, each is sold in a limited series of nine, representing the conventional number of statues that can be cast from a single mold and still be considered original.",
      "The catalog of some 250 Italian artworks comes from about 10 Italian museums and foundations, including the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana in Milan, the Capodimonte in Naples and the Pilotta in Parma, which owns Leonardo's unfinished painting on wood of a woman with windblown hair, which sold for 250,000 euros (nearly $290,000).",
      "Blem and a partner are in the process of setting up a similar nonprofit in the United States that is expected to launch next year.",
      "The digital artworks appear backlit on screens sized to match their originals, the luminescent effect bordering on Technicolor for such brightly colored masterpieces as Raffaelo's \u201cThe Marriage of the Virgin,'' which hangs in Milan's Brera Art Gallery.",
      "Others on display in the non-profit's Milan offices, like Leonardo's wind-swept portrait and Andrea Mantegna's \u201cLamentation over a Dead Christ,\u201d are more subdued. On close inspection, details are visible down to the brush stroke, but without any texture that may belong to the original.",
      "\u201cI must say that the digital copy of \u2018The Marriage of the Virgin' has aroused in me and all those who have seen it a great deal of interest,'' said Angelo Crespi, the Brera Art Gallery's director. \u201cThe perfection, the luminosity, the visibility of the painting is amazing. But at the same time it doesn't deceive. \u2026 When they get close, people can see that it's a digital copy on a screen.\u201d",

      "\u201cItalian museums, bodies, have been at the forefront of these technologies,'' he said, citing the Alinari Archive in Florence, a collection of over 5 million photographic materials dating from the mid-1800s, and the Vatican Museums, which collaborated on ultra-high-resolution digital photography to create a detailed record of the Sistine Chapel.",
      "The Brera museum last week launched another phase with Save the Artistic Heritage, with a second series of nine artworks that can be used to woo donors and for promotional purposes, reinforcing the fundraising mission. Roman numerals distinguish them from the commercial series.",
      "The Brera gets 30% of its roughly 14 million euro budget from donations, sponsors and other projects, and just 10% from the state. The rest comes from tickets. Any new revenue source is precious.",
      "\u201cSave the Heritage is not just making a sale,'' Brera director Crespi said. \u201cThey are creating a system that allows anyone who buys an artwork to contribute to the museum.''",
      "The digital copies are projected onto screens sized to scale with original artworks in replica frames. The patented technology comprises a box that contains the digital copy that unlocks when in communication with Cinello\u2019s mainframe. Computer code makes each digital copy unique.",
      "The technology is patented in Europe, the United States and China, places where Blem is looking to expand.",
      "In a next phase, Blem hopes to be able to support so-called digital exhibitions of masterpieces that are only rarely if ever put on loan, bringing them to far-flung and remote places where access to museum quality exhibitions are rare. He calls them \u201cImpossible Exhibitions.\"",

      "Sidney Crosby is on the verge of breaking Mario Lemieux's record for career regular-season points with the Pittsburgh Penguins",
      "PHILADELPHIA -- Sidney Crosby says, no, of course he has not heard from Mario Lemieux recently as the current Penguins captain moves closer to taking another franchise record from his mentor.",
      "Crosby is seven shy of Lemieux for the most regular-season points with the Penguins. He already holds the team record for regular and postseason points combined.",
      "Heck, play Philadelphia a few more times each season, and Crosby could have shattered the record years ago.",
      "Crosby scored his 58th and 59th career goals against the Flyers on Monday night. His continued excellence in the cross-state rivalry helped lead the Penguins to a 5-1 win.",
      "Crosby, who has 18 goals this season, has dominated the Flyers like no other visiting player has done in Philadelphia\u2019s franchise history. Crosby has 59 goals and 137 points in 92 games against Philadelphia, the most in both categories any opponent has ever put up on the Flyers.",
      "The 38-year-old Crosby has 1,716 career points, close to eclipsing Lemieux\u2019s 1,723 for most in franchise history. Lemieux owned the team when Crosby captained the Penguins to championships in 2009, 2016 and 2017.",
      "Lemieux seems to be saving his well-wishes for when the record ultimately falls.",
      "\u201cI'm sure he knows me well enough to know that's not something I really want to talk about it,\u201d Crosby said. \u201cJust go out there and play. If it happens, it happens.\u201d",
      "It will happen. Soon.",
      "Crosby is in the thick of the hunt for the NHL goals lead. Colorado's Nathan McKinnon and Boston's Morgan Geekie each have 20.",
      "The Flyers promoted the game all night as a Keystone Rivalry game but the series \u2014 even as fans voraciously booed Crosby with each touch \u2014 has never been much of a rivalry. Crosby has won three Stanley Cup titles while the Flyers have won only two in franchise history, in 1974 and 1975. Crosby wasn\u2019t even born until 1987.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s always been a rivalry, long before I played here,\u201d Crosby said. \u201cThese games, you always know there\u2019s a little more intensity, a little more to them. You just try to prepare accordingly. I just tried to get ready like everyone else.\u201d",
      "Crosby has never played like everyone else. He did enough damage to snap the Flyers\u2019 modest three-game winning streak \u2014 and help Pittsburgh rebound after a 7-2 loss to Toronto.",
      "\u201cWhen you have a game like that, you just want to respond, regardless of who you're playing,\u201d Crosby said.",
      "Crosby scored to give the Penguins a 1-0 lead \u2014 his 60th career road game-opening goal \u2014 and added a wrist shot through traffic on the power play for a 2-1 lead in the second period.",
      "The Penguins were one of the early surprises of the NHL season until a stretch of seven losses in nine games in November. The team considered a long shot to reach the playoffs when the season began \u2014 only Chicago and San Jose faced slimmer odds of hoisting the Stanley Cup than Pittsburgh \u2014 has since tumbled from the top spot in the Metropolitan Division it held a month into the season.",
      "The perpetually rebuilding Flyers and Penguins are tied with 31 points apiece.",
      "Crosby at least gives Penguins and NHL fans a reason to watch \u2014 his No. 87 jersey was spotted around the concourse more than any Flyer \u2014 and chasing Lemieux can spice up an otherwise dead zone in the schedule. Even his teammates, who watch him practice and play on the daily, remain in awe of Crosby.",
      "\u201cIt shows you what kind of exceptional player and person that he is, to never be satisfied with anything,\u201d said Bryan Rust, who had a goal and two assists in the victory over the Flyers. \u201cEverything he\u2019s done at a team level, at an individual level, on and off the ice. It\u2019d be easy to kind of start to pull back the reins a little bit, but I think it\u2019s almost like it\u2019s almost fueling him a little bit more to get more and more.\u201d",

      "Lane Kiffin called his past six years at Ole Miss \u201cthe best six years\u201d of his life",
      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- Lane Kiffin called his past six years at Ole Miss \u201cthe best six years\" of his life, and then tried to explain why he felt compelled to leave Oxford, Mississippi, behind and take over an LSU football program that he's always admired from afar.",
      "\u201cHaving watched this place for a long time, having been on the other sideline in this stadium, this place is different, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re here,\u201d Kiffin said. \u201cLSU is the best job in football. When you take the history, tradition, passion and the great players in the state of Louisiana ... when you\u2019re in Tiger Stadium on Saturday night, there is nothing like it.\u201d",
      "Kiffin was flown in on a private plane on Sunday night with LSU athletic director Verge Ausberry.",
      "Monday afternoon, he was standing on a podium before a festive crowd of LSU dignitaries in a premium club lounge with a panoramic view of Tiger Stadium, where massive video boards were lit up with his name and likeness.",
      "\u201cI felt like everybody that I talked to outside of the state that I was in (Mississippi) all basically said the same thing,\u201d Kiffin said, acknowledging that he also had received a \u201cunique, great call\u201d from Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry during LSU's courtship.",
      "\u201cThey all said, \u2018Man, you are going to regret it if you don\u2019t take a shot and you don\u2019t go to LSU. It\u2019s the best job in America with the best resources,\u2019\u201d Kiffin said.",
      "Ausberry said Kiffin's name was the first on everyone's lips when LSU's search committed first met to discuss candidates.",
      "Kiffin, meanwhile, said he liked the fact that Ausberry told him: \u201cI\u2019m going to leave you alone and let you coach the team.\u201d",
      "Kiffin now has a seven-year contract paying him about $13 million annually, making him, for the time being, the second-highest-paid coach in college football. Kiffin said he received similar offers from Ole Miss and Florida, but that LSU's plan for raising money for paying players impressed him the most.",
      "Just three days earlier, Kiffin was walking off a football field with triumphant Ole Miss players after an Egg Bowl victory at Mississippi State that secured the first 11-win regular season in Rebels history. Kiffin wanted to continue coaching the Rebels in the College Football Playoff, and made his case to do so during more than a day of protracted negotiations with Ole Miss athletic director Keith Carter over the weekend.",
      "Kiffin said that while he felt most people across the country agreed that he should be able to coach in the postseason, he also respected Carter's stance, because Carter would still have to live in Oxford when the season was done. Even after Kiffin had moved on to the Rebels' historical rivals in neighboring Louisiana.",
      "Kiffin said he was torn, and that making his decision to leave Ole Miss was excruciating and extremely difficult. He said he felt grateful to the people of Oxford, as well as his Rebels players and assistant coaches, for both his coaching success and quality of life he enjoyed while he was there.",
      "\u201cIt was amazing,\u201d Kiffin said. \"It will forever be a major part of my story.\u201d",

I\u2019ve been around it long enough to know that, and it\u2019s just the passion of the SEC. I\u2019m not upset at those reactions by fans, by people. I think that people get really upset when you leave somewhere because they feel hurt because you\u2019re doing a really good job.\u201d",

      "But he appreciated the enthusiasm for his arrival, and when he rode past Tiger Stadium, all lit up on Sunday night, he called his old friend and former LSU coach Ed Orgeron.",

      "Conservationists are hoping to strengthen regulations at a wildlife trade conference on birds, reptiles and other animals that are seeing their numbers decline due to the exotic pet trade",
      "A growing exotic pet trade has conservationists calling for stronger regulations to protect the reptiles, birds and other animals in the wild that are increasingly showing up for sale on internet marketplaces and becoming popular on social media.",
      "The two-week Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora is scheduled to run through Friday in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. Several proposals related to the pet trade will be considered Tuesday.",
      "Participants have proposed tighter regulations or complete bans on the trade of several species including iguanas from the Galapagos Islands, more than a dozen species of Latin America tarantulas and an odd-looking turtle from Africa.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is the pet trade much more looking at reptiles, amphibians. People want rare species and they don\u2019t have to go into a pet shop,\u201d said Susan Lieberman, vice president for international policy at the nonprofit Wildlife Conservation Society. \u201cThey go online and there are thousands of animals, including endangered species, illegally obtained species, all available on the internet.\u201d",
      "In the past, the trade was dominated by sales in animal parts like elephant ivory and tiger bones. But Matt Collis, the senior director of international policy at the International Fund for Animal Welfare, said live animals for the pet trade are increasingly turning up on the internet.",
      "\u201cThe dramatic growth in online marketplaces has put consumers directly in touch with wildlife traders and criminals around the world,\u201d Collis said. \u201cIn today\u2019s society where pretty much anything can be bought with a click of a button and shipped anywhere in the world in a matter of days, no wildlife is safe.\u201d",
      "Social media influencers, who have made owned exotic pets cool, are also contributing to the problem, Collis said.",
      "Several of the species proposed for greater protection at the CITES conference are in Latin America, where an IFAW report last year found illegal trade is on the rise. The report, covering 18 Spanish speaking Latin American countries, says there were more than 100,000 animals seized or poached from 2017 to 2022, with seizures increasing every year.",
      "The report found the live pet trade accounted for a growing piece of the trade, with reptiles representing about 60% of the animals, while nearly 30% were birds and more than 10% were amphibians. Many animals were traded locally or regionally but there also was evidence of animals shipped to collectors in Europe, Asia and the United States.",
      "More than 90% of the seized wildlife destined for Europe were live animals, confirming the demand for pets was a key driver of the illegal trade, the report said.",
      "Among the reptile species up for tighter trade controls is Home\u2019s Hinged-back Tortoise, a critically endangered turtle found in West Africa that has a unique hinge on its back allowing it to close off its back legs and tail.",
      "There are proposals to regulate the trade in two vipers species endemic to Ethiopia, two species of rattlesnake found mostly in Mexico, the leaf-tailed gecko from Australia and two species of sloths from South America, which are increasingly turning up in sloth-themed cafes in Asia.",
      "A proposal from Ecuador would ban the trade in marine and land iguanas from the Galapagos, which are listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as critically endangered or vulnerable. There are concerns that the illegal trade could further destabilize the population, which already faces threats from invasive species, rising tourism and fluctuations in weather associated with the El Nino.",
      "In its CITES proposal, Ecuador said it doesn't permit commercial export of iguanas and collecting them from the Galapagos has been prohibited for decades. But Ecuador raised concerns that traders are capturing and transporting young iguanas by boat or overland to ports and evading authorities by mislabeling them as captive bred. Most of the iguanas are destined for Japan and other Asia countries and can sell for as much $25,000 on the black market.",

      "Countries issue permits without verifying animal origins, which helps traffickers launder animals from illegal sources, \u201cundermining the very framework meant to protect these species,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cWhen the treaty was drafted in the early 1970s, there wasn't a lot of captive breeding and people thought, 'Well, if they\u2019re bred in captivity, it\u2019ll take pressure off the wild,\u201d she said. \u201cSounds good, except it doesn\u2019t work that way. Breeding in captivity also creates a market, but they\u2019re cheaper from the wild. And also it\u2019s a great way to launder.\u201d",

The proposal would permit the trade in the spiders as long as there is proof the sources are legal, sustainable and traceable.",
      "\u201cSome tarantula species are particularly vulnerable to overexploitation due to their long life span, limited geographic range and low reproductive rate,\u201d according to the proposal. \u201cAlarmingly, most of them are not regulated internationally, despite the high availability of hundreds of species in international trade.\u201d",

      "The Ministry of Communications' order issued Monday asked smartphone makers to pre-install the government\u2019s \u201cSanchar Saathi\u201d app on all new devices within 90 days and to prevent users from deleting it. The order also requires manufacturers to push the app onto older models through a software update, extending the mandate beyond phones available in the market.",
      "The ministry said the app, which is available to India\u2019s 1.2 billion smartphone users, was essential in \u201ccurbing misuse of telecom resources for cyber frauds and ensuring telecom cyber security.\u201d But privacy advocates say the order marks an effort to erode user privacy and consent.",

      "\u201cThe more retailers that launch these tools, the better they get, and the more that consumers get comfortable and start to seek them out,\u201d Jashinsky said. \"But customer behavior takes a long time to change.\u201d",
      "Here are three ways the technology is poised to influence holiday shopping habits in 2025:",
      "AI's potential to simplify the search for the perfect present is most apparent so far in tools that promise to give shoppers faster and more detailed results than a web browser with a lot fewer clicks.",
      "OpenAI upgraded ChatGPT with a shopping research feature that provides personalized buyers' guides. The information comes from product pages, reviews. prices and a user's previous interactions with the chatbot. The tool works best for complicated products like electronics and appliances, or for \u201cdetail-heavy\u201d items like beauty or sporting goods, OpenAI said.",
      "Then there's Rufus, the shopping assistant that Amazon rolled out last year. It now remembers information customers previously fed it, like having four children that all like board games, for example. A user's browsing and purchase history and reviews are used to personalize recommendations.",
      "Google upgraded its AI Mode search tool to provide answers to detailed questions composed in natural language. For example, users can tell the agent they want to buy a casual sweater to wear with skirt or jeans in New York in January that goes with a skirt or jeans,",
      "Responses are pulled from Google's 50 billion product listings. The tool can also produce charts with side-by-side comparisons of prices, features, reviews and other factors. Previously, shoppers had to use keywords, filters and product links to find the information they needed.",
      "\u201cThis is an expansionary moment, I think, for all of technology and for commerce,\u201d Lilian Rincon, vice president of product, consumer shopping at Google, recently told The Associated Press.",
      "Meanwhile, Walmart\u2019s AI shopping assistant, Sparky, offers occasion-based recommendations and synthesizes reviews. An AI-powered gift finder on Target's app exclusively for the holidays responds to prompts such as the age and special hobbies of the recipient.",
      "Tools for tracking online prices have been around for years, including CamelCamelCamel, a third-party service for Amazon prices, as well as Paypal\u2019s Honey browser extension for monitoring thousands of online shops.",

      "Amazon launched a 90-day pricing history tracker this month for virtually everything it sells. Shoppers also now can set up alerts to receive notifications when prices on specific items fall within their budgets.",
      "Google, which for years had a basic price tracker, launched a more advanced version that lets users refine their requests with details like a garment's size and color. Microsoft's Copilot also launched a price tracker this year.",
      "Jason Goldberg, chief commerce strategy officer at Publicis Groupe, said he thinks the new pricing tools will add more pressure on retailers to make sure their prices are competitive.",
      "\u201cA lot of consumers that weren\u2019t even looking for price alerts are going to discover price alerts for the first time,\u201d Goldberg predicted.",
      "Amazon, OpenAI and Google are racing to create tools that would allow for seamless AI-powered shopping by taking consumers from browsing to buying within the same program instead of having to go to a retailer's website to complete a purchase.",
      "OpenAI launched a new instant checkout feature that lets users buy products suggested by ChatGPT without leaving the app. Users can order merchandise from Etsy sellers and from some brands that use Shopify, including Glossier, Skims and Spanx.",
      "OpenAI and Walmart announced a similar deal in October, saying the partnership would allow ChatGPT members to use the instant checkout feature to shop for nearly everything available on Walmart\u2019s website except for fresh food. For now, however, the feature only supports buying one item at a time.",
      "A different deal Target struck with OpenAI lets shoppers put multiple items in a cart on ChatGPT, including fresh food products. But when customers are ready to pay for their orders, they are directed away from the chatbot to the Target app.",
      "New tools from Amazon and Google will give shoppers a taste of having autonomous AI assistants do the buying for them. While the services still are limited, \u201cagentic AI\u201d is intended to be more independent and advanced than the generative AI chatbots that excel at research and writing, experts say.",
      "Amazon is now letting Rufus automatically purchase items for customers who click an \u201cauto buy\u201d button while setting up price alerts. Once a product's price drops to the desired level, customers receive notice of their completed orders and have a limited window to cancel, the company said.",
      "The e-commerce giant also started allowing shoppers to use Rufus searches for brand-name products on the Amazon app as a gateway to other retailers. If Amazon doesn't carry a desired item in its store, a \u201cShop Direct\u201d button will take them to the website of a place that does.",
      "Google's AI Mode price tracker also includes a \u201cbuy for me\u201d option that automatically makes a customer's purchase through Google Pay when the price is right. The feature is available for products sold by Wayfair, Chewy, Quince and some Shopify merchants, and Google expects to keep adding more stores, the company said. sellers.",
      "Google also expanded its web browser with an automated AI call feature that phones local businesses on behalf of customers looking for information or specific products. Google's program discloses to the store that it's an AI caller, and stores can choose not to participate, the company said.",
      "Google said it's applying the feature initially to specific product categories: toys, health and beauty, and electronics. Target and Walmart declined to comment on whether this type of service would be part of their future plans.",

      "Ukrainians in the southern city of Kherson live in constant fear of Russian drone attacks",
      "KHERSON, Ukraine -- When Olena Horlova leaves home or drives through town outside the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, she fears that she's a target. She believes that Russian drones could be waiting on a rooftop, along the road or aiming for her car.",
      "To protect herself and her two daughters, the girls stay indoors, and she stays alert \u2014 sometimes returning home at night along dark roads without headlights so as not to be seen.",
      "After living through the occupation, refusing to cooperate with Russian forces and hiding from them, Horlova, like so many other residents, found that even after her town was liberated in 2022, the ordeal didn't end.",
      "Kherson was among the first places where Russian forces began using short-range, first-person view, or FPV, drones against civilians. The drones are equipped with livestreaming cameras that let operators see and select their targets in real time. The tactic later spread more than 300 kilometers (185 miles) along the right bank of the Dnipro River, across the Dnipropetrovsk, Kherson and Mykolaiv regions.",
      "The United Nations' Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine says the attacks leave little doubt about their intent. In an October report, the commission said that the attacks have repeatedly killed and wounded civilians, destroyed homes and forced thousands to flee, concluding that they amount to the crimes against humanity of murder and forcible transfer.",
      "\u201cWe live with the hope that one day this will finally end,\u201d Horlova said, her voice trembling. \u201cWhat matters for us is a cease-fire, or for the front line to be pushed further away. Then it would be easier for us.\u201d",
      "Horlova lives in Komyshany, a village just outside Kherson and only 4 kilometers (2\u00bd miles) from the Dnipro River, where the level of intense attacks has remained the same, despite Ukrainian forces retaking the city from Russian occupation in November 2022 \u2014 about nine months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24 of that year.",
      "But the war didn't end there. Instead, it shifted into a phase in which the area has effectively become what locals and the military term a \u201chuman safari,\u201d describing it as a testing ground where people are often the target of drone attacks.",
      "Horlova says that FPVs often land on rooftops when their batteries run low and then wait out.",
      "\u201cWhen people, cars or even a cyclist appear, the drone suddenly lifts off and drops the explosive,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten to the point where they even drop them on animals \u2014 cows, goats.\u201d",
      "She believes that civilians are hunted as \u201crevenge\u201d for the celebrations that broke out when Kherson was liberated.",
      "The report from the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine says the attacks have spread terror among civilians and violated their right to life and other fundamental human rights. Investigators found that Russian units on the occupied left bank of the Dnipro carried out the strikes and identified specific drone units, operators and commanders involved. They also noted that Russian Telegram channels routinely share videos of the attacks, often with mocking captions and threats of more.",
      "The U.N. commission said that it examined Russian claims that Ukrainian forces had launched drone attacks on civilians in occupied areas, unable to conclude its investigation because it lacked access to the territory, couldn't ensure witness safety and didn't receive answers from Russian authorities.",
      "Interceptions obtained by The Associated Press from the 310th Separate Marine Electronic Warfare Battalion show Russian FPV drones that appear to be hunting for vehicles. The videos capture drones flying low over roads and locking onto moving or parked cars \u2014 often pickups, supply vehicles, sedans and even clearly marked ambulances \u2014 before diving for a strike.",
      "The commander of the 310th Battalion, which protects the skies over 470 kilometers (nearly 300 miles) of southern Ukraine, including Kherson, says at least 300 drones fly toward the city every day. In October alone, the number of drones that flew over Kherson was 9,000.",
      "\u201cThis area is like a training ground,\u201d said the battalion\u2019s commander, Dmytro Liashok, a 16-year military veteran and one of Ukraine\u2019s early pioneers in electronic warfare. \u201cThey bring new Russian crews here to gain experience before sending them elsewhere.\u201d The AP couldn't independently verify the claim.",

      "Billionaires Michael and Susan Dell pledged a historic $6.25 billion on Tuesday to provide an incentive to families to adopt new investment accounts for children",
      "NEW YORK -- Billionaires Michael and Susan Dell pledged $6.25 billion Tuesday to provide 25 million American children under 10 an incentive to claim the new investment accounts for children created as part of President Donald Trump\u2019s tax and spending legislation.",
      "The historic gift has little precedent, with few single charitable commitments in the past 25 years exceeding $1 billion, much less multiple billions. Announced on GivingTuesday, the Dells believe it\u2019s the largest single private commitment made to U.S. children.",
      "Its structure is also unusual. Essentially, it builds on the \u201c Trump Accounts \" program, where the U.S. Department of the Treasury will deposit $1,000 into investment accounts set up by Treasury for American children born between Jan. 1, 2025 and Dec. 31, 2028. The Dells' gift will use the \u201cTrump Accounts\u201d infrastructure to give $250 to each qualified child under 10.",
      "\u201cWe believe that if every child can see a future worth saving for, this program will build something far greater than an account. It will build hope and opportunity and prosperity for generations to come,\u201d said Michael Dell, the founder and CEO of Dell Technologies whose estimated net worth is $148 billion, according to Forbes.",
      "Though the \u201cTrump Accounts\u201d became law as part of the president's signature legislation in July, the Dells say the accounts will not launch until July 4, 2026. Michael Dell said they wanted to mark the 250th anniversary of U.S. independence.",
      "\u201cWe want these kids to know that not only do their families care, but their communities care, their government, their country cares about them,\u201d said Susan Dell. \u201cAnd we\u2019re all rooting for them to have a wonderful future, a bright future, and that that\u2019s available to them.\u201d",
      "Under the new law, \u201cTrump Accounts\u201d are available to any American child under 18 with a Social Security number and their families can fund the accounts, which must be invested in an index fund that tracks the overall stock market. When the children turn 18, they can withdraw the funds to put toward their education, to buy a home or to start a business.",
      "The Dells will put money into the accounts of children 10 and younger who live in ZIP codes with a median family income of $150,000 or less and who won't get the $1,000 seed money from the Treasury. The Dells hope their gift will encourage families to claim the accounts and deposit more money into it, even small amounts, so it will grow over time along with the stock market.",
      "President Trump plans to celebrate the commitment later on Tuesday and a White House spokesperson Kush Desai said the Dell's gift will be the first of many new pledges to fund the accounts.",
      "\u201cThe One Big Beautiful Bill\u2019s Trump Accounts are a revolutionary investment by the federal government into the next generation of American children,\u201d Desai said. \u201cIt\u2019s also President Trump\u2019s call to action for American businesses and philanthropists to do their part, too.\"",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to give effective dollars away at scale, particularly to the country\u2019s neediest kids in a way that you have confidence that those dollars are going to compound with the upside of the U.S. economy,\" Brad Gerstner, a venture capitalist, who advocated for the passage of this legislation. \"And so, this is a unique platform that\u2019s being created by the government that I think can unlock major giving.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Luigi Mangione is due back in court on Tuesday for the second day of a hearing in his bid to bar New York prosecutors from using evidence that they say links him to last year\u2019s killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.",
      "The pretrial hearing in Mangione\u2019s state murder case kicked off Monday with prosecutors playing surveillance videos of the Dec. 4, 2024, killing and security footage of his arrest five days later at a McDonald\u2019s in Pennsylvania.",
      "Mangione, 27, gripped a pen in his right hand, making a fist at times, as prosecutors played the audio of a 911 call from a McDonald\u2019s manager relaying concerns from customers that Mangione looked like the suspect in Thompson\u2019s death.",
      "Mangione\u2019s lawyers are asking Judge Gregory Carro to block prosecutors from showing or telling jurors about items seized from his backpack during his arrest, including a 9 mm handgun that prosecutors say matches the one used in the killing and a notebook in which they say Mangione described his intent to \u201cwack\u201d a health insurance executive.",
      "The defense contends the items should be excluded because police didn't have a warrant to search his backpack. They also want to suppress some statements Mangione made to law enforcement personnel, such as allegedly giving a false name, because officers started asking questions before telling him he had a right to remain silent.",
      "Mangione, the Ivy League-educated scion of a wealthy Maryland family, has pleaded not guilty to state and federal murder charges. The state charges carry the possibility of life in prison, while federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. Neither trial has been scheduled. The next hearing in the federal case is scheduled for Jan. 9.",
      "Mangione\u2019s lawyers want to bar evidence from both cases, but this week\u2019s hearing pertains only to the state case.",
      "Five witnesses testified on Monday, including a Pennsylvania prison officer who said Mangione told him that at the time of his arrest he had a backpack with foreign currency and a 3D-printed pistol.",
      "Another prison officer said his superintendent told him Mangione was being held under constant watch because the facility \u201cdid not want an Epstein-style situation,\u201d referring to Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s 2019 jail suicide.",

      "Mangione was arrested as he ate breakfast at a McDonald\u2019s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, about 230 miles (about 370 kilometers) west of Manhattan after the restaurant\u2019s manager told a 911 dispatcher, \u201cI have a customer here that some other customers were suspicious of \u2014 that he looks like the CEO shooter from New York.\u201d",
      "The manager told the dispatcher that she searched online for photos of the suspect that police disseminated. But, as Mangione sat in the restaurant, she said she could only see his eyebrows because he had a beanie pulled down close to his eyes and was wearing a medical face mask.",

      "Experts warn that the drop doesn't necessarily mean safer days are here to stay and that it could simply represent a return to average levels.",
      "\u201cSir Isaac Newton never studied crime, but he says \u2018What goes up must come down,'\" said James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University. The current drop in numbers is more likely what statisticians call a \u201cregression to the mean,\u201d he said, representing a return to more average crime levels after an unusual spike in mass killings in 2018 and 2019.",
      "\u201cWill 2026 see a decline?\" Fox said. \"I wouldn\u2019t bet on it. What goes down must also go back up.\u201d",
      "The mass killings \u2014 defined as incidents in which four or more people are killed in a 24-hour period, not including the killer \u2014 are tracked in the database maintained by The Associated Press and USA Today in partnership with Northeastern University. Fox, who manages the database, says mass killings were down about 24% this year compared to 2024, which was also about a 20% drop compared to 2023.",
      "Mass killings are rare, and that means the numbers are volatile, said James Densley, a professor of at Metropolitan State University in Minnesota.",
      "\u201cBecause there's only a few dozen mass killings in a year, a small change could look like a wave or a collapse,\u201d when really it's just a return to more typical levels, Densley said. \u201c2025 looks really good in historical context, but we can't pretend like that means the problem is gone for good.\u201d",
      "But there are some things that might be contributing to the drop, Densley said, including an overall decline in homicide and violent crime rates, which peaked during the COVID-19 pandemic. Improvements in the immediate response to mass shootings and other mass casualty incidents could also be playing a part, he said.",
      "\u201cWe had the horrible Annunciation School shooting here in Minnesota back in August, and that case wouldn't even fit the mass killing definition because there were only two people killed but over 20 injured,\u201d Densley said. \u201cBut I happen to know from the response on the ground here, that the reason only two people were killed is because of the bleeding control and trauma response by the first responders. And it happened on the doorsteps of some of the best children's hospitals in the country.\u201d",
      "Crime is complex, and academics are not great at assessing the reasons behind crime rate changes, said Eric Madfis, a professor of criminal justice at University of Washington-Tacoma.",
      "\u201cIt's multicausal. It's never going to be just one thing. People are still debating why homicide rates went down in the 1990s,\u201d Madfis said. \u201cIt is true that gun violence and gun violence deaths are down, but we still have exceedingly high rates and numbers of mass shootings compared to anywhere else in the world.\"",

      "President Donald Trump and Republicans are hoping to recover from recent losses as Tennessee voters choose a representative for the conservative 7th Congressional District on Tuesday",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- President Donald Trump and Republicans will try to bounce back from recent losses around the country when Tennessee voters choose the next representative for the reliably conservative 7th U.S. House Congressional District on Tuesday.",
      "The special election, which was organized after Republican Rep. Mark Green resigned this summer, saw an unexpected surge of spending in recent weeks, flooding the airwaves and filling residents' mailboxes with campaign flyers.",
      "Matt Van Epps, the Republican candidate, has been backed by more than $1 million from MAGA Inc. It's the first time the Trump-supporting super PAC has spent money on a campaign since last year's presidential race, a reflection of this contest's outsize importance. House Speaker Mike Johnson and GOP chair Joe Gruters rallied supporters in Tennessee on Monday. Trump addressed the crowd by phone and later held a tele-rally for Van Epps, his second of the general election.",
      "Democrats recently won by wide margins in New Jersey, Virginia and elsewhere, and a strong showing in Tennessee could further embolden the party ahead of midterm elections next November.",
      "The House Majority PAC has put $1 million behind state Rep. Aftyn Behn, the Democratic candidate. National party chair Ken Martin visited to campaign for Behn. Former Vice President Kamala Harris participated in a canvassing kickoff while in Nashville on a book tour. And former Vice President Al Gore, a Tennessee native, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez headlined a virtual rally on the election's eve.",
      "The 7th District is one of three seats redrawn in 2022 to erode the influence of Nashville, the state\u2019s largest city and a Democratic stronghold. Only about 1 in 5 of its registered voters are in Nashville, and last year it went to Green by 21 percentage points and to Trump by a similar margin.",
      "Democrats say closing the gap would signal that their party has momentum going into next year. Republicans remain confident that they can defend the seat, and they hope to dismiss Democratic claims that even red districts are now in play as Trump struggles with low approval ratings and persistent economic dissatisfaction.",
      "However there are concerns about turnout due to the timing, as early voting went into Thanksgiving week with Election Day the following Tuesday.",

A frequent target are comments Behn made about Nashville years ago, when she said \u201cI hate this city\u201d and complained about bachelorette parties.",
      "For the most part, Behn has answered questions about those remarks by redirecting to cost of living issues. But she has responded specifically about Nashville, saying she wants it \u201cto be a place where working people can thrive\u201d even if she gets annoyed at some tourist draws.",
      "Behn, a self-proclaimed \u201cpissed-off social worker,\u201d has condemned Trump's tariffs and tax cut legislation, both of which Van Epps supports. She also has criticized Republicans\u2019 reluctance to release files related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "Van Epps originally opposed a House vote to force the Justice Department to disclose more Epstein documents but changed his stance to mirror Trump after the president backed the measure.",
      "Democratic allies sought to eat away at Van Epps' base by urging conservatives to back independent candidate Jon Thorp instead. That messaging came in mailers from Your Community PAC, which has spent more than $16 million supporting Democratic candidates across the country since last year.",

      "Barnes has met with some opposition among Democrats who have publicly expressed worries about him running after he lost the Senate race to Republican incumbent Sen. Ron Johnson three years ago. If he wins next year, he will become Wisconsin\u2019s first Black governor.",
      "\u201cMandela had his opportunity. He didn\u2019t close. And that means it\u2019s time for a new chapter,\u201d the Black-owned Milwaukee Courier newspaper wrote in an Oct. 25 editorial. \u201cWe need a candidate who can unite this state \u2014 and win.

      "Barnes lost to Johnson by 1 percentage point, which amounts to just under 27,000 votes. He does not mention the Senate race in his campaign launch video.",
      "After the defeat, he formed a voter turnout group called Forward Together Wisconsin, which he says has strengthened his position heading into the governor\u2019s race. He also has a political action committee.",

      "The bear was seen on video footage clambering out from beneath his house Tuesday. He had installed a camera near the space back in June when he saw what looked like damage caused by an animal.",
      "Nothing showed up on the camera until last week. And now he's trying to figure out how to make it leave.",
      "\u201cIt's a huge bear,\u201d Johnson said, describing it as tall as a table and bigger than the trash bins in front of his house. \u201cIt's really unnerving because I don't know if he's going to tear everything up under there, I don't know how to get him out.\"",
      "Johnson lives in Altadena, an unincorporated community northeast of Los Angeles that was devastated by the Eaton Fire in January. The fire killed at least 19 people and scorched thousands of structures, but it also tore through the Angeles National Forest, displacing wildlife from their natural habitats and destroying their food supply.",

      "The bear was too large to be tranquilized, so employees from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife set a bear trap before taking it to the Angeles National Forest to be released with a tracking collar, the state agency wrote on social media. In February, another homeowner found himself with an unwelcome roommate, snapping pictures of a bear lounging by the pool and bringing food back to the crawl space at night, the Los Angeles Times reported.",
      "\u201cIn the foothills of bear country, it\u2019s important to close crawl spaces with bear-proof material in advance of winter months to discourage bears from denning and damaging property,\u201d the CDFW wrote on social media after that incident.",

      "Those items include a 9 mm handgun that prosecutors say matches the one used in the Dec. 4, 2024, killing and a notebook in which they say he described his intent to \u201cwack\u201d a health insurance executive.",

      "They contend that the gun and other items should be excluded because police lacked a warrant to search the backpack in which they were found. They also want to suppress some of his statements to police, such as allegedly giving a false name, because officers started asking questions before telling him he had a right to remain silent.",
      "Eliminating the gun and notebook would be critical wins for Mangione\u2019s defense and a major setback for prosecutors, depriving them a possible murder weapon and evidence they say points to motive.",
      "The Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office has quoted extensively from Mangione\u2019s handwritten diary in court filings including his praise for Unabomber Ted Kaczynski.",
      "In it, prosecutors say, Mangione mused about rebelling against \u201cthe deadly, greed fueled health insurance cartel\u201d and said killing an industry executive \u201cconveys a greedy bastard that had it coming.\u201d",
      "Mangione has pleaded not guilty to state and federal murder charges. The state charges carry the possibility of life in prison, while federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.",
      "Mangione\u2019s lawyers want to bar evidence from both cases, but this week\u2019s hearings pertain only to the state case. The next hearing in the federal case is scheduled for Jan. 9.",

      "WASHINGTON -- For many children, the experience of getting their first pair of glasses is an inevitable milestone, the first in a lifetime of visits to the eye doctor.",
      "But what if those lenses could actually help preserve the child\u2019s vision and reduce the chances for more serious eye problems in adulthood?",
      "That\u2019s the promise of a new type of lens approved by the Food and Drug Administration in September. While the technology has previously been available in Europe, Asia and other parts of the world, it\u2019s now rolling out in the U.S.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the new approach.",
      "Myopia, commonly called nearsightedness, is when people can clearly see objects at close range but struggle with distant objects, which often appear blurry or indistinct.",
      "Studies conducted around the world have shown rising rates of myopia, which researchers have associated with increased time indoors looking at screens, books and other objects held close to the eyes.",
      "In the U.S., 30% to 40% of children will have myopia by the time they finish high school, according to Dr. Michael Repka, a professor and pediatric ophthalmologist at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.",
      "Until now, doctors had few options for treating the condition.",
      "\u201cIt was typically and simply: \u2018Your child needs to wear glasses and they\u2019ll live with it,\u2019\u201d Repka said. \u201c'It will be lifelong and it will likely get worse over the next few years.\u2019\u201d",
      "The specialized glasses, sold under the brand Essilor Stellest, are approved by the FDA to slow nearsightedness in 6- to 12-year-olds.",
      "The FDA said it cleared the lenses based on company data showing children experienced a 70% reduction in the progression of their myopia after two years.",
      "Over time, myopia causes the eye to grow longer, worsening vision and increasing the risk of tears to the retina \u2014 the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye that is essential for vision.",
      "The new lenses use 11 concentric rings filled with tiny raised dots to refocus light onto the retina in a way that is believed to slow elongation of the eye.",
      "\u201cWhether this hypothesis is ultimately proven to be true, of course, matters only in part,\u201d Repka said, noting that the lenses appear to work regardless of how the underling science works.",
      "In the company study, children wearing the lens showed a 50% reduction in eye lengthening when measured after two years. Currently, researchers in the U.S. and other countries are conducting their own independent studies to confirm those results.",
      "Ophthalmologists say the potential benefits go beyond preserving vision to heading off some long-term consequences of severe myopia, which can include cataracts, glaucoma and retinal detachment that can lead to blindness.",

      "Some doctors prescribe medicated eye drops intended to slow myopia, but those are not approved by the FDA.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/avatar-fire-and-ash-director-james-cameron-on-generative-ai-thats-horrifying-to-me/",
    "published": "Sun, 30 Nov 2025 13:44:10 -0500",
    "summary": "The \"Avatar\" director, who uses performance capture to help create fantasy characters, has consistently raised the level of movie visual effects. But James Cameron believes using artificial intelligence to create a character and performance without an actor is \"horrifying.\"",
    "story": [
      "Much of what we see from the Earth-like moon of Pandora, the fantastical setting for the \"Avatar\" franchise, comes from a soundstage in Los Angeles, where scenes from the second and third movies were filmed. \"We had to build an ocean,\" director James Cameron said. \"We could make a two-meter swell. We could make a wave crash up on a shoreline if we built the shoreline.\"",
      "Sigourney Weaver, Zoe Salda\u00f1a  and other actors shot their underwater scenes in the nearly 250,000-gallon tank. Digital artists then took those shots, called performance captures, as a template to render the final versions of the characters we see on screen.",
      "\"So, performance capture, we use a whole bunch of cameras to capture the body performance of the actor,\" Cameron explained. \"And we use a single camera (or now we use actually two) to video their face. They're in a close-up 100% of the time. But there's a beautiful thing about being in a close-up 100% of the time. It's very much like theater rehearsal.\"",
      "\"Avatar: Fire and Ash\" is the third film in the series. It tells the story of the indigenous Na'vis' fight to defend their paradise from colonizing humans.",
      "Cameron created these stories and this world. He's always been a dreamer, even as a kid in rural Canada. \"I lived in a world of my imagination \u2013 it was comic books, it was science fiction. I read a lot. There were movies, TV shows,\" he said. \"I mean, I had a pretty fertile imagination.\"",
      "Cameron moved to Los Angeles with his parents as a teen. He briefly attended community college, where studies included marine biology, before dropping out and picking up odd jobs, including truck driving.",
      "So, how did he go from blue collar to Hollywood? \"Watching 'Star Wars,'\" he said. \"I used to put my headphones on and listen to fast electronic music and imagine space battles, hyperkinetic space battles with all kinds of maneuvers and energy weapons, and people going through debris fields and all that. If the things I'm seeing in my mind can be the same things that are in a movie that's the number one movie in movie history, then I've got a salable imagination.\"",
      "He returned to school, although not in an official capacity. \"I started to study visual effects, and the way I did it was, I didn't have the money to go to USC or anything like that. So what I used to do is, I'd go down to USC, I'd go bury myself on a Saturday, when I wasn't driving a truck, in the stacks. And I'd read everything I could find on optical printing and front-screen projection and, you know, sodium process traveling mattes. All self-taught. I'd Xerox all these scholarly papers, put them all in binders. And I had this shelf full of black binders that had essentially a graduate course in visual effects and cinematography.\"",
      "He found jobs in visual effects departments and production design, rising through the ranks quickly due to his technical knowledge.",
      "Then, in the early 1980s, Cameron, inspired by a literal dream about a robot exoskeleton, co-wrote and directed \"The Terminator.\" The movie put him on the map, and proved he could turn his imagination into reality.",
      "But CGI wasn't available at the time; the effects were done largely through puppeteering. \"We just figured out how to do it all practically,\" Cameron said.",
      "He showed us around his private museum in Los Angeles, full of movie props from his films, including \"Aliens,\" where puppeteers brought Sigourney Weaver's powerlifter - and the Alien Queen \u2013 to life. Of the Alien Queen, Cameron said, \"Her head had, I think, seven or eight different axes of movement that were controlled by cables that went basically out her butt. And we had to hide all that stuff, so there was a lotta steam and smoke and backlight and things like that.\"",
      "Cameron's first use of CGI came with the science fiction movie \"The Abyss,\" It was also his first cinematic foray into another one of his fascinations: the deep sea. His second venture into an oceanic film? \"Titanic.\" It became the then-highest-grossing movie of all time. Cameron took home three Oscars himself.",
      "But the film itself was never the priority for Cameron: He said he wrote the script in order to explore the wreck of the Titanic. \"It was a little bit of a means to an end, you know?\" he said. \"I thought, 'I can just go do this. All right, I need a story. Okay, 'Romeo and Juliet.' You know, young, doomed love on the Titanic.' Boom! Like, instantaneous.\"",
      "He found a way to use Hollywood to invest in his passion for scientific exploration. \"Yeah, exactly,\" he said. \"And then I had so much fun on my expedition that was to shoot Titanic for the movie, that I basically took an eight-year hiatus from Hollywood, an eight-year sabbatical. And I did subsequently six more expeditions for a total of seven, before I started 'Avatar.'\"",
      "Cameron wrote the treatment for \"Avatar\" before \"Titanic,\" but it wasn't until 2005 that he thought the current technology could support his vision. And even then, he wasn't sure the business of Hollywood would go along. \"For years, there was this sense that, 'Oh, they're doing something strange with computers and they're replacing actors,' when in fact, once you really drill down and you see what we're doing, it's a celebration of the actor-director moment,\" he said.",
      "\"Now, go to the other end of the spectrum, and you've got generative AI, where they can make up a character,\" he continued. \"They can make up an actor. They can make up a performance from scratch with a text prompt. It's like, no. That's horrifying to me. That's the opposite. That's exactly what we're not doing.\"",
      "Cameron's \"Avatar: Fire and Ash\" opens next months.",
      "So, how does he feel a few weeks from the premiere? \"Nervous!\" he laughed. \"Are you kidding? Always. Always.\"",
      "Despite the uncertainty, Cameron is still undaunted, and enamored by the unknown. \"I'm attracted, in case you haven't noticed, by things I don't know how to do,\" he said. \"Because you grow and you learn. If I'm still making movies when I got an oxygen tube up my nose and I'm 87 or whatever, should I be that lucky, I want to still be doing things I don't know how to do.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 30 Nov 2025 10:03:06 -0500",
    "summary": "The heavy metal band has not only changed lives with their music; they've also changed lives with their philanthropy \u2013 from donations to food banks and disaster relief, to their charity, All Within My Hands, which has donated to workforce education and other critical services.",
    "story": [
      "Carmen DeBerry is a newly-minted commercial delivery driver in Baltimore, Maryland. She says having this new job has completely changed her life. \"It feels awesome,\" she said. \"You know, I take care of my daughter, and I also take care of my mother.\"",
      "The commercial driver's license, like the type DeBerry got at the Community College of Baltimore County, can cost up to $7,500, money she didn't have \u2013 which is where four kind of unlikely guys from the Bay Area stepped in.",
      "Yes, we are talking about the guys from the band Metallica, one of the most commercially successful bands of all time, with more than 180 million records sold. \"I mean, to be honest, I didn't know when I first signed up that it was through Metallica; they just called it a scholarship,\" DeBerry said.",
      "A Metallica Scholarship, to be precise, part of the more than $10 million the band's charity All Within My Hands has donated to workforce education, mostly in the form of grants through trade schools and community colleges.",
      "\"Not everyone is built for college, and not everyone needs college,\" said Metallica lead singer James Hetfield. And he should know; he himself is the son of a truck driver, something he's hasn't forgotten.",
      "\"It was very evident during COVID, you know, when we weren't able to go out and do our thing,\" said Hetfield. \"But the plumber, the electrician, the truck driver, the people that needed to help keep America running were there. And thank God for them. You know, my thought is that the next millionaires will be the tradesmen.\"",
      "\"We all came from, I mean, pretty humble beginnings,\" said Metallica bassist Robert Trujillo, who worked in construction before he became a professional musician. \"At a certain point you realize, like, hey, you know, we're selling tickets, we're doing well, the ship's not sinking. What can we do to make people's lives better?\"",
      "The band's philanthropy actually began with the simple question of what to do with their leftover food backstage at the sports arenas and stadiums they'd been playing. They started donating it to local food banks; then, they starting donating sizable checks to those food banks as well, which turned into disaster relief.",
      "\"It was a bit profound for us because one of the first things that happened was in, maybe 2017, we had the Northern California fires that affected so many people in the Bay Area,\" said guitarist Kirk Hammett. When disaster struck in the band's backyard, that's when he says it hit home: \"And we were able to, like, jump in and, like, really help people right off the bat. And there's been other instances where there's been earthquakes, you know, disasters, people in need of food and medicine. And we've been able to step up and send money, and not just a pittance, but like enough money that makes a difference to, you know, a good group of people who need it.\"",
      "But actually talking about their charity work publicly? That didn't come as easily, says drummer Lars Ulrich. \"We had never screamed from the rooftops about it,\" he said. \"I think instinctively you just want to help. I mean, we all depend on each other \u2013 you know, if you really want to break it down, then you go, humans are herd animals and really thrive, you know, the flock does better when everybody is doing well.\"",
      "Now, if all this doesn't sound very Metallica-like, well, in a way neither does the annual fundraiser concert that they've been putting on in Los Angeles. Last year it raised $3.5 million and brought in some big Metallica admirers, like Aquaman himself Jason Momoa. \"They've kind of been the soundtrack of my life, man. I've kind of discovered them probably when I was ten years old. And I think these are your heroes. These are my heroes.\"",
      "It might come as a surprise to some that a band with songs like \"Nothing Else Matters\" and \"Seek and Destroy\" spends so much time thinking about how to better other people's lives. But for Hetfield, it's a thought process that comes with age.",
      "\"It seems clearer that we have a purpose,\" he said. \"And that purpose is to bring joy to people on this planet, and absolutely still blows my mind that there's three generations out there, you know, rocking out to 'Master of Puppets.' Like, really? You like this song? Okay! That was written when I was 22 years old, and I was pissed off. But beyond what we've done in the music thing, as you get older, you start to see the world in a different light, you know? My philosophy is, you're climbing to the next layer of the high rise. And the older you get, the better the view is of the world, and what you get to see, and where you can be of service. And this is certainly one of them.\"",
      "Up until now, Hetfield had never actually met a Metallica scholar, but that changed backstage before a show in Landover, Maryland, when a very appreciative Carmen DeBerry stopped by. \"I really think that your scholarship, me telling them about your scholarship, is what got me the job,\" she told Hetfield. \"Because once I told them that I got the Metallica scholarship, they were like, Whaaaaat? I got an entrance, and they took a chance with me. And I appreciate it.\"",
      "\"Right on!\" Hetfield replied.",
      "I asked, \"You're about to go out and play to thousands and thousands of people, and yet you just had a moment of getting to talk to somebody whose life has been significantly changed from All Within My Hands' charity work. What's that feel like?\"",
      "Hetfield replied, \"It is so amazing. We get to go make some people smile out there, deliver the goods by playing songs that saved us in our lives. And then to create a foundation that's giving back to, you know, the blue collar America? We get to go from thousands that are making big noise, that we know we're impacting, but to get a one-on-one, you know, heart-to-heart with somebody whose life you've changed, it changes mine.\"",

    "summary": "From living on her Upstate New York farm, to her roles in movies like the forthcoming \"The Testament of Ann Lee\" and \"The Housemaid,\" to her battling serious anxiety and OCD, the Oscar-nominee reveals a grounded movie star living a grounded life.",
    "story": [
      "Breakfast is served on Amanda Seyfried's Upstate New York farm, which means feeding the horses, the goats, and Cliff, a 35-year-old pony. \"I love it,\" Seyfried said, \"'cause nothing else matters, because they need to get fed. It's a responsibility that, like, keeps me focused on what's important.\"",
      "I asked, \"What is it about this place that makes you feel whatever it is that it makes you feel?\"",
      "\"I don't know if you know this, but Hollywood is really \u2026 it's tricky, and it's got a lot of personalities,\" Seyfried replied. \"There are a lot of people that are working in a way that doesn't necessarily make it feel like a safe place. This is exactly what I have always wanted.\"",
      "And she's is not merely putting on a show for the cameras. \"Last night it was raining, it was pouring, and I was doing the same ****. I just didn't look this nice!\" she said.",
      "This is where Seyfried lives, but she goes where the work is, and there's been plenty of it \u2013 as Karen, memorably clueless in \"Mean Girls,\" later as Sophie in the mega-hit \"Mamma Mia!\"",
      "A big change of pace came in 2020, starring as early Hollywood actress Marion Davies in \"Mank.\" The film earned Seyfried an Oscar nomination.",
      "She agrees that she wants to be challenged, badly. \"Because here's the thing: the challenge is within a certain parameter. I have had enough therapy and enough insight and perspective to know what happens when I may fall too deep into something, and I have enough tools and support to not let that happen. So, every time I'd say it's a challenge, it's really hard, and I look back and I'm like, I wouldn't want to do that again! But when I'm in it, it's more than a challenge; it's a new life. I'm being born into something \u2013 a new version of myself.\"",
      "Her commitment is right there on the screen in two movies out next month: the psychological thriller \"The Housemaid,\" co-starring Sydney Sweeney; and the dramatic musical \"The Testament of Ann Lee.\"",
      "In that 18th century story, Seyfried plays Ann Lee, the founder of the Shakers, a religious sect that embraced equality and chastity, even inside of marriage.",
      "\"Her conviction was everything,\" Seyfried said of Lee. \"The coolest thing about her is that she created a utopia. The idea that we're better off working together as equals, it still rings true to this day. Like, if you take away power and control of each other, there's nothing we can't do.\"",
      "The cast received a long standing ovation at the Venice Film Festival, while the role has made Seyfried an Oscar contender.",
      "\"It's like, I worked my ass off in this specific experience, and I worked my ass off throughout my career, and I've stayed true to who I am,\" she said. \"I've definitely changed, and evolved, and become a better person. Do I still make mistakes? Uh-huh, yeah. Do I still make bad choices? Yeah! But I'm human, and I'm, like, doing the best I can. And I'm nice. And I'm f****** nice!\" she laughed. \"'Cause there's no other reason not to be.\"",
      "I can testify, she is \u2026 nice! And refreshingly honest. Raised in Allentown, Pennsylvania, Seyfried studied acting and music as a kid, did some modeling, too. In high school, she was a regular on the soap opera \"All My Children.\" She was on the show for ten months.",
      "Why'd she leave it? \"Why did I leave? Why did Megan McTavish write me off? I don't know, ask her!\" she laughed.",
      "Getting fired, even at 17, hurt. She figured acting was over, so she enrolled at New York's Fordham University, sort of. \"I, like, took the elevator up, and then I stood there, looked at the elevators, and then I took the escalator down, and then I went home. That was my time at Fordham,\" she laughed.",
      "Immediately after \"college,\" Seyfried landed an audition for \"Mean Girls,\" her first big break. \"Mamma Mia!\" was her second. It led to a sequel, 2018's \"Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again\" \u2026 and maybe a trilogy? Asked if there was going to be a third one, she replied, \"Yeah, absolutely.\"",
      "\"Do we know anything about the story?\" I asked.",
      "\"No, I think if we all decided we'll do it for free, they'll be like, 'Cool. Let's do it tomorrow,'\" she replied. \"I know Judy Craymer, who created it, is working furiously on a script. I just assume it'll happen exactly ten years from when we shot the last one, which was '17. So, we'll shoot it in 2027, out in 2028. Every ten years! I just don't know how they get Meryl back.\"",
      "Well, that is the tricky part, as her character is (spoiler) dead. Evil twin? \"There it is!\" Seyfried smiled.",

    "published": "Sat, 29 Nov 2025 20:58:40 -0500",
    "summary": "Stoppard was often hailed as the greatest British playwright of his generation.",
    "story": [
      "British playwright Tom Stoppard, who won an Academy Award for the screenplay for 1998's \"Shakespeare In Love,\" has died. He was 88.",
      "United Agents said in a statement Saturday that Stoppard died \"peacefully\" at his home in Dorset in southern England, surrounded by his family.",
      "\"He will be remembered for his works, for their brilliance and humanity, and for his wit, his irreverence, his generosity of spirit and his profound love of the English language. It was an honour to work with Tom and to know him,\" the statement said.",
      "\"My wife and I are deeply saddened to learn of the death of one of our greatest writers, Sir Tom Stoppard,\" King Charles said in a statement. \"A dear friend who wore his genius lightly, he could, and did, turn his pen to any subject, challenging, moving and inspiring his audiences, borne from his own personal history. We send our most heartfelt sympathy to his beloved family. Let us all take comfort in his immortal line: \"Look on every exit as being an entrance somewhere else.\"",
      "Stoppard was born in the Czech Republic in 1937. His family fled to Singapore after Nazi Germany's invasion in 1939. He, his brother and their mother fled again when Japanese forces closed in on the city in 1941. His father died trying to leave the city. His mother married an English officer in 1946, and the family moved to postwar Britain. The 8-year-old Tom \"put on Englishness like a coat,\" he later said, growing up to be a quintessential Englishman who loved cricket and Shakespeare.",
      "Stoppard first worked as a journalist before turning to theater in the 1960s. Stoppard was often hailed as the greatest British playwright of his generation and was garlanded with honors, including a shelf full of theater gongs.",
      "His brain-teasing plays ranged across Shakespeare, science, philosophy and the historic tragedies of the 20th century. Five of them won Tony Awards for best play: \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead\" in 1968; \"Travesties\" in 1976; \"The Real Thing\" in 1984; \"The Coast of Utopia\" in 2007; and \"Leopoldstadt\" in 2023.",
      "He wrote plays for radio and television including \"A Walk on the Water,\" televised in 1963, and made his stage breakthrough with \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,\" which reimagined Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" from the viewpoint of two hapless minor characters.",
      "Stoppard was a strong champion of free speech who worked with organizations including PEN\u00a0and Index on Censorship. He claimed not to have strong political views otherwise, writing in 1968: \"I burn with no causes. I cannot say that I write with any social objective. One writes because one loves writing, really.\"",
      "That was especially true of his late play \"Leopoldstadt,\" which drew on his own family's story for the tale of a Jewish Viennese family over the first half of the 20th century. Stoppard said he began thinking of his personal link to the Holocaust quite late in life, only discovering after his mother's death in 1996 that many members of his family, including all four grandparents, had died in concentration camps.",
      "\"Leopoldstadt\" premiered in London at the start of 2020 to rave reviews; weeks later all theaters were shut by the COVID-19 pandemic. It eventually opened on Broadway in late 2022, going on to win four Tonys.",
      "Dizzyingly prolific, Stoppard also wrote many radio plays, a novel, television series including \"Parade's End\" (2013) and many film screenplays. These included dystopian Terry Gilliam comedy \"Brazil\" (1985), Steven Spielberg-directed war drama \"Empire of the Sun\" (1987), Elizabethan romcom \"Shakespeare in Love\" (1998) \u2014 for which he and Marc Norman shared a best adapted screenplay Oscar \u2014 code breaking thriller \"Enigma\" (2001) and Russian epic \"Anna Karenina\" (2012).",
      "He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1997 for his services to literature.",

      "According to the FDA, any exposure to lead is considered unsafe, with even low levels of exposure potentially causing serious health problems.

      "Children are especially sensitive to lead, which can damage their brains and nervous systems, slowing their growth and development, the agency says. Women of childbearing age and new mothers who are breastfeeding their infants are also at risk for lead poisoning, the FDA notes.",

    "story": [
      "Trump accounts are a new type of tax-deferred investment vehicle for U.S. children, created under\u00a0President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" tax and spending bill, which promises $1,000 seed contributions from the federal government for eligible kids.",
      "Here's what to know, including who qualifies for a Trump account, how to set one up and how they compare to other savings plans geared to children.",
      "Who is eligible for a Trump account?",
      "Children who are U.S. citizens and who are born between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028, are eligible to have a Trump Account, according to a fact sheet from the Department of the Treasury. Households of any income may open an account, and all such accounts qualify for a one-time $1,000 contribution from the U.S. government.",
      "Families with children under 18 may also open accounts, but they won't receive the $1,000 gift from the government. However, parents, friends, employers and other parties can contribute tax-free dollars to an account.",
      "How do I open a Trump account?",
      "Parents or guardians must set up and manage the account until a child turns 18.",
      "The Treasury Department said households should use IRS Form 4547 to open a Trump account on behalf of a child. The newly created form is also where applicants can request the $1,000 U.S. government contribution to the account. The White House said that each Trump account for eligible children will launch with a $1,000 contribution from the government.",
      "In May 2026, the Treasury Department will send instructions to individuals who applied for government-funded accounts on how to activate them.",
      "When can I set up an account?",
      "Families can open a Trump account beginning in early 2026 and can start making financial contributions on July 4, 2026, according to the Trump Administration.",
      "How much can I contribute?",
      "Excluding the government's $1,000 donation, a total of $5,000 per child can be deposited into an account each year. Employers can contribute up to $2,500 per year to an employee's account tax-free, which will count toward the $5,000 limit.",
      "Financial contributions from cities, states, tribal governments and tax-exempt organizations, including nonprofit organizations, are generally not counted toward the $5,000 limit, according to employment law firm\u00a0Littler.",
      "Annual contribution limits to the accounts are indexed to inflation and will be adjusted after 2027, according to a notice from the Internal Revenue Service.",
      "Can funds be withdrawn before a child turns 18?",
      "No. Families may not withdraw funds from a Trump account before a child turns 18, except for the following reasons:",
      "A rollover of the entire account to a Trump account with another brokerage\u00a0Certain rollovers to an \"Achieving a Better Life Experience\"\u00a0account in the year the child turns 17\u00a0Distribution when the individual dies",

      "Certain rollovers to an \"Achieving a Better Life Experience\"\u00a0account in the year the child turns 17",
      "Distribution when the individual dies",
      "After age 18, standard IRA rules for withdrawals apply.",
      "How will money in a Trump account be invested?",
      "Under the \"big, beautiful bill,\" funds in a Trump account must be invested in an authorized investment, such as mutual funds or exchange-traded funds that track the S&P 500 stock index or another index with mostly U.S. equities. Financial firms managing the funds also may not charge more than 0.1% in annual fees.",
      "Should I personally invest in the account?",
      "Financial experts advise people considering opening a Trump account to accept the government's $1,000 contribution \u2014 money is money, after all \u2014 but to think twice about putting in their own money. The reason: Other types of savings plans \u2014 such as a\u00a0529 plan, a tax-advantaged savings account for education expenses, or a custodial brokerage account, an investment account for a minor managed by an adult \u2014 can be more financially advantageous.",
      "\"The gift is the biggest part of this. It really is free money,\" Madeline Brown, a wealth and financial policy expert at the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, D.C., told CBS News.",
      "\"It's a nice perk for parents with children who qualified,\" added Kate Ashford, a wealth management specialist at personal finance company NerdWallet. \"But it's not a slam dunk, and it's not going to do as much for you as other accounts.\"",
      "She cited the accounts' contribution caps and more limited investment tax advantages as drawbacks compared to 529s or custodial brokerage accounts.",
      "\"The only advantage is your earnings grow tax-free over the years, but you pay the ordinary income tax rate \u2014 not, say, a capital gains tax rate,\" Ashford said.",
      "Adam Michel, director of tax policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian public policy research firm, thinks there are better ways to set money aside for children, such as in a 529 or standard IRA account.",
      "\"Generally speaking, parents should not put their own money into a Trump account,\" he told CBS News. \"The primary use case for the accounts is to receive free money from sources like the government or private donations.\"",
      "For example, Michael and Susan Dell on Tuesday said they would donate a total of $6.25 billion \u2014 or $250 apiece \u2014 to millions of kids in Trump accounts.",
      "How do Trump accounts compare to a 529 savings plan?",
      "If you're saving for college, a 529 savings plan could be a better alternative, investment experts said. It lets families sock away money tax-free for education expenses. Savings from such an account can also be transferred to an IRA, offering accountholders more flexibility to save for retirement or other expenses.",
      "The Trump accounts have \"many more strings attached and complicated rules that make it not an attractive overall investment vehicle,\" Michel of the Cato Institute said.",
      "To be sure, 529 plans also have limitations. If people use funds for non-education expenses, for example, they must pay a 10% penalty.",
      "Meanwhile, a Trump account offers some flexibility. Beneficiaries, once they are adults, may use the money for purposes beyond education, such as buying a home or starting a business, while the accounts also can serve as a kind of IRA.",

The Dells said they are encouraging others to join in by contributing funds to the accounts, ranging from other philanthropists and businesses to childrens' families and friends.",
      "\"We believe the smartest investment we can make is the one in children,\" Michael Dell told \"CBS News 24/7 Mornings\" in a Tuesday interview. \"We know that when a child has an account like this, even a modest sum, it really improves their outlook on life, and they are more likely to graduate from high school and college, and buy a home, start a business, start a family, become productive members of society.\"",
      "Susan Dell added that the gift builds on the couple's previous philanthropic efforts to help children through their foundation. The pair announced the program on Giving Tuesday, an annual event where people are encouraged to make charitable contributions.",
      "\"When we heard about this, for us, this was a natural fit,\" Susan Dell told \"CBS News 24/7 Mornings.\" \"This was going to reach a lot of children and help them have a start at a really bright future.\"",
      "Dell Technologies \u2014 the company founded by Michael Dell, where he serves as CEO \u2014 said in June that it had pledged to match the Treasury Department's $1,000 contributions to the Trump Accounts. The Dell corporate match will be provided to every child born to its U.S.-based employees between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028, the company said in an email to CBS News.",
      "\"Today's philanthropic gift from Michael and Susan Dell is separate from, and in addition to, our corporate commitment,\" Dell Technologies said. \"Together, these contributions provide children with meaningful financial opportunities and a transformative head start toward their futures.\"",

    "summary": "Rep. Anna Paulina Luna is seeking to force a vote on a bipartisan bill that would ban members of Congress from trading individual stocks.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Rep. Anna Paulina Luna on Tuesday followed through on a monthslong threat to try to force a vote on a bipartisan bill that would ban members of Congress from trading individual stocks.",
      "Luna, a Florida Republican, introduced a discharge petition to circumvent House leaders and put the measure on the floor for a vote if it receives 218 signatures. The procedural maneuver has become a common tactic for rank-and-file lawmakers to try to force a vote on issues ignored by Republican leaders.",
      "The congresswoman had threatened to file a discharge petition if there wasn't movement on the Restore Trust in Congress Act by the end of September. But the push for a vote was stalled by the 43-day government shutdown that began on Oct. 1. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, kept the House out of session during the shutdown, putting all committee hearings and markups of legislation on hiatus.",
      "Dozens of House lawmakers across the political spectrum have coalesced behind the Restore Trust in Congress Act, which would prohibit members of Congress, their spouses and dependent children from owning or trading individual stocks. The compromise bill was introduced by Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas in September and has the support of more than 100 members, including progressives, conservatives and moderate Republicans and Democrats.",
      "But the bill is also facing bipartisan opposition, according to its cosponsors, who spoke to reporters ahead of a Nov. 19 hearing before the House Administration Committee about congressional stock trading.",
      "\"There are members in both parties who do not want this to happen, who are in the ear of leadership, who are trying to stop this from happening,\" Democratic Rep. Seth Magaziner of Rhode Island said.",
      "Under a 13-year-old law known as the STOCK Act, members of Congress, executive branch officials and other federal employees are prohibited from using nonpublic information for their financial benefit. The law also requires officials to disclose stock trades exceeding $1,000 within 45 days.",
      "Critics say the law needs reforms to require more transparency to ensure public officials are not using their positions for personal gain.",
      "\"This body has been enriching itself on the taxpayers' dime for too dadgum long, and it's got to stop,\" Republican Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee told reporters. \"We're in committee meetings. We hear things before y'all do. We can make those connections.\"",
      "Dan Savickas, the vice president of policy and government affairs at the Taxpayers Protection Alliance, told lawmakers during the hearing that \"on average, members of both political parties outperformed the market.\"",
      "\"Each party's performance gets a boost when they control more branches of government,\" Savickas said. \"This only lends further credence to the public perception that congressional representatives are using their office for personal gain rather than public service.\"",
      "No member of Congress has ever been prosecuted under the current law and no public records exist indicating that any officials have ever paid fines for disclosure errors, according to James R. Copland, a senior fellow at Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, a conservative think tank.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. air travelers who haven't upgraded to a Real ID can still fly without one, but starting Feb. 1 they'll be charged a $45 fee, the Transportation Security Administration\u00a0said\u00a0Monday.",
      "Flyers without a Real ID, a passport or another acceptable form of ID will need to have their identities confirmed through a fee-based verification system called TSA Confirm.ID, the agency said.",
      "The announcement of a $45 fee for people without Real IDs comes after the TSA started requiring the identification or other approved documents in May. The Real ID is a federally compliant state driver's license, learner's permit or nondriver ID card, identified by a black or gold star in the upper right corner.",
      "Passengers without Real IDs \"will be referred to the optional TSA Confirm.ID process for identity verification upon TSA check-in and prior to entering the security line,\" the TSA said.",
      "The process will vary from airport to airport, according to the agency, which said it is working with private vendors to allow consumers to pay for the screening process before they arrive at the airport. The TSA warned that people without Real IDs could encounter increased wait times at airports while their identities are verified.",
      "The fee verifies passengers for a 10-day period, according to the TSA. The agency is still urging passengers without Real IDs to visit their local DMV to update their IDs.",
      "The $45 fee is designed to ensure that travelers, not taxpayers, foot the bill for the advanced verification system, said Adam Stahl, a TSA official, in the statement.",
      "Some travel experts said the new fee disadvantages lower-income Americans and that the 10-day verification window could cause confusion.",
      "The policy creates \"a bizarre situation where your identity expires like a carton of milk,\" travel expert Julian Kheel, founder of flight search engine Points Path, told CBS News. \"After those 10 days pass, you're back to square one, forced to pay another $45 even though nothing about your actual identity has changed.\"",
      "How does Confirm.ID work?",
      "Confirm.ID asks passengers without Real IDs to answer a series of questions about themselves to verify their identity.",
      "Once a passenger's identity is confirmed, they'll receive a receipt to show a screening agent at the TSA checkpoint, along with their form of ID. They will then continue through security like all other passengers.",
      "Passengers who don't have Real IDs and opt not to pay the $45 fee may be denied entry at checkpoints, the TSA said Monday during a press call describing the new fee-based program.",
      "What's an acceptable form of ID?",
      "Travelers with Real IDs or other accepted forms of identification don't have to pay the $45 fee to travel. Here are some of the documents the TSA says can substitute for a Real-ID-compliant driver's license:",

    "published": "Tue, 02 Dec 2025 14:08:34 -0500",
    "summary": "Personal finance is too complex for most people to navigate, two economists contend in a new book. Is there a better way to help people deal with money?",
    "story": [
      "Americans typically score poorly in financial literacy tests. Yet they're on their own when it comes to making major financial decisions, from funding their retirement to buying a home, two economists argue in a new book that critiques the personal finance system.",
      "Take the U.S. retirement system, which has shifted away from corporate-based pensions that guaranteed income in old age toward 401(k) plans, where workers must decide how to invest their savings.",
      "In theory, taking control of your investment decisions should be empowering, but the current U.S. retirement system \"appears too complex for many people to understand,\" write Harvard University economist John Campbell and Imperial College London economist Tarun Ramadorai in \"Fixed: Why Personal Finance Is Broken and How to Make It Work for Everyone,\" published by Princeton University Press.",
      "Despite some recent changes in how personal finance is practiced in the U.S., such as automatic enrollment in 401(k)s that were inspired by behavioral economist Richard Thaler's research about \"nudges\" \u2014 small changes that can steer people to make positive financial decisions \u2014 millions of Americans remain woefully unprepared to weather the financial strains of old age.",
      "Stronger medicine is needed, Campbell and Ramadorai say. Rather than a nudge, they call for a combination of regulatory and industry changes designed to overhaul the country's approach to personal finance \u2014 a broader shift they describe as a \"shove.\"",
      "\"We've learned that people make many mistakes, and particularly, sadly, less educated and poorer people tend to make worse mistakes,\" Campbell told CBS News.",
      "Their book proposes a \"starter kit\" of personal finance options, such as retirement accounts that automatically enroll people when they start their first job and stay with them throughout their careers, along with savings accounts that pay interest at the same rate and carry clear, transparent fees.",
      "CBS News spoke with Campbell and Ramdorai about their new book. It has been edited for length and clarity.",
      "CBS News: You write that most Americans are financially illiterate, according to one\u00a0basic assessment. Yet you say that introducing personal finance classes in high school isn't the solution. Why?",
      "Campbell: A simple way to put it is that you have a race between financial literacy and the complexity of the products people are offered, and the decisions they're asked to make. And complexity has been winning the race.",
      "Yes, young people in high school do have to make some big decisions \u2014 taking on student debt, going to college. They may also get a credit card, and then they have to manage their credit score. But there are a lot of other decisions they won't make until much later in life.",
      "It's as if we were trying to teach people to drive by just having the classroom component of driver's ed, without putting the kids behind the wheel.",
      "Ramadorai: All of us are also consumers in the personal finance system, and if you ask me what fraction of my daily time I spend thinking about my own personal finance situation, it's probably fairly small. But the financial sector is entirely focused \u2014 especially those on the personal finance side \u2014 on trying to get this right. So there's a sort of uneven competition between me, however educated I may be, and the financial sector, who is doing this on an industrial scale.",
      "For us to say, \"Oh, well, you know, if only you had taken the time and trouble to be educated, you wouldn't be in the situation you're in right now,\" that seems a bit glib. We're proposing not just putting all of the burden of responsibility on individuals.",
      "You advocate for \"shoves\" instead of \"nudges\" to ensure people are on the proper financial path. Can you elaborate?",
      "Ramadorai: We've seen lots of good examples of these nudges \u2014 for example, auto-enrollment into pension plans. That seems like it's a very well-functioning, effective policy until you start to look a little bit more closely at it. Research is starting to emerge that, in some cases, what happens is that the default contribution rate can actually either be too high or too low, depending on what kind of person you are.",
      "There's a kind of characterization or a caricature of academics as, \"All you want is, you just want the government to come in and fix everything.\" That's really not what we're about in this book.",
      "What we're trying to say is that we believe very strongly in the power of capitalism to produce products that are extremely high quality and are delivered at very low prices. But the energy of capitalism has been perverted.",
      "Campbell: We'd like to make personal finance shopping more like buying a painkiller when you have a headache. You know, you walk into the pharmacy, you go to the shelf. There's ibuprofen, there's Advil, there's the generic \u2014 it's all on the same shelf. The active ingredient is the same, the dosage is the same, and there's a little label on the shelf that shows you the price per unit.",
      "We think personal finance, unfortunately, is a long way away from that right now. It's more like the world of unregulated medicine 120 years ago, when people were selling legitimate medicines, but they were also selling snake oil, and it was very hard for individuals to tell the difference.",
      "You're suggesting that personal finance should be more tightly regulated. Critics of that idea might argue that this would chill innovation in personal finance. What's your view?",
      "Ramadorai:\u00a0There are areas where even the most laissez-faire among us would agree that there's a role for government intervention. Think about civil aviation.",
      "Civil aviation transports very large numbers of people across vast distances at a relatively low cost, and what we don't necessarily want is for people to come in and innovate in that space in a way that introduces risks, because we're super averse to the fact that we don't want these things falling out of the sky.",
      "The other one, of course, is basic utilities. You want the lights to be on \u2014 electricity companies are regulated in a particular way, there's piping that goes to houses for running water. We think that there's a strong role for government to play in having regulation in those areas.",
      "Our argument is that there are vast areas of personal finance that are just as important as any of those basic utilities. It is the plumbing that makes our financial system work.",
      "Campbell: We instead propose a forward-looking, design-focused approach to regulation, where we ask the regulators to get very specific about what a basic financial product should look like. We call these \"starter kit products.\" They can offer a wide range of products. And the starter kit product should be designed so that it is simple, safe, cheap and easy.",
      "If you could redesign how personal finance works in the U.S. from the ground up, what would be the first feature you would build in?",
      "Campbell:\u00a0Number one, I would create a universal retirement account. I would give it a Roth structure that is open for people, automatically upon the date of first employment, and then you can carry it with you across all jobs that you have subsequently.",
      "That would fix the problem we have at the moment \u2014 we have this immense profusion of accounts, and as people change jobs, they very often end up with multiple 401(k)s. But at the same time, people who work for small businesses or who are self-employed \u2014 maybe they open an IRA, maybe they don't \u2014 but the contribution limits are much lower, and so we have an access problem.",
      "Ramadorai:\u00a0Right now in the United States, there's a lock-in problem [with mortgages], which is that interest rates have gone up so high that it's compromising mobility for most people in the U.S. So people are sitting on 2% mortgages, and they're absolutely reluctant to move, even if there's a great job opportunity somewhere else, because they would have to refinance into a much higher rate.",
      "There's a feature of mortgage markets that exists in other places, which is called portability, where you simply take your old mortgage with you to the new place \u2014 you then get the lender to reassess the collateral on the new place, and then you're able to take your mortgage with you. That increases mobility and keeps the labor market functioning well.",
      "You could also have a different feature, which is called assumability, where the buyer of your house actually is able to take on your cheap mortgage, assuming that they pass the appropriate credit checks and so on.",
      "Both of those features, portability and assumability, would be really good additions to the U.S. mortgage market.",

      "As one of America's coffee capitals, Portland, Oregon, has grounds for worry: coffee prices have soared to historic highs.",
      "\"We have bags of coffee on our menu that are $28.50. That's a lot of money for a bag of coffee,\" said Laila Ghambari, owner of Guilder Coffee Company, a caf\u00e9 that sells specialty coffee.",
      "Ghambari and her brothers practically grew up inside an espresso machine. Her father owned a coffee shop, and Ghambari became the U.S. barista champion in 2014. Now, she's a small business owner grappling with the expense of tariffs, which are still impacting her business even though coffee and other products were granted an exemption last month.",
      "\"Any coffee that's already landed in the United States is still subject to the tariff,\" Ghambari said.",
      "Coffee prices were already high due to supply and demand pressures for premium beans along with climate issues, especially crop-killing frost. The average retail price of 100% ground roast coffee hit a record high of $9.14 per pound in September, according to\u00a0the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. In December 2019, shortly before the COVID-19 pandemic, one pound of ground coffee cost a little over $4. And in August, retail coffee prices in the U.S. had jumped 20.9% from the previous year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics \u2014 the sharpest increase in nearly three decades.",
      "Then, back in April, the U.S. imposed a so-called reciprocal tariff of 10% on coffee-producing countries. Ghambari said it cost her roughly fifty cents a bag.",
      "Christopher Hendon, a chemistry professor at the University of Oregon   known as \"Dr. Coffee,\" studies the global industry and said the tariffs cost independent coffee operators more than consumers.",
      "\"[The consumer is] probably not feeling it,\" Hendon said. \"You might not care today, because the price didn't change all that much, but you might care if your local caf\u00e9 disappears.\"",
      "Charlie Wicker's company, Trail Head Coffee, roasts green beans into brown ones. Tariffs hit him hard.",
      "\"I had to lay off the two full-time employees. So now it's down to just myself and one part-time employee,\" Wicker said, adding, \"The fact that we're still standing is a function of having a little bit of savings to keep the lights on.\"",
      "Despite the reversal that lifted tariffs on coffee, relief will take time because coffee roasters and caf\u00e9s typically order beans months in advance.",
      "Ghambari said it won't be until February when the first import of tariff-free coffees will land in her warehouse.",
      "For Wicker, who delivers to caf\u00e9s, lifting those tariffs could be the coffee break he needs.",

    "published": "Mon, 01 Dec 2025 15:43:35 -0500",
    "summary": "Holiday spending is hitting new records, but some data shows that people are buying fewer items amid higher prices.",
    "story": [
      "Americans may not be feeling jolly about their economic prospects, but that didn't stop shoppers from opening their wallets on Black Friday and driving spending to new records. Despite record holiday sales, however, other signs suggest consumers are getting a smaller bang for their buck because of rising inflation and stingier seasonal discounts.",
      "Consumers spent a combined $11.8 billion online on Nov. 28 during the shopping blitz, a 9.1% jump from last year, Adobe Analytics said. Including in-store sales, Americans spent 4.1% more on Black Friday than a year earlier,\u00a0according to Mastercard SpendingPulse.",
      "Purchases on Cyber Monday are also expected to be strong, with Adobe forecasting shoppers will spend a record $14.2 billion online today, which would amount to a more than 6% jump from a year ago.",
      "The resilience of the American consumer has helped buoy the economy even as it faces headwinds ranging from higher costs from the Trump administration's tariffs to a spike in corporate layoffs amid a slowing labor market.",
      "Inflation remains a problem",
      "Yet while discounts dangled by retailers from Walmart to Amazon helped fuel spending, beneath the record sales are signs of weakness, according to online sales data from Salesforce.com. Discounts this year aren't as deep, with the average selling price of goods rising 7% from a year ago, while consumers bought 2% fewer items at checkout, Salesforce said.",
      "\"A lot of growth is being driven by higher prices, and this means the growth in the number of things that people buy is significantly less,\" Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData, told CBS News. \"So far this year, we have retail volume growth running at about 0.3%, which is very low growth.\"",
      "He added, \"This is one of the reasons some consumers feel a little gloomy when they see their dollars don't stretch as far as they once did.\"",
      "Inflation ticked up to 3% in September on an annual basis, according to the latest available Consumer Price Index data. That's up from a low this year of 2.3% in April.",
      "Experts say tighter household budgets are causing many consumers to watch their spending, such as by focusing on a few \"big ticket\" purchases, or spreading out what they buy over days of promotions in hopes of getting the most bang for their buck.",
      "Affordability pinch",
      "Consumer spending is vital to the U.S. economy because it represents about 70 cents of every $1 of gross domestic product. With consumer confidence falling last month to its lowest point since April, there were questions about whether the holiday season would bring cheer or gloom to retailers.",
      "Some Americans are also facing an affordability pinch, with costs for everything from groceries to utility bills on the rise. According to Deloitte's 2025 holiday study, three-quarters of shoppers reported bracing for higher prices during the holidays.",
      "Consumer spending in 2025 has been largely driven by high-income households, with the top 10% accounting for nearly half of all spending in the second quarter, according to an\u00a0analysis\u00a0of Federal Reserve data by Mark Zandi, chief economist at financial research firm Moody's Analytics.",
      "Spending among the bottom 80% of households \u2014 or those earning less than $175,000 a year \u2014 has \"simply kept pace with inflation since the pandemic,\" Zandi wrote in a September social media post.",
      "That's creating a so-called\u00a0K-shaped economy, with high-earning Americans spending more, while middle- and low-income households are holding back due to rising costs.",
      "\"Virtually all major holiday outlooks point to a bifurcated consumer,\" Kent Smetters of the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a nonpartisan research project at the University of Pennsylvania, said in an email. \"Widening behavioral gap \u2014 high-income households spending and staying online; lower-income households more selective, financed and volume-conscious.\"",
      "For now, both discount retailers and luxury stores appear to be outperforming this season, Saunders noted.",
      "\"So far, we're seeing value-focused retailers like Walmart and off-price do well,\" he said. \"Some of the accessible luxury brands, such as Coach and Ralph Lauren, are also doing really well. So there are winners out there, but the low-volume growth means that there are losers, too.\"",

It said microscopic examination of the paint layers revealed not only white, black, and red pigments in the areas representing flesh, but also blue and green pigments Rubens typically used in painting human skin.",
      "Art expert Eric Turquin told a packed house the painting had virtually disappeared in the early 1600s. It is known to have belonged to 19th-century French classic painter William Bouguereau before it was passed down in the family.",
      "Although Rubens produced many works for the Church, the painting, measuring 42 by 29 inches, was likely to have been created for a private collector.",

    "story": [
      "Airlines reported short-term disruptions heading into the busy\u00a0Thanksgiving holiday weekend\u00a0as they fixed software on a widely used commercial aircraft.",
      "Thousands of Airbus A320 airliners around the world might require a software update, potentially causing flight delays or cancellations during the busy Thanksgiving holiday weekend.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy wrote on social media Saturday afternoon that \"travelers SHOULD NOT expect any major disruptions.\"",
      "\"All impacted U.S. carriers have reported great progress, and are on track to meet the deadline of this Sunday at midnight to complete the work,\" Duffy said.",
      "The emergency update stems from an incident Oct. 30 when a JetBlue flight traveling from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, experienced an issue with its flight controls. The plane dropped about 100 feet in seven seconds, according to preliminary flight data from Flightradar24, and was diverted to Tampa, Florida.",
      "Between 15 and 20 people were injured and taken to area hospitals upon\u00a0landing, according to Vivian Shedd, a spokesperson for Tampa Fire Rescue.",
      "Airbus identified an apparent issue relating to \"intense solar radiation,\" which \"may corrupt data critical to the functioning of flight controls\" and recommended an emergency software update to the A320 family of aircraft \u2013 a common passenger plane for U.S. carriers.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency issued emergency orders Friday that grounded the affected planes. The EU safety agency's order took effect Saturday at 7 p.m. Eastern Time, meaning planes awaiting the updates would be essentially grounded. The order allows for the planes to be flown up to three times without passengers to get them to a location for the fix.",
      "The software change comes as U.S. passengers were beginning to head home from the Thanksgiving holiday, which is the busiest travel time in the country. More than 500 U.S.-registered aircraft will be impacted, the Associated Press reported.",
      "Several U.S. carriers use the Airbus A320 family in their fleet. Spirit and Frontier only fly the A320 family of planes, with many popular carriers maintaining several hundred in their fleet. Delta flies about 315 A320 jets, United has about 200 planes and American has around 480 planes.",
      "United told CBS News the order impacts six aircraft in its Airbus fleet. Delta expects only a small portion of its A320 fleet, less than 50 aircraft, to be impacted by the updates.",
      "American Airlines said in a statement to CBS News Friday evening that it had downgraded the number of impacted aircraft from more than 340 to 209, and that it expected the majority of those 209 to be updated by Friday \"and through the night.\"",
      "\"All aircraft will be completed ahead of the EASA Emergency Airworthiness Directive taking effect tomorrow at 6 p.m. CT,\" American said in a statement.",
      "Hawaii Airlines said it was unaffected.",
      "Internationally, Japan's All Nippon Airways canceled 65 domestic flights on Saturday and said further cancellations were possible. Air India said on X that it had completed the reset on more than 40% of the planes that needed it, and that there were no cancellations so far. France's transport minister said the issue had a limited impact in the country. Disruptions were also minimal in the U.K., Germany and Scandinavia.",
      "Airlines for America, the trade association for the leading U.S. airlines, predicted that carriers will fly a record 31 million passengers from last Friday, Nov. 21, through this coming Monday. The FAA says it expects this year's Thanksgiving holiday travel period to be the busiest in 15 years.",
      "Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury apologized to customers in a post on LinkedIn.",
      "\"Our teams are working around the clock to support our operators and ensure these updates are deployed as swiftly as possible to get planes back in the sky and resume normal operations, with the safety assurance you expect from Airbus,\" he wrote in a message posted on Saturday.",
      "Meanwhile, Airbus also informed airlines globally Saturday that is implementing new procedures that will restrict Airbus aircraft equipped with Pratt & Whitney engines in certain freezing winter weather conditions that include freezing fog and visibility less than 450 feet.",
      "Pratt & Whitney engines are found on the Airbus A220 and are an engine option for the A320 family of planes.",

    "summary": "Shoppers turned out in big numbers for Black Friday despite wider economic uncertainty.",
    "story": [
      "Despite wider economic uncertainty hovering above this year's holiday season, shoppers turned out in big numbers for Black Friday \u2014 spending billions of dollars both in stores and online.",
      "Adobe Analytics, which tracks e-commerce, said U.S. consumers spent a record $11.8 billion online Friday, marking a 9.1% jump from last year. It was a slight increase from the company's spending estimate of $11.7 billion.",
      "Traffic particularly piled up between the hours of 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. local time nationwide, when $12.5 million passed through online shopping carts every minute. Mobile shopping was estimated to drive more than half of all sales, according to Adobe.",
      "Consumers also spent a record $6.4 billion online on Thanksgiving Day, per Adobe. Top categories that saw an uptick in sales across both days included video game consoles, electronics and home appliances. Shopping services powered by artificial intelligence and social media advertising have also particularly influenced what consumers choose to buy, the firm said.",
      "In-store traffic continues to dwindle",
      "Meanwhile, software company Salesforce estimated that Black Friday online sales totaled $18 billion in the U.S. and $79 billion globally. And e-commerce platform Shopify said its merchants raked in a record $6.2 billion in sales worldwide on Black Friday. At its peak, sales reached $5.1 million per minute - with top categories including cosmetics and clothing, according to the Canadian company.",
      "Black Friday is far from the sales event that created midnight mall crowds or doorbuster mayhem just decades ago. More and more consumers have instead turned to online deals to make post-Thanksgiving purchases from the comfort of their own homes - or opt to stretch out spending across longer promotions now offered by retailers.",
      "As a result, in-store traffic has continued to dwindle. Initial data from RetailNext, which measures real-time foot traffic in physical stores, found that U.S. Black Friday traffic fell 3.6% from 2024.",
      "But \"the story isn't just that shoppers stayed home; it's that they're changing how and when they shop,\" Joe Shasteen, global manager of advanced analytics at RetailNext said in emailed comments on Saturday. He explained that customers are now spreading out purchases over a longer time frame and \"walking into stores with a far narrower mission than we've seen in past holiday seasons.\"",
      "Black Friday remains a major date on retailers' calendar - and Shasteen added that Friday's drop is \"notably better\" than a sharper 6.2% decline RetailNext saw in in-store traffic for the days leading up to Thanksgiving. This indicates that, while shoppers remain cautious and are pulling back on in-store spending overall, \"they're still willing to show up for the biggest promotional moments,\" he said.",
      "Experts expect heightened holiday spending to continue through the weekend. In terms of e-commerce, Adobe expects U.S. shoppers to spend another $5.5 billion Saturday and $5.9 billion on Sunday - before reaching an estimated $14.2 billion peak on Cyber Monday, which would mark yet another record.",
      "Tariffs create strain on businesses and households",
      "Still, rising prices could be contributing to some of those numbers. U.S. President Donald Trump's barrage of tariffs\u00a0on foreign imports have strained businesses and households alike over the last year. The federal government had raised $195 billion in customs duties for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30,\u00a0according to\u00a0the U.S. Department of the Treasury.",
      "Despite spending more overall, Salesforce found U.S. shoppers purchased fewer items at checkout on Black Friday (down 2% from last year). Order volumes also slipped 1%, the firm noted, as average selling prices climbed 7%.",
      "This year's holiday spending rush arrives amid heightened economic uncertainty for consumers. Beyond tariffs, workers across public and private sectors are also struggling with anxieties over job security - amid both corporate layoffs and the after-effects of the 43-day government shutdown.",
      "For the November-December holiday season overall, the National Retail Federation estimates U.S. shoppers will spend more than $1 trillion for the first time this year. But the rate of growth is slowing - with an anticipated increase of 3.7% to 4.2% year over year, compared to 4.3% in 2024's holiday season.",
      "At the same time, credit card debt and delinquencies on other short-term loans have been rising. And more and more shoppers are turning to \"buy now, pay later\" plans, which allows them to delay payments on holiday decor, gifts and other items.",
      "Americans spending more for the holidays despite dour economic views\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMichigan Retailers Association encourages local shopping on Cyber Monday\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Friday shoppers pack Lenox Square, chasing holiday discounts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShopify outage disrupts some merchants on Cyber Monday\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-person Black Friday shopping making a comeback in Metro Detroit",

    "story": [
      "Stocks gained in a short Friday session to close near a record high, capping a five-day rally that helped the S&P 500 index erase nearly all its losses from earlier in the month.",
      "The S&P 500 rose 36 points, or 0.5%, to close at 6,849, 42 points shy of its Oct. 28 record. The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 289 points, or 0.6%, to close at 47,716. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.7% on Friday but ended November with a decline of 1.5% because of losses for some big tech stocks.",
      "Stock indexes closed at 1 p.m. EDT on Friday due to the Thanksgiving holiday.",
      "The multi-day rebound came after a largely volatile month for stocks, sparked by concerns about a possible bubble in artificial intelligence and tech stocks. AI chipmaker Nvidia lost 1.8% Friday and closed the month with a double-digit loss. Oracle tumbled 23% in November while Palantir Technologies sank 16%.",
      "\"The market needs to prove it can sustain this momentum, but right now, the weakness after Nvidia's earnings looks like it could be more of a short-term AI-selling climax than a sign of heightened bearishness,\" Chris Larkin, Managing Director of trading and investing at E*TRADE from Morgan Stanley, said in an email.",
      "Some investors have expressed worry that an AI bubble\u00a0could burst, triggering devastating financial losses. Bubbles occur when stocks surge on inflated growth expectations that ultimately prove to be disconnected from a company's underlying fundamentals.",
      "Some tech stocks did notch monthly gains, most notably Alphabet, which rose nearly 14%, due to excitement about its recently released Gemini AI model.",
      "The market turned around on hopes that the Federal Reserve would again cut interest rates at its meeting next month. Recent comments from Fed officials have given traders more confidence that the central bank will again cut interest rates at its meeting that ends Dec. 10.",
      "Traders are betting on a nearly 87% probability that the Fed will cut next month, according to data from CME Group.",
      "The central bank, which has already cut rates twice this year in hopes of shoring up the slowing job market, is facing an increasingly difficult decision on interest rates as inflation rises and the job market slows. Cutting interest rates further could help support the economy as employment weakens, but it could also fuel inflation. The latest round of corporate earnings reports was mostly positive, but economic data has been mixed.",
      "The minutes of the Fed's most recent meeting in October indicate there are likely to be strong divisions among policymakers about the Fed's next step.",
      "Investors also had their eye on retail stocks as they wait to see if shoppers rushed to take advantage of the annual Black Friday sales event. Macy's fell 0.3% while Kohl's gained 1.4%. Dick's Sporting Goods dropped 0.5%. Among specialty retailers, Abercrombie & Fitch rose 2.9% and American Eagle Outfitters gained 0.7%.",
      "Amid the volatility in tech stocks, traders moved money into other parts of the market. Pharmaceutical companies Eli Lilly and Merck each rose more than 20% for the month. Travel-related companies such as Marriott and Expedia also posted strong monthly gains.",
      "Earlier, futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq were halted for hours due to a technical issue at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. CME said the problem was tied to an outage at a CyrusOne data center.",
      "Treasury yields rose slightly, with the 10-year yield at 4.02%.",

    "summary": "Tech giants including Alibaba, Amazon and Meta are counting on AI as the \"killer app\" that convinces consumers to try smart glasses.",
    "story": [
      "If seeing the world through the eyes of artificial intelligence sounds appealing, a growing number of technology companies have just the thing: AI eyeglasses.",
      "The latest entrant is from Alibaba, which on Thursday started selling smart glasses that let wearers access the Chinese online retailer's Qwen AI app with the touch of a button. Consumers can use the device, dubbed Quark AI Glasses, to search the internet, automatically compile meeting notes, make payments, listen to music and manage their schedule, among other functions.",
      "Consumers can also use the glasses' built-in camera to snap a picture of a product and instantly price it on Alibaba's e-commerce site, Taobao. The glasses, which start at 3,799 yuan (roughly $537), are only available for purchase in China, according to Alibaba.",
      "Companies have been down this road before \u2014 often unsuccessfully. Google launched smart glasses, which could be used to search the web, get directions and record video, more than a decade ago. But the product failed to catch on, with consumers put off by the $1,500 price tag.",
      "After repositioning Google Glass as a tool for businesses, the Alphabet-owned company pulled the plug in 2023.",
      "Yet the idea of wearing a computer on your face, rather than carrying one around in your pocket in the form of a smartphone, never went away. Today, major tech players, including Amazon, Meta and Xiaomi, are all rolling out digital glasses, betting on AI as the \"killer app\" that wins over consumers. Dozens of smaller players are also entering the fray with a variety of products.",
      "In the U.S., Meta this summer teamed with eyewear maker Oakley to introduce AI glasses that lets users make calls, send and receive text messages, listen to music, stream video, translate foreign languages, and generally tap the internet via the company's AI app. Geared to athletes, the product starts at $399. Meta also offers AI glasses in a partnership with Ray-Ban.",
      "Such devices are attracting users beyond tech fans. For example, some visually impaired people are using Meta's smart glasses to connect with volunteers for real-time help completing tasks such as shopping or going through their mail.",
      "Although smart glasses remain a niche product, tech market researcher IDC forecasts steady growth, from global sales of 9.4 million units this year to nearly 20 million in 2029. Roughly 17% of online adults in the U.S report having tried smart glasses, according to Forrester, up from 4% in 2024.",

      "A U.S. official says ICE is planning to surge resources to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area to launch immigration enforcement operations there targeting individuals with deportation orders. The region has the largest population of immigrants from Somalia in the U.S., some of whom have deportation orders.",

      "President Trump: \"I don't want [Somalis] in our country\"",
      "In the midst of Tuesday's reports, President Trump took further aim at Minnesota's Somali community, the country of Somalia and the diaspora at large.",
      "\"They contribute nothing \u2026 I don't want them in our country,\" Trump said to the press on Tuesday. \"That's not politically correct, but I don't care. I don't want them here. Their country is no good for a reason.\"",
      "In a\u00a0Thanksgiving post where he also called Gov. Tim Walz a slur for people with intellectual disabilities, Mr. Trump said Somali refugees are \"completely taking over the once great State of Minnesota.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also previously ordered all green card holders from Somalia and more than a dozen other countries to be reexamined and said he would end the temporary protected status for Somalis in Minnesota, claiming, without evidence, that \"Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great state.\" The latter move would affect hundreds in the community.",

      "\"To our Somali community, I love you, and we stand with you. That commitment is rock solid,\" said Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. \"Minneapolis is proud to be home to the largest Somali community in the entire country. They've been here for decades, in many instances. Entrepreneurs and fathers, they benefit both the cultures and the economic resilience of our city.\"",

      "\"Mistakes will be made, and let's be clear, it means that American citizens will be detained, for no other reason than the fact that they look like they are Somali,\" Frey said. \"That is not now and will never be a legitimate reason.\"",
      "St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter said the actions of the Trump administration are \"un-American.\"",
      "\"I grew up in an America that prided itself on being a country of immigrants, that prided itself on the fact that people from other countries would look across a whole ocean and say that's where I want to be. It seems that what we learned was that we've prided ourselves and we have decades and generations of priding ourselves on being a beacon for immigration from Europe,\" Carter said. \"I mean, it seems to many of us, like, the darker-skinned the immigrants who come to our country are, the more our posture on immigration as a country has shifted. That's un-American. That's concerning.\"",
      "Carter said the Twin Cities need to unite to stand up for immigrants and refugees.",
      "\"The last thing that we need is federal agents coming to town attempting to turn us against each other, to turn us against ourselves. The last thing we need is federal agents coming in town to create chaos and challenge for us, and so we stand together,\" Carter said. \"We encourage folks to look to the organizations that serve immigrants and refugees across our community because we have constant reminders out there about what your rights are. You have rights, that's an American thing.\"",
      "Minneapolis City Council member Jamal Osman, who was born in Somalia, pulled no punches in his assessment of the president.",
      "\"One of the things I do want to say, and obviously everyone knows that our president is racist, xenophobic, Islamophobic, and we're going to fight that,\" Osman said. \"America has a history of fighting and stopping those kind of individuals who continue to divide people and divide communities.\"",
      "Osman said his community will remain firm amid the current climate of danger.",
      "\"Our community has lived through fear in the past, and we're not gonna let them divide that,\" Osman said.",

      "Samatar said it all began in 1991 with Somalia's civil war.",
      "\"Somalis, everyone, they have to flee,\" Samatar said. \"Whoever will take them in, they have to flee.\"",
      "Some stayed in Somalia but were internally displaced. Others went to refugee camps in neighboring countries. Many were sent to other countries all over the world.",

      "Yuri Ushakov, a top Putin official, told reporters following Tuesday's meeting that the talks were \"constructive, very useful and substantive,\" but said a compromise to the lingering territorial issues in Ukraine wasn't found.",
      "\"The territorial issue, naturally, is the most important for us, and for the Americans too. A compromise option has not yet been found, but some American developments look more or less acceptable, but they need to be discussed,\" he said. \"Some formulations that were proposed to us are acceptable to us.\"",
      "\"We are no closer to resolving the crisis in Ukraine, and there is much work to be done,\" Ushakov said.",

      "Ushakov said both Russia and the U.S. agreed not to disclose the specific details of the talks. No direct talks between Putin and Mr. Trump are currently planned, but Putin asked Witkoff and Kushner to relay \"important political signals\" to Mr. Trump, Ushakov said.",
      "Witkoff and Kushner are set to return to the U.S. to discuss the meeting with Mr. Trump, and will then get back in touch with Russian officials by phone, Ushakov said.",

One provision that drew heavy pushback from U.S. and European officials called for Ukraine to cede territory it currently controls in Donetsk to Russia.",
      "\"They're making concessions,\" Mr. Trump said of the Russians. \"They're big concessions. They stop fighting, and they don't take any more land.\"",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said at a Tuesday news conference that the plan had been whittled down to 20 points following talks in Geneva and Florida. He said later on the social media platform Telegram that Ukraine would \"wait for signals from the American delegation after its meetings in Russia.\"",
      "\"We will receive certain signals. If the signals work, if it is fair play with our partners, then perhaps we will meet with the American delegation very soon,\" he said, adding, \"I am ready to meet with President Trump. Everything depends on today's talks.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Justice Department will seek to dismiss a lawsuit that former federal prosecutor Maurene Comey brought against it, arguing she didn't properly follow administrative complaint procedures before suing.",
      "The government laid out its argument in court papers filed Monday prior to a Thursday hearing in Manhattan federal court.",
      "Comey, a former federal prosecutor in New York who handled criminal cases against Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, sued the Trump administration in September over\u00a0her firing\u00a0in July, saying her ouster was \"unlawful and unconstitutional.\" In their\u00a0complaint, Comey's attorneys argued that her termination was \"politically motivated\" and an overreach of presidential authority.",
      "Comey is the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, who has publicly clashed with President Trump for years. In 2017, Mr. Trump\u00a0terminated\u00a0James Comey as FBI director, amid the department's investigation into any ties between Mr. Trump's associates and Russia.",
      "James Comey was indicted by a grand jury in September on two counts related to testimony he provided to Congress in September 2020. He has\u00a0pleaded not guilty. A federal judge last week ordered the criminal charges against him be dismissed on the grounds that Lindsey Halligan, the interim U.S. attorney who secured the indictment, was unlawfully appointed to the role. Attorney General Pam Bondi told reporters that the Justice Department will \"be taking all available legal action, including an immediate appeal.\"",
      "The Justice Department indicated its planned defense to Maurene Comey's lawsuit in a joint letter submitted Monday to Judge Jesse M. Furman by Maurene Comey's lawyers and the chief of the civil division of the federal prosecutor's office in Albany.",
      "The government's sections in the letter argued her lawsuit was not properly before the court because she did not fully comply with administrative procedures requiring the Merit Systems Protection Board to first consider her claim. It rejected her lawsuit's claim that the notice of appeal she filed with the board in August was futile.",
      "The board, the Justice Department maintained in the letter, was \"the appropriate forum to determine whether, as Ms. Comey claims, her removal was a prohibited personnel action or an arbitrary and capricious agency action.\"",
      "Maurene Comey's lawyers said in the filing that the board \"lacks expertise to adjudicate this novel dispute\" and was not an appropriate forum because \"this case raises foundational constitutional questions with respect to the separation of powers.\" They also argued that it was \"no longer true\" that the board functions independently of the president.",
      "A lawyer for Maurene Comey referred CBS News to the letter on Tuesday.",
      "Before her firing in July, Maurene Comey was an assistant U.S. attorney in the high-profile U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan, where she had worked since 2015. Her lawyers wrote in their lawsuit that she was fired one day after she had \"been asked to take the lead on a major public corruption case.\" Just months before, she had received an \"outstanding\" review from supervisors, the complaint said.",
      "Last month, U.S. Attorney John Sarcone in Albany took on the case and indicated his office will defend the Trump administration in the lawsuit. The move followed the recusal of prosecutors in Manhattan, where Maurene Comey had secured guilty verdicts in several high-profile cases, including the sex trafficking conviction of Ghislaine Maxwell and the bribery convictions of former Sen. Bob Menendez and his wife.",
      "Two weeks before Maurene Comey was fired, a jury convicted Combs of prostitution-related charges, though it acquitted him of more serious sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy charges. She led the prosecution team. Combs, 56, is scheduled for release from prison in June 2028.",
      "Maxwell, 63, was convicted in December 2021 on sex trafficking charges after a jury found she aided the sex abuse of girls and women by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein was found dead in his federal jail cell in August 2019 as he awaited a sex trafficking charge. His death was ruled a suicide.

    "summary": "President Trump said his administration could attack accused drug traffickers who traverse Latin America by land \"very soon,\" which would mark an escalation in his anti-narcotics campaign.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said Tuesday his administration could attack accused drug traffickers who traverse Latin America by land \"very soon,\" which would mark an escalation in the U.S. military's campaign of lethal strikes on alleged drug boats.",
      "\"We're going to start doing those strikes on land, too,\" Mr. Trump told reporters during a Cabinet meeting when asked about the administration's strikes at sea. \"You know, the land is much easier ... And we know the routes they take. We know everything about them. We know where they live. We know where the bad ones live. And we're going to start that very soon, too.\"",
      "Mr. Trump did not definitively say when or where any possible land strikes might take place.",
      "Officials have discussed possible military operations in Venezuela in recent weeks, CBS News has previously reported, as the Trump administration accuses Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of working with drug cartels \u2014 a charge Maduro denies.",
      "But Mr. Trump said Tuesday that land strikes would not necessarily be limited to Venezuela. He said any country where illicit drugs are produced or trafficked \"is subject to attack,\" and singled out neighboring Colombia, which the U.S. has accused of failing to control the drug trade.",
      "The president has hinted for months that he may broaden his administration's sea-based strikes to include accused drug targets on land, telling reporters in October that he is \"totally prepared\" to carry out land strikes.",
      "Meanwhile, the U.S. military has built up its presence in the Caribbean, dispatching the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier to the region and sending F-35 fighter jets to Puerto Rico. And over the weekend, Mr. Trump said the airspace over Venezuela should be considered closed.",
      "If the president takes the step of ordering strikes on targets within Latin American countries, it would significantly expand the Trump administration's anti-drug trafficking operations, which have hit upward\u00a0of 20 alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and Pacific, killing more than 80 people.",
      "Those boat strikes are already controversial. Democratic lawmakers and some Republicans have argued Mr. Trump is acting without legal authority and hasn't provided enough evidence that the boats are carrying drugs. The administration has said the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels, which it has designated as terrorist groups.",
      "And The Washington Post reported last week that the first boat attack, on Sept. 2, included a second strike to kill two survivors clinging to the vessel's wreckage, which some lawmakers and experts argue could constitute a war crime. The White House confirmed there was a second strike, but maintained that the operation was legal.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said Tuesday that any land attack \"would be an act of war, and Congress would invoke the War Powers Act,\" referring to the 1973 law that limits the president's authority to make war without congressional authorization.",
      "Efforts in Congress to limit Mr. Trump's campaign have run into opposition so far. The Senate narrowly\u00a0voted down a resolution last month that would have prevented any strikes against Venezuela without a declaration of war, with 49 senators \u2014 including two Republicans \u2014 voting in support. A month earlier, a vote to end the strikes on alleged drug boats also failed.",
      "Land strikes would also likely face heavy pushback in Latin America. In response to Mr. Trump's comments, Colombian President Gustavo Petro defended his government's anti-narcotics efforts, but warned: \"Do not threaten our sovereignty, because you will awaken the jaguar.\"",
      "Venezuelan officials have also accused the Trump administration of intimidating the country and seeking Maduro's ouster. Mr. Trump has not said what his intentions are with Venezuela, but told reporters in mid-November he's \"sort of\" made up his mind on how to proceed.",

    "story": [
      "A former Honduran president convicted of helping to smuggle 400 tons of cocaine into the United States has left prison after being pardoned by President Donald Trump. The U.S. Bureau of Prisons confirmed his release in a statement to the Associated Press.",
      "Juan Orlando Hernandez\u00a0was released from a federal prison in West Virginia on Monday and was \"once again a free man,\" his wife, Ana Garc\u00eda, announced on social media. Garc\u00eda thanked Mr. Trump for pardoning Hern\u00e1ndez via the social platform X early Tuesday.",
      "\"After almost four years of pain, of waiting and difficult challenges, my husband Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez RETURNED to being a free man, thanks to the presidential pardon granted by President Donald Trump,\" Garc\u00eda's post said. She included a picture of the U.S. Bureau of Prisons listing for Hern\u00e1ndez indicating his release.",
      "Mr. Trump's controversial pardon came as the U.S. president is simultaneously ordering the bombing of boats in the Caribbean allegedly carrying drugs. He is also heavily backing a candidate from Hernandez's party in Honduras's tense, ongoing presidential election vote count.",
      "Mr. Trump explained his decision\u00a0on social media\u00a0by posting that \"according to many people that I greatly respect,\" Hern\u00e1ndez was \"treated very harshly and unfairly.\"",
      "In March of last year, Hernandez was convicted in U.S. court\u00a0of conspiring to import cocaine\u00a0into the U.S. He had served two terms as the leader of the Central American nation of roughly 10 million people. Hern\u00e1ndez has been appealing his conviction and serving time at the U.S. Penitentiary, Hazelton in West Virginia.",
      "Shortly after Mr. Trump's announcement, Hernandez's wife and children gathered on the steps on their home in Tegucigalpa and kneeled in prayer, thanking God that Hernandez would return to their family after almost four years apart.",
      "It was the same home that Honduran authorities hauled him out of in 2022 just months after leaving office. He was extradited to the United States to stand trial.",
      "Trump's pardon drew criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.",
      "Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, of Louisiana, was critical of the pardon, saying Sunday on social media, \"Why would we pardon [Hernandez] and then go after Maduro for running drugs into the United States? Lock up every drug runner! Don't understand why he is being pardoned.\"",
      "\"This is shocking,\" Sen. Tim Kaine, a Democrat of Virginia,\u00a0said of the pardon\u00a0on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "\"He was convicted in a federal court in the United States,\" said Kaine, the ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere. \"One of the bits of evidence was his statement that was picked up by those near to him that he wanted to 'shove drugs up the nose of gringos' and flood the United States with cocaine, more than 400 tons. He was the leader of one of the largest criminal enterprises that has ever been subject to a conviction in U.S. courts, and less than one year into his sentence, President Trump is pardoning him, suggesting that President Trump cares nothing about narcotrafficking. Suggesting possibly that pardons are now for sale by this White House.\"",
      "In remarks on the House floor Tuesday, Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, said, \"What message does pardoning this criminal send to parents who have lost children to narcotics, to law enforcement officers risking everything to stop the flow of deadly drugs?\"",
      "\"This disgraceful pardon should be met with bipartisan condemnation,\" she added.",
      "Mr. Trump defended the move to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday, claiming, \"Many of the people of Honduras said it was a Biden setup. ... He was the president of the country, and they basically said he was a drug dealer because he was the president of the country. And they said it was a Biden administration setup, and I looked at the facts and I agreed with them.\"",
      "When asked what evidence he had seen to indicate Hernandez's case was a setup, Mr. Trump said, \"You take any country you want, if somebody sells drugs in that country, that doesn't mean you arrest the president and put him in jail for the rest of his life.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Monday claimed it was a \"clear Biden overprosecution,\" alleging that there was some \"egregious\" information that came out during Hernandez's trial.",

    "story": [
      "The Canadian publishing house behind the \"Franklin\" children's books appeared to condemn Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth on Monday, after the top military official posted a cartoon image of the famous anthropomorphic turtle blowing up an apparent drug boat.",
      "Hegseth's post \u2014 which shows Franklin shooting a rocket-propelled grenade from a helicopter, with the faux book title \"Franklin Targets Narco Terrorists\" \u2014 appeared on the defense secretary's X account Sunday evening, as questions swirled about the Trump administration's monthslong campaign of boat strikes around South America, and specifically a reported second strike targeting survivors who were in the water.",
      "A day later, Toronto-based Kids Can Press said in a statement posted to social media: \"Franklin the Turtle is a beloved Canadian icon who has inspired generations of children and stands for kindness, empathy, and inclusivity. We strongly condemn any denigrating, violent, or unauthorized use of Franklin's name or image, which directly contradicts these values.\"",
      "Kids Can Press is the publisher of more than a dozen picture books that depict Franklin navigating life with his parents and friends, with titles like \"Franklin Rides a Bike,\" \"Franklin Goes to School\" and \"Franklin Goes to the Hospital.\" The stories have also been adapted for TV.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Kids Can Press for comment. In a statement Monday night, Chief Pentagon Spokesman Sean Parnell told CBS News: \"We doubt Franklin the Turtle wants to be inclusive of drug cartels... or laud the kindness and empathy of narco-terrorists.\"",
      "For your Christmas wish list\u2026 pic.twitter.com/pLXzg20SaL",
      "Hegseth's post drew flak earlier Monday from Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, a retired Navy captain who is\u00a0facing a controversial investigation by the Pentagon\u00a0for participating in a video that encouraged service members not to obey illegal orders.",
      "\"He is in the national command authority for nuclear weapons, and last night he's putting out, on the internet, turtles with rocket-propelled grenades,\" Kelly told reporters. \"I mean, have you seen this? This is the secretary of defense. This is not a serious person.\"",
      "Days before Hegseth's post, The Washington Post reported that the U.S. military carried out more than one strike on a single boat on Sept. 2, killing two survivors from the initial attack after Hegseth allegedly ordered the military to kill everybody onboard. The White House confirmed Monday that there was a second strike, but denied that Hegseth ordered it.",
      "Some Democratic lawmakers have argued the second strike may have been a war crime, pointing to domestic and international laws forbidding military forces from attacking wounded people who no longer pose a threat. One Pentagon manual says \"wounded, sick, or shipwrecked\" combatants should not be attacked.",
      "The Trump administration has said its boat attacks have complied with the law and argues that the strikes are necessary to crack down on drug trafficking.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier Monday that Adm. Frank Bradley, who commanded the Sept. 2 operation, \"worked well within his authority and the law, directing the engagement to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the United States of America was eliminated.\"",
      "Hegseth posted Monday on social media that Bradley \"is an American hero, a true professional, and has my 100% support. I stand by him and the combat decisions he has made \u2014 on the September 2 mission and all others since.\"",

      "The government of\u00a0Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u00a0on Tuesday announced that the twice-weekly flights will go on following a request from the Trump administration. That reverses a Venezuelan government Saturday announcement indicating that U.S. immigration authorities had unilaterally suspended the flights.",
      "An overflight and landing application submitted Monday by U.S.-based Eastern Airlines requests permission for an arrival Wednesday. The agreement authorizes flights on a Boeing 777-200 from Phoenix, Arizona, to land at Maiquet\u00eda International Airport, the Venezuelan government said. The application was made public Tuesday by Venezuela's foreign affairs minister.",
      "Venezuelans have been steadily deported to their home country this year after Maduro, under pressure from the White House, did away with his long-standing policy of not accepting deportees from the U.S. Maduro has since framed their return as a triumph, saying Venezuelans are being repatriated from harsh conditions in U.S. detention.",
      "Immigrants arrive regularly at the airport outside the capital, Caracas, on flights operated by a U.S. government contractor or Venezuela's state-owned airline. More than 13,000 immigrants have returned so far this year on the chartered flights, the latest of which arrived Friday.",
      "The U.S.-Venezuela repatriation deal has faced scrutiny from human rights organizations, though Trump administration officials point to the diplomatic deal as an important tool in reducing the influence of transnational criminal gangs. The flights have continued despite U.S. military strikes against vessels suspected of smuggling drugs in the eastern Pacific Ocean and off Venezuela's Caribbean coast.",
      "Trump administration officials say the combination of targeted strikes and deportation flights reflect a multi-pronged strategy to disrupt the Tren de Aragua gang and other organized criminal networks, which have been linked to drug trafficking and violent crime throughout the Americas.",
      "The Trump administration has also claimed some of the drug cartels are controlled by Maduro. Mr. Trump said Tuesday that the U.S. would start doing strikes on land soon, though he didn't specify where and said attacks might occur in countries besides Venezuela, suggesting Colombia could see military strikes.",
      "\"You know, the land is much easier, much easier. And we know the routes they take,\" Mr. Trump said to reporters as he met with his Cabinet at the White House. \"We know everything about them We know where they live. We know where the bad ones live. And we're going to start that very soon too.\"",
      "Later, when asked to elaborate, the president said he was speaking about countries that are manufacturing and selling fentanyl or cocaine. The president said he heard that Colombia is manufacturing cocaine and selling it to the U.S.",
      "Colombia, indeed, is the world's top cocaine producer.",
      "\"Anybody that's doing that and selling it into our country is subject to attack,\" Mr. Trump said. He added a few moments later: \"Not just Venezuela.\"",
      "Tuesday's Cabinet meeting came amid calls for investigations and\u00a0bipartisan concerns in Congress\u00a0that a\u00a0follow-up strike on an alleged drug boat\u00a0may have constituted a war crime.",
      "As tensions continue to escalate between the two countries,\u00a0Pope Leo XVI\u00a0on Tuesday called for the U.S. to pursue dialogue and even economic pressure on Venezuela to achieve its goals, rather than threats of military action.",

      "\"The voices coming from the United States change, with a certain frequency at times,\" he said. \"On the one hand, it seems there was telephone conversation between the two presidents, on the other, there's this danger, this possibility of an activity, an operation including invading the territory of Venezuela.\"",
      "He stressed that he didn't have further information. \"Again I believe it's better to look for ways of dialogue, perhaps pressure \u2014 including economic pressure \u2014 \u00a0but looking for other ways to change, if that's what the United States wants to do.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Rep. Anna Paulina Luna on Tuesday followed through on a monthslong threat to try to force a vote on a bipartisan bill that would ban members of Congress from trading individual stocks.",
      "Luna, a Florida Republican, introduced a discharge petition to circumvent House leaders and put the measure on the floor for a vote if it receives 218 signatures. The procedural maneuver has become a common tactic for rank-and-file lawmakers to try to force a vote on issues ignored by Republican leaders.",
      "The congresswoman had threatened to file a discharge petition if there wasn't movement on the Restore Trust in Congress Act by the end of September. But the push for a vote was stalled by the 43-day government shutdown that began on Oct. 1. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, kept the House out of session during the shutdown, putting all committee hearings and markups of legislation on hiatus.",
      "Dozens of House lawmakers across the political spectrum have coalesced behind the Restore Trust in Congress Act, which would prohibit members of Congress, their spouses and dependent children from owning or trading individual stocks. The compromise bill was introduced by Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas in September and has the support of more than 100 members, including progressives, conservatives and moderate Republicans and Democrats.",
      "But the bill is also facing bipartisan opposition, according to its cosponsors, who spoke to reporters ahead of a Nov. 19 hearing before the House Administration Committee about congressional stock trading.",
      "\"There are members in both parties who do not want this to happen, who are in the ear of leadership, who are trying to stop this from happening,\" Democratic Rep. Seth Magaziner of Rhode Island said.",
      "Under a 13-year-old law known as the STOCK Act, members of Congress, executive branch officials and other federal employees are prohibited from using nonpublic information for their financial benefit. The law also requires officials to disclose stock trades exceeding $1,000 within 45 days.",
      "Critics say the law needs reforms to require more transparency to ensure public officials are not using their positions for personal gain.",
      "\"This body has been enriching itself on the taxpayers' dime for too dadgum long, and it's got to stop,\" Republican Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee told reporters. \"We're in committee meetings. We hear things before y'all do. We can make those connections.\"",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. military's early September strike on an alleged Venezuelan drug boat \u2014 the first salvo in a months-long string of attacks \u2014 has drawn new scrutiny in recent days, as the White House confirmed that the vessel was struck twice.",
      "The confirmation followed a Washington Post report that the first boat was struck a second time, killing a pair of survivors \u2014 prompting calls for investigations and concerns in Congress that the follow-up strike may have constituted a war crime. A\u00a0Pentagon manual on the law of war says combatants that are \"wounded, sick, or shipwrecked\" no longer pose a threat and should not be attacked.",
      "The Trump administration has defended the series of boat strikes, casting them as a necessary tactic to stem the flow of narcotics from South America. But U.S. officials have not provided specific evidence that the vessels were smuggling drugs or posed a threat to the U.S. Some lawmakers from both parties have questioned the\u00a0 legality of the strikes.",
      "Here's what we know about the Sept. 2 strike and what the administration has said:",
      "Sept. 2: Trump says military \"shot out a boat\"",
      "President Trump announces to reporters during a Sept. 2 event that the U.S. had \"literally shot out a boat\" from Venezuela that he alleged was carrying drugs earlier in the day.",
      "In social media posts later that day, Mr. Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio described the attack in further detail, and referred to it as a single strike.",
      "The president said on Truth Social that the strike had killed 11 alleged members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang that his administration designated as a terrorist group earlier this year. Mr. Trump posted a 29-second video that showed one strike on a boat.",
      "Mr. Trump said the boat was headed to the U.S., but Rubio said later in the day that the drugs were \"probably headed to Trinidad or some other country in the Caribbean.\"",
      "The following day, Rubio stated that it was \"headed towards, eventually, the United States.\"",
      "Sept. 3: Hegseth says he \"watched it live\"",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth pushes back on a Venezuelan official's claim that the video of the Sept. 2 strike may have been fake, telling \"Fox and Friends\" the following morning: \"I watched it live. We knew exactly who was in that boat. We knew exactly what they were doing.\"",
      "Sept. 4: U.S. had \"absolute and complete authority\" to hit boat, Hegseth says",
      "Asked by CBS News what legal authority the Pentagon cited to strike the boat, Hegseth says: \"We have the absolute and complete authority to conduct that.\" He called the importation of drugs to the U.S. an \"assault on the American people.\"",
      "Separately, the White House told Congress on Sept. 4 that it believes the strike was \"consistent with [the president's] responsibility to protect Americans and United States interests abroad and in furtherance of United States national security and foreign policy interests,\" according to a notification later obtained by CBS News.",
      "Sept. 11: Boat was allegedly turning around",
      "The New York Times and CBS News report the boat appeared to be turning around when it was hit. A source familiar with the matter told CBS News that the individuals onboard the boat saw a military aircraft overhead and attempted to turn back before the U.S. hit the boat.",
      "White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement, \"The President acted in line with the laws of armed conflict to protect our country from those trying to bring poison to our shores.\"",
      "Sept. 15: Another boat is hit",
      "Mr. Trump announces another strike against an alleged drug-carrying boat in the Caribbean, killing three \"male terrorists.\"",
      "The administration later said the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels in a message to Congress justifying the Sept. 15 strike that was viewed by CBS News. It called the three individuals killed in the second strike \"unlawful combatants.\"",
      "In total, the U.S. has struck more than 20 boats between early September and mid-November, killing more than 80 people.",
      "Oct. 16: Key admiral announces retirement",
      "Hegseth announces that Adm. Alvin Holsey will retire as commander of U.S. Southern Command at year's end. Holsey was one year into his tenure overseeing the region where the boat strikes took place. Typically, combatant commanders serve for three years on average.",
      "Separately, CBS News reported that two people survived a strike on a boat in the Caribbean on Oct. 16. Mr. Trump later said the survivors would be returned to their countries of origin. The two, from Ecuador and Colombia, were repatriated within a few days of the strike.",
      "Nov. 28: Report says the first strike left survivors who were then killed in second attack",
      "The Washington Post reports that the Sept. 2 strike left two survivors, who clung to the boat's wreckage before dying in a follow-on attack. The Post reported that the second strike was conducted because Hegseth ordered everybody to be killed.",
      "Hegseth called the reporting \"fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory.\"",
      "\"The declared intent is to stop lethal drugs, destroy narco-boats, and kill the narco-terrorists who are poisoning the American people,\" Hegseth wrote on X. \"Every trafficker we kill is affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization.\"",
      "He also defended the strikes' legality once again.",
      "In response, the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee said in a joint statement on Nov. 28 that they would conduct \"vigorous oversight to determine the facts related to these circumstances.\" Similarly, the leaders of the House Armed Services Committee released a statement promising to gather a full accounting of the operation.",
      "Nov. 30: Senator says it may rise \"to the level of a war crime\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia says on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that the reported follow-on strike \"rises to the level of a war crime if it's true,\" pointing to international and domestic laws on attacks against wounded combatants.",
      "Rep. Mike Turner, a Republican from Ohio who serves on the House Armed Services Committee, expresses similar concerns, saying, \"Obviously, if that occurred, that would be very serious, and I agree that \u2026 would be an illegal act.\"",
      "Nov. 30: Trump responds",
      "On Air Force One, the president tells reporters he \"wouldn't have wanted\" a second strike on the boat.",
      "He added that Hegseth said he didn't order a follow-on strike, and \"I believe him 100%.\"",
      "Dec. 1: Leavitt confirms a second strike",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirms that there was a follow-on strike, but denied that it was done at Hegseth's behest. She says Adm. Mitch Bradley, who led Joint Special Operations Command at the time of the operation, was authorized by Hegseth to conduct strikes.",
      "A reporter asked Leavitt: \"Does the administration deny that that second strike happened, or did it happen and the administration denies that Secretary Hegseth gave the order?\"",
      "She responded: \"The latter is true.\"",
      "Leavitt then read a prepared statement: \"President Trump and Secretary Hegseth have made it clear that presidentially designated narcoterrorist groups are subject to lethal targeting in accordance with the laws of war. With respect to the strikes in question on Sept. 2, Secretary Hegseth authorized Admiral Bradley to conduct these kinetic strikes. Admiral Bradley worked well within his authority and the law, directing the engagement to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the United States of America was eliminated.\"",
      "Leavitt later told CBS News senior White House correspondent Weijia Jiang that she \"would reject\" that Hegseth ever said that everyone in the boat on Sept. 2 should be killed.",
      "Dec. 1: Senate Armed Services chair says he expects to obtain all the audio and video from the strikes",
      "GOP Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, tells reporters that he has spoken with Hegseth and Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and he plans to talk with the admiral who led the operation. He said Hegseth \"did indicate\" that \"there was a second attack.\"",
      "But Wicker told reporters he did not have information on survivors who may have been killed. He said he expects to receive that information because \"we're going to have all of the audio and all of the video.\"",
      "Dec. 2: Hegseth says he didn't watch second strike and didn't see any survivors",
      "During a Cabinet meeting, Hegseth tells reporters he watched the first boat strike on Sept. 2 live, but had \"moved on to my next meeting\" before the boat was hit a second time.",
      "\"I watched that first strike live,\" Hegseth said. \"As you can imagine, at the Department of War, we've got a lot of things to do. So I didn't stick around for the hour, two hours, whatever, where all the sensitive site exploitation digitally occurs.\"",
      "He said he later learned that Bradley chose to \"sink the boat and eliminate the threat,\" which Hegseth said was the right decision.",
      "Hegseth also said he did not \"personally see survivors\" following the first strike \"because the thing was on fire,\" calling the situation the \"fog of war.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump said he \"didn't know about the second strike\" when asked about his comment over the weekend that he wouldn't have wanted a follow-on attack.",
      "\"To me, it was an attack. It wasn't one strike, two strikes, three strikes,\" the president said.",
      "Earlier in the meeting, Hegseth defended the administration's strategy of striking vessels, saying, \"We've only just begun striking narco-boats and putting narco-terrorists at the bottom of the ocean.\"",

    "summary": "Daniel Richman, a friend of ex-FBI Director James Comey, is taking legal action against DOJ over files investigators seized from him more than five years ago.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A friend and former lawyer for ex-FBI Director James Comey is taking legal action against the Justice Department over material that investigators seized from him more than five years ago and is asking a federal court to block the government from using the files in any way.",
      "The bid from Daniel Richman, a law professor at Columbia University, comes as federal prosecutors weigh whether to seek a new indictment against Comey, related to testimony he gave to Congress in the fall of 2020. The criminal case against the ex-FBI chief that was brought in late September was dismissed last week when a judge found Lindsey Halligan, the prosecutor who secured the indictment, was unlawfully appointed interim U.S. attorney.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi and the White House said that decision would be appealed, but prosecutors have yet to formally notify the court that they will ask the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit to review the ruling. The Justice Department could also try to bring new charges against Comey, but that may come with its own risks.",
      "The material at issue was seized by the FBI in 2019 and 2020 and includes information from Richman's hard drive, two email accounts and an Apple iCloud account. Investigators obtained search warrants for the device and accounts as part of a probe called \"Arctic Haze,\" which examined a potential leak of sensitive information and was closed in 2021 without any charges being filed.",
      "But a magistrate judge overseeing one aspect of Comey's criminal case revealed new details about the warrants for Richman's devices and the Justice Department's handling of his files as it investigated the former FBI director.",
      "The judge, William Fitzpatrick, found that the government likely seized material outside the scope of the original warrants, held onto that information for years after the Arctic Haze investigation was closed, and then conducted a new search of Richman's files in September.",
      "Fitzpatrick wrote in a decision that the government was left \"unchecked to rummage through all of the information seized\" from Richman as part of its investigation into Comey and believed it could do so \"again anytime they choose.\" The judge suggested that federal investigators should have obtained a new warrant for the search of Richman's material in September, but noted that the parameters likely would have been narrower in scope than the original warrants for his device and accounts.",
      "Fitzpatrick also wrote that the materials seized from Richman were the \"cornerstone\" of Halligan's presentation to the grand jury, which went on to indict Comey on two criminal counts.",
      "Pointing to the judge's findings, lawyers for Richman argued his Fourth Amendment rights were violated, and he asked the U.S. district court in Washington, D.C., to order the immediate return of the files and block the government from using the \"improperly seized or retained materials\" any further.",
      "Richman's civil suit was first reported by Anna Bower of Lawfare.",
      "\"The government's conduct has deprived Professor Richman of his constitutional rights, and the injury to Professor Richman will continue if his property is not returned,\" they wrote.",
      "Richman's legal team argued that the files taken by investigators in connection with the 2019 and 2020 warrants, as well as the search earlier this year, were illegally seized, so the government cannot hold onto them.",
      "\"The government's over-seizure and retention of Professor Richman's Files and the 2025 warrantless search constitute, at a minimum, 'callous disregard for [his] rights,'\" they wrote.",
      "Richman's lawyers said investigators' decision to search his files in connection with their investigation into Comey, when they had been retained by the government for four years, \"exemplifies precisely the governmental abuse against which the Fourth Amendment was designed to protect.\"",
      "They asked the court to issue a temporary order that would prevent the government from using or relying on \"in any way\" his seized material while it considers whether his constitutional rights were violated.",

      "Lakanwal appeared virtually from a D.C. hospital, where he remains after being shot by law enforcement after allegedly shooting the two National Guard members, Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom and Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe. Beckstrom, 20, died of her injuries, and Wolfe remains hospitalized in critical condition.",
      "The magistrate judge overseeing Tuesday's initial appearance said that the government's case was \"exceedingly strong.\"",
      "According to charging documents in District of Columbia Superior Court, Lakanwal allegedly yelled \"Allahu Akbar!\" as he fired his gun at Beckstrom and Wolfe. The phrase is Arabic for God is great. According to the documents, another National Guard member fired a service weapon and hit Lakanwal as he was reloading his gun. Lakanwal was also charged with possession of a firearm during a crime of violence.",
      "Security footage from the scene of the shooting cited in the charges shows Lakanwal standing near a popular subway stop located near the scene of the shooting, before \"running in the direction of the intersection\" where Wolfe and Beckstrom were walking.",
      "After striking both guard members with his initial rounds of shots, prosecutors allege that Lakanwal attempted to chase and shoot at another National Guard member nearby. In one screenshot of security footage, prosecutors allege that Lakanwal bent down next to Beckstrom and Wolfe after shooting them.",
      "Last week, D.C. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro said that Lakanwal would be charged with additional crimes as the case proceeds: \"There will be no stone left unturned.\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said that she is considering seeking the death penalty for Lakanwal.",
      "After the shooting, sources told CBS News that Lakanwal served on a CIA-backed operations team for about eight years and said that he suffered from PTSD.",
      "He and his family fled Taliban threats in Afghanistan and were brought into the United States in 2021, and his asylum case was approved earlier this year. Over the weekend, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem suggested he could have \"radicalized\" after coming to the U.S. Emails obtained by CBS News also indicate that Lakanwal's mental health had deteriorated in recent years and that he had become isolated and detached from his family.",
      "The Trump administration has cited the attack as reason to further expand its ongoing immigration crackdown, halting all visa and immigration processing for Afghan nationals, and ordering a review of green card cases for immigrants from 19 countries.",

      "That proclamation, referred to as a travel ban by supporters and critics alike, imposed a near-total restriction on the entry of people from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. It also partially suspended the entry of travelers and immigrants from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.",

      "Washington \u2014 GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York lashed out at House Speaker Mike Johnson, accusing him of blocking a provision that would require the FBI to notify Congress when it opens counterintelligence investigations into candidates running for federal office.",
      "Stefanik, who is a member of Johnson's leadership team, said Monday she would vote against the National Defense Authorization Act if it does not include her provision. The House could vote on the annual defense policy bill as soon as next week.",
      "In a social media post, Stefanik said Johnson is \"getting rolled\" by House Democrats who oppose the provision.",
      "\"Unless this provision is added back into the bill to prevent illegal political weaponization of the intelligence community in our elections, I am a HARD NO. I have always voted in support of the defense and intelligence authorization bills, but no more,\" she wrote.",
      "She continued to express her anger in a Tuesday post, blaming Johnson for \"blocking my provision.\"",
      "\"This is an easy one. This bill is DOA unless this provision gets added in as it was passed out of committee,\" she said.",
      "Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, claimed ignorance of the situation and said her version of the story was \"false.\"",

      "He said he told Stefanik over text, \"What are you talking about? This hasn't even made it to my level.\"",
      "The House speaker told reporters that the bipartisan leaders of the House and Senate Judiciary committees, which he believed had jurisdiction over the issue, had not agreed to include it in the defense bill.",

      "\"Just more lies from the Speaker,\" she said. \"This is his preferred tactic to tell Members when he gets caught torpedoing the Republican agenda.\"",
      "It's unclear if Stefanik's opposition to the defense bill will doom its passage in the House, where Republicans have a narrow majority. The bill has passed every year for more than six decades with bipartisan support.",

      "Republican nominee Matt Van Epps, a combat veteran, and Democrat Aftyn Behn, a Tennessee state representative, are vying for the seat in Tennessee's 7th Congressional District to replace former GOP Rep. Mark Green, who resigned in July. Green had represented the district, which stretches from parts of Nashville to the state's borders with Kentucky and Alabama and includes many rural counties, since 2019. He won his most recent race by more than 20 points.",
      "Though the election would normally be considered a safe win for Republicans, polling has shown a closer-than-expected race in The Volunteer State, including some that outline a single-digit race. Meanwhile, millions of dollars in outside spending have poured in, while top figures in both parties have stumped for the candidates in recent days.",
      "Still, a Democratic victory in the deep-red Tennessee district would be an uphill climb. But onlookers will be watching to see whether the race comes within a single-digit margin as a possible harbinger of what's to come in next year's elections.",

      "The outcome of Tuesday's special election will all but certainly be viewed as an indicator for what's to come in next year's midterm elections, as Democrats tout a string of recent victories.",
      "Traditional political wisdom dictates that the party that controls the White House often loses ground in midterm elections. And the Tennessee special election follows overperformance by Democrats in special elections in September, along with a sweep across key races in November's elections that the party has pointed to as evidence of a changing tide among the electorate after bruising 2024 elections for the party.",
      "In last month's races, Democrats Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill handily won their gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey, while in New York City, democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani prevailed in his race for mayor.",

      "A special election with national attention",
      "Tuesday's special election has drawn national interest, with millions of dollars in outside spending, along with visits and phone rallies held by high-ranking members of both parties, who have poured into the district in recent days to support the candidates.",

      "At one point, Johnson phoned a \"friend,\" who turned out to be the president. \"We have to win this seat,\" Mr. Trump told the crowd.",
      "\"Let's make it a sweeping victory. The whole world is watching Tennessee right now and they're watching your district,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's a big vote, it's got to show something, and it's got to show that the Republican party is stronger than it's ever been.\"",
      "Former Vice President Al Gore, who represented Tennessee in Congress, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez were among Democrats who spoke at a phone rally for Behn on Monday. Gore said during November's elections, \"bipartisan and independent voters served notice, with massive landslides, that they're sick and tired of Trump's madness and cruelty.\"",
      "\"So it's no wonder that the president's begun to panic about tomorrow's election here in Tennessee,\" Gore said. \"The stage is set, and I do believe that Tennesseans are determined to claw back decency, self respect and common sense from the most corrupt and dangerous president in American history.\"",

      "Medication-delivering drones and telehealth at local libraries are among the ideas state leaders revealed in November for spending their share of a $50 billion federal rural health program.",
      "The Trump administration, which has promised \"radical transparency,\" said in an FAQ that it plans to publish the \"project summary\" for states that win awards. Following the lead of federal regulators, many states are withholding their complete applications, and some have refused to release any details.",
      "\"Let's be clear,\" said Alan Morgan, chief executive of the National Rural Health Association. \"The hospital CEOs, the clinic administrators, the community leaders: They're going to want to know what their states are doing.\" The NRHA's members include struggling rural hospitals and clinics, which federal lawmakers promised would benefit from the Trump administration's Rural Health Transformation Program.",
      "Morgan said his members are interested in what states propose, which of their ideas are approved or rejected, and their budget narratives, which detail how the money could be spent.",
      "Improving rural health care is an \"insanely complicated and difficult task,\" Morgan said.",
      "The five-year Rural Health Transformation Program was approved by Congress in a law \u2014 the One Big Beautiful Bill Act \u2014 that also drastically cuts Medicaid spending, on which rural providers heavily depend. It's being watched closely because it's a much-needed influx of funds \u2014 with a caveat from the Trump administration that the money be spent on transformational ideas, not just to prop up ailing rural hospitals.",
      "The law says half of the $50 billion will be divided equally among all states with an approved application. The rest will be distributed through a points-based system. Of the second half, $12.5 billion will be allotted based on each state's rurality. The remaining $12.5 billion will go to states that score well on initiatives and policies that, in part, mirror the Trump administration's \"Make America Healthy Again\" objectives.",

      "\"We're working to make this the most transparent HHS in its 70-year history,\" Kennedy said in written testimony to lawmakers in September.",
      "Lawrence Gostin, a professor of public health law at Georgetown University, said HHS is \"acting in a way that utterly lacks transparency\" and that the public has the right to demand \"greater openness and clarity.\" Without transparency, the public cannot hold HHS accountable, he said.",
      "Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services spokesperson Catherine Howden said the agency will follow the federal regulations governing competitive grant materials when releasing information about the rural health program.",
      "Grant applications are \"not released to the public during the merit review process,\" Howden said, adding, \"The purpose of this policy is to protect the integrity of evaluations, applicant confidentiality, and the competitive nature of the process.\"",
      "Democrats and many health care advocates are concerned politics will affect how much money states get.",
      "\"I am very concerned about retaliation,\" said Rep. Nikki Budzinski (D-Ill.). Because Democrats control her state's politics, \"our application might not be as seriously considered as other states that have Republican leadership,\" she added.",

      "Howard directs the university's State Health and Value Strategies program, which is tracking the rural health fund, and praised most states for publicly posting their project summaries.",
      "\"To me, it speaks to the intense interest in this program,\" Howard said. Her team, reviewing about two dozen state summaries, found themes including expansion of home-based and mobile services, increased use of technology, and workforce development initiatives like scholarships, signing bonuses, and child care assistance for high-demand positions.",
      "\"I think it's exciting,\" Howard said. \"What's great here is the experimentation we're going to learn from.\"",
      "Telerobotics appeared in Georgia's and Alabama's applications, she said, including a proposal to use robotic equipment for remote ultrasounds.",
      "Another theme that \"warms my heart,\" Howard said, was the effort among states to create advisory groups or committees, including in Idaho, where work groups are expected to focus on technology, workforce development, tribal collaboration, and behavioral health.",
      "All 50 states submitted applications to federal regulators by the Nov. 5 deadline and awards will be announced by the end of the year, according to CMS.",
      "As of late November, nearly 40 states had released their project narrative, the main part of the application, which describes proposed initiatives, according to KFF Health News tracking. More than a dozen states have also released their budget narratives.",
      "A handful of states \u2014 Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Carolina, and Wyoming \u2014 released all parts of the application.",

      "The rural health program is part of the July law projected to reduce federal Medicaid spending in rural areas by $137 billion over 10 years.",
      "Those cuts are expected to affect rural health facilities' bottom lines, threatening their ability to stay open. A recent Commonwealth Fund report found that rural areas continue to lack access to primary care. But the guidelines for the rural health program say states can use only 15% of their new funding to pay providers for patient care.",
      "Between the Medicaid cuts and funding boost from the new program, \"there's real opportunity for national policy to impact rural, both in the negative and the positive potentially,\" said Celli Horstman, a senior research associate at the New York-based policy think tank who co-authored the report.",
      "Among the publicly available rural health transformation proposals, Democratic-leaning states show support, or are willing to adopt, some of the administration's goals but will lose out on points from eschewing others.",
      "For example, New Mexico said it would introduce legislation requiring students to take the Presidential Fitness Test and physicians to complete continuing education courses on nutrition. But it won't prevent people from using their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits to buy \"non-nutritious\" foods such as soda and candy.",
      "Many states want to invest in technology, including telehealth, cybersecurity, and remote patient monitoring equipment. Other themes include increasing access to healthy food, improving emergency services, preventing and managing chronic illnesses, and enlisting community health workers and paramedics for home visits.",
      "Specific proposals include:",
      "Arkansas wants to spend $5 million through its \"FAITH\" program \u2014 Faith-based Access, Interventions, Transportation, & Health \u2014 to enlist rural religious institutions to host education and preventive screening events.

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Monday afternoon was expected to confer with his top deputies on the next steps for U.S. operations in Venezuela, according to a senior military official and two sources familiar with the upcoming White House meeting.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth were scheduled to attend what sources described as a decisional meeting regarding the next steps in the escalating pressure campaign against the Maduro regime.",
      "Mr. Trump said recently he's spoken with Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, while the U.S. president has also built up a significant military force in the region as a part of what he's described as an anti-drug campaign against the cartels his administration has designated as terror groups. The State Department has designated Maduro himself as a terrorist.",
      "CNN was first to report the meeting, which comes amid the president's looming threats of military action on land and intensifying scrutiny by lawmakers over the Pentagon's lethal strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed Monday that the president would meet with his national security team on Venezuela and \"on many matters.\" Details on the planned meeting have not emerged.",
      "The Washington Post reported Friday that Hegseth gave a verbal order to leave no survivors in the first U.S. strike on a suspected drug smuggling boat in the Caribbean. The U.S. attack on the vessel was announced by Mr. Trump on Sept. 2. The Post reported that the initial strike left two survivors in the water, and the commander of the operation then ordered a second strike to comply with Hegseth's directive, killing the survivors.",
      "A working group of former judge advocates general said that if this is true, it would constitute \"war crimes, murder, or both.\" The group pointed to the Geneva Conventions, which says that members of armed forces who are out of the fight because of \"sickness, wounds, detention, or any other cause, shall in all circumstances be treated humanely,\" and acts including \"violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds\" are banned. The U.S. military has killed at least 80 people in boat strikes in the Caribbean and the Pacific in \"Operation Southern Spear,\" which it says is targeting narco-terrorists.",
      "The JAG group called on Congress to probe any use of the military involving \"the intentional targeting of anyone \u2013 enemy combatants, non-combatants, or civilians \u2013 rendered hors de combat (\"out of the fight\") as a result of their wounds or the destruction of the ship or aircraft carrying them.\"",
      "On Sunday, Mr. Trump told reporters he \"wouldn't have wanted\" a reported second strike on an alleged drug boat earlier this year, while pledging to look into the incident.",
      "\"The first strike was very lethal, it was fine and if there were two people around,\" the president told reporters on Air Force One. \"But Pete said that didn't happen. I have great confidence in him.\"",
      "GOP Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota, who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, was also asked Monday evening about whether he has confidence in Hegseth and about the boat strike.",
      "\"The question will be based on the facts as we find them out,\" he responded. \"We're going to have some discussions within the committee. Until such times we know the full facts, we won't be making comment.\"",

Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and he plans to talk with the admiral who led the operation. He said that Hegseth \"did indicate\" that \"there was a second attack.\" But Wicker told reporters he did not have information on survivors who may have been killed, adding that he expects to receive that information because \"we're going to have all of the audio and all of the video.\"",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump warned that Venezuelan airspace should be considered closed, and Venezuela said the U.S. had unilaterally suspended its migrant repatriation flights and wants to \"undermine the sovereignty of its airspace.\"",
      "The Trump administration says it's aiming to stop drugs from being smuggled into the U.S., while Venezuela says Mr. Trump seeks Maduro's ouster. Over the past several weeks, the U.S. has moved a number of military ships to the western Atlantic and the Caribbean and reopened a naval base in Puerto Rico.",
      "On Sunday, Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said the reported U.S. follow-on strike on an alleged drug boat earlier this year \"rises to the level of a war crime if it's true.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff are meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Tuesday, a White House source confirmed, as Mr. Trump presses for an end to the fighting in Ukraine.",
      "The meeting comes after U.S. and Ukrainian officials held talks in Florida over the weekend. Witkoff has met with Putin before, as he has turned his focus toward Ukraine after he and Kushner helped broker the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters after Sunday's talks, \"I think that there's a good chance we can make a deal.\"",
      "The U.S. backed a peace proposal to end Russia's war on Ukraine last month, although much more work remains to be done. Putin has called U.S. proposals a \"set of issues put forward for discussion\" rather than a draft agreement. Last week, Mr. Trump said there were \"only a few remaining points of disagreement,\" after a U.S. official and Ukraine's national security adviser Rustem Umerov said a common understanding on a proposal had been reached, with details still to be worked out.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters over the weekend that the U.S.-backed plan, which was originally 28 points, has evolved, after some alleged it was heavily slanted toward Russia's priorities, with one provision calling for Ukraine to cede territory it currently controls to Russia.",
      "\"They're making concessions,\" Mr. Trump told reporters of the Russians. \"They're big concessions. They stop fighting, and they don't take any more land.\"",
      "Those two things aren't going to be seen as concessions to European leaders, who believe Russia should give back Ukrainian territory it has occupied. Ukraine has also pushed for security guarantees as part of any deal to end the war, though Russia has rejected the idea of Ukraine joining NATO, which would obligate the U.S. and other member states to come to its defense.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was in Florida for the talks with the Ukrainians over the weekend, called the conversations with the Ukrainians \"another very productive session\" but \"there are a lot of moving parts.\"",
      "\"We don't just want to end the war. We also want to help Ukraine be safe forever,\" he said. \"So never again will they face another invasion. And equally importantly, we want them to enter an age of true prosperity. It's about also the terms that set up Ukraine for long-term prosperity.\"",
      "On Sunday, Republican Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio voiced concerns that the White House approach could be too pro-Russia.",
      "Asked by CBS News' chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes whether he still has concerns about the plan being too pro-Russia, Turner, who sits on the House Armed Services Committee and formerly chaired the House Intelligence Committee, said \"I think we all have those concerns.\" But he added, \"one thing that I think everybody understands is that you can't have, you can't be America First and pro-Russia, because Russia is a self-declared adversary of the United States.\"",
      "Peace is far from a reality on the ground in Ukraine, as Russian missiles rained down again on Kyiv over the weekend, CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams reports from western Ukraine.",
      "Mr. Trump has offered high praise for Witkoff's negotiating skills and personable nature, and given him an increasingly large portfolio. The White House did not dispute a phone transcript published by Bloomberg last week in which Witkoff reportedly advised Yuri Ushakov, a top Putin official, on how Putin should approach Mr. Trump in peace negotiations.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The White House on Monday said a U.S. attack on an alleged drug boat in September included more than one strike on the vessel, seemingly confirming a Washington Post report that the U.S. targeted the boat for a second time to take out survivors of the initial attack.",
      "The Post reported on Friday that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave a verbal order to leave no survivors before the U.S. attack on a suspected drug-smuggling boat in the Caribbean on Sept. 2. The Post reported that the first strike left two men alive in the water. The paper said the commander of the operation, Adm. Frank Bradley, ordered a second strike to comply with Hegseth's directive, killing the two. CBS News has not independently confirmed the Washington Post's reporting.",
      "The report sparked calls for an investigation by lawmakers of both parties in Congress, some of whom raised the prospect that targeting the survivors could constitute a war crime. Hegseth has called the reporting \"fabricated, inflammatory and derogatory,\" claiming the operations in the Caribbean are \"lawful under both U.S. and international law.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked about the Post's report during the White House briefing on Monday. \"Does the administration deny that that second strike happened, or did it happen and the administration denies that Secretary Hegseth gave the order?\" a reporter asked.",
      "\"The latter is true,\" Leavitt replied, before reading out a written statement: \"President Trump and Secretary Hegseth have made it clear that presidentially designated narcoterrorist groups are subject to lethal targeting in accordance with the laws of war. With respect to the strikes in question on Sept. 2, Secretary Hegseth authorized Admiral Bradley to conduct these kinetic strikes. Admiral Bradley worked well within his authority and the law, directing the engagement to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the United States of America was eliminated.\"",
      "At another point, CBS News senior White House correspondent Weijia Jiang asked Leavitt: \"So was the initial order from Secretary Hegseth, 'everyone be killed,' and did that come from President Trump?\"",
      "\"I saw that quoted in a Washington Post story. I would reject that the secretary of war ever said that,\" Leavitt said. \"However, the president has made it quite clear that if narcoterrorists, again, are trafficking illegal drugs towards the United States, he has the authority to kill them. And that's what this administration is doing.\"",
      "Later on Monday, Hegseth wrote on social media that Bradley is \"an American hero, a true professional, and has my 100% support.\"",
      "\"I stand by him and the combat decisions he has made \u2014 on the September 2 mission and all others since,\" Hegseth said.",
      "President Trump said Sunday that he \"wouldn't have wanted\" the second strike but defended Hegseth's handling of the incident, saying the secretary told him he did not order the subsequent attack.",
      "\"The first strike was very lethal, it was fine,\" the president told reporters on Air Force One, saying he has \"great confidence\" in Hegseth.",
      "He added: \"I'm going to find out about it, but Pete said he did not order the death of those two men.\"",
      "A group of former military lawyers argued in an assessment on Saturday that the reported second strike would be a violation of international or domestic law. In Congress, the leaders of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees pledged to investigate the matter. And Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" Sunday that the strike \"rises to the level of a war crime if it's true,\" while GOP Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio agreed that it \"would be an illegal act\" if true.",
      "Former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, who served in the role from 2011-2013 under former President Barack Obama, said on \"CBS Evening News\" Monday that the reported second strike constitutes a war crime \"because these individuals were injured. They were in the water.\"",
      "\"The basic rules of war that are involved here make very clear that you do not strike wounded people in the water in order to kill them,\" Panetta said. \"You basically then are responsible to try to make sure you do everything to try protect their lives at that point. And that the concern right now whether or not this really violated the rules of war and constituted a criminal act.\"",
      "On Monday, GOP Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told reporters that he has spoken with Hegseth and Gen.

    "summary": "The shooting raised questions about whether the government missed any red flags about the alleged attacker, 29-year-old Afghan national Rahmanullah Lakanwal.",
    "story": [
      "The shooting of two National Guard soldiers in Washington, D.C., last week has sparked a national debate about U.S. immigration policy and whether the federal government missed any red flags about the alleged attacker, identified by authorities as 29-year-old Afghan national Rahmanullah Lakanwal.",
      "The Trump administration has cited the attack, which killed one of the soldiers, to further expand its government-wide immigration crackdown. The administration has halted all visa and immigration processing for Afghan nationals, ordered a review of green card cases for immigrants from 19 countries and frozen all asylum case decisions.",
      "Lakanwal's exact motives remain unclear. Over the weekend, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem suggested he could have \"radicalized\" after coming to the U.S. Emails obtained by CBS News also indicate that Lakanwal's mental health deteriorated in recent years, and that he became isolated and detached from his family.",
      "Trump administration officials have blamed the Biden administration for allowing Lakanwal to enter the U.S. in 2021, while critics of President Trump have faulted his government for approving his asylum case earlier this year. But a review of Lakanwal's immigration case, based on conversations with U.S. officials and other official sources, shows there were several opportunities for federal authorities, under both administrations, to vet Lakanwal and identify any potentially concerning information.",
      "This is what we know about the immigration process Lakanwal underwent to enter the U.S. and to try to remain here permanently.",
      "September 2021: Lakanwal arrives in the U.S.",
      "Lakanwal entered the U.S. in September 2021 as part of \"Operation Allies Welcome,\" the Biden administration's effort to resettle tens of thousands of Afghan evacuees airlifted from Kabul following the chaotic American military withdrawal and Taliban takeover of Afghanistan.",
      "U.S. officials familiar with his case told CBS News that Lakanwal was granted humanitarian parole. Government statistics show parole was offered to more than 77,000 evacuees so they could live and work in the country legally for two-year increments. Parole was designed to be a stopgap measure while the evacuees applied for permanent forms of legal status, such as asylum or Special Immigrant Visas for those who assisted the American war effort.",
      "All Afghan evacuees were supposed to undergo an initial round of vetting at military bases in Italy, Germany, Qatar, Spain and the United Arab Emirates before being allowed to enter the U.S. Those who raised security concerns were sent to Kosovo. After arriving in the U.S., many evacuees were housed in American military bases in several states before settling in communities throughout the country.",
      "At the time, Republican lawmakers in Congress raised concerns about the vetting process undertaken by the Biden administration during the Afghan resettlement effort. A 2022 report by the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General said the screening process encountered several obstacles and that some federal officials \"did not always have critical data\" to properly vet the evacuees.",
      "December 2024: Lakanwal requests asylum",
      "Lakanwal applied for asylum with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in December 2024, arguing he would face persecution if returned to Afghanistan, according to U.S. officials who requested anonymity to discuss internal government information.",
      "His application would have been another opportunity for the U.S. government to vet his case. USCIS generally requires asylum applicants to show up to in-person interviews at one of its offices across the country.",
      "A DHS official told CBS News the USCIS asylum vetting process generally involves the collection of biometrics, a review of social media activity, FBI background checks and other screenings. The process also includes an inquiry into whether the applicant can prove he or she would face persecution if deported because of one of five factors: their race, nationality, religion, political opinion or membership in a \"particular social group.\"",
      "In recent years, USCIS has been prioritizing Afghan asylum claims, processing them faster than the cases of other nationalities due to a Biden-era federal court settlement. The vast majority of Afghan asylum cases are approved. Government data shows 20,354 \u2014 96% \u2014 of 21,201 Afghan asylum requests decided by USCIS since the summer of 2021 were granted. Only 120 cases were denied during that time.",
      "Two U.S. officials and an ex-Afghan military official told CBS News that Lakanwal was part of a \"Zero Unit,\" one of a number of CIA-backed forces in the former Afghan government's military and intelligence apparatus that gained infamy for their secrecy and alleged brutality. That work could have made him a target for reprisals by the Taliban.",
      "April 2025: Lakanwal is granted asylum",
      "USCIS approved Lakanwal's asylum application in April 2025, granting him \u2014 and any derivative immediate relatives \u2014 asylee status, U.S. officials told CBS News.",
      "While a grant of asylum is a determination that the applicant meets the legal definition of a refugee, it does not immediately bestow permanent legal status to the beneficiary. Asylees have to submit another application to request a green card, or lawful permanent resident status, which they can receive no sooner than one year after the grant of asylum. Two U.S. officials told CBS News that Lakanwal filed that application, known as an adjustment of status request, and that it was pending at the time of the attack.",
      "U.S. law allows the government to terminate someone's asylum status in certain circumstances, including when asylees commit serious crimes or fraud. A DHS official told CBS News that process requires USCIS to notify the asylee of the intent to terminate the status.",
      "Those whose asylum status is revoked are placed in deportation proceedings before federal immigration judges, who are overseen by the Justice Department. In Lakanwal's case, that process would likely not be finalized until after the adjudication of the criminal charges he faces because of last week's shooting.",

      "FBI Director Kash Patel's travel to watch his girlfriend sing at a Pennsylvania sporting event is now being investigated by the top Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee.",
      "Citing a series of recent media reports, the committee Democrats allege Patel has used the FBI's Gulfstream passenger jet for a series of recent flights for a \"date night\" in Tennessee and an outing with friends in Texas.",
      "The panel's Democrats have asked Patel to respond with travel records, passenger information and any communication with passengers about the recent flights.",
      "Rep. Jamie Raskin, the Maryland Democrat who is the Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee, and another committee member, Democratic Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove of California, wrote to the FBI to ask about Patel's Oct. 25 flight to Pennsylvania.",
      "\"You flew there because your girlfriend was performing at a wrestling match on the campus of Pennsylvania State University,\" the Democrats wrote in the letter. \"After attending her performance, you used the government's jet to fly with her home to Nashville the following day. Your 'date night' had no apparent connections to your official duties.\"",
      "The inquiry also questioned a trip to Texas that was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.",
      "\"Later that weekend, you took the FBI jet to San Angelo, Texas, for four days, where Republican Party mega-donor Bubba Saulsbury hosted you at Boondoggle Ranch \u2014 'a scenic hunting resort' that touts itself as the ideal place to 'waste money or time on unnecessary or questionable projects,'\" Raskin and Kamlager-Dove wrote.",
      "The FBI did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "The Judiciary Committee Democrats said Patel's travel on the flights was revealed by public flight logs and social media posts by Patel's girlfriend.",
      "The Democrats' letter seeks Patel's travel records from the FBI by Dec. 15. But as minority party members of the panel, Raskin and Kamlager-Dove do not have the congressional subpoena power to require the records be handed over \u2014 they may only request them. Raskin and Kamlager-Dover wrote, \"These planes are not yours. They are the property of the U.S. Government and are paid for by the American people.\"",
      "In May, CBS News reported about questions surrounding Patel's use of the FBI aircraft, including a formal request by Senate Democrats for a Government Accountability Office review of Patel's travel.",
      "FBI directors are required by executive branch policy to use government aircraft for air travel, whether official or personal. That allows them to maintain access to secure communications wherever they travel and to move quickly in the event of an emergency. They must reimburse the government for personal flights at coach fare rates. Directors are permitted to take family or friends on personal trips, but the cost of their trips must be reimbursed to the government, as well.",
      "CBS News reporting in May found Patel also appears to have made use of the FBI's Gulfstream 5 jets to travel to Las Vegas, where he has a home, and to Nashville, where Patel's girlfriend, a country singer, lives. Sources familiar with Patel's travel confirmed to CBS News that the director was on the plane for several trips captured by public flight trackers, including a weekend jaunt to Las Vegas on March 7 and a weekend in Nashville on March 24.",

    "summary": "A federal appeals court on Monday upheld a lower court decision that disqualified Alina Habba as acting U.S. attorney in New Jersey.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court on Monday upheld a lower court decision that disqualified Alina Habba, who served as a personal lawyer to President Trump, as the acting U.S. attorney in New Jersey.",
      "The decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit was unanimous against the Trump administration, which has attempted to use a novel mechanism to place lawyers who have not received Senate approval into temporary U.S. attorney positions across the country.",
      "The case before the 3rd Circuit arose after three men facing criminal charges in New Jersey challenged the validity of Habba's appointment as a violation of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act and sought to have their indictments dismissed.",
      "U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann ruled in August that Habba has been serving without lawful authority since the beginning of July, when she was tapped to temporarily lead the U.S. Attorney's Office in New Jersey. Brann said she must be disqualified from participating in ongoing cases.",
      "The Justice Department appealed that decision to the 3rd Circuit, which is now the first federal appeals court to weigh in on the administration's scheme for installing certain U.S. attorneys.",
      "\"The court's decision affirms that U.S. Attorney Alina Habba is unlawfully and invalidly serving as the chief federal law enforcement officer in New Jersey, marking the first time an appellate court has ruled that President Trump cannot usurp longstanding statutory and constitutional processes to insert whomever he wants in these positions,\" lawyers Abbe Lowell, Gerry Krovatin and Norm Eisen said in a joint statement. \"We will continue to challenge President Trump's unlawful appointments of purported U.S. attorneys wherever appropriate.\"",
      "Lowell argued before the 3rd Circuit, and Krovatin represents one of the defendants.",
      "Thomas Mirigliano, a lawyer who represented a second defendant, said \"the panel issued a clear and carefully reasoned decision that recognizes the extraordinary power vested in U.S. attorneys and reinforces the limits Congress has set on who may occupy those positions. We appreciate the Court's thoughtful approach and the clarity it brings to this important issue.\"",
      "Neither Habba nor the Justice Department immediately responded to requests for comment.",
      "Habba was tapped to serve as interim U.S. attorney in New Jersey earlier this year, but her appointment to the role was limited to 120 days, unless the U.S. district court in New Jersey voted to extend her tenure or she was confirmed to the post by the Senate. Habba's nomination, however, was unlikely to win approval in the upper chamber, as New Jersey's two senators, Democrats Cory Booker and Andy Kim, opposed her nomination.",
      "Ahead of the 120-day deadline, the judges in New Jersey declined to allow Habba to continue serving as U.S. attorney and instead voted to install her deputy, Desiree Leigh Grace, to the position. But that decision was met with swift pushback from Attorney General Pam Bondi, who fired Grace.",
      "Then, Mr. Trump and top administration officials employed a multi-step maneuver to keep Habba in the role of U.S. attorney and get around the district court's decision. First, the president withdrew Habba's nomination for U.S. attorney in New Jersey. Then, Habba resigned as interim U.S. attorney. Bondi then appointed Habba as \"special attorney\" and to fill Grace's role as first assistant U.S. attorney. Finally, because the position as the New Jersey's top prosecutor was vacant, Habba was elevated to the role of acting U.S. attorney under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act.",
      "That law, also known as the Vacancies Act, limits the government employees who can temporarily fill the roughly 1,300 federal offices that require nomination by the president and confirmation by the Senate.",
      "In their decision, the judges on the 3rd Circuit found that the Trump administration's argument in support of Habba's role \"should raise a red flag,\" since it would allow the Justice Department to circumvent the Vacancies Act and effectively allow anyone to hold a U.S. attorney position indefinitely.",
      "\"Under the Government's delegation theory, Habba may avoid the gauntlet of presidential appointment and Senate confirmation and serve as the de facto U.S. Attorney indefinitely,\" Judge Michael Fisher wrote for the court. \"This view is so broad that it bypasses the constitutional [presidential appointment and Senate confirmation] process entirely. It also essentially eliminates the requirements of the FVRA and the U.S. Attorney-specific statute.\"",
      "Fisher was selected for the 3rd Circuit by President George W. Bush. He was joined in the decision by Judge L. Felipe Restrepo, appointed by President Barack Obama, and Judge D. Brooks Smith, tapped for the 3rd Circuit by Bush.",
      "The Trump administration has sought to install temporary U.S. attorneys in Nevada and Los Angeles using the mechanism it employed for Habba, but has faced resistance from the courts. The most high-profile of those decisions came last week, when a federal judge ordered the criminal charges against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James to be dismissed on the grounds that Lindsey Halligan, the interim U.S. attorney who secured their indictments, was unlawfully appointed to the role.",

    "story": [
      "Sick young ants release a smell to tell worker ants to destroy them to protect the colony from infection, scientists said Tuesday, adding that queens do not seem to commit this act of self-sacrifice.",
      "Many animals conceal illness for social reasons. For example, sick humans are known to risk infecting others so they can still go to the office \u2014 or the pub.",
      "Ant colonies, however, act as one \"super-organism\" which works to ensure the survival of all, similar to how infected cells in our bodies send out a \"find-me and eat-me\" signal, according to an Austria-led team of scientists.",
      "Ant nests are a \"perfect place for a disease outbreak to occur because there are thousands of ants crawling over each other,\" Erika Dawson, a behavioral ecologist at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria and lead author of a new study titled \"Altruistic disease signaling in ant colonies,\" told AFP.",
      "When adult worker ants get an illness that could spread through the colony, they leave the nest to die alone. Young ants, known as pupae, in contrast are still trapped inside a cocoon, making this kind of social distancing impossible.",
      "Scientists had already figured out that when these pupae are terminally ill, there is a chemical change that produces a particular smell. Adult worker ants then gather around, remove the cocoon, \"bite holes in the pupae and insert poison,\" Dawson said. The poison acts as a disinfectant, which kills both the colony-threatening pathogen and the pupae.",
      "For the new research, the scientists wanted to figure out whether the pupae \"were actively saying: 'hey, come and kill me,'\" Dawson said.",
      "\"Altruistic act\"",
      "First, the scientists extracted the smell from the sick pupae of a small black garden ant called Lasius neglectus. When they applied the smell to a healthy brood in the lab, the workers still destroyed them.",
      "Then, the team conducted an experiment showing that the sick pupae only produce the smell when worker ants are nearby, proving it is a deliberate signal for destruction.",
      "\"While it is a sacrifice \u2014 an altruistic act \u2014 it's also in their own interest, because it means that their genes are going to survive and be passed on to the next generation,\" Dawson said.",
      "However, there is one member of the nest that does not sacrifice itself. When queen pupae are infected inside their cocoons, they do not send out the smelly warning signal, the team found.",
      "\"Are they cheating the system?\" Dawson said the team asked themselves.",
      "However, they found that the \"queen pupae have much better immune systems than the worker pupae, and so they were able to fight off the infection \u2014 and that's why we think that they weren't signaling,\" she said.",
      "The study's authors note that sick queens face a conundrum.",
      "\"By alerting others to destroy them, queen pupae would risk losing potential future reproductive opportunities if they would survive infection,\" the authors write. \"On the other hand, by spreading their infection to their colony, they could incur high indirect fitness costs.\"",
      "Dawson hopes future research will investigate whether queen pupae sacrifice themselves when it becomes clear they will not beat their infection.",
      "The study was published in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "Scientists have previously studied\u00a0how ants communicate. A Stanford University study\u00a0published\u00a0in 2012 showed that harvester ants transmit information to determine how many ants to send to a particular food source. Researchers concluded that ants communicate in much the same way as data moves on the internet, dubbing it the \"anternet.\"",
      "Researchers have also previously concluded that other sick species practice social distancing \u2014\u00a0including guppies, bats and mandrills. Bees have been documented using tactics to prevent getting sick, including\u00a0kicking sick bees out of their hives\u00a0altogether.",

    "summary": "Researchers have documented 55 instances of \"mini lightning\" over two Martian years by eavesdropping on the whirling wind recorded by NASA's Perseverance rover.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists have detected what they believe to be lightning on Mars by eavesdropping on the whirling wind recorded by NASA's Perseverance rover.",
      "The crackling of electrical discharges was captured by a microphone on the rover, a French-led team reported Wednesday.",
      "The researchers documented 55 instances of \"mini lightning\" over two Martian years, primarily during dust storms and dust devils. Almost all occurred on the windiest Martian sols, or days, during dust storms and dust devils.",
      "Just inches in size, the electrical arcs occurred within 6 feet of the microphone perched atop the rover's tall mast, part of a system for examining Martian rocks via camera and lasers. Sparks from the electrical discharges \u2014 akin to static electricity here on Earth \u2014 are clearly audible amid the noisy wind gusts and dust particles smacking the microphone.",
      "Scientists have been looking for electrical activity and lightning at Mars for half a century, said the study's lead author Baptiste Chide, of the Institute for Research in Astrophysics and Planetology in Toulouse.",
      "\"It opens a completely new field of investigation for Mars science,\" Chide said, citing the possible chemical effects from electrical discharges. \"It's like finding a missing piece of the puzzle.\"",
      "The evidence is strong and persuasive, but it's based on a single instrument that was meant to record the rover zapping rocks with lasers, not lightning blasts, said Cardiff University's Daniel Mitchard, who was not involved in the study. What's more, he noted in an article accompanying the study in the journal Nature, the electrical discharges were heard \u2014 not seen.",
      "\"It really is a chance discovery to hear something else going on nearby, and everything points to this being Martian lightning,\" Mitchard said in an email. But until new instruments are sent to verify the findings, \"I think there will still be a debate from some scientists as to whether this really was lightning,\" he said.",
      "\"Like a thunderstorm on Earth, but barely visible with a naked eye\"",
      "Lightning has already been confirmed on Jupiter and Saturn, and Mars has long been suspected of having it too.",
      "To find it, Chide and his team analyzed 28 hours of Perseverance recordings, documenting episodes of \"mini lightning\" based on acoustic and electric signals.",
      "Electrical discharges generated by the fast-moving dust devils lasted just a few seconds, while those spawned by dust storms lingered as long as 30 minutes.",
      "\"It's like a thunderstorm on Earth, but barely visible with a naked eye and with plenty of faint zaps,\" Chide said in an email. He noted that the thin, carbon dioxide-rich Martian atmosphere absorbs much of the sound, making some of the zaps barely perceptible.",
      "Mars' atmosphere is more prone than Earth's to electrical discharging and sparking through contact among grains of dust and sand, according to Chide.",
      "\"The current evidence suggests it is extremely unlikely that the first person to walk on Mars could, as they plant a flag on the surface, be struck down by a bolt of lightning,\" Mitchard wrote in Nature. But the \"small and frequent static-like discharges could prove problematic for sensitive equipment.\"",
      "These aren't the first Mars sounds transmitted by Perseverance. Earthlings have listened in to the rover's wheels crunching over the Martian surface and the whirring blades of its no-longer-flying helicopter sidekick, Ingenuity.",
      "Perseverance has been scouring a dry river delta at Mars since 2021, collecting samples of rock for possible signs of ancient microscopic life.

      "Earlier this month, Blue Origin launched its second heavy-lift New Glenn rocket that put two small NASA satellites onto a long, looping course to Mars. The satellites are aiming to learn more about how the sun has slowly blown away the red planet's once-thick atmosphere.",
      "The NASA-sponsored payload, managed by the University of California, Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory, is made up of two small, low-budget satellites known as Blue and Gold that make up the heart of the ESCAPADE mission \u2014 Escape, Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers. Mars launch windows typically open every two years when Earth and the red planet reach favorable positions in their orbits to permit direct flights using current rockets. The next such window opens in 2026.",
      "Passing within 600 miles of Earth in November 2027, the ESCAPADE probes will make velocity-boosting gravity-assist flybys, augmented by onboard propulsion, to finally head for Mars. In all, the twin spacecraft will spend a full year in that initial kidney bean-shaped orbit out past the moon and back, and another 10 months in transit to Mars. The probes won't reach the red planet until September 2027.",
      "While the ESCAPADE mission is modest compared to Mars rovers and more sophisticated orbiters, the probes are designed to answer key questions about the evolution of the Martian atmosphere.",
      "Mars once had a global magnetic field like Earth's, but its molten core, which powered that field, mostly froze in place long ago, leaving only patchy, isolated remnants of that once-protective field in magnetized deposits.",

    "story": [
      "American astronomer-turned-medical physicist and now NASA astronaut Chris Williams joined two Russian cosmonauts aboard a Soyuz ferry ship Thursday for a Thanksgiving Day flight to the International Space Station.",
      "With commander Sergey Kud-Sverchkov at the controls of the Soyuz MS-28/74S spacecraft, flanked on his left by flight engineer Sergey Mikaev and on the right by Williams, the crew's Soyuz 2.1a booster roared to life at 4:27 a.m. Eastern and smoothly climbed away from the Russian-leased Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.",
      "Nine minutes and 45 seconds later, the Soyuz spacecraft was released from the booster's upper stage, its two solar wings unfolded and the crew set off in pursuit of the space station. Three hours later, they caught up with the orbital outpost and moved in for docking at the lab's Earth-facing Rassvet module at 7:34 a.m. Eastern.",
      "Williams, a former volunteer fire fighter and emergency medical technician who went on to earn a Ph.D. in astrophysics from MIT, was a board-certified medical physicist at Harvard Medical School when he was selected to join NASA's astronaut corps in 2021.",
      "He and flight engineer Mikaev were making their first space flight on Thursday, while Kud-Sverchkov is a seasoned veteran who logged 185 days aboard the space station in 2020-2021.",
      "\"It's a really great crew,\" Williams said in a NASA interview. \"Sergey and Sergey are both just absolutely wonderful people, really kind, super interested, super intellectually curious, which is really fun. Had a lot of really, really great discussions, just talking and talking about things.",
      "\"It's been been wonderful to both spend some time with them over in Star City, and also to be able to spend some time with them in Houston through our training.\"",
      "The Soyuz MS-28 crew is replacing Soyuz MS-27/73S commander Sergey  Ryzhikov, flight engineer Alexey Zubritsky and NASA astronaut Jonny Kim,  who were launched to the space station last April. They plan to return  to Earth on Dec. 9 to wrap up their eight-month stay on the ISS.",
      "Also  on hand to welcome Williams and his crewmates aboard the station: NASA  Crew 11 commander Zena Cardman, Michael Fincke, Japanese astronaut  Kimiya Yui and cosmonaut Oleg Platonov. They launched atop a SpaceX  Falcon 9 rocket last August and plan to come home in February or March,  after their replacements \u2014 Crew 12 \u2014 arrive.",
      "All 11 station  fliers planned to gather for a traditional welcome aboard video call to  mission managers and family back in Moscow before a safety briefing and  the start of familiarization with the space station's complex systems.",
      "Williams, an Eagle Scout with a private pilot's license, is a standout among super achievers.",
      "After  graduating from Stanford University with a bachelor's degree in  physics, he was doing radio astronomy research on the way to a  Ph.D. and, \"down the street from my house, there was a volunteer fire  department. And I was like, oh, that sounds like something that could be  kind of like fun and interesting to do.\"",
      "\"So I started  volunteering. Got trained as an EMT and a firefighter, and started just  sort of doing that on a volunteer basis. And I found that I really liked  it. I got a lot of satisfaction out of knowing that ... at the end of  the shift, I would have really made a very direct and immediate positive  impact on somebody's life.\"",
      "He kept that up throughout graduate  school. Then, as he was winding up his doctorate in astrophysics,  Williams said he ran into a doctor he knew at a party who told him there  was \"a big need for physicists in medicine, in particular, in radiation  oncology, where we use radiation to treat cancer.\"",
      "He talked with a few other people, including one who had been an astronomer before switching to medical physics, and \"I was struck by how much of what I knew and had learned as an astronomer would actually be useful and apply very directly to medicine.\"",
      "\"A lot of the math behind (medical) imaging is the exact same math that actually you use in a radio telescope to make an image,\" Williams said. \"It was kind of neat to see that image processing techniques that I'd used as (a radio astronomer) actually carried over pretty directly into medicine.\"",
      "At the time of his selection as an astronaut, Williams was on the staff at Harvard Medical School as a clinical physicist and researcher. He is the second member of the 2021 class of astronauts to fly in space, getting assigned to the Soyuz MS-28 mission shortly after finishing astronaut candidate training.",
      "He said the training for launch on a Russian spacecraft was difficult, primarily because of the travel required. He credited his wife, Aubrey, with keeping the family's life on an even keel throughout.",
      "As for what he looks forward to during his eight-month stay in space, Williams repeated a familiar theme.",
      "\"I've got a lot of different goals, but I think the biggest one, and the thing I'm most excited about, is to truly be able to put my training into practice and to do a really good job to push forward the science and research that we're doing on on the space station.\"",
      "\"I think it's incredibly important. I think it's incredibly interesting and incredibly inspiring, and I feel really lucky to have the opportunity to contribute to that.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/children-smartphones-increased-risk-of-health-problems-study/",
    "published": "Mon, 01 Dec 2025 19:16:23 -0500",
    "summary": "Children and adolescents who own smartphones by age 12 have higher risks of depression, poor sleep and obesity, according to a new study.",
    "story": [
      "Having a smartphone may be harmful for children younger than 12, according to a new study.",
      "The study published Monday in the peer-reviewed journal\u00a0Pediatrics\u00a0found that owning a smartphone during early adolescence is associated with increased risks of mental health issues and obesity. As far as psychological impacts, it pinpointed higher incidences of depression and insufficient sleep among children who owned smartphones by ages 12 or younger, compared with others kids without the devices.",
      "Researchers at Children's Hospital Philadelphia, the University of California at Berkeley, and Columbia University arrived at those conclusions after analyzing data from more than 10,000 adolescents around the United States who participated in the\u00a0Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study\u00a0(ABCD) between 2018 and 2020. That study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, describes itself as \"the largest long-term study of brain development and child health\" in the country.",
      "According to researchers, 63.6% of the ABCD study's participants owned a smartphone, and the median age they received them was at 11 years old. Using that data, the researchers determined that younger children had greater risks than older participants of poor sleep or obesity linked to smartphone ownership, with increasingly worse health outcomes reported for kids the younger they were when they received their first smartphone.",
      "\"We didn't even look at what the kids did on the phone,\" Ran Barzilay, the lead author of the study and a child psychiatrist with the Youth Suicide Prevention, Intervention and Research Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told CBS News. \"We basically asked one simple question: does the mere factor of having one's own smartphone at this age range have anything to do with health outcomes?\"",
      "The Pediatrics study also compared children who had obtained a smartphone by age 12 and children who had not, and found that one year later, those without smartphones were experiencing better mental health than those who had them.",
      "\"We did account for the fact that the kids may have had other technological devices like tablets or iPads, and it did not change the results,\" Barzilay said in an interview on CBS News' \"The Daily Report.\"",
      "In a separate\u00a0statement, Barzilay said his study's findings suggest that parents should see smartphones as having \"a significant factor in teen health\" and approach the decision to give children a phone with care and consideration. He noted that smartphones \"can play a constructive role\" in teens' lives by strengthening their social connections and helping them learn, adding that some families see smartphones as necessary for their children's safety.",
      "Going forward, Barzilay said the researchers behind the study hope to investigate which aspects of smartphone use and ownership are connected with negative health effects for young people. Researchers intend to study younger children, who acquired smartphones before age 10, in an effort to understand who is most vulnerable to the detrimental impacts of smartphone use who and who could most benefit from it. Ultimately, Barzilay said the goal is to identify ways to protect children and adolescents who own smartphones from the consequences outlined in their findings.",
      "In recent years, a growing number of experts have sounded the alarm about increased screen time and the effect it has on kids and teens. In a 2023\u00a0advisory\u00a0on social media use and mental health, former U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy recommended creating\u00a0\"tech-free zones\"\u00a0and encouraging kids to \"foster in-person friendships.\" Meanwhile,\u00a0several states\u00a0have taken steps to\u00a0ban cellphones\u00a0in schools.",
      "According to\u00a0Pew Research Center, 95% of teens between the ages of 13 and 17 owned a smartphone in 2024. More than half of parents with children between the ages of 11 and 12 who were surveyed by the research center at that time said their kids also owned smartphones. The same survey found that nearly 30% of parents with children between 8 and 10 years old said their kids owned smartphones, as did 12% of parents with children between 5 and 7 years old, and 8% of parents with children younger than 5.",
      "\"Most probably, all teens will eventually have a smartphone,\" said Barzilay. \"Once this happens, it is advisable to monitor what our children do on their phones, ensuring they're not exposed to inappropriate content and that smartphones don't disrupt sleep.\"",

    "story": [
      "If seeing the world through the eyes of artificial intelligence sounds appealing, a growing number of technology companies have just the thing: AI eyeglasses.",
      "The latest entrant is from Alibaba, which on Thursday started selling smart glasses that let wearers access the Chinese online retailer's Qwen AI app with the touch of a button. Consumers can use the device, dubbed Quark AI Glasses, to search the internet, automatically compile meeting notes, make payments, listen to music and manage their schedule, among other functions.",
      "Consumers can also use the glasses' built-in camera to snap a picture of a product and instantly price it on Alibaba's e-commerce site, Taobao. The glasses, which start at 3,799 yuan (roughly $537), are only available for purchase in China, according to Alibaba.",
      "Companies have been down this road before \u2014 often unsuccessfully. Google launched smart glasses, which could be used to search the web, get directions and record video, more than a decade ago. But the product failed to catch on, with consumers put off by the $1,500 price tag.",
      "After repositioning Google Glass as a tool for businesses, the Alphabet-owned company pulled the plug in 2023.",
      "Yet the idea of wearing a computer on your face, rather than carrying one around in your pocket in the form of a smartphone, never went away. Today, major tech players, including Amazon, Meta and Xiaomi, are all rolling out digital glasses, betting on AI as the \"killer app\" that wins over consumers. Dozens of smaller players are also entering the fray with a variety of products.",
      "In the U.S., Meta this summer teamed with eyewear maker Oakley to introduce AI glasses that lets users make calls, send and receive text messages, listen to music, stream video, translate foreign languages, and generally tap the internet via the company's AI app. Geared to athletes, the product starts at $399. Meta also offers AI glasses in a partnership with Ray-Ban.",
      "Such devices are attracting users beyond tech fans. For example, some visually impaired people are using Meta's smart glasses to connect with volunteers for real-time help completing tasks such as shopping or going through their mail.",
      "Although smart glasses remain a niche product, tech market researcher IDC forecasts steady growth, from global sales of 9.4 million units this year to nearly 20 million in 2029. Roughly 17% of online adults in the U.S report having tried smart glasses, according to Forrester, up from 4% in 2024.",
      "One obstacle AI eyewear will have to overcome to gain broader acceptance, according to security experts: privacy. Smart glasses capture, store and share personal data, while their capacity to record and stream video raises thorny questions about filming people without their consent, according to legal experts.",

    "summary": "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has been directed by the Trump administration to target undocumented Somali immigrants in the Twin Cities, according to the New York Times.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has been directed by the Trump administration to target undocumented Somali immigrants in the Twin Cities, a person familiar with the planning confirmed.",
      "A U.S. official says ICE is planning to surge resources to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area to launch immigration enforcement operations there targeting individuals with deportation orders. The region has the largest population of immigrants from Somalia in the U.S., some of whom have deportation orders.",
      "The enhanced ICE operations in the Twin Cities are expected to begin this week, the official said. The operations were\u00a0first reported by the New York Times.",
      "Hundreds of people are expected to be targeted, the person familiar with the planning said.",
      "Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the agency would not discuss \"future or potential operations.\"",
      "President Trump: \"I don't want [Somalis] in our country\"",
      "In the midst of Tuesday's reports, President Trump took further aim at Minnesota's Somali community, the country of Somalia and the diaspora at large.",
      "\"They contribute nothing \u2026 I don't want them in our country,\" Trump said to the press on Tuesday. \"That's not politically correct, but I don't care. I don't want them here. Their country is no good for a reason.\"",
      "In a\u00a0Thanksgiving post where he also called Gov. Tim Walz a slur for people with intellectual disabilities, Mr. Trump said Somali refugees are \"completely taking over the once great State of Minnesota.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also previously ordered all green card holders from Somalia and more than a dozen other countries to be reexamined and said he would end the temporary protected status for Somalis in Minnesota, claiming, without evidence, that \"Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great state.\" The latter move would affect hundreds in the community.",
      "Mr. Trump has become increasingly focused on people of Somali descent living in the U.S., saying recently that they \"have caused a lot of trouble,\" which is rhetoric that community leaders say has inflamed tensions and revived fears of profiling.",
      "On Monday evening, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also announced his department is investigating whether Minnesota tax money found its way to al Shabaab, a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization and al Qaeda affiliate based in Somalia.",
      "Minneapolis, St. Paul leaders stand in solidarity with Somali community",
      "In a joint news conference on Tuesday afternoon, the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul, along with Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara and Minneapolis City Council member Jamal Osman, said they are standing in solidarity with the metro's Somali community.",
      "\"To our Somali community, I love you, and we stand with you. That commitment is rock solid,\" said Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. \"Minneapolis is proud to be home to the largest Somali community in the entire country. They've been here for decades, in many instances. Entrepreneurs and fathers, they benefit both the cultures and the economic resilience of our city.\"",
      "Frey said the targeting of Minnesota's Somali population \"means due process will be violated.\"",
      "\"Mistakes will be made, and let's be clear, it means that American citizens will be detained, for no other reason than the fact that they look like they are Somali,\" Frey said. \"That is not now and will never be a legitimate reason.\"",
      "St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter said the actions of the Trump administration are \"un-American.\"",
      "\"I grew up in an America that prided itself on being a country of immigrants, that prided itself on the fact that people from other countries would look across a whole ocean and say that's where I want to be. It seems that what we learned was that we've prided ourselves and we have decades and generations of priding ourselves on being a beacon for immigration from Europe,\" Carter said. \"I mean, it seems to many of us, like, the darker-skinned the immigrants who come to our country are, the more our posture on immigration as a country has shifted. That's un-American. That's concerning.\"",
      "Carter said the Twin Cities need to unite to stand up for immigrants and refugees.",
      "\"The last thing that we need is federal agents coming to town attempting to turn us against each other, to turn us against ourselves. The last thing we need is federal agents coming in town to create chaos and challenge for us, and so we stand together,\" Carter said. \"We encourage folks to look to the organizations that serve immigrants and refugees across our community because we have constant reminders out there about what your rights are. You have rights, that's an American thing.\"",
      "Minneapolis City Council member Jamal Osman, who was born in Somalia, pulled no punches in his assessment of the president.",
      "\"One of the things I do want to say, and obviously everyone knows that our president is racist, xenophobic, Islamophobic, and we're going to fight that,\" Osman said. \"America has a history of fighting and stopping those kind of individuals who continue to divide people and divide communities.\"",
      "Osman said his community will remain firm amid the current climate of danger.",
      "\"Our community has lived through fear in the past, and we're not gonna let them divide that,\" Osman said.",
      "As head of the Minneapolis police, O'Hara reiterated that his police officers do not work with federal law enforcement who are conducting immigration enforcement.",
      "\"We don't provide information to federal immigration authorities,\" he said. \"We don't ask people about their immigration status. Our mission is clear: to protect life, to uphold the law and to maintain safety for all people in our communities.\"",
      "Gov. Walz calls reports of ICE operation \"PR stunt\"",
      "On Tuesday afternoon, Walz responded to the reports that ICE would target undocumented Somalis in the Twin Cities, calling it \"a PR stunt.\"",
      "\"We welcome support in investigating and prosecuting crime,\" Walz added. \"Indiscriminately targeting immigrants is not a real solution to a problem.\"",
      "Minnesota has the largest Somali population in the U.S., numbering roughly 80,000 people, according to Minnesota Compass, a project of Wilder Research. Many fled the long civil war in their East African country and were drawn to the state's welcoming social programs.",
      "Jaylani Hussein, a Somali American who is executive director of the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said his group has heard of \"less than a dozen\" immigration arrests within the local Somali community in recent days.",
      "But Hussein said around 95% of Somalis in Minnesota are U.S. citizens, so the number of those at earlier stages of the immigration process is a \"pretty small\" proportion of the community. He said they estimate that 50% of the community was born in the U.S.",
      "The history behind Minnesota's Somali-American community",
      "Dr. Ahmed Samatar, the founding dean of the Kofi Annan Institute for Global Citizenship at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota, spoke with WCCO in 2019 about why so many Somali-Americans have made \"the Land of 10,000 Lakes\" home.",
      "Samatar said it all began in 1991 with Somalia's civil war.",
      "\"Somalis, everyone, they have to flee,\" Samatar said. \"Whoever will take them in, they have to flee.\"",
      "Some stayed in Somalia but were internally displaced. Others went to refugee camps in neighboring countries. Many were sent to other countries all over the world.",
      "According to the Minnesota Department of Human Services, 13,582 Somali refugees came to Minnesota between 2005 and 2018.",
      "\"Of course, when some came, they will tell others about the good news of Minnesota,\" Samatar said. \"I call that the 'call of kinship.'\"",
      "He thinks there are a variety of reasons for what are called \"secondary arrivals,\" but there are a few that stand out. One is the support from local, volunteer resettlement agencies that work with governments to help refugees find housing, schooling and jobs.",
      "Samatar also cited Minnesota's strong economy, which gave Somali-Americans job opportunities \u2014 many in western Minnesota \u2014 schooling options, health care and a safe place to live.",
      "\"The state of Minnesota has always been considered a kind and successful place,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "A top aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin said there is still \"much work to be done\" after President Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Tuesday, amid a push by Mr. Trump to end the\u00a0war in Ukraine.",
      "The meeting lasted roughly five hours and came on the heels of talks between U.S. and Ukrainian officials in Florida over the weekend.",
      "Yuri Ushakov, a top Putin official, told reporters following Tuesday's meeting that the talks were \"constructive, very useful and substantive,\" but said a compromise to the lingering territorial issues in Ukraine wasn't found.",
      "\"The territorial issue, naturally, is the most important for us, and for the Americans too. A compromise option has not yet been found, but some American developments look more or less acceptable, but they need to be discussed,\" he said. \"Some formulations that were proposed to us are acceptable to us.\"",
      "\"We are no closer to resolving the crisis in Ukraine, and there is much work to be done,\" Ushakov said.",
      "Ushakov said that Moscow was given four more documents in addition to the\u00a0original 28-point plan\u00a0the Trump administration presented last month, but did not elaborate on what those documents contained.",
      "Ushakov said both Russia and the U.S. agreed not to disclose the specific details of the talks. No direct talks between Putin and Mr. Trump are currently planned, but Putin asked Witkoff and Kushner to relay \"important political signals\" to Mr. Trump, Ushakov said.",
      "Witkoff and Kushner are set to return to the U.S. to discuss the meeting with Mr. Trump, and will then get back in touch with Russian officials by phone, Ushakov said.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who took part in weekend talks with Ukrainian officials in Florida, previously said the conversations were \"another very productive session,\" but \"there are a lot of moving parts.\"",
      "Mr. Trump had told reporters after Sunday's talks, \"I think that there's a good chance we can make a deal.\"",
      "The original U.S.-backed\u00a0peace proposal\u00a0to end Russia's war on Ukraine that was unveiled last month has gone through changes after the initial plan was criticized by some as being too favorable to Russia, Mr. Trump told reporters over the weekend. One provision that drew heavy pushback from U.S. and European officials called for Ukraine to cede territory it currently controls in Donetsk to Russia.",
      "\"They're making concessions,\" Mr. Trump said of the Russians. \"They're big concessions. They stop fighting, and they don't take any more land.\"",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said at a Tuesday news conference that the plan had been whittled down to 20 points following talks in Geneva and Florida. He said later on the social media platform Telegram that Ukraine would \"wait for signals from the American delegation after its meetings in Russia.\"",
      "\"We will receive certain signals. If the signals work, if it is fair play with our partners, then perhaps we will meet with the American delegation very soon,\" he said, adding, \"I am ready to meet with President Trump. Everything depends on today's talks.\"",
      "Putin has previously called the proposals a \"set of issues put forward for discussion\" as opposed to a firm draft agreement.",
      "Last week, a U.S. official told CBS News\u00a0that Ukraine had \"agreed to a peace deal,\" with the official and Ukrainian national security adviser Rustem Umerov saying a common understanding on a proposal had been reached, with details still to be worked out.",
      "Mr. Trump expressed optimism over the development, saying there were only a \"few remaining points of disagreement.\" Moscow, however, said it was \"premature\" to say the two sides were close to a peace deal.",

    "story": [
      "The Justice Department will seek to dismiss a lawsuit that former federal prosecutor Maurene Comey brought against it, arguing she didn't properly follow administrative complaint procedures before suing.",
      "The government laid out its argument in court papers filed Monday prior to a Thursday hearing in Manhattan federal court.",
      "Comey, a former federal prosecutor in New York who handled criminal cases against Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, sued the Trump administration in September over\u00a0her firing\u00a0in July, saying her ouster was \"unlawful and unconstitutional.\" In their\u00a0complaint, Comey's attorneys argued that her termination was \"politically motivated\" and an overreach of presidential authority.",
      "Comey is the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, who has publicly clashed with President Trump for years. In 2017, Mr. Trump\u00a0terminated\u00a0James Comey as FBI director, amid the department's investigation into any ties between Mr. Trump's associates and Russia.",
      "James Comey was indicted by a grand jury in September on two counts related to testimony he provided to Congress in September 2020. He has\u00a0pleaded not guilty. A federal judge last week ordered the criminal charges against him be dismissed on the grounds that Lindsey Halligan, the interim U.S. attorney who secured the indictment, was unlawfully appointed to the role. Attorney General Pam Bondi told reporters that the Justice Department will \"be taking all available legal action, including an immediate appeal.\"",
      "The Justice Department indicated its planned defense to Maurene Comey's lawsuit in a joint letter submitted Monday to Judge Jesse M. Furman by Maurene Comey's lawyers and the chief of the civil division of the federal prosecutor's office in Albany.",
      "The government's sections in the letter argued her lawsuit was not properly before the court because she did not fully comply with administrative procedures requiring the Merit Systems Protection Board to first consider her claim. It rejected her lawsuit's claim that the notice of appeal she filed with the board in August was futile.",
      "The board, the Justice Department maintained in the letter, was \"the appropriate forum to determine whether, as Ms. Comey claims, her removal was a prohibited personnel action or an arbitrary and capricious agency action.\"",
      "Maurene Comey's lawyers said in the filing that the board \"lacks expertise to adjudicate this novel dispute\" and was not an appropriate forum because \"this case raises foundational constitutional questions with respect to the separation of powers.\" They also argued that it was \"no longer true\" that the board functions independently of the president.",
      "A lawyer for Maurene Comey referred CBS News to the letter on Tuesday.",
      "Before her firing in July, Maurene Comey was an assistant U.S. attorney in the high-profile U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan, where she had worked since 2015. Her lawyers wrote in their lawsuit that she was fired one day after she had \"been asked to take the lead on a major public corruption case.\" Just months before, she had received an \"outstanding\" review from supervisors, the complaint said.",
      "Last month, U.S. Attorney John Sarcone in Albany took on the case and indicated his office will defend the Trump administration in the lawsuit. The move followed the recusal of prosecutors in Manhattan, where Maurene Comey had secured guilty verdicts in several high-profile cases, including the sex trafficking conviction of Ghislaine Maxwell and the bribery convictions of former Sen. Bob Menendez and his wife.",
      "Two weeks before Maurene Comey was fired, a jury convicted Combs of prostitution-related charges, though it acquitted him of more serious sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy charges. She led the prosecution team. Combs, 56, is scheduled for release from prison in June 2028.",
      "Maxwell, 63, was convicted in December 2021 on sex trafficking charges after a jury found she aided the sex abuse of girls and women by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein was found dead in his federal jail cell in August 2019 as he awaited a sex trafficking charge. His death was ruled a suicide. Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence at a prison camp in Texas, where she was transferred last summer from a prison in Florida.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-says-he-is-planning-land-strikes-on-alleged-drug-traffickers-very-soon/",

    "summary": "President Trump said his administration could attack accused drug traffickers who traverse Latin America by land \"very soon,\" which would mark an escalation in his anti-narcotics campaign.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said Tuesday his administration could attack accused drug traffickers who traverse Latin America by land \"very soon,\" which would mark an escalation in the U.S. military's campaign of lethal strikes on alleged drug boats.",
      "\"We're going to start doing those strikes on land, too,\" Mr. Trump told reporters during a Cabinet meeting when asked about the administration's strikes at sea. \"You know, the land is much easier ... And we know the routes they take. We know everything about them. We know where they live. We know where the bad ones live. And we're going to start that very soon, too.\"",
      "Mr. Trump did not definitively say when or where any possible land strikes might take place.",
      "Officials have discussed possible military operations in Venezuela in recent weeks, CBS News has previously reported, as the Trump administration accuses Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of working with drug cartels \u2014 a charge Maduro denies.",
      "But Mr. Trump said Tuesday that land strikes would not necessarily be limited to Venezuela. He said any country where illicit drugs are produced or trafficked \"is subject to attack,\" and singled out neighboring Colombia, which the U.S. has accused of failing to control the drug trade.",
      "The president has hinted for months that he may broaden his administration's sea-based strikes to include accused drug targets on land, telling reporters in October that he is \"totally prepared\" to carry out land strikes.",
      "Meanwhile, the U.S. military has built up its presence in the Caribbean, dispatching the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier to the region and sending F-35 fighter jets to Puerto Rico. And over the weekend, Mr. Trump said the airspace over Venezuela should be considered closed.",
      "If the president takes the step of ordering strikes on targets within Latin American countries, it would significantly expand the Trump administration's anti-drug trafficking operations, which have hit upward\u00a0of 20 alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and Pacific, killing more than 80 people.",
      "Those boat strikes are already controversial. Democratic lawmakers and some Republicans have argued Mr. Trump is acting without legal authority and hasn't provided enough evidence that the boats are carrying drugs. The administration has said the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels, which it has designated as terrorist groups.",
      "And The Washington Post reported last week that the first boat attack, on Sept. 2, included a second strike to kill two survivors clinging to the vessel's wreckage, which some lawmakers and experts argue could constitute a war crime. The White House confirmed there was a second strike, but maintained that the operation was legal.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said Tuesday that any land attack \"would be an act of war, and Congress would invoke the War Powers Act,\" referring to the 1973 law that limits the president's authority to make war without congressional authorization.",
      "Efforts in Congress to limit Mr. Trump's campaign have run into opposition so far.

    "story": [
      "Trump accounts are a new type of tax-deferred investment vehicle for U.S. children, created under\u00a0President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" tax and spending bill, which promises $1,000 seed contributions from the federal government for eligible kids.",
      "Here's what to know, including who qualifies for a Trump account, how to set one up and how they compare to other savings plans geared to children.",
      "Who is eligible for a Trump account?",
      "Children who are U.S. citizens and who are born between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028, are eligible to have a Trump Account, according to a fact sheet from the Department of the Treasury. Households of any income may open an account, and all such accounts qualify for a one-time $1,000 contribution from the U.S. government.",
      "Families with children under 18 may also open accounts, but they won't receive the $1,000 gift from the government. However, parents, friends, employers and other parties can contribute tax-free dollars to an account.",
      "How do I open a Trump account?",
      "Parents or guardians must set up and manage the account until a child turns 18.",
      "The Treasury Department said households should use IRS Form 4547 to open a Trump account on behalf of a child. The newly created form is also where applicants can request the $1,000 U.S. government contribution to the account. The White House said that each Trump account for eligible children will launch with a $1,000 contribution from the government.",
      "In May 2026, the Treasury Department will send instructions to individuals who applied for government-funded accounts on how to activate them.",
      "When can I set up an account?",
      "Families can open a Trump account beginning in early 2026 and can start making financial contributions on July 4, 2026, according to the Trump Administration.",
      "How much can I contribute?",
      "Excluding the government's $1,000 donation, a total of $5,000 per child can be deposited into an account each year. Employers can contribute up to $2,500 per year to an employee's account tax-free, which will count toward the $5,000 limit.",
      "Financial contributions from cities, states, tribal governments and tax-exempt organizations, including nonprofit organizations, are generally not counted toward the $5,000 limit, according to employment law firm\u00a0Littler.",
      "Annual contribution limits to the accounts are indexed to inflation and will be adjusted after 2027, according to a notice from the Internal Revenue Service.",
      "Can funds be withdrawn before a child turns 18?",
      "No. Families may not withdraw funds from a Trump account before a child turns 18, except for the following reasons:",
      "A rollover of the entire account to a Trump account with another brokerage\u00a0Certain rollovers to an \"Achieving a Better Life Experience\"\u00a0account in the year the child turns 17\u00a0Distribution when the individual dies",
      "A rollover of the entire account to a Trump account with another brokerage",
      "Certain rollovers to an \"Achieving a Better Life Experience\"\u00a0account in the year the child turns 17",
      "Distribution when the individual dies",
      "After age 18, standard IRA rules for withdrawals apply.",
      "How will money in a Trump account be invested?",
      "Under the \"big, beautiful bill,\" funds in a Trump account must be invested in an authorized investment, such as mutual funds or exchange-traded funds that track the S&P 500 stock index or another index with mostly U.S. equities. Financial firms managing the funds also may not charge more than 0.1% in annual fees.",
      "Should I personally invest in the account?",
      "Financial experts advise people considering opening a Trump account to accept the government's $1,000 contribution \u2014 money is money, after all \u2014 but to think twice about putting in their own money. The reason: Other types of savings plans \u2014 such as a\u00a0529 plan, a tax-advantaged savings account for education expenses, or a custodial brokerage account, an investment account for a minor managed by an adult \u2014 can be more financially advantageous.",
      "\"The gift is the biggest part of this. It really is free money,\" Madeline Brown, a wealth and financial policy expert at the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, D.C., told CBS News.",
      "\"It's a nice perk for parents with children who qualified,\" added Kate Ashford, a wealth management specialist at personal finance company NerdWallet. \"But it's not a slam dunk, and it's not going to do as much for you as other accounts.\"",
      "She cited the accounts' contribution caps and more limited investment tax advantages as drawbacks compared to 529s or custodial brokerage accounts.",
      "\"The only advantage is your earnings grow tax-free over the years, but you pay the ordinary income tax rate \u2014 not, say, a capital gains tax rate,\" Ashford said.",
      "Adam Michel, director of tax policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian public policy research firm, thinks there are better ways to set money aside for children, such as in a 529 or standard IRA account.",
      "\"Generally speaking, parents should not put their own money into a Trump account,\" he told CBS News. \"The primary use case for the accounts is to receive free money from sources like the government or private donations.\"",
      "For example, Michael and Susan Dell on Tuesday said they would donate a total of $6.25 billion \u2014 or $250 apiece \u2014 to millions of kids in Trump accounts.",
      "How do Trump accounts compare to a 529 savings plan?",
      "If you're saving for college, a 529 savings plan could be a better alternative, investment experts said. It lets families sock away money tax-free for education expenses. Savings from such an account can also be transferred to an IRA, offering accountholders more flexibility to save for retirement or other expenses.",
      "The Trump accounts have \"many more strings attached and complicated rules that make it not an attractive overall investment vehicle,\" Michel of the Cato Institute said.",
      "To be sure, 529 plans also have limitations. If people use funds for non-education expenses, for example, they must pay a 10% penalty.",
      "Meanwhile, a Trump account offers some flexibility. Beneficiaries, once they are adults, may use the money for purposes beyond education, such as buying a home or starting a business, while the accounts also can serve as a kind of IRA.",

      "The money will be given to most children ages 10 and younger who were born before the qualifying date of the Trump accounts, which were created earlier this year through the Republicans' tax and spending bill. Those accounts are designed to provide $1,000 to babies born during President Trump's second term in office.",
      "\"Children older than 10 may benefit, too, if funds remain available after initial sign-ups.\u202fIt is an incredibly practical and direct step to help families begin saving today,\" the Dells said in their statement.",
      "Dell, who is ranked by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index as the world's 11th richest person with net worth of $148 billion, said he and his wife were inspired by the Invest America program, which is the formal name of the Trump accounts. The Dells said they are encouraging others to join in by contributing funds to the accounts, ranging from other philanthropists and businesses to childrens' families and friends.",
      "\"We believe the smartest investment we can make is the one in children,\" Michael Dell told \"CBS News 24/7 Mornings\" in a Tuesday interview. \"We know that when a child has an account like this, even a modest sum, it really improves their outlook on life, and they are more likely to graduate from high school and college, and buy a home, start a business, start a family, become productive members of society.\"",
      "Susan Dell added that the gift builds on the couple's previous philanthropic efforts to help children through their foundation. The pair announced the program on Giving Tuesday, an annual event where people are encouraged to make charitable contributions.",
      "\"When we heard about this, for us, this was a natural fit,\" Susan Dell told \"CBS News 24/7 Mornings.\" \"This was going to reach a lot of children and help them have a start at a really bright future.\"",
      "Dell Technologies \u2014 the company founded by Michael Dell, where he serves as CEO \u2014 said in June that it had pledged to match the Treasury Department's $1,000 contributions to the Trump Accounts. The Dell corporate match will be provided to every child born to its U.S.-based employees between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028, the company said in an email to CBS News.",
      "\"Today's philanthropic gift from Michael and Susan Dell is separate from, and in addition to, our corporate commitment,\" Dell Technologies said. \"Together, these contributions provide children with meaningful financial opportunities and a transformative head start toward their futures.\"",
      "What are \"Trump accounts\"?",
      "Every child born in the U.S. between Jan. 1, 2025, and Jan. 1, 2029, with a Social Security number, and whose parents have Social Security numbers, would be automatically enrolled in the program, according to Invest America.",
      "Sign-ups are slated to begin on July 4, 2026, with parents and caregivers needed to activate the accounts. The Department of Treasury will seed the accounts with $1,000 per child, while parents, friends and others can also contribute up to $5,000 per year.",
      "Signing up will be easy, according to details released by the Trump adminstration on Tuesday. Parents or guardians will need to file an IRS Form 4547, a one-page document that asks for basic information such as a child's home address and Social Security number, to activate the account.",
      "The accounts are limited to investing in broad U.S. stock funds that track the overall market, such as a S&P 500 fund, don't use leverage and charge no more than 0.1% in annual fees. Parents can make elections for their children's accounts at trumpaccounts.gov.",

      "The $250 will be contributed to accounts for kids under 10 years old but who were born before 2025, and therefore don't qualify for the original Trump accounts, the Dells said. Children who are eligible for the $1,000 under the original Invest America plan don't qualify for the Dells' $250 investment.",
      "\"Priority goes to younger children if demand exceeds available funds,\" they noted. \"Any remaining funds may open eligibility for older children.\"",
      "The accounts will have the same guidelines as the $1,000 accounts, with the investments locked until the children turn 18 years old, at which point they can use the money for qualified expenses like education or buying a home.",

      "Washington \u2014 Rep. Anna Paulina Luna on Tuesday followed through on a monthslong threat to try to force a vote on a bipartisan bill that would ban members of Congress from trading individual stocks.",
      "Luna, a Florida Republican, introduced a discharge petition to circumvent House leaders and put the measure on the floor for a vote if it receives 218 signatures. The procedural maneuver has become a common tactic for rank-and-file lawmakers to try to force a vote on issues ignored by Republican leaders.",
      "The congresswoman had threatened to file a discharge petition if there wasn't movement on the Restore Trust in Congress Act by the end of September. But the push for a vote was stalled by the 43-day government shutdown that began on Oct. 1. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, kept the House out of session during the shutdown, putting all committee hearings and markups of legislation on hiatus.",
      "Dozens of House lawmakers across the political spectrum have coalesced behind the Restore Trust in Congress Act, which would prohibit members of Congress, their spouses and dependent children from owning or trading individual stocks. The compromise bill was introduced by Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas in September and has the support of more than 100 members, including progressives, conservatives and moderate Republicans and Democrats.",
      "But the bill is also facing bipartisan opposition, according to its cosponsors, who spoke to reporters ahead of a Nov. 19 hearing before the House Administration Committee about congressional stock trading.",
      "\"There are members in both parties who do not want this to happen, who are in the ear of leadership, who are trying to stop this from happening,\" Democratic Rep. Seth Magaziner of Rhode Island said.",
      "Under a 13-year-old law known as the STOCK Act, members of Congress, executive branch officials and other federal employees are prohibited from using nonpublic information for their financial benefit. The law also requires officials to disclose stock trades exceeding $1,000 within 45 days.",
      "Critics say the law needs reforms to require more transparency to ensure public officials are not using their positions for personal gain.",
      "\"This body has been enriching itself on the taxpayers' dime for too dadgum long, and it's got to stop,\" Republican Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee told reporters. \"We're in committee meetings. We hear things before y'all do. We can make those connections.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 02 Dec 2025 15:31:48 -0500",
    "summary": "Flyers without Real IDs, passports or other accepted forms of identification will need to pay a $45 fee starting Feb. 1.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. air travelers who haven't upgraded to a Real ID can still fly without one, but starting Feb. 1 they'll be charged a $45 fee, the Transportation Security Administration\u00a0said\u00a0Monday.",
      "Flyers without a Real ID, a passport or another acceptable form of ID will need to have their identities confirmed through a fee-based verification system called TSA Confirm.ID, the agency said.",
      "The announcement of a $45 fee for people without Real IDs comes after the TSA started requiring the identification or other approved documents in May. The Real ID is a federally compliant state driver's license, learner's permit or nondriver ID card, identified by a black or gold star in the upper right corner.",
      "Passengers without Real IDs \"will be referred to the optional TSA Confirm.ID process for identity verification upon TSA check-in and prior to entering the security line,\" the TSA said.",
      "The process will vary from airport to airport, according to the agency, which said it is working with private vendors to allow consumers to pay for the screening process before they arrive at the airport. The TSA warned that people without Real IDs could encounter increased wait times at airports while their identities are verified.",
      "The fee verifies passengers for a 10-day period, according to the TSA. The agency is still urging passengers without Real IDs to visit their local DMV to update their IDs.",
      "The $45 fee is designed to ensure that travelers, not taxpayers, foot the bill for the advanced verification system, said Adam Stahl, a TSA official, in the statement.",
      "Some travel experts said the new fee disadvantages lower-income Americans and that the 10-day verification window could cause confusion.",
      "The policy creates \"a bizarre situation where your identity expires like a carton of milk,\" travel expert Julian Kheel, founder of flight search engine Points Path, told CBS News. \"After those 10 days pass, you're back to square one, forced to pay another $45 even though nothing about your actual identity has changed.\"",
      "How does Confirm.ID work?",
      "Confirm.ID asks passengers without Real IDs to answer a series of questions about themselves to verify their identity.",
      "Once a passenger's identity is confirmed, they'll receive a receipt to show a screening agent at the TSA checkpoint, along with their form of ID. They will then continue through security like all other passengers.",
      "Passengers who don't have Real IDs and opt not to pay the $45 fee may be denied entry at checkpoints, the TSA said Monday during a press call describing the new fee-based program.",
      "What's an acceptable form of ID?",
      "Travelers with Real IDs or other accepted forms of identification don't have to pay the $45 fee to travel. Here are some of the documents the TSA says can substitute for a Real-ID-compliant driver's license:",

      "The TSA's website has a\u00a0complete list of compliant types of IDs.",
      "Who has a Real ID?",
      "The TSA noted that more than 94% of passengers currently use Real IDs or other acceptable forms of identification.",
      "The TSA had previously proposed a rule that would charge travelers without a Real ID an $18 fee at security checkpoints, according to a\u00a0notice\u00a0published in the Federal Register earlier this month.",
      "The cost of getting a Real ID varies by state. New York, for example, has no additional fee for a Real ID beyond the regular cost of getting a driver's license or renewing it, but\u00a0Pennsylvania\u00a0charges a \"one-time $30 Real ID fee\" on top of standard renewal fees.",

    "summary": "Daniel Richman, a friend of ex-FBI Director James Comey, is taking legal action against DOJ over files investigators seized from him more than five years ago.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A friend and former lawyer for ex-FBI Director James Comey is taking legal action against the Justice Department over material that investigators seized from him more than five years ago and is asking a federal court to block the government from using the files in any way.",
      "The bid from Daniel Richman, a law professor at Columbia University, comes as federal prosecutors weigh whether to seek a new indictment against Comey, related to testimony he gave to Congress in the fall of 2020. The criminal case against the ex-FBI chief that was brought in late September was dismissed last week when a judge found Lindsey Halligan, the prosecutor who secured the indictment, was unlawfully appointed interim U.S. attorney.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi and the White House said that decision would be appealed, but prosecutors have yet to formally notify the court that they will ask the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit to review the ruling. The Justice Department could also try to bring new charges against Comey, but that may come with its own risks.",
      "The material at issue was seized by the FBI in 2019 and 2020 and includes information from Richman's hard drive, two email accounts and an Apple iCloud account. Investigators obtained search warrants for the device and accounts as part of a probe called \"Arctic Haze,\" which examined a potential leak of sensitive information and was closed in 2021 without any charges being filed.",
      "But a magistrate judge overseeing one aspect of Comey's criminal case revealed new details about the warrants for Richman's devices and the Justice Department's handling of his files as it investigated the former FBI director.",
      "The judge, William Fitzpatrick, found that the government likely seized material outside the scope of the original warrants, held onto that information for years after the Arctic Haze investigation was closed, and then conducted a new search of Richman's files in September.",
      "Fitzpatrick wrote in a decision that the government was left \"unchecked to rummage through all of the information seized\" from Richman as part of its investigation into Comey and believed it could do so \"again anytime they choose.\" The judge suggested that federal investigators should have obtained a new warrant for the search of Richman's material in September, but noted that the parameters likely would have been narrower in scope than the original warrants for his device and accounts.",
      "Fitzpatrick also wrote that the materials seized from Richman were the \"cornerstone\" of Halligan's presentation to the grand jury, which went on to indict Comey on two criminal counts.",
      "Pointing to the judge's findings, lawyers for Richman argued his Fourth Amendment rights were violated, and he asked the U.S. district court in Washington, D.C., to order the immediate return of the files and block the government from using the \"improperly seized or retained materials\" any further.",
      "Richman's civil suit was first reported by Anna Bower of Lawfare.",
      "\"The government's conduct has deprived Professor Richman of his constitutional rights, and the injury to Professor Richman will continue if his property is not returned,\" they wrote.",
      "Richman's legal team argued that the files taken by investigators in connection with the 2019 and 2020 warrants, as well as the search earlier this year, were illegally seized, so the government cannot hold onto them.",
      "\"The government's over-seizure and retention of Professor Richman's Files and the 2025 warrantless search constitute, at a minimum, 'callous disregard for [his] rights,'\" they wrote.",
      "Richman's lawyers said investigators' decision to search his files in connection with their investigation into Comey, when they had been retained by the government for four years, \"exemplifies precisely the governmental abuse against which the Fourth Amendment was designed to protect.\"",
      "They asked the court to issue a temporary order that would prevent the government from using or relying on \"in any way\" his seized material while it considers whether his constitutional rights were violated.",

      "The suspect in last week's shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, D.C., has been charged with murder and assault with intent to kill while armed. Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, was ordered held without bond during an initial court appearance Tuesday.",
      "Lakanwal appeared virtually from a D.C. hospital, where he remains after being shot by law enforcement after allegedly shooting the two National Guard members, Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom and Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe. Beckstrom, 20, died of her injuries, and Wolfe remains hospitalized in critical condition.",
      "The magistrate judge overseeing Tuesday's initial appearance said that the government's case was \"exceedingly strong.\"",
      "According to charging documents in District of Columbia Superior Court, Lakanwal allegedly yelled \"Allahu Akbar!\" as he fired his gun at Beckstrom and Wolfe. The phrase is Arabic for God is great. According to the documents, another National Guard member fired a service weapon and hit Lakanwal as he was reloading his gun. Lakanwal was also charged with possession of a firearm during a crime of violence.",
      "Security footage from the scene of the shooting cited in the charges shows Lakanwal standing near a popular subway stop located near the scene of the shooting, before \"running in the direction of the intersection\" where Wolfe and Beckstrom were walking.",
      "After striking both guard members with his initial rounds of shots, prosecutors allege that Lakanwal attempted to chase and shoot at another National Guard member nearby. In one screenshot of security footage, prosecutors allege that Lakanwal bent down next to Beckstrom and Wolfe after shooting them.",
      "Last week, D.C. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro said that Lakanwal would be charged with additional crimes as the case proceeds: \"There will be no stone left unturned.\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said that she is considering seeking the death penalty for Lakanwal.",
      "After the shooting, sources told CBS News that Lakanwal served on a CIA-backed operations team for about eight years and said that he suffered from PTSD.",
      "He and his family fled Taliban threats in Afghanistan and were brought into the United States in 2021, and his asylum case was approved earlier this year. Over the weekend, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem suggested he could have \"radicalized\" after coming to the U.S. Emails obtained by CBS News also indicate that Lakanwal's mental health had deteriorated in recent years and that he had become isolated and detached from his family.",
      "The Trump administration has cited the attack as reason to further expand its ongoing immigration crackdown, halting all visa and immigration processing for Afghan nationals, and ordering a review of green card cases for immigrants from 19 countries.",

    "story": [
      "An invasive crab species has been spotted again in Oregon, a discovery that wildlife officials called \"concerning,\" especially because the crab turned up this time in a different part of the state.",
      "The Chinese mitten crab, recognized by its \"hairy\" claws that create a mitten-like appearance, is capable of climbing over walls as high as 13 feet and isn't native to the United States. In Oregon, the species is prohibited, according to the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, which has asked community members to help search for other mitten crabs that may still be in the area.",
      "In the latest case, a Chinese mitten crab was found in the Willamette River, which is about an hour south of Portland by car. After appearing in shallow water, it was captured alive by hand, the wildlife department said in news release Tuesday. The crab was reported to the department in mid-November and was not released back into the water, it said.",
      "The crab was found some 150 miles away from a spot along the lower Columbia River where another mitten crab was caught earlier this year. The Columbia River runs along Oregon's northern border with Washington.",
      "\"This recent confirmation is concerning for ODFW as another Chinese mitten crab was found in Oregon waters in April 2025 in a different location \u2013 marking the second confirmation of this invasive species in Oregon,\" the wildlife department said. \"ODFW biologists are working with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Portland State's Center for Lakes and Reservoirs and the Oregon Invasive Species Council to determine if other mitten crabs are in the Willamette River.\"",
      "Unlike Oregon's native crab species, which live in the ocean, bays and estuaries, mitten crabs live in freshwater and migrate to brackish water to breed, the department said. The invasive crab species originated in East Asia and first established an invasive population in the San Francisco Bay area in the 1980s, according to the Smithsonian. In more recent years, mitten crabs have spread to the U.S. East Coast, with one sighting last year in New York.",
      "Along with the claws that became their namesake, mitten crabs are known for their brownish-orange or greenish-brown appearance as well as their four spines \u2014 yet another distinguishing trait that sets them apart from any native U.S. crab species. According to the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, mitten crabs are capable of climbing vertical concrete walls up to 13 feet tall. In at least one instance, the crabs were able to escape from a concrete holding tank with sides that were even taller \u2014 18 feet high.",
      "It is illegal to possess or sell mitten crabs in Oregon, but wildlife officials said there are risks of mitten crabs entering the state through illegal food imports. Hoping to identify crabs still lurking in Oregon's rivers, officials said they are setting up artificial habitats to attract any that may still be alive and collecting water samples to look for signs of them. Additional monitoring programs are underway in the Columbia and Willamette rivers, they said.",

      "Despite some recent changes in how personal finance is practiced in the U.S., such as automatic enrollment in 401(k)s that were inspired by behavioral economist Richard Thaler's research about \"nudges\" \u2014 small changes that can steer people to make positive financial decisions \u2014 millions of Americans remain woefully unprepared to weather the financial strains of old age.",
      "Stronger medicine is needed, Campbell and Ramadorai say. Rather than a nudge, they call for a combination of regulatory and industry changes designed to overhaul the country's approach to personal finance \u2014 a broader shift they describe as a \"shove.\"",

      "Their book proposes a \"starter kit\" of personal finance options, such as retirement accounts that automatically enroll people when they start their first job and stay with them throughout their careers, along with savings accounts that pay interest at the same rate and carry clear, transparent fees.",
      "CBS News spoke with Campbell and Ramdorai about their new book. It has been edited for length and clarity.",
      "CBS News: You write that most Americans are financially illiterate, according to one\u00a0basic assessment. Yet you say that introducing personal finance classes in high school isn't the solution. Why?",
      "Campbell: A simple way to put it is that you have a race between financial literacy and the complexity of the products people are offered, and the decisions they're asked to make. And complexity has been winning the race.",
      "Yes, young people in high school do have to make some big decisions \u2014 taking on student debt, going to college. They may also get a credit card, and then they have to manage their credit score. But there are a lot of other decisions they won't make until much later in life.",
      "It's as if we were trying to teach people to drive by just having the classroom component of driver's ed, without putting the kids behind the wheel.",
      "Ramadorai: All of us are also consumers in the personal finance system, and if you ask me what fraction of my daily time I spend thinking about my own personal finance situation, it's probably fairly small. But the financial sector is entirely focused \u2014 especially those on the personal finance side \u2014 on trying to get this right. So there's a sort of uneven competition between me, however educated I may be, and the financial sector, who is doing this on an industrial scale.",
      "For us to say, \"Oh, well, you know, if only you had taken the time and trouble to be educated, you wouldn't be in the situation you're in right now,\" that seems a bit glib. We're proposing not just putting all of the burden of responsibility on individuals.",
      "You advocate for \"shoves\" instead of \"nudges\" to ensure people are on the proper financial path. Can you elaborate?",
      "Ramadorai: We've seen lots of good examples of these nudges \u2014 for example, auto-enrollment into pension plans. That seems like it's a very well-functioning, effective policy until you start to look a little bit more closely at it. Research is starting to emerge that, in some cases, what happens is that the default contribution rate can actually either be too high or too low, depending on what kind of person you are.",
      "There's a kind of characterization or a caricature of academics as, \"All you want is, you just want the government to come in and fix everything.\" That's really not what we're about in this book.",
      "What we're trying to say is that we believe very strongly in the power of capitalism to produce products that are extremely high quality and are delivered at very low prices. But the energy of capitalism has been perverted.",
      "Campbell: We'd like to make personal finance shopping more like buying a painkiller when you have a headache. You know, you walk into the pharmacy, you go to the shelf. There's ibuprofen, there's Advil, there's the generic \u2014 it's all on the same shelf. The active ingredient is the same, the dosage is the same, and there's a little label on the shelf that shows you the price per unit.",
      "We think personal finance, unfortunately, is a long way away from that right now. It's more like the world of unregulated medicine 120 years ago, when people were selling legitimate medicines, but they were also selling snake oil, and it was very hard for individuals to tell the difference.",
      "You're suggesting that personal finance should be more tightly regulated. Critics of that idea might argue that this would chill innovation in personal finance. What's your view?",
      "Ramadorai:\u00a0There are areas where even the most laissez-faire among us would agree that there's a role for government intervention. Think about civil aviation.",
      "Civil aviation transports very large numbers of people across vast distances at a relatively low cost, and what we don't necessarily want is for people to come in and innovate in that space in a way that introduces risks, because we're super averse to the fact that we don't want these things falling out of the sky.",
      "The other one, of course, is basic utilities. You want the lights to be on \u2014 electricity companies are regulated in a particular way, there's piping that goes to houses for running water. We think that there's a strong role for government to play in having regulation in those areas.",
      "Our argument is that there are vast areas of personal finance that are just as important as any of those basic utilities. It is the plumbing that makes our financial system work.",
      "Campbell: We instead propose a forward-looking, design-focused approach to regulation, where we ask the regulators to get very specific about what a basic financial product should look like. We call these \"starter kit products.\" They can offer a wide range of products. And the starter kit product should be designed so that it is simple, safe, cheap and easy.",
      "If you could redesign how personal finance works in the U.S. from the ground up, what would be the first feature you would build in?",
      "Campbell:\u00a0Number one, I would create a universal retirement account. I would give it a Roth structure that is open for people, automatically upon the date of first employment, and then you can carry it with you across all jobs that you have subsequently.",
      "That would fix the problem we have at the moment \u2014 we have this immense profusion of accounts, and as people change jobs, they very often end up with multiple 401(k)s. But at the same time, people who work for small businesses or who are self-employed \u2014 maybe they open an IRA, maybe they don't \u2014 but the contribution limits are much lower, and so we have an access problem.",
      "Ramadorai:\u00a0Right now in the United States, there's a lock-in problem [with mortgages], which is that interest rates have gone up so high that it's compromising mobility for most people in the U.S. So people are sitting on 2% mortgages, and they're absolutely reluctant to move, even if there's a great job opportunity somewhere else, because they would have to refinance into a much higher rate.",
      "There's a feature of mortgage markets that exists in other places, which is called portability, where you simply take your old mortgage with you to the new place \u2014 you then get the lender to reassess the collateral on the new place, and then you're able to take your mortgage with you. That increases mobility and keeps the labor market functioning well.",
      "You could also have a different feature, which is called assumability, where the buyer of your house actually is able to take on your cheap mortgage, assuming that they pass the appropriate credit checks and so on.",
      "Both of those features, portability and assumability, would be really good additions to the U.S. mortgage market.",

      "The Trump administration is considering expanding its travel ban \u2014 which currently restricts or bars the entry of nationals from 19 countries \u2014 to around 30 nations in the wake of the shooting of two National Guard soldiers in Washington, D.C., last week, multiple U.S. officials told CBS News on Tuesday.",
      "The plans are preliminary and the number of countries added to the list could change, said the officials, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. CNN reported\u00a0on Tuesday morning that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was recommending expanding the travel ban to between 30 and 32 countries.",
      "After a meeting with President Trump on Monday, Noem said on X\u00a0that she had urged him to impose \"a full travel ban on every damn country that's been flooding our nation with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies.\"",
      "\"Our forefathers built this nation on blood, sweat, and the unyielding love of freedom\u2014not for foreign invaders to slaughter our heroes, suck dry our hard-earned tax dollars, or snatch the benefits owed to AMERICANS,\" Noem wrote in her X post.",
      "The Trump administration has cited the attack in Washington \u2014 which was allegedly carried out by an Afghan man who entered the U.S. in September 2021 and was granted asylum in April 2025 \u2014 to further expand its immigration crackdown. It has halted all visa and immigration processing for Afghan nationals, paused asylum case decisions for all nationalities and ordered a full-scale review of green card cases involving immigrants from the 19 countries currently subject to the travel ban.",
      "The plans being considered would significantly broaden the scope of a proclamation issued by Mr. Trump over the summer that partially or fully barred legal immigration and travel from 19 countries, most of them in Asia and Africa.",
      "That proclamation, referred to as a travel ban by supporters and critics alike, imposed a near-total restriction on the entry of people from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. It also partially suspended the entry of travelers and immigrants from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.",
      "At the time, Mr. Trump said the proclamation was needed to mitigate concerns about terrorist activity in some of the nations on the list, the inability to properly vet some of the affected nationals and the refusal by certain countries to cooperate on deportation flights from the U.S.",

    "title": "RFK Jr. wants to delay hepatitis B vaccine. Here's what parents need to know.",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hepatitis-b-vaccine-what-parents-need-to-know/",
    "published": "Tue, 02 Dec 2025 12:48:11 -0500",
    "summary": "The three-dose hepatitis B vaccine has a long track record of safety, but rolling back recommendations could leave kids vulnerable to infections, doctors say.",
    "story": [
      "Working out of a tribal-owned hospital in Anchorage, Alaska, liver specialist Brian McMahon has spent decades treating the long shadow of hepatitis B. Before a vaccine became available in the 1980s, he saw the virus claim young lives in western Alaskan communities with stunning speed.",
      "One of his patients was 17 years old when he first examined her for stomach pain. McMahon discovered she had developed liver cancer caused by hepatitis B, just weeks before she was set to graduate from high school as valedictorian. She died before the ceremony.",
      "McMahon thinks often of an 8-year-old boy who showed no signs of illness until he complained of pain from what turned out to be a rapidly growing tumor on his liver.",
      "McMahon can still hear his voice.",
      "\"He was moaning in pain, saying, 'I know I am going to die soon,'\" he recalled. \"We were all crying.\" The boy died at home a week later.",
      "The hepatitis B virus is transmitted through blood and bodily fluids, even in microscopic amounts, and the virus can survive on surfaces for a week. Like many of his patients, McMahon said, both children contracted hepatitis B at birth or in early childhood.",
      "That outcome is now preventable. A birth dose of the vaccine, recommended for newborns since 1991, is up to 90% effective in preventing infection from the mother if given in the first 24 hours of life. If babies receive all three doses, 98% of them have immunity from the incurable virus, with the protection lasting at least 30 years.",
      "In the communities of western Alaska, years of targeted testing and widespread vaccination efforts led to the number of cases plummeting.",
      "\"Liver cancer has disappeared in children,\" McMahon said. \"We haven't seen a case since 1995. Nor do we have any children under 30 that have gotten infected that we know of.\"",
      "He worries those hard-won gains could soon be rolled back.",
      "Pushing back the dose?",
      "A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vaccine advisory panel appointed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is scheduled to discuss and vote on the hepatitis B birth dose recommendation during its two-day meeting starting Dec. 4, potentially limiting children's access.",
      "On Tucker Carlson's podcast in June, Kennedy falsely claimed that the hepatitis B birth dose is a \"likely culprit\" of autism.",
      "He also said the hepatitis B virus is not \"casually contagious.\" But decades of research shows the virus can be transmitted through indirect contact, when traces of infected fluids like blood enter the body when people share personal items like razors or toothbrushes.",
      "The committee's recommendations carry weight. Most private insurers must cover the vaccines the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices endorses, and many state vaccination policies are directly linked to its guidelines.",
      "Neither ACIP nor the CDC is regulatory. They cannot mandate immunizations. It's up to states to do that. But keeping the recommendation for a hepatitis B vaccine at birth preserves the widest range of options for families. They can choose to vaccinate at birth, wait until later in childhood, or not vaccinate at all, and insurance will continue to cover the cost of the shot as long as it remains approved by the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "Two senior FDA officials \u2014 Commissioner Marty Makary and top vaccine regulator Vinay Prasad \u2014 suggested at the end of November that changes to the vaccine approval process may be coming. Vaccines must be approved by the FDA to be administered in the United States.",
      "In internal agency emails obtained by PBS NewsHour and The Washington Post, Prasad questioned the routine practice of \"giving multiple vaccines at the same time.\" It's not clear whether he was referring to combination vaccines that offer immunity against multiple diseases with a single shot. Three of the nine hepatitis B vaccines currently approved by the FDA are combination vaccines. The birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine is given only as a stand-alone vaccine.",
      "\"Sowing distrust\"",
      "If private insurers opt to still cover the shot, misinformation from the meeting still could lead families to falsely believe the vaccine could harm their babies, said Sean O'Leary, chair of the Committee on Infectious Diseases for the American Academy of Pediatrics and an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.",
      "\"Whatever comes out of this disaster of a meeting in December is going to be mainly designed around sowing distrust and spreading fear,\" he said.",
      "President Donald Trump, Kennedy, and some newly appointed ACIP members have mischaracterized how the liver disease spreads, ignoring or downplaying the risk of transmission through indirect contact. The hepatitis B virus is far more infectious than HIV. Unvaccinated people, including children, can get infected from microscopic amounts of blood on a tabletop or toy, even when the infected person is asymptomatic.",
      "McMahon has cared for children who tested negative at birth and later became infected through indirect contact. In a study in the 1970s, nearly a third of such children went on to develop chronic hepatitis B without ever showing symptoms, he said.",
      "\"It's a very infectious virus,\" McMahon said. \"That's why giving everybody the birth dose is the best way to prevent it.\"",
      "The CDC recommends that all pregnant people be screened for hepatitis B, but it estimates that up to 16% are not tested and fall through the cracks. O'Leary and other experts say testing mothers for the virus shortly before or after delivery is unfeasible, because most hospitals lack the staff and resources.",
      "The three-dose vaccine has a long track record of safety. Numerous studies show it is not associated with an increased risk of infant death, fever or sepsis, multiple sclerosis, or autoimmune conditions, and severe reactions are rare.",
      "\"We have an incredible safety profile,\" O'Leary said. \"No one expects to get in a car wreck, right? And yet we all put our seat belts on. This is similar.\"",
      "The CDC estimates that 2.4 million people in the U.S. have hepatitis B and that half do not know they are infected. The disease can range from an acute infection to a chronic one, often with few to no symptoms. If the disease is left untreated, it can lead to serious conditions such as cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer. There is no cure.",
      "Expert's advice to parents: Talk to a doctor",
      "William Schaffner, a professor of preventative medicine at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and a former voting member of ACIP, said some parents struggle to understand why a healthy newborn needs a vaccine so soon after birth, especially for a virus they feel certain they don't have and often wrongly associate only with risky behaviors. Those perceptions, he said, mix with declining trust in public health and rising skepticism about vaccines.",
      "His advice to expectant parents who are on the fence is to talk to their doctor about the shots. Even if the pregnant woman has tested negative, he said, it's still important to give the baby the birth dose, because false negatives are possible and because the virus can spread so easily from surface contact. Babies who receive the full vaccine series starting from birth have their chance of liver cancer reduced by 84%.",
      "\"If you wait a month and if the mom happens to be positive, or the baby picks it up from a caregiver, by that time the infection is established in that baby's liver,\" Schaffner said. \"It's too late to prevent that infection.\"",
      "He said that if fewer people get vaccinated, hepatitis B will circulate at higher rates in American communities and the risk of contracting the virus will rise for everyone who doesn't get the shots.",
      "And more hepatitis B cases could mean higher costs for patients and the broader health care system. The CDC estimates treating someone with a less severe form of the disease costs $25,000 to $94,000 per year. For patients who require a liver transplant, annual medical expenses can climb above $320,000, depending on their treatment.",
      "Over the past 30 years, the main adverse events parents have reported from their babies receiving the birth dose have been fussiness and crying, both of which pass quickly. Schaffner said that's a very strong safety profile \u2014 for a newborn vaccine with a track record of protecting babies from an incurable disease.",
      "\"The data are so clear about this,\" Schaffner said. \"A whole array now of other countries have initiated this program. They've modeled it on us.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Voters are heading to the polls Tuesday in central Tennessee for 2025's final election showdown in a race that could be a referendum on President Trump.",
      "Republican nominee Matt Van Epps, a combat veteran, and Democrat Aftyn Behn, a Tennessee state representative, are vying for the seat in Tennessee's 7th Congressional District to replace former GOP Rep. Mark Green, who resigned in July. Green had represented the district, which stretches from parts of Nashville to the state's borders with Kentucky and Alabama and includes many rural counties, since 2019. He won his most recent race by more than 20 points.",
      "Though the election would normally be considered a safe win for Republicans, polling has shown a closer-than-expected race in The Volunteer State, including some that outline a single-digit race. Meanwhile, millions of dollars in outside spending have poured in, while top figures in both parties have stumped for the candidates in recent days.",
      "Still, a Democratic victory in the deep-red Tennessee district would be an uphill climb. But onlookers will be watching to see whether the race comes within a single-digit margin as a possible harbinger of what's to come in next year's elections.",
      "An indicator for the midterms",
      "The outcome of Tuesday's special election will all but certainly be viewed as an indicator for what's to come in next year's midterm elections, as Democrats tout a string of recent victories.",
      "Traditional political wisdom dictates that the party that controls the White House often loses ground in midterm elections. And the Tennessee special election follows overperformance by Democrats in special elections in September, along with a sweep across key races in November's elections that the party has pointed to as evidence of a changing tide among the electorate after bruising 2024 elections for the party.",
      "In last month's races, Democrats Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill handily won their gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey, while in New York City, democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani prevailed in his race for mayor.",
      "With the dynamics in Tennessee, even a narrow loss in Tuesday's special election would be viewed as bolstering Democrats' momentum heading into the midterms.",
      "A special election with national attention",
      "Tuesday's special election has drawn national interest, with millions of dollars in outside spending, along with visits and phone rallies held by high-ranking members of both parties, who have poured into the district in recent days to support the candidates.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson stumped for Van Epps in the district Monday, framing the race as a contrast between the GOP \"delivering on our promises,\" and Democrats imposing their \"radical\" agenda.",
      "At one point, Johnson phoned a \"friend,\" who turned out to be the president. \"We have to win this seat,\" Mr. Trump told the crowd.",
      "\"Let's make it a sweeping victory. The whole world is watching Tennessee right now and they're watching your district,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's a big vote, it's got to show something, and it's got to show that the Republican party is stronger than it's ever been.\"",
      "Former Vice President Al Gore, who represented Tennessee in Congress, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez were among Democrats who spoke at a phone rally for Behn on Monday. Gore said during November's elections, \"bipartisan and independent voters served notice, with massive landslides, that they're sick and tired of Trump's madness and cruelty.\"",
      "\"So it's no wonder that the president's begun to panic about tomorrow's election here in Tennessee,\" Gore said. \"The stage is set, and I do believe that Tennesseans are determined to claw back decency, self respect and common sense from the most corrupt and dangerous president in American history.\"",

    "story": [
      "American climber Sasha DiGiulian has become the first woman to free-climb El Capitan's longest route \u2014 a journey she said ended up being the \"most formative and challenging climb\" of her career.",
      "\"When we got to the top, after 23 days of this climb, I took a step and I just started laughing cause I was like, I haven't walked in so long,\" DiGuilian told CBS News in a phone interview Monday.",
      "DiGiulian free-climbed the roughly 3,000-foot sheer granite wall in Yosemite National Park over the course of more than three weeks, nine days of which were spent waiting out bad weather on a wall ledge. Having eyed El Cap for years, DiGiulian is one of the few to summit via the long and difficult Platinum route.",
      "\"For the last few years I've been so committed to this specific line ... This climb kind of consumed me,\" she said.",
      "DiGiulian, 33, and her climbing partner Elliot Faber were periodically accompanied by support personnel and a videographer.",
      "Made famous by the Oscar-winning documentary \"Free Solo,\" which captured climber Alex Honnold's famed ascent in June 2017, El Capitan is more than twice the height of the Empire State Building in the northern valley of Yosemite National Park in California.",
      "The rock formation has 17 different free-climbing routes, according to DiGulian. Free-climbing is when climbers ascend with their hands and feet, using equipment and ropes only to protect against falling, which they set up in between pitches, or anchor points. In longer climbs like on El Capitan, climbers divide up the terrain into pieces.",
      "DiGiulian holds a World Champion title in rock climbing and is based in Boulder, Colorado. She confirmed to CBS News that the climbing emoji is based on her image.",
      "DiGiulian said she and Faber arrived in Yosemite on Oct. 8 and began preparations to spend 14-16 days climbing the Platinum route, also known as the Direct Line, which has 39 pitches. They established rope points and hiked with more than 30 gallons of water to the top of the rock wall to be accessed later on.",
      "Faber helped establish the route years ago, mapping out credit card-sized protrusions on rock, but he had not actually climbed it. That changed on Nov. 3, when DiGiulian and Faber began their ascent.",
      "Although they incorporated weather windows into their planning, an unforeseen storm brought everything to an abrupt halt on day nine. The duo set up camp on the 32nd pitch known as the mountain's Golden Edge to wait out wind, rain, cold and snow.",
      "\"This is my portaledge,\" DiGiulian says in an Instagram video on Nov. 14.",
      "The pair used a Jetboil to cook, ate freeze-dried food for dinner, consumed Send bars (a line of green protein bars DiGiulian invented herself), rationed Kindle battery to read, and went back and forth on airplane mode to communicate with the world below. DiGiulian also said the tent door flapping in the wind made it difficult to sleep. Despite battling fatigue, boredom and the elements, she said they enjoyed incredible mountain views, glorious sunrises and days on end to contemplate their mission.",
      "\"The storm was kind of this mental but also physical challenge because you're just stripped of any sense of normal,\" DiGiulian said.",
      "Finally, after several days of being unable to climb, the weather started to let up. Despite the wet and slippery rock \u2014 very difficult climbing conditions \u2014 the pair resumed their ascent after 18 days on the wall, nine of which were spent waiting out the storm.",
      "The remaining terrain was some of the most difficult, and not made easier by the slick surfaces, DiGiulian said. She put on a helmet due to the ice chunks falling from the 400 feet above.",
      "\"I don't know what it is that enabled me to like to climb this route and get through it beyond just sheer drive to push myself,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Just short of the summit, Faber had to leave El Cap due to a family emergency. DiGiulian waited on the wall for two days, hoping they could finish together. When Faber was ultimately not able to return, he gave his partner his blessing to summit alone.",
      "\"He was just kind, I guess, between a rock and a hard place,\" DiGiulian said.",
      "Accompanied by some friends and a camera crew, DiGiulian summited El Capitan on Wednesday, Nov. 26, after a grueling 23 days \u2013 the first woman to free-climb the ascent on the Platinum route.",
      "It usually takes climbers multiple days to reach the summit, depending on the route's difficulty. El Capitan draws tens of thousands of climbers each year, according to Yosemite National Park, most taking 5-7 days to summit (on the easier routes, weather conditions permitting) and 60% of climbers typically succeed. Emily Harrington became the first woman to summit the rock formation in under 24 hours via the Golden Gate route in 2021.",
      "DiGiulian has been adventuring since childhood. \"Climbing is this space for me where I get to be really locked in and focused on what my physical and mental self is capable of,\" she said. \"I love puzzle solving.\"",

      "Rep. Jamie Raskin, the Maryland Democrat who is the Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee, and another committee member, Democratic Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove of California, wrote to the FBI to ask about Patel's Oct. 25 flight to Pennsylvania.",
      "\"You flew there because your girlfriend was performing at a wrestling match on the campus of Pennsylvania State University,\" the Democrats wrote in the letter. \"After attending her performance, you used the government's jet to fly with her home to Nashville the following day. Your 'date night' had no apparent connections to your official duties.\"",

That allows them to maintain access to secure communications wherever they travel and to move quickly in the event of an emergency.

Directors are permitted to take family or friends on personal trips, but the cost of their trips must be reimbursed to the government, as well.",

    "summary": "A federal appeals court on Monday upheld a lower court decision that disqualified Alina Habba as acting U.S. attorney in New Jersey.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court on Monday upheld a lower court decision that disqualified Alina Habba, who served as a personal lawyer to President Trump, as the acting U.S. attorney in New Jersey.",
      "The decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit was unanimous against the Trump administration, which has attempted to use a novel mechanism to place lawyers who have not received Senate approval into temporary U.S. attorney positions across the country.",
      "The case before the 3rd Circuit arose after three men facing criminal charges in New Jersey challenged the validity of Habba's appointment as a violation of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act and sought to have their indictments dismissed.",
      "U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann ruled in August that Habba has been serving without lawful authority since the beginning of July, when she was tapped to temporarily lead the U.S. Attorney's Office in New Jersey. Brann said she must be disqualified from participating in ongoing cases.",
      "The Justice Department appealed that decision to the 3rd Circuit, which is now the first federal appeals court to weigh in on the administration's scheme for installing certain U.S. attorneys.",
      "\"The court's decision affirms that U.S. Attorney Alina Habba is unlawfully and invalidly serving as the chief federal law enforcement officer in New Jersey, marking the first time an appellate court has ruled that President Trump cannot usurp longstanding statutory and constitutional processes to insert whomever he wants in these positions,\" lawyers Abbe Lowell, Gerry Krovatin and Norm Eisen said in a joint statement. \"We will continue to challenge President Trump's unlawful appointments of purported U.S. attorneys wherever appropriate.\"",
      "Lowell argued before the 3rd Circuit, and Krovatin represents one of the defendants.",
      "Thomas Mirigliano, a lawyer who represented a second defendant, said \"the panel issued a clear and carefully reasoned decision that recognizes the extraordinary power vested in U.S. attorneys and reinforces the limits Congress has set on who may occupy those positions. We appreciate the Court's thoughtful approach and the clarity it brings to this important issue.\"",
      "Neither Habba nor the Justice Department immediately responded to requests for comment.",
      "Habba was tapped to serve as interim U.S. attorney in New Jersey earlier this year, but her appointment to the role was limited to 120 days, unless the U.S. district court in New Jersey voted to extend her tenure or she was confirmed to the post by the Senate. Habba's nomination, however, was unlikely to win approval in the upper chamber, as New Jersey's two senators, Democrats Cory Booker and Andy Kim, opposed her nomination.",
      "Ahead of the 120-day deadline, the judges in New Jersey declined to allow Habba to continue serving as U.S. attorney and instead voted to install her deputy, Desiree Leigh Grace, to the position. But that decision was met with swift pushback from Attorney General Pam Bondi, who fired Grace.",
      "Then, Mr. Trump and top administration officials employed a multi-step maneuver to keep Habba in the role of U.S. attorney and get around the district court's decision. First, the president withdrew Habba's nomination for U.S. attorney in New Jersey. Then, Habba resigned as interim U.S. attorney. Bondi then appointed Habba as \"special attorney\" and to fill Grace's role as first assistant U.S. attorney. Finally, because the position as the New Jersey's top prosecutor was vacant, Habba was elevated to the role of acting U.S. attorney under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act.",
      "That law, also known as the Vacancies Act, limits the government employees who can temporarily fill the roughly 1,300 federal offices that require nomination by the president and confirmation by the Senate.",
      "In their decision, the judges on the 3rd Circuit found that the Trump administration's argument in support of Habba's role \"should raise a red flag,\" since it would allow the Justice Department to circumvent the Vacancies Act and effectively allow anyone to hold a U.S. attorney position indefinitely.",
      "\"Under the Government's delegation theory, Habba may avoid the gauntlet of presidential appointment and Senate confirmation and serve as the de facto U.S. Attorney indefinitely,\" Judge Michael Fisher wrote for the court. \"This view is so broad that it bypasses the constitutional [presidential appointment and Senate confirmation] process entirely. It also essentially eliminates the requirements of the FVRA and the U.S. Attorney-specific statute.\"",
      "Fisher was selected for the 3rd Circuit by President George W. Bush. He was joined in the decision by Judge L. Felipe Restrepo, appointed by President Barack Obama, and Judge D. Brooks Smith, tapped for the 3rd Circuit by Bush.",
      "The Trump administration has sought to install temporary U.S. attorneys in Nevada and Los Angeles using the mechanism it employed for Habba, but has faced resistance from the courts. The most high-profile of those decisions came last week, when a federal judge ordered the criminal charges against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James to be dismissed on the grounds that Lindsey Halligan, the interim U.S. attorney who secured their indictments, was unlawfully appointed to the role.",

      "\"The territorial issue, naturally, is the most important for us, and for the Americans too. A compromise option has not yet been found, but some American developments look more or less acceptable, but they need to be discussed,\" he said. \"Some formulations that were proposed to us are acceptable to us.\"",

      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said at a Tuesday news conference that the plan had been whittled down to 20 points following talks in Geneva and Florida.

    "story": [
      "A former Honduran president convicted of helping to smuggle 400 tons of cocaine into the United States has left prison after being pardoned by President Donald Trump. The U.S. Bureau of Prisons confirmed his release in a statement to the Associated Press.",
      "Juan Orlando Hernandez\u00a0was released from a federal prison in West Virginia on Monday and was \"once again a free man,\" his wife, Ana Garc\u00eda, announced on social media. Garc\u00eda thanked Mr. Trump for pardoning Hern\u00e1ndez via the social platform X early Tuesday.",
      "\"After almost four years of pain, of waiting and difficult challenges, my husband Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez RETURNED to being a free man, thanks to the presidential pardon granted by President Donald Trump,\" Garc\u00eda's post said. She included a picture of the U.S. Bureau of Prisons listing for Hern\u00e1ndez indicating his release.",
      "Mr. Trump's controversial pardon came as the U.S. president is simultaneously ordering the bombing of boats in the Caribbean allegedly carrying drugs. He is also heavily backing a candidate from Hernandez's party in Honduras's tense, ongoing presidential election vote count.",
      "Mr. Trump explained his decision\u00a0on social media\u00a0by posting that \"according to many people that I greatly respect,\" Hern\u00e1ndez was \"treated very harshly and unfairly.\"",
      "In March of last year, Hernandez was convicted in U.S. court\u00a0of conspiring to import cocaine\u00a0into the U.S. He had served two terms as the leader of the Central American nation of roughly 10 million people. Hern\u00e1ndez has been appealing his conviction and serving time at the U.S. Penitentiary, Hazelton in West Virginia.",
      "Shortly after Mr. Trump's announcement, Hernandez's wife and children gathered on the steps on their home in Tegucigalpa and kneeled in prayer, thanking God that Hernandez would return to their family after almost four years apart.",
      "It was the same home that Honduran authorities hauled him out of in 2022 just months after leaving office. He was extradited to the United States to stand trial.",
      "Trump's pardon drew criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.",
      "Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, of Louisiana, was critical of the pardon, saying Sunday on social media, \"Why would we pardon [Hernandez] and then go after Maduro for running drugs into the United States? Lock up every drug runner! Don't understand why he is being pardoned.\"",
      "\"This is shocking,\" Sen. Tim Kaine, a Democrat of Virginia,\u00a0said of the pardon\u00a0on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "\"He was convicted in a federal court in the United States,\" said Kaine, the ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere. \"One of the bits of evidence was his statement that was picked up by those near to him that he wanted to 'shove drugs up the nose of gringos' and flood the United States with cocaine, more than 400 tons. He was the leader of one of the largest criminal enterprises that has ever been subject to a conviction in U.S. courts, and less than one year into his sentence, President Trump is pardoning him, suggesting that President Trump cares nothing about narcotrafficking. Suggesting possibly that pardons are now for sale by this White House.\"",
      "In remarks on the House floor Tuesday, Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, said, \"What message does pardoning this criminal send to parents who have lost children to narcotics, to law enforcement officers risking everything to stop the flow of deadly drugs?\"",
      "\"This disgraceful pardon should be met with bipartisan condemnation,\" she added.",
      "Mr. Trump defended the move to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday, claiming, \"Many of the people of Honduras said it was a Biden setup. ... He was the president of the country, and they basically said he was a drug dealer because he was the president of the country. And they said it was a Biden administration setup, and I looked at the facts and I agreed with them.\"",
      "When asked what evidence he had seen to indicate Hernandez's case was a setup, Mr. Trump said, \"You take any country you want, if somebody sells drugs in that country, that doesn't mean you arrest the president and put him in jail for the rest of his life.\"",

      "Immigrants arrive regularly at the airport outside the capital, Caracas, on flights operated by a U.S. government contractor or Venezuela's state-owned airline. More than 13,000 immigrants have returned so far this year on the chartered flights, the latest of which arrived Friday.",
      "The U.S.-Venezuela repatriation deal has faced scrutiny from human rights organizations, though Trump administration officials point to the diplomatic deal as an important tool in reducing the influence of transnational criminal gangs. The flights have continued despite U.S. military strikes against vessels suspected of smuggling drugs in the eastern Pacific Ocean and off Venezuela's Caribbean coast.",

Mr. Trump said Tuesday that the U.S. would start doing strikes on land soon, though he didn't specify where and said attacks might occur in countries besides Venezuela, suggesting Colombia could see military strikes.",

      "The U.S. military's early September strike on an alleged Venezuelan drug boat \u2014 the first salvo in a months-long string of attacks \u2014 has drawn new scrutiny in recent days, as the White House confirmed that the vessel was struck twice.",
      "The confirmation followed a Washington Post report that the first boat was struck a second time, killing a pair of survivors \u2014 prompting calls for investigations and concerns in Congress that the follow-up strike may have constituted a war crime. A\u00a0Pentagon manual on the law of war says combatants that are \"wounded, sick, or shipwrecked\" no longer pose a threat and should not be attacked.",
      "The Trump administration has defended the series of boat strikes, casting them as a necessary tactic to stem the flow of narcotics from South America. But U.S. officials have not provided specific evidence that the vessels were smuggling drugs or posed a threat to the U.S. Some lawmakers from both parties have questioned the\u00a0 legality of the strikes.",

      "In social media posts later that day, Mr. Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio described the attack in further detail, and referred to it as a single strike.",
      "The president said on Truth Social that the strike had killed 11 alleged members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang that his administration designated as a terrorist group earlier this year. Mr. Trump posted a 29-second video that showed one strike on a boat.",
      "Mr. Trump said the boat was headed to the U.S., but Rubio said later in the day that the drugs were \"probably headed to Trinidad or some other country in the Caribbean.\"",
      "The following day, Rubio stated that it was \"headed towards, eventually, the United States.\"",
      "Sept. 3: Hegseth says he \"watched it live\"",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth pushes back on a Venezuelan official's claim that the video of the Sept. 2 strike may have been fake, telling \"Fox and Friends\" the following morning: \"I watched it live. We knew exactly who was in that boat. We knew exactly what they were doing.\"",
      "Sept. 4: U.S. had \"absolute and complete authority\" to hit boat, Hegseth says",
      "Asked by CBS News what legal authority the Pentagon cited to strike the boat, Hegseth says: \"We have the absolute and complete authority to conduct that.\" He called the importation of drugs to the U.S. an \"assault on the American people.\"",
      "Separately, the White House told Congress on Sept. 4 that it believes the strike was \"consistent with [the president's] responsibility to protect Americans and United States interests abroad and in furtherance of United States national security and foreign policy interests,\" according to a notification later obtained by CBS News.",
      "Sept. 11: Boat was allegedly turning around",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is considering expanding its travel ban \u2014 which currently restricts or bars the entry of nationals from 19 countries \u2014 to around 30 nations in the wake of the shooting of two National Guard soldiers in Washington, D.C., last week, multiple U.S. officials told CBS News on Tuesday.",
      "The plans are preliminary and the number of countries added to the list could change, said the officials, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. CNN reported\u00a0on Tuesday morning that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was recommending expanding the travel ban to between 30 and 32 countries.",
      "After a meeting with President Trump on Monday, Noem said on X\u00a0that she had urged him to impose \"a full travel ban on every damn country that's been flooding our nation with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies.\"",
      "\"Our forefathers built this nation on blood, sweat, and the unyielding love of freedom\u2014not for foreign invaders to slaughter our heroes, suck dry our hard-earned tax dollars, or snatch the benefits owed to AMERICANS,\" Noem wrote in her X post.",
      "The Trump administration has cited the attack in Washington \u2014 which was allegedly carried out by an Afghan man who entered the U.S. in September 2021 and was granted asylum in April 2025 \u2014 to further expand its immigration crackdown. It has halted all visa and immigration processing for Afghan nationals, paused asylum case decisions for all nationalities and ordered a full-scale review of green card cases involving immigrants from the 19 countries currently subject to the travel ban.",
      "The plans being considered would significantly broaden the scope of a proclamation issued by Mr. Trump over the summer that partially or fully barred legal immigration and travel from 19 countries, most of them in Asia and Africa.",
      "That proclamation, referred to as a travel ban by supporters and critics alike, imposed a near-total restriction on the entry of people from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. It also partially suspended the entry of travelers and immigrants from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.",
      "At the time, Mr. Trump said the proclamation was needed to mitigate concerns about terrorist activity in some of the nations on the list, the inability to properly vet some of the affected nationals and the refusal by certain countries to cooperate on deportation flights from the U.S.",

    "summary": "Ant colonies act as one \"super-organism\" which works to ensure the survival of all, according to a team of scientists.",
    "story": [
      "Sick young ants release a smell to tell worker ants to destroy them to protect the colony from infection, scientists said Tuesday, adding that queens do not seem to commit this act of self-sacrifice.",
      "Many animals conceal illness for social reasons. For example, sick humans are known to risk infecting others so they can still go to the office \u2014 or the pub.",
      "Ant colonies, however, act as one \"super-organism\" which works to ensure the survival of all, similar to how infected cells in our bodies send out a \"find-me and eat-me\" signal, according to an Austria-led team of scientists.",
      "Ant nests are a \"perfect place for a disease outbreak to occur because there are thousands of ants crawling over each other,\" Erika Dawson, a behavioral ecologist at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria and lead author of a new study titled \"Altruistic disease signaling in ant colonies,\" told AFP.",
      "When adult worker ants get an illness that could spread through the colony, they leave the nest to die alone. Young ants, known as pupae, in contrast are still trapped inside a cocoon, making this kind of social distancing impossible.",
      "Scientists had already figured out that when these pupae are terminally ill, there is a chemical change that produces a particular smell. Adult worker ants then gather around, remove the cocoon, \"bite holes in the pupae and insert poison,\" Dawson said. The poison acts as a disinfectant, which kills both the colony-threatening pathogen and the pupae.",
      "For the new research, the scientists wanted to figure out whether the pupae \"were actively saying: 'hey, come and kill me,'\" Dawson said.",
      "\"Altruistic act\"",
      "First, the scientists extracted the smell from the sick pupae of a small black garden ant called Lasius neglectus. When they applied the smell to a healthy brood in the lab, the workers still destroyed them.",
      "Then, the team conducted an experiment showing that the sick pupae only produce the smell when worker ants are nearby, proving it is a deliberate signal for destruction.",
      "\"While it is a sacrifice \u2014 an altruistic act \u2014 it's also in their own interest, because it means that their genes are going to survive and be passed on to the next generation,\" Dawson said.",
      "However, there is one member of the nest that does not sacrifice itself. When queen pupae are infected inside their cocoons, they do not send out the smelly warning signal, the team found.",
      "\"Are they cheating the system?\" Dawson said the team asked themselves.",
      "However, they found that the \"queen pupae have much better immune systems than the worker pupae, and so they were able to fight off the infection \u2014 and that's why we think that they weren't signaling,\" she said.",
      "The study's authors note that sick queens face a conundrum.",
      "\"By alerting others to destroy them, queen pupae would risk losing potential future reproductive opportunities if they would survive infection,\" the authors write. \"On the other hand, by spreading their infection to their colony, they could incur high indirect fitness costs.\"",
      "Dawson hopes future research will investigate whether queen pupae sacrifice themselves when it becomes clear they will not beat their infection.",
      "The study was published in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "Scientists have previously studied\u00a0how ants communicate. A Stanford University study\u00a0published\u00a0in 2012 showed that harvester ants transmit information to determine how many ants to send to a particular food source. Researchers concluded that ants communicate in much the same way as data moves on the internet, dubbing it the \"anternet.\"",
      "Researchers have also previously concluded that other sick species practice social distancing \u2014\u00a0including guppies, bats and mandrills. Bees have been documented using tactics to prevent getting sick, including\u00a0kicking sick bees out of their hives\u00a0altogether.",

    "summary": "U.S. prosecutors shared what had been one of the central questions after Sinaloa cartel leader Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada fell into U.S. hands in July 2024.",
    "story": [
      "Armed men entered through a window to ambush Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada, the most elusive of the Sinaloa cartel's leaders, who was then loaded onto a plane, drugged and spirited across the border to the United States, according to details revealed Monday in the plea hearing of the drug trafficker who abducted him.",
      "Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez, the 39-year-old son of former Sinaloa cartel kingpin Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n, pleaded guilty to two counts of drug trafficking and continuing criminal enterprise in federal court in Chicago after admitting his role in overseeing the transport of tens of thousands of pounds of drugs to the U.S.",
      "As part of that plea agreement, U.S. prosecutors shared what had been one of the central questions in the hours and days immediately after Zambada fell into U.S. hands in July 2024.",
      "How did the wily drug capo who had stayed ahead of authorities for decades end up in the United States like a present tied with bow?",
      "The plea agreement did not name Zambada, but in the days after his arrest, one of his lawyers shared a letter from him that explained he had been called to a meeting with Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez and there he had been abducted.",
      "Andrew Erskine, an attorney representing the U.S. government, said Monday the alleged kidnapping of an unnamed individual was part of an attempt to show cooperation with Washington, which he said did not sanction those actions. He also said Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez would not receive cooperation credit because of that.",
      "The arrest of both drug traffickers by U.S. authorities angered Mexico's then-President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who suspected the U.S. government was behind the operation. Washington denied involvement from the outset, but experts thought it would be virtually impossible to pull off without U.S. authorities having some knowledge.",
      "Erskine described the alleged kidnapping in court, saying Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez had the glass from a floor-to-ceiling window removed from a room ahead of the meeting with the unnamed person.",
      "Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez allegedly had others enter through the open window, seize the individual, put a bag over his head and take him to a plane. On board, he was zip tied and given sedatives before the plane landed at a New Mexico airport near the border with Texas.",
      "Zambada in his letter said Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez had called him to a meeting on the outskirts of Sinaloa state's capital, Culiacan, along with some local politicians, one of whom was later found dead.",
      "He said when he arrived there were a lot of armed men in green military uniforms, who he assumed were gunmen for the \"Chapitos,\" as \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n's sons were known. According to a 2023 U.S. indictment, the Chapitos and their cartel associates used corkscrews, electrocution and hot chiles to\u00a0torture their rivals\u00a0while some of their victims were \"fed dead or alive to tigers.\"",
      "Even though they ran a rival faction within the cartel, Zambada maintained communication with them and appeared to trust Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez enough to follow him into a dark room.",
      "On the plane that landed in New Mexico were only the pilot, Zambada and Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez. Aboard the plane, Zambada was given a drink containing sedatives, which Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez also drank a little of, according to Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez's account.",
      "Rather than congratulating or thanking the U.S. for arresting the elusive Zambada, Mexico's Attorney General's Office said it was studying the possibility of bringing treason charges against Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez or whoever else aided in the plot.",
      "The arrests set off a bloody fight in Sinaloa among their respective cartel factions for control of the business, violence that L\u00f3pez Obrador's successor President Claudia Sheinbaum is still dealing with.",
      "With the plea deal, Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez's defense attorney, Jeffrey Lichtman, said he is expected to avoid life in prison.",
      "Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n is serving a life sentence after being convicted in 2019 for his role as the former leader of the Sinaloa cartel, having smuggled mountains of cocaine and other drugs into the United States over 25 years.",
      "In May, Mexico's security chief confirmed that\u00a017 family members\u00a0of the cartel leaders crossed into the U.S. as part of a deal between a son of the former head of the Sinaloa Cartel and the Trump administration. El Chapo's ex-wife, Griselda Lopez Perez, and her daughter were among the family members to enter the U.S.,\u00a0local media reported.",

      "Days before the vote, former Tegucigalpa mayor Asfura won Mr. Trump's backing \u2014 as the U.S. president sought to put his finger on the scale of another Latin American election.",
      "In a Monday post on his own Truth Social platform, Mr. Trump accused the Honduran electoral body of \"trying to change the results\" of the vote, adding: \"If they do, there will be hell to pay!\"",
      "He claimed that the CNE had \"abruptly stopped counting\" ballots on the night of the election when the initial count \"showed a close race between\" Asfura and Nasralla, noting the slight lead that tally showed for Asfura.",
      "\"It is imperative that the Commission finish counting the Votes. Hundreds of thousands of Hondurans must have their Votes counted,\" he said in the post, which he published before the CNE chief urged patience for a manual count.",

      "Ally Javier Milei came out on top in Argentina's mid-term elections, but it is not yet clear if Mr. Trump's endorsement will be enough to secure victory for Asfura, whose campaign slogan was: \"Grandad, at your service!\"",
      "Could Trump help swing Honduras back to the right?",
      "The election is a clear defeat for ruling leftists trailing far behind in the vote count. A swing to the right could help build U.S. influence in a country that under leftist government had looked increasingly to China.",
      "The election campaign was dominated by Mr. Trump's threat and the surprise announcement that he would pardon former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernandez of Asfura's National Party.",
      "Hernandez, who has always maintained his innocence, is serving a 45-year prison sentence in the United States, where he was convicted of belonging to one of \"the largest and most violent drug trafficking conspiracies in the world.\"",

      "Many Hondurans have fled north to escape grinding poverty and violence, including minors fearing forced recruitment by gangs.",
      "This escape route has been made more difficult by Mr. Trump's immigration crackdown, and nearly 30,000 Honduran migrants have been deported from the U.S. since his second term started in January.",

      "Mr. Trump said recently he's spoken with Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, while the U.S. president has also built up a significant military force in the region as a part of what he's described as an anti-drug campaign against the cartels his administration has designated as terror groups. The State Department has designated Maduro himself as a terrorist.",
      "CNN was first to report the meeting, which comes amid the president's looming threats of military action on land and intensifying scrutiny by lawmakers over the Pentagon's lethal strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean.",

The U.S. attack on the vessel was announced by Mr. Trump on Sept. 2. The Post reported that the initial strike left two survivors in the water, and the commander of the operation then ordered a second strike to comply with Hegseth's directive, killing the survivors.",
      "A working group of former judge advocates general said that if this is true, it would constitute \"war crimes, murder, or both.\" The group pointed to the Geneva Conventions, which says that members of armed forces who are out of the fight because of \"sickness, wounds, detention, or any other cause, shall in all circumstances be treated humanely,\" and acts including \"violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds\" are banned. The U.S. military has killed at least 80 people in boat strikes in the Caribbean and the Pacific in \"Operation Southern Spear,\" which it says is targeting narco-terrorists.",
      "The JAG group called on Congress to probe any use of the military involving \"the intentional targeting of anyone \u2013 enemy combatants, non-combatants, or civilians \u2013 rendered hors de combat (\"out of the fight\") as a result of their wounds or the destruction of the ship or aircraft carrying them.\"",
      "On Sunday, Mr. Trump told reporters he \"wouldn't have wanted\" a reported second strike on an alleged drug boat earlier this year, while pledging to look into the incident.",
      "\"The first strike was very lethal, it was fine and if there were two people around,\" the president told reporters on Air Force One. \"But Pete said that didn't happen. I have great confidence in him.\"",
      "GOP Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota, who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, was also asked Monday evening about whether he has confidence in Hegseth and about the boat strike.",

Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and he plans to talk with the admiral who led the operation. He said that Hegseth \"did indicate\" that \"there was a second attack.\" But Wicker told reporters he did not have information on survivors who may have been killed, adding that he expects to receive that information because \"we're going to have all of the audio and all of the video.\"",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump warned that Venezuelan airspace should be considered closed, and Venezuela said the U.S. had unilaterally suspended its migrant repatriation flights and wants to \"undermine the sovereignty of its airspace.\"",
      "The Trump administration says it's aiming to stop drugs from being smuggled into the U.S., while Venezuela says Mr. Trump seeks Maduro's ouster. Over the past several weeks, the U.S. has moved a number of military ships to the western Atlantic and the Caribbean and reopened a naval base in Puerto Rico.",
      "On Sunday, Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said the reported U.S. follow-on strike on an alleged drug boat earlier this year \"rises to the level of a war crime if it's true.\"",

      "The U.S. backed a peace proposal to end Russia's war on Ukraine last month, although much more work remains to be done. Putin has called U.S. proposals a \"set of issues put forward for discussion\" rather than a draft agreement. Last week, Mr. Trump said there were \"only a few remaining points of disagreement,\" after a U.S. official and Ukraine's national security adviser Rustem Umerov said a common understanding on a proposal had been reached, with details still to be worked out.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters over the weekend that the U.S.-backed plan, which was originally 28 points, has evolved, after some alleged it was heavily slanted toward Russia's priorities, with one provision calling for Ukraine to cede territory it currently controls to Russia.",
      "\"They're making concessions,\" Mr. Trump told reporters of the Russians. \"They're big concessions. They stop fighting, and they don't take any more land.\"",
      "Those two things aren't going to be seen as concessions to European leaders, who believe Russia should give back Ukrainian territory it has occupied. Ukraine has also pushed for security guarantees as part of any deal to end the war, though Russia has rejected the idea of Ukraine joining NATO, which would obligate the U.S. and other member states to come to its defense.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was in Florida for the talks with the Ukrainians over the weekend, called the conversations with the Ukrainians \"another very productive session\" but \"there are a lot of moving parts.\"",
      "\"We don't just want to end the war. We also want to help Ukraine be safe forever,\" he said. \"So never again will they face another invasion. And equally importantly, we want them to enter an age of true prosperity. It's about also the terms that set up Ukraine for long-term prosperity.\"",
      "On Sunday, Republican Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio voiced concerns that the White House approach could be too pro-Russia.",
      "Asked by CBS News' chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes whether he still has concerns about the plan being too pro-Russia, Turner, who sits on the House Armed Services Committee and formerly chaired the House Intelligence Committee, said \"I think we all have those concerns.\" But he added, \"one thing that I think everybody understands is that you can't have, you can't be America First and pro-Russia, because Russia is a self-declared adversary of the United States.\"",
      "Peace is far from a reality on the ground in Ukraine, as Russian missiles rained down again on Kyiv over the weekend, CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams reports from western Ukraine.",
      "Mr. Trump has offered high praise for Witkoff's negotiating skills and personable nature, and given him an increasingly large portfolio. The White House did not dispute a phone transcript published by Bloomberg last week in which Witkoff reportedly advised Yuri Ushakov, a top Putin official, on how Putin should approach Mr. Trump in peace negotiations.",

      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked about the Post's report during the White House briefing on Monday. \"Does the administration deny that that second strike happened, or did it happen and the administration denies that Secretary Hegseth gave the order?\" a reporter asked.",
      "\"The latter is true,\" Leavitt replied, before reading out a written statement: \"President Trump and Secretary Hegseth have made it clear that presidentially designated narcoterrorist groups are subject to lethal targeting in accordance with the laws of war. With respect to the strikes in question on Sept. 2, Secretary Hegseth authorized Admiral Bradley to conduct these kinetic strikes. Admiral Bradley worked well within his authority and the law, directing the engagement to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the United States of America was eliminated.\"",
      "At another point, CBS News senior White House correspondent Weijia Jiang asked Leavitt: \"So was the initial order from Secretary Hegseth, 'everyone be killed,' and did that come from President Trump?\"",
      "\"I saw that quoted in a Washington Post story. I would reject that the secretary of war ever said that,\" Leavitt said. \"However, the president has made it quite clear that if narcoterrorists, again, are trafficking illegal drugs towards the United States, he has the authority to kill them. And that's what this administration is doing.\"",
      "Later on Monday, Hegseth wrote on social media that Bradley is \"an American hero, a true professional, and has my 100% support.\"",
      "\"I stand by him and the combat decisions he has made \u2014 on the September 2 mission and all others since,\" Hegseth said.",
      "President Trump said Sunday that he \"wouldn't have wanted\" the second strike but defended Hegseth's handling of the incident, saying the secretary told him he did not order the subsequent attack.",
      "\"The first strike was very lethal, it was fine,\" the president told reporters on Air Force One, saying he has \"great confidence\" in Hegseth.",
      "He added: \"I'm going to find out about it, but Pete said he did not order the death of those two men.\"",
      "A group of former military lawyers argued in an assessment on Saturday that the reported second strike would be a violation of international or domestic law. In Congress, the leaders of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees pledged to investigate the matter. And Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" Sunday that the strike \"rises to the level of a war crime if it's true,\" while GOP Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio agreed that it \"would be an illegal act\" if true.",
      "Former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, who served in the role from 2011-2013 under former President Barack Obama, said on \"CBS Evening News\" Monday that the reported second strike constitutes a war crime \"because these individuals were injured. They were in the water.\"",
      "\"The basic rules of war that are involved here make very clear that you do not strike wounded people in the water in order to kill them,\" Panetta said. \"You basically then are responsible to try to make sure you do everything to try protect their lives at that point. And that the concern right now whether or not this really violated the rules of war and constituted a criminal act.\"",
      "On Monday, GOP Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told reporters that he has spoken with Hegseth and Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and he plans to talk with the admiral who led the operation. He said Hegseth \"did indicate\" that \"there was a second attack.\" But Wicker told reporters he did not have information on survivors who may have been killed, adding that he expects to receive that information because \"we're going to have all of the audio and all of the video.\"",
      "The developments come as the U.S. has carried out close to two dozen boat strikes in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean since the first attack on Sept. 2.",
      "Asked by CBS News if he has concerns about the boat strikes more broadly, Mr. Trump said Sunday: \"Very little, because you can see the boats, you can see the drugs in the boats and each boat is responsible for killing 25,000 Americans.\"",
      "\"The amount of drugs coming into our country by sea is infinitesimal compared to what it was just a few months ago,\" the president said.",

      "Known locally in Mexico as the \"Chapitos,\" or \"little Chapos,\" Joaquin Guzman Lopez and his brother, Ovidio Guzman Lopez, are accused of running a faction of the Sinaloa cartel. Federal authorities in 2023 described the operation as a massive effort to send \"staggering\" quantities of fentanyl into the United States.",

    "published": "Mon, 01 Dec 2025 16:12:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The shooting raised questions about whether the government missed any red flags about the alleged attacker, 29-year-old Afghan national Rahmanullah Lakanwal.",
    "story": [
      "The shooting of two National Guard soldiers in Washington, D.C., last week has sparked a national debate about U.S. immigration policy and whether the federal government missed any red flags about the alleged attacker, identified by authorities as 29-year-old Afghan national Rahmanullah Lakanwal.",
      "The Trump administration has cited the attack, which killed one of the soldiers, to further expand its government-wide immigration crackdown. The administration has halted all visa and immigration processing for Afghan nationals, ordered a review of green card cases for immigrants from 19 countries and frozen all asylum case decisions.",
      "Lakanwal's exact motives remain unclear. Over the weekend, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem suggested he could have \"radicalized\" after coming to the U.S. Emails obtained by CBS News also indicate that Lakanwal's mental health deteriorated in recent years, and that he became isolated and detached from his family.",
      "Trump administration officials have blamed the Biden administration for allowing Lakanwal to enter the U.S. in 2021, while critics of President Trump have faulted his government for approving his asylum case earlier this year. But a review of Lakanwal's immigration case, based on conversations with U.S. officials and other official sources, shows there were several opportunities for federal authorities, under both administrations, to vet Lakanwal and identify any potentially concerning information.",
      "This is what we know about the immigration process Lakanwal underwent to enter the U.S. and to try to remain here permanently.",
      "September 2021: Lakanwal arrives in the U.S.",
      "Lakanwal entered the U.S. in September 2021 as part of \"Operation Allies Welcome,\" the Biden administration's effort to resettle tens of thousands of Afghan evacuees airlifted from Kabul following the chaotic American military withdrawal and Taliban takeover of Afghanistan.",
      "U.S. officials familiar with his case told CBS News that Lakanwal was granted humanitarian parole. Government statistics show parole was offered to more than 77,000 evacuees so they could live and work in the country legally for two-year increments. Parole was designed to be a stopgap measure while the evacuees applied for permanent forms of legal status, such as asylum or Special Immigrant Visas for those who assisted the American war effort.",
      "All Afghan evacuees were supposed to undergo an initial round of vetting at military bases in Italy, Germany, Qatar, Spain and the United Arab Emirates before being allowed to enter the U.S. Those who raised security concerns were sent to Kosovo. After arriving in the U.S., many evacuees were housed in American military bases in several states before settling in communities throughout the country.",
      "At the time, Republican lawmakers in Congress raised concerns about the vetting process undertaken by the Biden administration during the Afghan resettlement effort. A 2022 report by the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General said the screening process encountered several obstacles and that some federal officials \"did not always have critical data\" to properly vet the evacuees.",
      "December 2024: Lakanwal requests asylum",
      "Lakanwal applied for asylum with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in December 2024, arguing he would face persecution if returned to Afghanistan, according to U.S. officials who requested anonymity to discuss internal government information.",
      "His application would have been another opportunity for the U.S. government to vet his case. USCIS generally requires asylum applicants to show up to in-person interviews at one of its offices across the country.",
      "A DHS official told CBS News the USCIS asylum vetting process generally involves the collection of biometrics, a review of social media activity, FBI background checks and other screenings. The process also includes an inquiry into whether the applicant can prove he or she would face persecution if deported because of one of five factors: their race, nationality, religion, political opinion or membership in a \"particular social group.\"",
      "In recent years, USCIS has been prioritizing Afghan asylum claims, processing them faster than the cases of other nationalities due to a Biden-era federal court settlement. The vast majority of Afghan asylum cases are approved. Government data shows 20,354 \u2014 96% \u2014 of 21,201 Afghan asylum requests decided by USCIS since the summer of 2021 were granted. Only 120 cases were denied during that time.",
      "Two U.S. officials and an ex-Afghan military official told CBS News that Lakanwal was part of a \"Zero Unit,\" one of a number of CIA-backed forces in the former Afghan government's military and intelligence apparatus that gained infamy for their secrecy and alleged brutality. That work could have made him a target for reprisals by the Taliban.",
      "April 2025: Lakanwal is granted asylum",
      "USCIS approved Lakanwal's asylum application in April 2025, granting him \u2014 and any derivative immediate relatives \u2014 asylee status, U.S. officials told CBS News.",
      "While a grant of asylum is a determination that the applicant meets the legal definition of a refugee, it does not immediately bestow permanent legal status to the beneficiary. Asylees have to submit another application to request a green card, or lawful permanent resident status, which they can receive no sooner than one year after the grant of asylum. Two U.S. officials told CBS News that Lakanwal filed that application, known as an adjustment of status request, and that it was pending at the time of the attack.",
      "U.S. law allows the government to terminate someone's asylum status in certain circumstances, including when asylees commit serious crimes or fraud. A DHS official told CBS News that process requires USCIS to notify the asylee of the intent to terminate the status.",
      "Those whose asylum status is revoked are placed in deportation proceedings before federal immigration judges, who are overseen by the Justice Department. In Lakanwal's case, that process would likely not be finalized until after the adjudication of the criminal charges he faces because of last week's shooting.",

      "The municipal government of the coastal city of Joao Pessoa said a young man \u2014 identified by Brazilian media as Gerson de Melo Machado, 19 \u2014 had \"deliberately invaded the lioness's enclosure\" at the Arruda Camara Zoobotanical Park.",
      "\"In a rapid and surprising manner, he climbed a wall over six meters high, scaled the security bars, accessed one of the trees, and entered the enclosure,\" the government said in a statement.",
      "Viral videos of the attack showed the lioness, Leona, lying next to the glass separating her from visitors, who gasp in shock as the teen shimmies down a tree.",
      "The lioness spots him and makes a beeline for the tree, pulling Machado down to the ground. Bushes are seen shaking, and the teen stands up one more time before disappearing from view.",
      "\"It got him. It got him,\" visitors can be heard saying, with exclamations of \"my God!\"",
      "The government statement said Machado \"died from injuries caused by the animal.\"",
      "The zoo said in a statement on Instagram that the incident was \"extremely sad\" and that it was closed while investigations continue.",
      "\"We reiterate that the park follows rigorous technical standards and safety protocols, and we are fully cooperating with all responsible bodies to clarify the facts,\" the zoo said.",

      "Child protection counselor Veronica Oliveira said in a video on Instagram that she had accompanied Machado for eight years as he \"went through all the institutional care in this city.\"",
      "She said his mother and grandparents suffered from schizophrenia, but state psychiatrists said he merely \"had a behavioral problem.\"",
      "\"He should have been in treatment,\" she said.",
      "In other media interviews, Oliveira said Machado had dreamed of being a lion tamer, and once cut through an airport fence and hid in the landing gear of a plane he thought was going to Africa.",
      "\"Society, without knowing your story, preferred to throw you into the lion's den,\" she said.",
      "Fatal lion attacks at zoos are extremely rare, but this marks the second such incident in fewer than three months. In September, a zookeeper in Thailand was killed by lions after he stepped out of his vehicle at a safari park.",

      "\"I was so nervous. I immediately got my clothes, phone and went downstairs,\" he said.",
      "He never imagined that the blaze at the Wang Fuk Court apartment complex in Hong Kong would spread so quickly. It tore through bamboo scaffolding, mesh netting covering it, and then foam window coverings that had adorned the sprawling complex's eight buildings for ongoing renovation work.",
      "\"I got outside and saw a big fire,\" he told CBS News on Monday, as the official death toll from the blaze climbed to over 150. \"Fire was spreading everywhere, and I could hear the bamboo exploding. The fire spread to the other block. The mesh caught alight.\"",
      "That other block was his own building, where he knew his wife was still upstairs. He watched as the blaze spread up the sides, quickly blocking the main lobby.",
      "\"I called my wife immediately and said there's a big fire and we have to go now,\" the 67-year-old recalled through tears. \"I told my wife, don't come down.\"",
      "He had hoped that firefighters would be able to get the blaze under control before it was too late.",
      "On the other end of the phone, his distraught wife, Bai Shui Lin, told him she couldn't move through the thick smoke.",

      "\"I kept waiting, hoping the fire would be put out. I thought maybe only the outside would be affected. But the fire just kept getting bigger,\" he said.",
      "As the blaze spread to seven of the buildings on the complex, Yip watched from behind a police cordon for any sign of his wife being carried out, but he never saw her.",
      "He said he pored over lists of photos and names of victims for days as the death toll mounted, giving her description to nearby hospitals in the hope that she had been rescued.",
      "\"I couldn't find my wife,\" he said through tears. \"I tried everything.\"",
      "Five days later, police confirmed his worst fears in a phone call on Monday. Bai, his wife of 40 years, never made it out of their building.",
      "The couple's two sons had to confirm her identification, but her remains were burned so badly that authorities used an ID card found in her purse to verify it was her.",
      "Yip said she had gone door to door, warning neighbors of the fire that had spread to their building. He said she helped at least three other families make it out before it was too late.",
      "Both of their sons survived the catastrophic fire, but Yip said he was struggling with guilt over the loss of his wife.",
      "\"If I'd asked her to leave a minute earlier, I think she would have survived,\" he said. \"But we know her. She wouldn't have left without warning others.\"",

    "summary": "The World Health Organization issued new guidelines recommending the use of GLP-1 drugs for adults with obesity and called for action on manufacturing and affordability.",
    "story": [
      "The World Health Organization issued new guidelines Monday recommending the use of GLP-1 drugs for treating obesity.",
      "In the\u00a0new guidelines, the United Nations health agency made two key recommendations \u2014 first, that GLP-1 therapies may be used by adults for long-term treatment of obesity, except for pregnant women. It also recommended intensive behavioral therapy, including changes related to diet and exercise, alongside the use of the medications.",
      "\"Obesity is a major global health challenge that WHO is committed to addressing by supporting countries and people worldwide to control it, effectively and equitably. Our new guidance recognizes that obesity is a chronic disease that can be treated with comprehensive and lifelong care,\" Dr. Tedros Adhanom\u00a0 Ghebreyesus, director-general of the WHO, said in a news release. \"While medication alone won't solve this global health crisis, GLP-1 therapies can help millions overcome obesity and reduce its associated harms.\"",
      "Both recommendations, however, are considered \"conditional.\" WHO noted that the first recommendation is considered \"conditional\" due to limited data on the medications' long-term efficacy and safety, as well as costs and other factors. The second recommendation was graded \"conditional\" based on \"low-certainty evidence\" that intensive behavioral therapy enhances GLP-1  treatment outcomes.",
      "Still, the organization calls the drugs \"more than a scientific breakthrough.\"",
      "\"They represent a new chapter in the gradual conceptual shift in how society approaches obesity-from a 'lifestyle condition' to a complex, preventable, and treatable chronic disease,\" says an article published online Monday in the peer-reviewed medical journal  JAMA. The article was co-written by Francesca Celletti, who is senior advisor for obesity at WHO's Nutrition and Food Safety department.",
      "The World Health Organization highlighted the importance of equitable access to GLP-1 drugs, saying that it is calling for \"urgent action on manufacturing, affordability, and system readiness to meet global needs.\"",
      "\"Even with rapid expansion in production, GLP-1 therapies are projected to reach fewer than 10% of those who could benefit by 2030,\" WHO says.",
      "Well-known brand names of GLP-1 drugs in the U.S. include Ozempic and Mounjaro, which are FDA approved for treating diabetes, and Wegovy and Zepbound, which are approved for weight loss.",
      "WHO estimates that obesity affects more than 1 billion people globally and was associated with 3.7 million deaths last year. It also notes that in September, it added GLP-1 therapies to its \"Essential Medicines List\" for managing type 2 diabetes in groups that are high-risk.",
      "\"With the new guideline, WHO issues conditional recommendations for using these therapies to support people living with obesity in overcoming this serious health challenge, as part of a comprehensive approach that includes healthy diets, regular physical activity and support from health professionals,\" the agency said in its news release Monday.",

      "\"We don't just want to end the war. We also want to help Ukraine be safe forever. So never again will they face another invasion. And equally importantly, we want them to enter an age of true prosperity,\" he said. \"It's about also the terms that set up Ukraine for long-term prosperity. ... I think we build on that today, but there's more work to be done.\"",
      "Witkoff is set to travel to Moscow on Monday, a U.S. official later confirmed to CBS News.",

      "The plan, which Mr. Trump has since played down as a \"concept\" or a \"map\" to be \"fine-tuned,\" would have imposed limits on the size of Ukraine's military, blocked the country from joining NATO and required Ukraine to hold elections in 100 days.

    "story": [
      "Hong Kong \u2014 As the confirmed death toll from the Hong Kong apartment complex fire climbed to at least 151 on Monday, officials said their investigation into the blaze had found that mesh used to cover scaffolding for ongoing renovations was not up to fire-safety codes.",
      "Frustration over what appears to have been clear safety lapses ahead of the devastating fire \u2014   which took more than two days to extinguish as it engulfed seven of the complex's eight towers \u2014 was being met with government moves to stifle criticism.",
      "Initial tests of the netting that had enshrouded the scaffolding showed it met safety regulations, but Hong Kong officials said Monday that investigators had since gained access to more areas to collect samples, including from higher floors.",
      "Hong Kong Chief Secretary Eric Chan said seven of the 20 new samples of the synthetic mesh had failed fire safety standards, suggesting contractors may have opted for cost-saving over the safety of residents and workers.",
      "\"They just wanted to make money at the expense of people's lives,\" Chan told reporters.",
      "Recovery teams found another eight bodies, including those of three firefighters located earlier but which workers had been unable to retrieve, Tsang Shuk-yin, head of the Hong Kong police's casualty enquiry unit told reporters on Monday. She said more than 30 people were still listed as missing, but some were likely among the nearly 40 sets of remains recovered but yet to be identified.",
      "\"We will have to wait until we get through all seven blocks before we can make a final report,\" she said, adding that some remains were likely so badly burned that identification could prove impossible.",

      "Monday was to be the last day of an official mourning period declared by authorities, and thousands of people turned out to pay their respects, laying flowers, toys and notes for the victims, many of whom where children and the elderly.",
      "Police have released photos from inside the charred buildings, where they found the bodies of residents who had tried to escape the inferno in stairwells and on rooftops.",
      "One deeply distraught man at the scene on Monday told CBS News that his sons had just identified the remains of his 66-year-old wife, who died in the fire. He said he was demanding answers from the government as to how the disaster could have happened.",
      "Anger has mounted in Hong Kong since the fire erupted on Wednesday morning last week. It had already been revealed that the fire alarms were turned off in the complex, and for months, residents had issued warnings about what they believed to be hazardous materials covering the buildings during the renovation.",
      "As of Monday, 14 people had been arrested for suspected manslaughter, and authorities were not ruling out further arrests.",
      "The level of public angst has rattled Beijing, to the extent that the central government issued a warning to Hong Kongers against any protests or using the fire to \"disrupt\" life in the city.",
      "The warning drew parallels to the crackdown on pro-democracy protests that paralyzed the city in 2019.",
      "Three people had been arrested on Monday under a sweeping national security law imposed in the wake of those protests. Their lawyer says they were detained for starting a petition calling for an independent inquiry into the fire \u2014   a sign of how concerned Beijing is that the tragedy could lead to fresh civil unrest in the previously semi-autonomous southern metropolis.",

      "Even if you don't know the meaning of the Oxford University Press' word of the year for 2025, you've probably been a victim of it on social media.",
      "The publisher for the Oxford English Dictionary said on Monday it chose \"rage bait\" as its top word for the year, capturing the internet zeitgeist of 2025.",
      "The word of the year is selected by lexicographers at Oxford University Press who analyze new and emerging words, as well as changes in the way language is being used, to identify words of \"cultural significance.\"",
      "What is \"rage bait\"?",
      "The phrase refers to online content that is \"deliberately designed to elicit anger or outrage by being frustrating, provocative or offensive,\" to drive traffic to a particular social media account, Oxford said in a statement.",
      "\"The person producing it will bask in the millions, quite often, of comments and shares and even likes sometimes,'' lexicographer Susie Dent told CBS News partner BBC. This is a result of the algorithms used by social media companies, \"because although we love fluffy cats, we'll appreciate that we tend to engage more with negative content and content that really provokes us.\"",
      "It is similar to clickbait, where a headline is used to lure a reader into viewing an article or a video, but rage bait content's specific focus is on making people angry.",
      "\"The fact that the word 'rage bait' exists and has seen such a dramatic surge in usage means we're increasingly aware of the manipulation tactics we can be drawn into online,\" Casper Grathwohl, president of Oxford Languages, told BBC News. \"Before, the internet was focused on grabbing our attention by sparking curiosity in exchange for clicks, but now we've seen a dramatic shift to it hijacking and influencing our emotions, and how we respond.\"",
      "2025 Word of the Year shortlist",
      "Rage bait topped two other contenders \u2013 \"aura farming\" and \"biohack\" \u2013 after public comment on a shortlist compiled by the publisher's lexicographers.",
      "\"Aura farming'' means to cultivate a public image by presenting oneself in \"a way intended subtly to convey an air of confidence, coolness or mystique.''",
      "\"Biohack'' is defined as \"an attempt to improve or optimize one's physical or mental performance, health or longevity.''",
      "Oxford's past winners",
      "Oxford University Press has selected a word of the year annually since 2004.",
      "Past winners include \"podcast\" in 2005, \"emoji\" in 2015, and in 2022, \"goblin mode,\" which described people who resisted returning to normal life after the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Last year's word, brain rot, captured the mental drain of mindless scrolling on Instagram or TikTok.",
      "Cambridge Dictionary declared \"parasocial\" as its 2025 word of the year, defined as \"involving or relating to a connection that someone feels between themselves and a famous person they do not know, a character in a book, film, TV series, etc., or an artificial intelligence.\"",

      "\"So this is the one and only painting showing blood and water coming out of the side wound of Christ, and this is something that Rubens only painted once.\"",
      "The Osenat auction house said the painting's authenticity and provenance were confirmed after scientific analysis. It said microscopic examination of the paint layers revealed not only white, black, and red pigments in the areas representing flesh, but also blue and green pigments Rubens typically used in painting human skin.",
      "Art expert Eric Turquin told a packed house the painting had virtually disappeared in the early 1600s. It is known to have belonged to 19th-century French classic painter William Bouguereau before it was passed down in the family.",
      "Although Rubens produced many works for the Church, the painting, measuring 42 by 29 inches, was likely to have been created for a private collector.",
      "A flurry of paintings by famous artists have sold at auctions in recent days.",
      "Last week, a previously unknown work by French impressionist painter Auguste Renoir of his toddler son Jean sold for $2.08 million at a Paris auction.",

      "Forest rangers in India have deployed drones to track wolves after nine people, mostly children, were killed by the animals in recent weeks, officials said Sunday.",
      "The latest victim was a 10-month-old girl who was snatched by a wolf in Bahraich district of northern Uttar Pradesh state on Saturday while she was sleeping beside her mother, they said.",
      "The child was later found dead in a field.",
      "A day earlier, a 5-year-old boy was snatched in plain sight of his mother from outside their home.",
      "The child, found mauled in a sugarcane field, died on the way to hospital.",
      "Officials said the attack followed the same pattern seen across a cluster of villages reporting similar incidents since September.",
      "The latest deaths raise the toll from suspected wolf attacks in Bahraich to at least nine in three months, according to police, forest officials and media reports.",
      "The victims also included an elderly couple.",
      "Forest Officer Ram Singh Yadav told AFP on Sunday that authorities have deployed drones, camera traps and shooters in the area.",
      "\"The behavior of wolves seems to have changed. Of late, they are seen active in daytime, which is strange,\" Yadav said.",
      "Other forest officials said the animals appeared unusually bold.",
      "Bahraich saw a similar wave of attacks last year, with a pack of wolves killing at least nine people, including a 1-year-old boy and 3-year-old girl, and injuring several others. At that time, authorities warned people against sleeping out in the open or moving around at night alone, but some houses in the area don't even have doors and many lack indoor toilets, so residents have little option but to go out to relieve themselves in the night.",
      "The grassland plains of Bahraich district lie about 30 miles south of the border with Nepal, where thick forests cover the Himalayan foothills.",
      "Experts say wolves attack humans or livestock only as a last resort when they are starving, preferring less dangerous prey such as small antelopes.",
      "The majority of India's roughly 3,000 wolves survive outside protected areas, often in close proximity to people.",
      "The animals, also known as the plains wolf and listed as vulnerable, are smaller than the stronger Himalayan wolf and can be mistaken for other species such as jackals.",
      "Villagers in Bahraich say they now live in mortal fear of the wolves lurking near their homes.",
      "\"Our children are not safe even inside the house,\" one resident said.",
      "\"We just want the attacks to stop.\"",
      "While attacks by big cats and\u00a0elephants\u00a0are not rare in India, wolf attacks are unusual. More than 300 people were killed in\u00a0tiger attacks\u00a0in the country between 2018 and 2022.",

      "1. Childhood: Birth to 9 years old",
      "In the childhood era of the brain, rapid growth and \"network consolidation\" occurs, including the expansion of grey and white matter and the stabilization of the brain surface. Grey matter is responsible for processing information in the brain, while white matter enables communication, according to the researchers.",

      "2. Adolescence: 9 to 32 years old",
      "In the adolescence stage, which lasts on average until the age of 32, the growth of white matter continues, while the brain\u2019s communication networks become more refined and efficient.",
      "There is also an increase in connectivity, which enhances cognitive development and learning, the study found.",
      "The first era of brain development occurs between birth and 9 years old, involving an influx in neuron connectors and brain matter. (iStock)",
      "These developments peak in the early 30s, which is defined as the \"strongest topological turning point\" of the entire lifespan.",
      "Around age 32, the \"most directional changes in wiring and the largest overall shift in trajectory\" occur, lead researcher Dr. Alexa Mousley, a Gates Cambridge Scholar, wrote in a statement.",
      "\"While puberty offers a clear start, the end of adolescence is much harder to pin down scientifically,\" she said. \"Based purely on neural architecture, we found that adolescent-like changes in brain structure end around the early 30s.\"",
      "3. Adulthood: 32 to 66 years old",
      "Adulthood is the longest era of brain development, lasting more than three decades. In this stage, the brain architecture stabilizes with no major turning points, corresponding with a \"plateau in intelligence and personality,\" the researchers echoed from other studies.",
      "Meanwhile, regions of the brain during adulthood become more compartmentalized or \"segregated.\"",
      "4. Early aging: 66 to 83 years old",
      "Around year 66, there are no major structural shifts, but researchers still pointed to \"meaningful changes\" in the pattern of brain networks. This re-organization is most likely related to general aging, coinciding with reduced connectivity and the degeneration of white matter.",
      "According to Mousley, people at this age face an increased risk of health conditions that can affect the brain, like hypertension.",

      "In an interview with Fox News Digital, Dr. Paul Saphier, a neurosurgeon and founder of Coaxial Neurosurgical Specialists in New Jersey, commented that although he agrees with the concept of stages of brain aging, the \"segregation they proposed is a little bit broad.\"",

      "\"It's not the immigrants\u2019 doing, it's a problem we have where our leadership classes, whether it's government, business, education, religion, everything, aren't really sure about whether it is even a good thing to be an American,\" Krikorian, one of the country\u2019s most notorious authorities on immigration policy, continued.",

And everything stems from that,\" he continued. \"Because if that's your worldview, then obviously law enforcement coming to round up and remove people who have no right to be here, no legal right to be here, is immoral.\"",
      "\"So, in that context, how could we expect immigrants to Americanize successfully?\" Krikorian said, adding,\"What's different today from, say, 100 or 200 years ago, is we now have a leadership class that doesn't even believe in assimilation. They think Americanization is a dirty word.\"",
      "\"My mother was a daughter of immigrants, went to public school in the 30s and 40s outside Boston, and she was taught to memorize the Gettysburg Address and George Washington was the father of our country and they sang Hail Columbia in school.

No!\" he said. \"They teach American kids to, at best, be ambivalent about America, depending on the school district, even hate America.\"",

With over 515,000 illegal aliens deported since Trump took office in January, the administration is on track to significantly exceed the record number of illegals deported out of the United States.",

You can hop on a plane and go to your cousin's wedding in Bogota for a three-day weekend.\"",
      "The solution, in Krikorian\u2019s estimation, is U.S. leaders, from the president to schoolteachers, embracing American identity. With the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence coming in 2026, Krikorian said there is a \"real opportunity\" for \"a whole year-long process of starting to change the narrative and have that narrative percolate down to local institutions, individual schools, individual congregations, individual businesses, and kind of reverse this idea that America stinks and you shouldn't want to become part of it.\"",

      "\"The alternative is to do nothing and allow NARA\u2019s appropriations to go to lawn care and toilet cleaning at the expense of FOIA processing, to close all presidential libraries when the government shuts down, to allow a deferred maintenance backlog to grow and to regret that presidential library structures were not addressed,\" Byron said. \"The National Archives is committed to making sure that doesn\u2019t happen while delivering for the American people.\"",
      "Luke Nichter, a history professor at Chapman University who said he averages 100 days annually for research and interviews with former government officials, told Fox News Digital that, given the constraints of the federal budget, it's necessary for presidential foundations to shoulder more of the cost for upkeep of these presidential libraries.",

The administration deserves credit for starting an important conversation about the future of these cherished institutions.",

      "But this isn\u2019t always the case. For example, the Obama Foundation is an entirely private entity and did not choose to construct a library for NARA to store documents, instead opting to build a private presidential center and private museum. As a result, NARA digitized and stored Obama presidential records at an existing NARA site and still oversees preserving and providing access to those records.",
      "Previous efforts to revamp the funding partnership between government and private entities successfully occurred in 2018, when NARA coordinated with each presidential foundation to discuss which operations it could take on amid increased budget constraints. Ultimately, those negotiations led to NARA and the George W. Bush Foundation securing a new deal splitting operational costs.",

      "The session \u2014 led by House Appropriations Vice Chair and National Security Subcommittee Chairman Mario D\u00edaz-Balart, R-Fla. \u2014 is feeding into a comprehensive report ordered by President Trump on recent massacres of Nigerian Christians and potential policy steps the U.S. could take to pressure Abuja to respond.",
      "Trump directed Congress, led by Reps. Riley Moore, R-W.Va., and Appropriations Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla., to probe Christian persecution in Nigeria and produce a report for the White House to review. He has floated the idea of taking direct military action against Islamists who kill.",
      "Vicky Hartzler, chair of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, told lawmakers that \"religious freedom [is] under siege,\" citing the abduction of more than 300 children and attacks in which \"radical Muslims kill entire Christian villages [and] burn churches.\" She said violations are \"rampant,\" \"violent,\" and disproportionately affect Christians, who she argued are targeted \"at a 2.2 to 1 rate\" compared with Muslims.",

      "She also urged Congress to direct the Government Accountability Office to conduct a review of past U.S. assistance and said Abuja should retake villages seized from Christian farming communities so widows and children can return home.",
      "Dr. Ebenezer Obadare of the Council on Foreign Relations offered the sharpest challenge to the Nigerian government\u2019s claim that the violence is not religiously motivated. He said the idea Boko Haram and other militant groups target Christians and Muslims equally is a \"myth,\" arguing the groups \"act for one reason and one reason only: religion.\" Any higher Muslim casualty count, he said, reflects geography, not equal targeting.",

He urged the U.S. to press the Nigerian government to disband armed groups enforcing Islamic law, confront corruption inside the security forces, and demonstrate genuine intent to curb religious violence. He added that Washington should insist Nigerian officials respond immediately to early warnings of impending attacks.",
      "Sean Nelson of Alliance Defending Freedom International added that Nigeria is \"the deadliest country in the world for Christians,\" claiming more Christians are killed there than in all other countries combined and at a rate \"five times\" higher than Muslims when adjusted for population. He said extremists also target Muslims who refuse to embrace their extreme ideology, which he argued further undercuts Abuja\u2019s narrative that the crisis is driven mainly by criminality or local disputes.",
      "With a population of more than 230 million, Nigeria\u2019s vibrant and often turbulent cities and villages are home to people of strikingly diverse backgrounds. The nation's roughly 120 million-strong Muslim population dominates the north, while some 90 million Christians are centered in the southern half of the country.",
      "Nigeria, a nation of more than 230 million people, is home to diverse communities, with Muslims largely in the north and Christians concentrated in the south. (Marvellous Durowaiye/Reuters)",
      "Nelson urged tighter U.S. oversight of assistance to Nigeria, including routing some aid through faith-based organizations to avoid corruption. He called for greater transparency in how Abuja handles mass kidnappings and ransom payments and said sustained U.S. and international pressure is essential because \"without transparency and outside pressure, nothing changes.\"",
      "D\u00edaz-Balart criticized the Biden administration for reversing the Trump administration\u2019s designation of Nigeria as a \"country of particular concern\" in 2021, arguing the change has had \"clearly deadly consequences.\" Lawmakers on the Appropriations, Foreign Affairs and Financial Services committees signaled additional oversight actions in the months ahead as they prepare the Trump-directed report to Congress.",

She pointed to President Bola Tinubu\u2019s decision to pull about 100,000 police officers from VIP bodyguard assignments and redistribute them across the country, calling it \"a promising start after years of neglect.\" She said the move reflects growing recognition inside Nigeria\u2019s political leadership that the violence has reached an intolerable level.",
      "She also highlighted comments last week from Nigeria\u2019s speaker of the House, who acknowledged the country is facing a \"coordinated and deeply troubling period of escalated violence.\" Hartzler said that acknowledgment \u2014 coupled with a push from the Nigerian House majority leader for more intensive legislative oversight \u2014 suggests the government may finally be admitting the scale and severity of the attacks.",

      "Even with these developments, Hartzler warned the measures are far from sufficient. She emphasized that the Nigerian government must show clear intent to \"quell injustice,\" act quickly when early warning signs of attacks appear, and commit to transparency and accountability if the recent steps are going to amount to meaningful progress.",

    "story": [
      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss a new iPhone update that will filter out spam messages and tips to protect yourself from A.I. cyber attacks.",
      "Cybercriminals keep finding new angles to get your attention, and email remains one of their favorite tools. Over the years, you have probably seen everything from fake courier notices to AI-generated scams that feel surprisingly polished. Filters have improved, but attackers have learned to adapt. The latest technique takes aim at something you rarely think about: the subject line itself. Researchers have found a method that hides tiny, invisible characters inside the subject so automated systems fail to flag the message. It sounds subtle, but it is quickly becoming a serious problem.",

      "NEW SCAM SENDS FAKE MICROSOFT 365 LOGIN PAGES",
      "Cybercriminals are using invisible Unicode characters to disguise phishing email subject lines, allowing dangerous scams to slip past filters. (Photo by Donato Fasano/Getty Images)",
      "How the new trick works",
      "Researchers recently uncovered phishing campaigns that embed soft hyphens between every letter of an email subject. These are invisible Unicode characters that normally help with text formatting. They do not show up in your inbox, but they completely throw off keyword-based filters. Attackers use MIME encoded-word formatting to slip these characters into the subject. By encoding it in UTF-8 and Base64, they can weave these hidden characters through the entire phrase.",
      "One analyzed email decoded to \"Your Password is About to Expire\" with a soft hyphen tucked between every character. To you, it looks normal. To a security filter, it looks scrambled, with no clear keyword to match. The attackers then use the same trick in the body of the email, so both layers slide through detection. The link leads to a fake login page sitting on a compromised domain, designed to harvest your credentials.",
      "If you have ever tried spotting a phishing email, this one still follows the usual script. It builds urgency, claims something is about to expire and points you to a login page. The difference is in how neatly it dodges the filters you trust.",
      "Why this phishing technique is super dangerous",
      "Most phishing filters rely on pattern recognition. They look for suspicious words, common phrases and structure. They also scan for known malicious domains. By splitting every character with invisible symbols, attackers break up these patterns. The text becomes readable for you but unreadable for automated systems. This creates a quiet loophole where old phishing templates suddenly become effective again.",
      "The worrying part is how easy this method is to copy. The tools needed to encode these messages are widely available. Attackers can automate the process and churn out bulk campaigns with little extra effort. Since the characters are invisible in most email clients, even tech-savvy users do not notice anything odd at first glance.",
      "Security researchers point out that this method has appeared in email bodies for years, but using it in the subject line is less common. That makes it harder for existing filters to catch. Subject lines also play a key role in shaping your first impression. If the subject looks familiar and urgent, you are more likely to open the email, which gives the attacker a head start.",
      "How to spot a phishing email before you click",
      "Phishing emails often look legitimate, but the links inside them tell a different story. Scammers hide dangerous URLs behind familiar-looking text, hoping you will click without checking. One safe way to preview a link is by using a private email service that shows the real destination before your browser loads it.",
      "Our top-rated private email provider recommendation includes malicious link protection that reveals full URLs before opening them. This gives you a clear view of where a link leads before anything can harm your device. It also offers strong privacy features like no ads, no tracking, encrypted messages and unlimited disposable aliases.",

      "A password manager helps you create strong, unique passwords for every account. Even if a phishing email fools you, the attacker cannot use your password elsewhere because each one is different. Most password managers also warn you when a site looks suspicious.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "Turning on 2FA adds a second step to your login process. Even if someone steals your password, they still need the verification code on your phone. This stops most phishing attempts from going any further.",
      "Strong antivirus software does more than scan for malware. Many can flag unsafe pages, block suspicious redirects and warn you before you enter your details on a fake login page. It is a simple layer of protection that helps a lot when an email slips past filters.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Attackers often tailor phishing messages using information they find about you. Reducing your digital footprint makes it harder for them to craft emails that feel convincing. You can use personal data removal services to clean up exposed details and old database leaks.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Do not rely on the display name. Always check the full email address. Attackers often tweak domain names by a single letter or symbol. If something feels off, open the site manually instead of clicking any link inside the email.",
      "If you get an email claiming your password will expire, do not click the link. Go to the website directly and check your account settings. Phishing emails rely on urgency. Slowing down and confirming the issue yourself removes that pressure.",
      "Updates often include security fixes that help block malicious scripts and unsafe redirects. Attackers take advantage of older systems because they are easier to trick. Staying updated keeps you ahead of known weaknesses.",
      "Many email providers (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo) allow you to tighten spam filtering settings. This won't catch every soft-hyphen scam, but it improves your odds and reduces risky emails overall.",

      "Phishing attacks are changing fast, and tricks like invisible characters show how creative attackers are getting. It's safe to say filters and scanners are also improving, but they cannot catch everything, especially when the text they see is not the same as what you see. Staying safe comes down to a mix of good habits, the right tools, and a little skepticism whenever an email pushes you to act quickly. If you slow down, double-check the details, and follow the steps that strengthen your accounts, you make it much harder for anyone to fool you.",

      "This type of scam works because it feels real. The messages look official, and the callers sound trained. Still, you can stay safer by watching out for signs that something is off.",
      "Scammers created a real-looking ticket to make the entire experience seem legitimate. You can confirm what's real by checking directly with Apple. Sign in at appleid.apple.com or open the Apple Support app to view your recent cases. If the case number isn't listed there, the message is fake, even if the email comes from an Apple domain.",
      "Never stay on a call that you did not initiate. Scammers rely on long conversations to build trust and pressure you into quick decisions. Hang up right away and call Apple Support directly at 1-800-275-2273 or through the Support app. A real agent will quickly confirm whether anything is wrong.",
      "If something feels off, look at the devices signed into your account. Go to\u00a0Settings, tap your\u00a0name and scroll to see all devices\u00a0linked to your Apple ID. Remove anything you don't recognize. This step can stop attackers fast if they've managed to get in.",
      "No real support agent will ever ask for your two-factor authentication codes. Treat any request for these codes as a major warning.",
      "Look closely at URLs. Fake sites often add extra words or change formatting to appear real. Apple will never send you to a site like appeal apple dot com.",

      "Strong antivirus software can spot dangerous links, unsafe sites, and fake support messages before you tap them. Anti-phishing tools are especially important with scams like this one since the attackers used a fake site and real ticket emails to trick victims.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

The best defense is to stay alert and take a moment before responding to anything unexpected. When you slow down, double-check support tickets, and never share verification codes, you make yourself far harder to fool. Adding layers like antivirus protection and data removal services also gives you more control over what attackers can access. These simple habits can stop even the most polished scams before they get to your accounts.",

      "Why FoloToy restored Kumma's sales after its safety review",
      "FoloToy brought Kumma back to its online store just one week after suspending sales. The fast return drew attention from parents and safety experts who wondered if the company had enough time to fix the serious issues identified in PIRG's report.",
      "FoloToy posted a detailed statement on X that laid out its version of what happened. In the post, the company said it viewed child safety as its\u00a0\"highest priority\" and that it was\u00a0\"the only company to proactively suspend sales, not only of the product mentioned in the report, but also of our other AI toys.\" FoloToy said it took this action \"immediately after the findings were published because we believe responsible action must come before commercial considerations.\"",
      "The company also emphasized to CyberGuy that it was the only one of the three AI toy startups in the PIRG review to suspend sales across all of its products and that it made this decision during the peak Christmas sales season, knowing the commercial impact would be significant. FoloToy told us, \"Nevertheless, we moved forward decisively, because we believe that responsible action must always come before commercial interests.\"",
      "The company also said it took the report's disturbing examples seriously. According to FoloToy, the issues were \"directly addressed in our internal review.\" It explained that the team\u00a0\"initiated a deep, company-wide internal safety audit,\" then \"strengthened and upgraded our content-moderation and child-safety safeguards,\" and\u00a0\"deployed enhanced safety rules and protections through our cloud-based system.\"",
      "After outlining these steps, the company said it spent the week on\u00a0\"rigorous review, testing, and reinforcement of our safety modules.\" It concluded its announcement by saying it\u00a0\"began gradually restoring product sales\" as those updated safeguards went live.",
      "FoloToy added that as global attention on AI toy risks grows,\u00a0\"transparency, responsibility and continuous improvement are essential,\" and that the company\u00a0\"remains firmly committed to building safe, age-appropriate AI companions for children and families worldwide.\"",

      "Not every model follows the same guardrails. Some include stronger filters while others may respond too freely. Look for transparent disclosures about which model powers the toy and what safety features support it.",
      "Groups like PIRG often test toys in ways parents cannot. These reviews flag hidden risks and point out behavior you may not catch during quick demos.",
      "Keep AI toys in shared spaces where you can hear or see how your child interacts with it. This helps you step in if the toy gives a concerning answer.",
      "Ask the toy questions, try creative prompts and see how it handles tricky topics. This lets you learn how it behaves before you hand it to your child.",
      "Many AI toys run on cloud systems. Updates often add stronger safeguards or reduce risky answers. Make sure the device stays current.",
      "AI toys can gather voice data, location info or behavioral patterns. A strong privacy policy should explain what is collected, how long it is stored and who can access it.",

      "How Chinese hackers turned Claude into an automated attack machine",
      "In mid-September 2025, Anthropic investigators spotted unusual behavior that eventually revealed a coordinated and well-resourced campaign. The threat actor, assessed with high confidence as a Chinese state-sponsored group, had used Claude Code to target roughly 30 organizations worldwide. The list included major tech firms, financial institutions, chemical manufacturers and government bodies. A small number of those attempts resulted in successful breaches.",
      "Claude handled most of the operation autonomously, triggering thousands of requests and generating detailed documentation of the attack for future use. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "This was not a typical intrusion. The attackers built a framework that let Claude act as an autonomous operator. Instead of asking the model to help, they tasked it with executing most of the attack. Claude inspected systems, mapped out internal infrastructure and flagged databases worth targeting. The speed was unlike anything a human team could replicate.",
      "To get around Claude's safety rules, the attackers broke their plan into tiny, innocent-looking steps. They also told the model it was part of a legitimate cybersecurity team performing defensive testing. Anthropic later noted that the attackers didn't simply hand tasks to Claude; they engineered the operation to make the model believe it was performing authorized pentesting work, splitting the attack into harmless-looking pieces and using multiple jailbreak techniques to push past its safeguards. Once inside, Claude researched vulnerabilities, wrote custom exploits, harvested credentials and expanded access. It worked through these steps with little supervision and reported back only when it needed human approval for major decisions.",
      "The model also handled the data extraction. It collected sensitive information, sorted it by value and identified high-privilege accounts. It even created backdoors for future use. In the final stage, Claude generated detailed documentation of what it had done. This included stolen credentials, systems analyzed and notes that could guide future operations.",
      "Across the entire campaign, investigators estimate that Claude performed around 80-90% of the work. Human operators stepped in only a handful of times. At its peak, the AI triggered thousands of requests, often multiple per second, a pace still far beyond what any human team could achieve. Although it occasionally hallucinated credentials or misread public data as secret, those errors underscored that fully autonomous cyberattacks still face limitations, even when an AI model handles the majority of the work.",
      "Why this AI-powered Claude attack is a turning point for cybersecurity",
      "This campaign shows how much the barrier to high-end cyberattacks has dropped. A group with far fewer resources could now attempt something similar by leaning on an autonomous AI agent to do the heavy lifting. Tasks that once required years of expertise can now be automated by a model that understands context, writes code and uses external tools without direct oversight.",
      "Earlier incidents documented AI misuse, but humans were still steering every step. This case is different. The attackers needed very little involvement once the system was in motion. And while the investigation focused on usage within Claude, researchers believe similar activity is happening across other advanced models, which might include Google Gemini, OpenAI's ChatGPT or Musk's Grok.",
      "This raises a difficult question. If these systems can be misused so easily, why continue building them? According to researchers, the same capabilities that make AI dangerous are also what make it essential for defense. During this incident, Anthropic's own team used Claude to analyze the flood of logs, signals and data its investigation uncovered. That level of support will matter even more as threats grow.",
      "We reached out to Anthropic for comment but did not hear back before our deadline.",

      "7 ways you can protect yourself from AI-driven cyberattacks",
      "You may not be the direct target of a state-sponsored campaign, but many of the same techniques trickle down to everyday scams, credential theft and account takeovers. Here are seven detailed steps you can take to stay safer.",
      "Strong antivirus software does more than scan for known malware. It looks for suspicious patterns, blocked connections and abnormal system behavior. This is important because AI-driven attacks can generate new code quickly, which means traditional signature-based detection is no longer enough.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com",
      "A good password manager helps you create long, random passwords for every service you use. This matters because AI can generate and test password variations at high speed. Using the same password across accounts can turn a single leak into a full compromise.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com",
      "A large part of modern cyberattacks begins with publicly available information. Attackers often gather email addresses, phone numbers, old passwords and personal details from data broker sites. AI tools make this even easier, since they can scrape and analyze huge datasets in seconds. A personal data removal service helps clear your information from these broker sites so you are harder to profile or target.",
      "FAKE CHATGPT APPS ARE HIJACKING YOUR PHONE WITHOUT YOU KNOWING",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web: Cyberguy.com",
      "Strong passwords alone are not enough when attackers can steal credentials through malware, phishing pages or automated scripts. Two-factor authentication adds a serious roadblock. Use app-based codes or hardware keys instead of SMS. While no method is perfect, this extra layer often stops unauthorized logins even when attackers have your password.",
      "Attackers rely heavily on known vulnerabilities that people forget or ignore. System updates patch these flaws and close off entry points that attackers use to break in. Enable automatic updates on your phone, laptop, router and the apps you use most. If an update looks optional, treat it as important anyway, because many companies downplay security fixes in their release notes.",
      "Malicious apps are one of the easiest ways attackers get inside your device. Stick to official app stores and avoid APK sites, shady download portals and random links shared on messaging apps. Even on official stores, check reviews, download counts and the developer name before installing anything. Grant the minimum permissions required and avoid apps that ask for full access for no clear reason.",
      "AI tools have made phishing more convincing. Attackers can generate clean messages, imitate writing styles and craft perfect fake websites that match the real ones. Slow down when a message feels urgent or unexpected. Never click links from unknown senders, and verify requests from known contacts through a separate channel. If a pop-up claims your device is infected or your bank account is locked, close it and check directly through the official website.",
      "By breaking tasks into small, harmless-looking steps, the threat actors tricked Claude into writing exploits, harvesting credentials and expanding access.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The attack carried out through Claude signals a major shift in how cyber threats will evolve. Autonomous AI agents can already perform complex tasks at speeds no human team can match, and this gap will only widen as models improve. Security teams now need to treat AI as a core part of their defensive toolkit, not a future add-on. Better threat detection, stronger safeguards and more sharing across the industry are going to be crucial. Because if attackers are already using AI at this scale, the window to prepare is shrinking fast.",

    "story": [
      "Safeguarding your phone and personal data has never been more crucial.",
      "Android users have been dealing with a steady rise in financial malware for years. Threats like Hydra, Anatsa and Octo have shown how attackers can take over a phone, read everything on the screen and drain accounts before you even notice anything wrong. Security updates have helped slow some of these strains, but malware authors keep adapting with new tricks.",
      "The latest variant spotted in circulation is one of the most capable yet. It can silence your phone, take screenshots of banking apps, read clipboard entries, and even automate crypto wallet transactions. This threat is now known as Android BankBot YNRK, and it is far more advanced than typical mobile malware.",

      "How the malware infiltrates devices",
      "HOW ANDROID MALWARE LETS THIEVES ACCESS YOUR ATM CASH",
      "Android banking malware is getting harder to spot as attackers use new tricks to take over phones and drain accounts. (Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images)",
      "BankBot YNRK hides inside fake Android apps that appear legitimate when installed. In the samples analyzed by researchers at Cyfirma, the attackers used apps that impersonated official digital ID tools. Once installed, the malware begins profiling the device by collecting details such as brand, model and installed apps. It checks whether the device is an emulator to avoid automated security analysis. It also maps known models to screen resolutions, which helps it tailor its behavior to specific phones.",
      "To blend in, the malware can disguise itself as Google News. It does this by changing its app name and icon, then loading the real news.google.com site inside a WebView. While the victim believes the app is genuine, the malware quietly runs its background services.",
      "One of its first actions is to mute audio and notification alerts. This prevents victims from hearing incoming messages, alarms or calls that could signal unusual account activity. It then requests access to Accessibility Services. If granted, this allows the malware to interact with the device interface just like a user. From that point onward, it can press buttons, scroll through screens and read everything displayed on the device.",
      "BankBot YNRK also adds itself as a Device Administrator app. This makes it harder to remove and helps it restart itself after a reboot. To maintain long-term access, it schedules recurring background jobs that relaunch the malware every few seconds as long as the phone is connected to the internet.",
      "What does the malware steal",
      "Once the malware receives commands from its remote server, it gains near-complete control of the phone. It sends device information and installed app lists to the attackers, then receives a list of financial apps it should target. This list includes major banking apps used in Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and India, along with several global cryptocurrency wallets.",
      "With Accessibility permissions enabled, the malware can read everything shown on the screen. It captures UI metadata such as text, view IDs and button positions. This helps it reconstruct a simplified version of any app's interface. Using this data, it can enter login details, swipe through menus or confirm transfers. It can also set text inside fields, install or remove apps, take photos, send SMS, turn call forwarding on and open banking apps in the background while the screen appears inactive.",
      "In cryptocurrency wallets, the malware acts like an automated bot. It can open apps such as Exodus or MetaMask, read balances and seed phrases, dismiss biometric prompts, and carry out transactions. Because all actions happen through Accessibility, the attacker never needs your passwords or PINs. Anything visible on the screen is enough.",
      "The malware also monitors the clipboard, so if users copy OTPs, account numbers or crypto keys, the data is immediately sent to the attackers. With call forwarding enabled, incoming bank verification calls can be silently redirected. All of these actions happen within seconds of the malware activating.",

      "A password manager helps you create long, unique passwords for every account. It also saves you from typing passwords directly into apps, which reduces the chance of malware capturing them from your clipboard or keystrokes.

It cannot stop malware that takes over your device, but it significantly limits how far an attacker can go with stolen credentials.",
      "GOOGLE ISSUES WARNING ON FAKE VPN APPS",
      "Malware often abuses permissions such as Accessibility or Device Admin because they allow deep control over your phone. Check your settings to see which apps have these permissions and remove anything that looks unfamiliar. Also, look through your installed apps and uninstall any tool or service you do not remember adding. Regular reviews help you spot threats early before they can steal data.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "BankBot YNRK is one of the most capable Android banking threats discovered recently. It combines device profiling, strong persistence, UI automation and data theft to gain full control over a victim's financial apps. Because much of its activity relies on Accessibility permissions, a single tap from the user can give attackers complete access. Staying safe means avoiding unofficial APKs, reviewing installed apps regularly and being cautious of any sudden request to enable special permissions.",

      "The implant uses hundreds of tiny electrodes to capture detailed signals from the motor cortex where the brain forms sounds and shapes words. (Paradromics)",
      "Paradromics developed a fully implantable speech-focused brain device called the Connexus BCI. The company designed it to capture detailed neural signals that support real-time communication for people who cannot speak. This system uses high-resolution electrodes and an implanted wireless setup to record activity from individual neurons involved in forming speech.",
      "The Connexus BCI has a titanium body with more than 400 platinum-iridium electrodes placed just below the brain's surface. Each electrode is thinner than a human hair. These electrodes record neural firing patterns in the motor cortex, where the brain controls the lips, tongue and larynx.",
      "Surgeons place the implant under the skin and connect it with a thin cable to a wireless transceiver in the chest. That transceiver sends data through a secure optical link to a second transceiver worn on the body. The external unit powers the system with inductive charging similar to wireless phone chargers.",
      "The collected signals then move to a compact computer that runs advanced language models. It analyzes the neural activity and converts it into text or into a synthetic voice based on the user's past recordings.",
      "Inside the Paradromics BCI human trial",
      "The trial begins with two participants. Each person will receive one 7.5-millimeter-wide electrode array placed 1.5 millimeters into the part of the motor cortex that controls the lips, tongue and larynx. During training sessions, the volunteers will imagine speaking sentences while the device learns the neural signatures of each sound.",
      "This is the first BCI trial that formally targets real-time synthetic voice generation. The study will also test whether the system can detect imagined hand movements and translate those signals into cursor control.",

      "\"Communication is a fundamental human need. For people with severe motor impairment, the inability to express themselves with family and friends or request basic needs makes living difficult. The FDA approved clinical study for the Connexus Brain-Computer Interface is the first step toward a future where commercially available neurotech can restore the ability to naturally speak and seamlessly use a computer.",
      "The fully implanted Connexus BCI is designed to record brain signals from individual neurons, capturing the massive amounts of data required for high performance applications like speech restoration and complex mouse and keyboard hand actions. Built from proven medical-grade materials, Connexus BCI is engineered for daily long-term use, backed by more than three years of stable pre-clinical recordings.",
      "How Paradromics compares to other BCI companies",
      "Paradromics joins Synchron and Neuralink at the front of the implanted BCI race. Synchron uses a stent-like device placed in a blood vessel to record broad neural patterns. Neuralink uses flexible threads with many recording sites to capture high-bandwidth signals from individual neurons.",
      "Paradromics sits in the middle of these two approaches by using a fully implantable system that still captures single-neuron detail. Researchers believe this design may offer long-term stability for everyday communication.",
      "What this means for you",
      "This breakthrough could make a major difference for people who have lost their ability to speak after ALS, stroke or spinal cord injury. A system that converts thought into speech could help them talk in real time and regain independence. It may also allow hands-free computer control, which can improve daily living.",
      "If the trial succeeds, the tech could change how assistive communication devices work and speed up patient access to advanced tools.",
      "During the trial, volunteers imagine speaking while advanced AI models learn their neural patterns and convert those signals into text or a synthetic voice. (Paradromics)",

      "Paradromics is taking a careful but bold path toward practical BCI communication. The first stage is small but meaningful. It sets the foundation for devices that may restore speech with natural flow and faster response times. As more trials move forward, this field could shift from experimental to everyday use faster than many expect.",

That stopped happening around 6 p.m.\"",

      "Walshe's searches went on for days, Guarino testified.

He conceded that he did not seek a warrant to check earlier search history, which may or may not have shown searches about dead body disposal prior to Ana's disappearance and suspected murder.",

      "Fulnecky and her classmates were tasked with writing a response to a scholarly article titled \"Relations Among Gender Typicality, Peer Relations, and Mental Health During Early Adolescence,\" summarizing results of a study about gender norms among middle schoolers and the social ramifications children may face for not conforming to gender norms.",

      "\"Gender roles and tendencies should not be considered 'stereotypes,'\" her essay continued. \"Women naturally want to do womanly things because God created us with those womanly desires in our hearts. The same goes for men. God created men in the image of His courage and strength, and He created women in the image of His beauty. He intentionally created women differently than men and we should live our lives with that in mind.\"",

However, pushing the lie that everyone has their own truth and everyone can do whatever they want and be whoever they want is not biblical whatsoever.\"",

      "Abu Nasira, a former senior Palestinian Authority police official who spent 16 years in an Israeli prison, is now operating with a small band of fighters on the eastern side of Gaza\u2019s \"yellow line,\" in territory under Israeli military control. \"I moved to the east of a yellow line, to the area that is now [controlled by the] Israeli Army.

      "Our flight to Lebanon is on. Hallelujah!",
      "I have been on nearly a dozen papal trips as a Fox News reporter and producer, but four days into Pope Leo\u2019s first international pilgrimage \u2014 this one takes the cake... or maybe a reference to a pie is more appropriate? Is this peace-pilgrimage trip to the Middle East just pie in the sky?",
      "We certainly had pies in the sky on the flight from Rome. I was seated next to a colleague who brought a pecan pie (which smelled divine, no pun intended) and behind two who gifted our Chicago-born pope home-baked pumpkin pies. Pope Leo was over the moon! Our Thanksgiving meal was less exciting but appreciated, served with a menu, real silverware and cloth napkins.",

      "Fast-forward to Saturday night, after three long, action-packed days, at a 4,000-strong Mass in Istanbul for the country\u2019s minuscule Catholic community. (Over a million Christians, especially Armenians, were wiped out in World War I by the Ottoman Empire. Now, most of the country\u2019s 85 million people are Sunni Muslim. Catholics are a mere 0.2% of the population.)",
      "At Mass, I sat next to my colleague Elise Harris, the first to be granted an interview with Pope Leo (he chose a woman, and an American, how cool is that!) and baker of one of those beautiful pumpkin pies.\u00a0As Pope Leo walked down a side aisle near us in a cloud of incense, he gave us an almost imperceptible nod and blessed us with the sign of the cross. Amazing!",
      "During the homily, the pope returned to the themes of peace and unity, the very same he emphasized on Thursday in Turkey\u2019s capital, Ankara, with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and again on Friday in Istanbul with Jewish religious leaders and later that day in Iznik, when he joined Orthodox patriarchs and ecumenical leaders to commemorate the 1,700th anniversary of the Council of Nicaea.",
      "After that meeting and prayer with Patriarch Bartholomew, the spiritual leader of the world\u2019s Orthodox Christians, he signed a joint declaration in a show of Christian unity.",

Agca was released from prison in 2010 after completing his sentences in Italy and Turkey and now lives in Iznik. He has never explained his motive for the assassination attempt, but Turkish media quoted him as saying he hoped to meet Leo \"for two or three minutes.\" Instead, he was escorted out of town.",
      "Back in 2006, I came to Istanbul for Fox News Radio to cover Pope Benedict XVI\u2019s conciliatory visit aimed at quelling the violent uproar over comments he had made in a speech in Germany, in which he quoted a Byzantine emperor saying Islam was spread through \"the sword.\"",
      "It was a big deal when Benedict was seen in the Blue Mosque, the country\u2019s most important Muslim place of worship, with his head bowed and lips moving. I remember my Reuters colleague excitedly yelling out in the press room, \"The pope is praying!\" Well, yes, he might be doing that, I thought \u2014 but how to explain its importance in a 30-second audio clip?",
      "In 2014, Pope Francis also visited the Blue Mosque and openly prayed. So it was natural to assume that our new pope would do the same. The Vatican press office even said in its daily communiqu\u00e9 he had.",

      "Pope Leo XIV arrived in Lebanon on Sunday, opening the second half of his first international trip as pontiff after three days in Turkey marked by calls for unity, peace and renewed ties among Christian communities.",
      "His stop in Lebanon places him in a nation where Christians have long-faced war, instability and a wave of emigration that has reshaped the country\u2019s demographics.",
      "Lebanon was once a Christian-majority country, a balance reflected in the 1932 census that recorded Christians as just over half the population. No official count has been conducted since, but demographic studies and independent estimates show a significant shift over the past century. As Reuters reported, Christians are now \"believed to make up roughly a third of Lebanon\u2019s population,\" a decline driven by emigration, conflict, and changing birth rates.",

      "JP De Gance, founder and president of Communio, told Fox News Digital that the choice of Turkey and Lebanon as the pope\u2019s first destinations is intentional. \"Pope Leo chose to make Turkey and Lebanon the site of his first trip very likely to emphasize two major themes of his pontificate. Coming out of the conclave that elected him, he has placed a great emphasis on both unity and on peace.\"",
      "Lebanon marks the most emotionally charged part of the trip. The last papal visit came in 2012. Pope Francis had hoped to travel there but was unable to make the journey because of health concerns. Lebanon is often described as having the highest proportion of Christians in the Middle East, yet these communities have been devastated by economic collapse, political paralysis and mass migration over the last decade.",

      "The Associated Press reported that the pope\u2019s schedule includes meetings with political leaders, Christian and Muslim clerics, and families affected by overlapping national crises. A key moment will come on Dec. 2 when he visits the Port of Beirut, the site of the 2020 explosion that killed more than 200 people and wounded thousands. His presence there is expected to draw significant attention in a country where many still demand accountability for the blast.",
      "Local media outlets report that large crowds are expected despite deep infrastructure problems and ongoing security challenges.",
      "The pope arrives amid one of Lebanon\u2019s most volatile periods in years, with repeated exchanges of fire along the southern border throughout 2024 and 2025 between Hezbollah and Israeli forces. The clashes displaced residents and raised fears of a wider conflict, prompting questions about whether the situation might force last-minute changes to the papal itinerary.",

He added that \"the situation was already well known even a few months ago, and all necessary precautionary measures have been taken.\"",
      "De Gance said the Lebanon leg underscores the pope\u2019s focus on Christians in the most vulnerable regions. \"In terms of peace, I believe the pope has added Lebanon to this trip because a great many Christian communities \u2014 both those in full communion with Rome and those who are Eastern Orthodox \u2014 are suffering in a war-torn region.\"",
      "He added that the trip also aims to draw international attention to communities often overlooked. \"Leo likely wants to bring the bully pulpit of the papacy to the region to bring a message of peace that also advocates for those often forgotten in the West \u2014 our Eastern Christian brothers and sisters.\"",

      "In Turkey, the pope marked the 1,700th anniversary of the First Council of Nicaea in \u0130znik. At an ecumenical prayer service near the archaeological remains associated with the council, he gathered with Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I and other Christian leaders.",
      "De Gance highlighted the significance of the commemoration. \"Pope Leo chose to commemorate the 1,700th anniversary of the Council of Nicea, which has such historic significance because this council helped define the reality \u2014 now still accepted by Protestants, Catholics and Orthodox \u2014 that Jesus Christ is truly God and truly man.\" He added, \"At the time of the council, a great many Christians had begun to reject this central apostolic truth.

      "\"He wanted to see the mosque, wanted to feel (the) atmosphere of the mosque, I think. And was very pleased,\" he said.",
      "There was also another change to the official program, after the Vatican said the head of Turkey's Diyanet religious affairs directorate would accompany Leo at the mosque. He didn\u2019t come and a spokesman from the Diyanet said he wasn\u2019t supposed to, since he had welcomed Leo in Ankara.",

      "According to documents obtained by NBC News via the Freedom of Information Act, the Illinois secretary of state\u2019s office sent letters to at least 19 national car rental headquarters stating that they had received public complaints of immigration agents switching license plates on rented vehicles when Operation Midway Blitz, an extensive government deportation operation, was active in the Chicago area.",

That revocation was of a license plate belonging to a 2026 Chevy Tahoe that had been rented by immigration agents, according to a statement from the Illinois secretary of state. The rental company targeted in the Nov. 10 letter, EAN Holdings LLC., which is the parent company of Enterprise Rent-A-Car and other brands, can request a hearing to challenge the decision. A company representative did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Illinois secretary of state sent the Department of Homeland Security a cease and desist letter in October, addressed to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement acting Director Todd Lyons, citing \u201cmultiple reports of federal ICE agents illegally swapping out the license plates displayed on vehicles that are registered in the State of Illinois.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese violations carry penalties that include fines and potential jail time, and the Secretary of State\u2019s Office has the authority to suspend or revoke Illinois license plates that are misused in this way,\u201d the letter to Lyons stated.",
      "DHS issued a statement in response to questions from NBC News about using rental cars as part of immigration operations and allegations of swapping license plates.",
      "\u201cOur operators comply with federal law and, consistent with the Supremacy Clause, endeavor to comply with state law except where doing so could compromise or interfere with the federal mission and operations,\u201d the DHS said. \u201cFederal motor vehicle management regulations account for the officer safety, public safety, and mission needs associated with federal investigative and law enforcement duties. Our agents risk their lives every day arresting the worst of the worst criminals from Chicago\u2019s streets to protect the public and stop rampant crime.

      "Judge demands answers from federal authorities on continued use of tear gas in Chicago area",
      "Judge temporarily blocks Trump administration from sending National Guard troops to Chicago",
      "At the same time, the letters raise questions over the extent to which federal agencies are using rental cars to assist in carrying out government immigration operations. They come amid public complaints that the massive deportation operation ordered by President Donald Trump lacks transparency and is being carried out by agents shrouded in masks, driving in unmarked vehicles and potentially with disguised license plates.",
      "The issue involving using rental cars for deportation also arose in August, when Penske Truck Rental issued a statement saying it did not authorize the use of their trucks for a deportation operation in Los Angeles and that its cargo area was not meant to transport people. At the time, DHS said it had conducted a \u201ctargeted raid\u201d that ultimately \u201cresulted in the arrest of 16 illegal aliens from Guatemala, Mexico, Honduras and Nicaragua.\u201d",
      "It is the latest clash between state and federal government entities as intensive immigration operations expand through the nation. After Chicago, Border Patrol agents moved on to North Carolina and are expected next in New Orleans.",
      "The cease and desist letter follows the launch of \u201cPlate Watch\u201d in Illinois, a hotline urging the public to report instances in which law enforcement vehicles are not carrying valid license plates, including when the plate IDs are partially shrouded or entirely missing. When Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias launched the effort in October, he pointed to a social media video in which it appears an immigration officer is seen telling an individual to take all the photos they wanted of a specific truck\u2019s license plates because they swapped them out every day anyway.",
      "\u201cWe made it clear to federal agents and rental-car companies that swapping or altering license plates to avoid detection is illegal \u2014 period. When our investigation uncovered ICE agents switching plates between vehicles, we immediately revoked the plate, making the car illegal to drive,\u201d Giannoulias said in a statement to NBC News. \u201cThe message is simple: when it comes to public safety and protecting our communities, no one is above the law. I urge residents to continue reporting these incidents to the Plate Watch hotline.\u201d",
      "The letters from the Illinois secretary of state demanded that the companies warn all their customers that the practice of changing license plates on a vehicle was a violation of state law and noted the companies would be held accountable.",
      "A Giannoulias aide said that as intensified immigration enforcement has played out in recent weeks, the secretary of state\u2019s office received reports from anonymous callers alleging varying violations: a different license plate on the front of the vehicle than in the back, no license plates on either the front or the back, plates that are partially masked, or the same vehicle carrying a different license plate from one day to the next.",
      "\u201cGiven the above notice, the Illinois Secretary of State demands that your entity notify and prohibit your customers from swapping, or otherwise altering, license plates on Illinois registered vehicles in violation of Illinois law,\u201d the letters state.",
      "As in the letter to Lyons, the companies were also warned that any violations carry fines and potential jail time, in addition to suspending or revoking Illinois license plates."

    "story": [
      "The HPV vaccine is very safe and highly effective at preventing cervical cancer, according to two large reviews that support routinely vaccinating adolescents against human papillomavirus.",
      "HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection and can cause genital warts. Merck\u2019s Gardasil vaccine, the first version of which was approved in 2006, protects against nine cancer-causing HPV strains.",
      "Nearly 60 randomized controlled clinical trials involving 160,000 participants, considered the gold-standard of scientific research, indicated that HPV vaccination is effective at preventing infection, as well as precancerous cervical lesions and genital warts. The two papers, published recently by Britain\u2019s widely respected Cochrane Review team, also included 225 observational studies of more than 132 million people worldwide. Together, the studies showed that girls who were vaccinated against HPV before age 16 had an 80% lower cervical cancer risk.",
      "\u201cThe vaccine works. Full stop,\u201d said Dr. Linda Eckert, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Washington and an expert in the causes of cervical cancer. \u201cThe vaccine is safe. Full stop.\u201d",
      "Eckert, who was not involved with the reviews, praised them as \u201cmethodically rigorous,\u201d \u201crobust\u201d and \u201cgold standard.\u201d",
      "The new reports are backed up by recent real-world findings. In late November, an Australian cervical cancer research organization announced that, almost certainly due to HPV vaccination, there were no new cases in 2021 in women under age 25, a milestone not seen since data had been gathered starting in 1982.  Last year, Scotland\u2019s public health agency found that there were no new cervical cancer cases in women fully vaccinated as youths.",
      "\u201cWe did a search of social media, looking at all of the things that people were saying HPV was associated with,\u201d said Jo Morrison, senior author of the Cochrane reviews and a gynecological oncology consultant at Somerset NHS Foundation Trust in England. According to her team\u2019s papers, the claims included that the vaccine caused infertility, chronic fatigue syndrome and paralysis. \u201cWhat we found was that the evidence very clearly shows that there\u2019s no association with the various things that people worry about,\u201d she said.",
      "Specifically, the team found that serious adverse health outcomes were rare and occurred at similar rates regardless of whether trial participants received the vaccine or a placebo.",
      "The reviews come as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an anti-vaccine activist, has increasingly stepped up scrutiny over childhood immunizations, overall.",
      "Kennedy has profited financially from waging vaccine-injury lawsuits against Merck, the manufacturer of the Gardasil HPV vaccine. In 2019, he called Gardasil \u201cthe most dangerous vaccine ever.\u201d Pressed during his Senate confirmation hearing by Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., Kennedy refused to say whether the vaccine was safe.",
      "HHS didn\u2019t return a request for comment.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in guidance established prior to Kennedy\u2019s HHS tenure, recommends vaccinating boys and girls against HPV at ages 11 to 12, before they become sexually active. More broadly, the agency recommends Gardasil for ages 9 through 26. People up to age 45 are eligible for vaccination.",
      "The HPV strains that Gardasil targets can cause multiple cancers in both men and women, including anal, vulval, oropharyngeal (back of the throat), vaginal and penile cancer. About 48,000 cases of cancer linked to HPV, including some 13,360 cervical cancer cases, are diagnosed annually in the U.S.",
      "However, since HPV vaccination began, the U.S. cervical cancer rate plunged 65% from 2012 to 2019 among women in their early 20s \u2014 the first American cohort to receive the shots, according to a 2023 study from the American Cancer Society.",
      "Morrison said the Cochrane reviews were likely only able to determine with certainty that the HPV vaccine prevents cervical cancer because the other HPV-linked cancers generally take longer to develop. For now, it\u2019s unclear whether vaccination reduces rates of the other cancers, she said.",
      "Anxieties about Gardasil have persisted since it was first approved two decades ago.",
      "Morgan Newman, 35, of Norwalk, Iowa, was offered the HPV vaccine at a medical appointment the year Gardasil was approved. Then 16, she went against her parents\u2019 wishes and declined, feeling the vaccine was too new and she didn\u2019t know enough about it.",
      "Eight years later, she was diagnosed with cervical cancer. She underwent chemotherapy and radiation, only for the cancer to metastasize two years later.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re brought to the brink of death,\u201d she recalled of the brutal treatment, which led to her infertility.",
      "Nearly a decade into remission, Newman is an outlier for continuing to survive stage IV cervical cancer.",
      "\u201cCancer is a gift wrapped in barbed wire,\u201d she said, noting that she lives with lymphedema, a permanent side effect of chemo that causes painful fluid retention. \u201cI\u2019m grateful to be here, but I want to make sure that whatever I do has purpose behind it.\u201d",
      "She\u2019s become a social worker and volunteers for Cervivor, a cervical cancer advocacy nonprofit.",
      "Newman recalled her mindset as a teenager about the prospect that she could ever develop a vaccine-preventable cancer. \u201cI told my mom, \u2018No, that\u2019ll never happen to me,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "According to annual CDC survey data, HPV vaccination rates, disrupted by the Covid pandemic, flatlined among  13- to 17-year-olds from 2022 to 2024. About 78% of these teens ultimately received at least one dose and 63% completed the multidose vaccination. Meanwhile, rates of other vaccinations the CDC recommends for adolescents increased during this period and topped 90%.",
      "A 2024 study published in The Lancet Regional Health found that white families in the U.S. and those with higher incomes were less likely to intend to vaccinate their children against HPV; safety concerns were the most common reason.",
      "Among the worries are that providing a vaccine against an STI might eventually lead to sexual risk-taking among children, although Harvard University-based research has found no evidence to support it.",
      "A Seattle mother who requested her name not be used for privacy said she hesitated when her pediatrician recommended Gardasil for her adolescent children, now 15 and 17.",
      "\u201cI remember thinking, well, my kids aren\u2019t sexually active,\u201d the 49-year-old mother said of the prospect of vaccinating against an STI. \u201cThen I thought, well, I might as well just do it. Let\u2019s cover all the bases.\u201d"

    "summary": "The members of 5 Seconds of Summer discuss their new album, \"Everyone's a Star!\", the inspiration and 15 years together.",
    "story": [
      "For the first time, when the members of Australian band 5 Seconds of Summer started to create their sixth album, they already knew what they wanted it to look and feel like.",
      "\"When you can see something in your head, it's more inspiring to get there,\" guitarist Michael Clifford says. \"You're not shooting in the dark like, 'I wonder what this is gonna be like?' You have an idea, and you can drive the ship there.\"",
      "The result was \"Everyone's A Star,\" which dropped Nov. 14. Arguably their most meta album yet, the 12 tracks \u2014 plus four bonus tracks on a deluxe edition that dropped Nov. 17 \u2014 discuss fame, self-destruction and the \"boyband\" culture they've at times rejected and embraced since the group formed in 2011.",
      "The album is less about the personal inspirations that defined their previous hits and more about a \"togetherness,\" says bassist Calum Hood\u00a0\u2014 fitting for a band that is still standing after each member has released at least one solo album.",
      "Below, 5 Seconds of Summer discuss new aspects to their sound, preparing for the \"Everyone\u2019s a Star! World Tour\" and the \"larger-than-life\" characters featured on their latest album \u2014 the band's first in three years.",
      "This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.",
      "Calum Hood: It's definitely not a singular conversation that we have at the start of every album. We don't all sit down together and be like, \"OK, what have we accomplished?\"",
      "I feel like we've lived so much life in this band, we intuitively know the different paths that we've taken. And it's very much an intuition-lead thing, moving into a new album process, examining what's happening in everyone's lives, and seeing where that collectively wants to go.",
      "Luke Hemmings: \"No. 1 Obsession\" was the first one. And that was like, \"OK, this feels like it's ticking all the boxes.\" It felt very 5SOS, reclaiming back a bit of that punk rock, garage spirit, but had lyrics that felt very eye catching, even though it's ear catching, I guess.",
      "And that was the one to beat for a while. It felt like a nice blueprint to go from there, because it takes a minute to figure out what the next album's sounds going to be like. You're sort of stabbing in the dark for a while \u2014 especially after the last album had a very specific sound and feeling to it. We love challenging that on the next album, trying to totally 180-flip ... (and saying) what does it feel like if we did the opposite?",
      "LH: Sonically, it has a lot of dance elements in it, like New York and London, Cassius, Prodigy, those dancier acts that still feel like they have a rawness to them. And it's mixed (with a sound) only 5SOS could do; ironic, tongue-in-cheek lyrics, but with lots of wisdom behind it. There's a little bit of social satire and self- deprecating humor in it. The sound is a mix of the pop rock, punk, garage band we started as, but mixed in with more dance element roots.",
      "That kind of sounds confusing as f---. (Laughs.) So I don't know.",
      "Michael Clifford: I don't think so.",
      "I think we're finally old enough \u2014\u00a0we're not old, sorry \u2014 we're young enough. We've been doing this for a minute, not too long, but we've been doing it for a little bit and we are able to understand a little bit more, just get perspective on things. I think that it was crucial for us to be able to have that perspective in order to make an album that has those types of themes in it.",
      "And like Luke said, trying to flip it on its head and trying to do the opposite of the last thing that we did, I think, was what we found so exciting about this.",
      "This has been the first time that we've really made an album knowing what we wanted it to look like and feel like in mind. We sort of had an idea of the theme and the feeling that we wanted this to evoke. So it made making it a lot easier and more inspiring. When you can see something in your head, sometimes it's more inspiring to get there because you're not shooting in the dark and like, \"I wonder what this is gonna be like?\" You kind of have an idea and you can drive the ship there.",
      "CH: It's definitely a cool feeling. These guys are kind of the only other three that can really resonate with my life's journey the last 15 years. I gain a lot of comfort from that. And it differs within our last albums, where a lot of the songs thematically come very personally. It's very personal-led, that's how we start songs. But this album felt more \u2014 there was a togetherness of the theme of the album and conceptually that felt really fresh and new. And there's definitely, subconsciously, a lot of healing from that, too.",
      "LH: I feel good. The last show we did, the \"Five Seconds of Summer Show,\" it felt like we unlocked our full evolution, or almost full evolution, as a band with mixing in the 10-year anniversary skits. It was more of treating it as an entertainment piece, as opposed to just ... (getting) out there and crank(ing) out some songs and play as a band. But it had multimedia and it was blurring the lines between the video and then the on-screen and onstage. It was really fun to do and it felt like the most \"us\" a show has been.",
      "So this time, because the characters that we have in this album, their egos are a bit more inflated, the show will reflect that. The people that have the big heads in \"Telephone Busy\" \u2014 those guys are making the show. They're behind the wheel and they're kind of crazy.",
      "MC: They've got some damage.",
      "LH: (Laughs.) It'll be like the 5SOS show we did but on steroids.",
      "MC: Not even steroids.",
      "LH: What's crazier than steroids?",
      "MC: Nothing that's appropriate to say on the TODAY show.",
      "CH: No, no, it's like Green Goblin-esque.",
      "LH: So if the Green Goblin was the fifth. Does that make any sense? (Laughs.)",
      "MC: I don't know. It's not as heady and narrative as that, but it sometimes made approaching concepts \u2014 and like Calum was saying \u2014 instead of going into the meaning of a song and being like, \"Do I personally resonate with this?\" It was more about like, \"Does my place within this story we're trying to tell, how do I embody that?\" Rather than trying to do anything that's too narratively driven. We always are going to be ourselves. We're just  ourselves in an alternate universe.",
      "LH: It's like the larger than life version of ourselves and we're back together. Especially after doing separate solo things, now together \u2014 we are like super, super 5SOS, I guess.",
      "CH: SuperSOS.",
      "MC: The conversation that we had behind it was like, we're our best, biggest versions of ourselves \u2014 well I'm the best, biggest version of myself when I'm doing my solo music \u2014\u00a0but also when I do the band's music. So they're the best versions of themselves when they're in the band.",
      "LH: This is a confusing read. (Laughs).",
      "CH: I agree, you're not your best version.",
      "MC: No, I said I am.",
      "LH: You're not your best version right now. (Laughs.)",
      "LH: We were telling people when we first started that we're going to be a band for 10, 15, 20, 30 years. And everyone, when you're 16 and 17, they're like, \"OK, cool,\" because usually the life cycle of a boy band is short. It's like a butterfly or something.",
      "MC: I think Ash has something to say as well.",
      "Ashton Irwin (mid-hair and makeup): What? ... Don't talk to me while I'm getting my makeup done.",
      "LH: You can legitimately quote that.",
      "I don't know if I'd tell (my younger self) anything. I'd just maybe, I'd just give him a soft drink. Maybe a cheeky pat on the back would be nice.",
      "CH: Maybe a foot-long Subway sandwich. Call it a day.",
      "LH: We've been telling people we're going to be a band for this long and I'm really happy that we stuck it out. We have a f------ amazing fan base that let us change and evolve and experiment with new sounds and looks and everything, and I still feel the same. And that's crazy to be some people's No. 1 obsession still. Sometimes I just feel like I'm a walking ghost.",
      "MC: Can I get a drink on the rocks?"

    "story": [
      "MOSCOW \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s special envoy tasked with negotiating an end to Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, as well as his son-in-law, faced a daunting task in Moscow on Tuesday.",
      "Nearly four years after Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s full-scale invasion of his smaller neighbor, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are grappling with an empowered Russia, plus Ukraine on the back foot both on and off the battlefield. Kyiv\u2019s troops, facing a dire manpower crisis, cling onto strategic hubs, and a major corruption scandal has shaken President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s government and seen his top negotiator removed.",
      "Witkoff, the man whom Washington has sent to negotiate with Putin this week, is viewed with suspicion by Kyiv and its allies after a leaked phone call suggested he was advising Moscow on how to deal with Trump, according to a transcript published by Bloomberg News.",
      "Russian state media reported Tuesday that the meeting between Putin and Witkoff lasted nearly five hours.",
      "Putin\u2019s special envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, posted a single word on X after the meeting: \"Productive.\"",
      "A leaked 28-point plan proposed by the U.S. last month was widely deemed as capitulating to Russia.",
      "\u201cThe Kremlin simply doesn\u2019t want a deal that\u2019s anything short of what it wants,\u201d such as a watered-down security guarantee for Ukraine and territorial concessions by Kyiv, said Michael A. Horowitz, an independent geopolitical and security analyst who has followed the war closely.",
      "From Ukraine\u2019s perspective, acceding to most of Russia\u2019s demands sets it up for a third invasion, \u201cafter 2014 and 2022,\u201d Horowitz added, referring to Russia\u2019s military backing of separatists in Ukraine\u2019s east in 2014 and the full-scale invasion eight years later.",
      "The 'three pillars'",
      "Putin has never hidden his hard-line demands.",
      "He has sought the capture of all of Ukraine\u2019s eastern industrial region of Donbas, comprising the contested Donetsk region and Russian-controlled Luhansk. (Russia holds about one-fifth of Ukraine\u2019s territory.) He has also called for Ukraine to be \u201cdemilitarized,\u201d essentially rendering the country defenseless, and a final peace settlement to be acknowledged in international law.",
      "\u201cThere are three pillars on which we will not compromise,\u201d according to a Russian official briefed on the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity. \u201cOne is the territory of the Donbas. The second is a limit on Ukraine\u2019s armed forces. The third is the recognition of territory by America and Europe.\u201d",
      "Moscow is prepared to be flexible on certain secondary issues, the official said this week, like hundreds of billions in Russian assets frozen in Europe at the beginning of the war. Ukraine and its European allies have called for the funds to be used to boost Ukraine\u2019s shattered economy.",
      "Trump\u2019s peace plan envisions that roughly one-third of the frozen assets, or $100 billion, would be invested in the U.S.-led efforts to rebuild Ukraine. According to the original leaked 28-point plan, the U.S. would receive 50% of the profits from this venture. No specific details have been released about the plan that was whittled down to 20 points during Sunday\u2019s talks between U.S. and Ukrainian officials in Florida.",
      "But Abbas Gallyamov, a Russian political analyst and former Putin speech writer, told NBC News he thinks Putin could be willing to compromise.",
      "\u201cThe most important thing you need to understand is he can\u2019t afford to fall out with Trump. It would be quite suicidal,\u201d Gallyamov said. And while the Russian economy has not been devastated by the war, in the long term Putin understands that ramped-up sanctions by Trump would make economic recovery very difficult, if not impossible, he said.",
      "\u201cIf Trump will really press him, Putin will agree to end the fighting \u2014 maybe with the calculation that he will build up strength, quickly organize some sort of provocation in the spring to blame on the Ukrainians and hit again,\u201d Gallyamov added.",
      "A lot depends on what the Americans demand, Gallyamov said, adding that Putin may be willing to agree to a ceasefire over Christmas and New Year\u2019s.",
      "But Putin is unlikely to truly end the war without intense pressure from the U.S., he added.",
      "What could Putin accept?",
      "Witkoff and Kushner arrived in Moscow fresh from talks with Ukraine in Florida this weekend, which both Washington and Kyiv deemed productive, without sharing details.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the last chance for Russia to convince Witkoff, and Witkoff must convince Trump that the Russian view is the correct one,\u201d said Andrei Fedorov, Russia\u2019s former deputy foreign minister.",
      "Putin has signaled for months, even before the diplomatic flurry caused by Trump\u2019s 28-point proposal, that he was willing to continue fighting.",
      "In September, he said he welcomed \u201ca certain light at the end of the tunnel\u201d in the wake of Trump\u2019s peace efforts in Alaska. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how the situation develops,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cIf not, we\u2019ll have to resolve all the challenges we face militarily.\u201d",
      "He reiterated this last week, saying fighting would stop when Ukrainian troops withdraw from the territories they hold. \u201cIf they don\u2019t withdraw, we will achieve this by force,\u201d he said.",
      "The leaked 28-point plan would force Ukraine to cede territory, including land it holds in the Donetsk region. It would limit the Ukrainian army to 600,000, down from more than 800,000 currently. It would also bar Ukraine from ever joining the NATO defense alliance \u2014 something that Kyiv has said is a nonstarter.",
      "But according to Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, a Berlin-based think tank, even the leaked plan did not go far enough for Putin.",
      "The 600,000-personnel limit the plan would impose on the Ukrainian army is one sticking point, she wrote in an analysis last week. It would still leave Kyiv with the largest army in Europe.",
      "The draft plan also did not include a total ban on long-range weapons in Ukraine, she added.",
      "The wording is also important for the Russian leader, Stanovaya said. Putin indicated last week that he would want every word of any peace agreement to be carefully weighed, having mocked the language of the original proposal as undiplomatic and, at times, \u201cridiculous.\u201d",
      "If he could write his own version of the peace plan, Horowitz said, Putin would legally claim all four Ukrainian provinces he illegally annexed in 2022, not just Donetsk and Luhansk; reduce Ukraine\u2019s army to one-tenth of its current size; complete the so-called denazification of Ukraine, which is code for a Russian say in Ukraine\u2019s future and removal of nationalist parties; and lift all sanctions.",
      "While Putin does not necessarily think these demands would be achievable, Horowitz said, he thinks the final deal should be closer to his ideal peace than that of Ukraine \u2014 and he is prepared to wait if that\u2019s not the case.",
      "\u201cThe problem, of course, is that this \u2018ideal deal\u2019 means Russia will be encouraged to invade Ukraine again \u2014 beyond what it already occupies,\u201d he added.",

      "Pointing out that members of Christian populations have a long history of migration \u201cfrom the Middle East to the West from the 19th century,\u201d Salem said \u201cthey were attracted to and feel comfortable going to the West, which is generally Christian.\u201d",

      "Elsewhere, some Syrian Christians have left their country amid concerns about the new government under interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa, former leader of the Islamist insurgent group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. In June, an unprecedented terrorist attack in Damascus on the Greek Orthodox Mar Elias Church during Mass killed at least 30 people and injured 54.",
      "Large numbers had already fled the country, as well as neighboring Iraq, after the Islamic State militant group, or ISIS, declared a caliphate.",

      "\u201cNo one wants to leave their home, especially if their home has been passed down for thousands of years and people have fought for that home to stay there. But we also want to live here with dignity,\u201d Giovanni Lteif, 21, told NBC News in an interview Saturday.",
      "Together with his twin, Charbel Lteif, he has set up \u201cEastern Christians\u201d pages on social media, which have racked up almost 700,000 followers.",
      "\u201cOne of the biggest problems we are facing is how many Christians have left,\u201d Charbel Lteif said, adding that with their videos they were trying to raise awareness and preserve their culture and traditions by creating \u201ca new voice for the Christians in the Middle East and North Africa, a voice that is not political, a voice that is not for anyone\u2019s agenda, a voice that is from the Christians of the East to the whole world.\u201d",
      "Charbel Lteif said churches were \u201cstill very alive,\u201d in Lebanon which has the largest percentage of Christians in the Middle East, making up over a third of the population.",
      "A power sharing agreement has been in place since Lebanon gained independence from France in 1943 in which the president is a Maronite Christian, the parliament speaker is a Shia Muslim and the prime minister is a Sunni Muslim.",
      "This makes Lebanon the only Arab country with a Christian head of state, a tradition that continued earlier this year when President Joseph Aoun, Prime Minister Nawaf Salam and a Cabinet were elected on reformist platforms and vowed to hold those behind the port explosion to account.",
      "Five years on from the blast, no official has been convicted, and years of obstructions by top officials have stalled an investigation and hampered hopes for justice.",
      "With no centralized effort by the Lebanese government to rebuild the surrounding neighborhoods, many families and business owners used their own money to fix their properties or reached out to charities and grassroots initiatives.",
      "At St. Anthony of Padua, Abboud remained hopeful that it would be restored to its former glory.",
      "\u201cWhen the church is closed, it means we\u2019ve lost a piece of our region,\u201d he said. \u201cI say this as a Christian who truly believes we have a mission with our Muslim brothers: a mission of dialogue, a mission of coexistence, of making peace.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The surging number of measles cases around the world is a stark warning sign that outbreaks of other vaccine-preventable diseases could be next, the World Health Organization warned Friday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s crucial to understand why measles matters,\u201d said Dr. Kate O\u2019Brien, director of the WHO\u2019s Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals. \u201cIts high transmissibility means that even small drops in vaccine coverage can trigger outbreaks, like a fire alarm going off when smoke is detected first.\u201d",
      "That is, measles is often the first disease to pop up when vaccination rates overall drop.",
      "\"When we see measles cases, it signals that gaps are almost certainly likely for other vaccine-preventable diseases like diphtheria or whooping cough or polio, even though they may not be setting off the fire alarm just yet,\" O'Brien said at a media briefing Monday, ahead of the release of the WHO's Progress Toward Measles Elimination report, published Friday in its Weekly Epidemiological Record.",
      "Indeed, whooping cough cases are also rising in the United States and are on track to be the most in a decade. More than 20,000 whooping cough cases have been reported so far in 2025, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "In 2024, there were an estimated 11 million measles infections worldwide, according to the report, nearly 800,000 more than were recorded in 2019.",
      "Last year, 59 countries reported large measles outbreaks. In 2025, the United States joined the list of countries.",
      "Elimination status threatened",
      "The ongoing outbreaks threaten the so-called measles elimination statuses of some countries.",
      "Elimination means a virus has stopped spreading in a specific country or region. (Only one virus \u2014 smallpox \u2014 has been eradicated, or wiped out permanently, worldwide.)",
      "In total, 81 countries had reached elimination status in 2024, according to the WHO. Canada eliminated measles in 1998. Two years later, the United States did the same.",
      "Elimination status means a country has the capacity to stop an outbreak when measles cases arrive from abroad, O'Brien said. If vaccination rates are high enough, the virus won't have enough unvaccinated people to infect, halting an outbreak in its tracks.",
      "But vaccination rates in the United States are falling: An NBC News investigation revealed that since 2019, 77% of counties and jurisdictions have reported declines in the number of kids getting routine childhood vaccinations like the measles-mumps-rubella shots.",
      "The key determining factor for a country to lose its measles elimination status is the ongoing spread of the same strain of the virus for a full year.",
      "Canada met that threshold this month. The United States could be next if scientists can trace current cases to a Texas outbreak that began in January.",
      "Nearly all of the samples analyzed from those early cases were identified as a genotype of measles called D8, according to a CDC report published in April.",
      "The D8 genotype was recently detected in a South Carolina outbreak.",
      "Preliminary results from specimens sent from South Carolina to CDC labs \"are the same type, D8, that is seen in other settings in the United States,\" Dr. Linda Bell, state epidemiologist for the South Carolina Department of Public Health, said at a news briefing Tuesday.",
      "Additional genetic sequencing is needed to make a definitive link between the Texas outbreak and the one in South Carolina, as well as outbreaks in Utah and Arizona. A South Carolina Department of Public Health spokesman said the agency \"expects those results in the next few weeks.\"",
      "Bell said that as of Tuesday, 58 cases had been reported in South Carolina, mostly in Spartanburg County in the northwest part of the state.",
      "An outbreak along the border of Arizona and Utah continues to grow. The Arizona Department of Health Services reported 153 cases this week, nearly all in Mohave County.",
      "Cases in Utah have reached 102, according to the state Department of Health and Human Services. While the bulk of those cases are linked to the cluster at the Utah-Arizona border, case numbers are also rising near Salt Lake City. NBC affiliate KSL reported that eight students at a high school in Wasatch County had been diagnosed.",
      "As of Wednesday, the CDC had reported 1,798 confirmed measles cases in 42 states in 2025. Three people, an adult in New Mexico and two little girls in Texas, have died."

    "story": [
      "In the latest twist in human evolution, scientists have discovered that a mysterious foot found in Ethiopia belonged to a previously unknown ancient relative.",
      "Dated to around 3.4 million years ago, the species was likely similar to Lucy, an ancient human relative who lived in the area at around the same time, according to a study published Wednesday in the scientific journal Nature.",
      "But researchers found that the Burtele foot \u2014 named after the place in northeastern Ethiopia where it was discovered in 2009 \u2014  was unmistakably different.",
      "With an opposable big toe resembling a human thumb, the fossilized Burtele foot suggests its owner was a skilled climber, spending more time in the trees than Lucy, the study said.",
      "For decades, Lucy\u2019s species was considered the ancestor of all later hominids \u2014 an ancient relative more closely related to humans, including Homo sapiens, than to chimpanzees.",
      "Scientists were unable to confirm the foot belonged to a new species until they were able to study new fossils, including a jawbone with 12 teeth, that were found at the same site.",
      "After identifying them as Australopithecus deyiremeda, they found the Burtele foot belonged to the same species.",
      "John Rowan, an assistant professor in human evolution at Britain\u2019s University of Cambridge, said their conclusion was \u201cvery reasonable.\u201d",
      "\u201cNow we have much stronger evidence that, at the same time, there lived a closely related but adaptively distinct species,\u201d Rowan, who was not associated with the study, told NBC News in an email Thursday.",
      "The study also looked at how these species shared the same environment. The research team, led by Yohannes Haile-Selassie from Arizona State University, concluded that the new species spent much of its time in the forest.",
      "Lucy, or Australopithecus afarensis, likely roamed the ground, the study said, before going on to suggest that the two species likely had different diets and used the landscape in different ways.",
      "Multiple examinations of the newly found teeth indicated that A. deyiremeda was more primitive than Lucy and likely relied on a diet of leaves, fruit and nuts, the study said.",
      "\u201cThese differences meant that they were unlikely to be directly competing for the same resources,\u201d said Ashleigh L.A. Wiseman, an assistant research professor at the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, which is also based at the U.K.\u2019s University of Cambridge.",
      "Highlighting the broader impact of this discovery on our understanding of evolution, Wiseman said in an email Thursday that the findings reminded us \u201cthat human evolution wasn\u2019t a straight ladder with one species turning into the next.\u201d",
      "Instead, she said, it should be viewed as a family tree with several so-called \u201ccousins\u201d alive at the same time, and each having a different way of surviving. \u201cDid they interact? We will likely never know the answer to that question,\u201d she added.",
      "Rowan also contended that as the number of well-documented human-related species grows, so do our questions about our ancestry. \u201cWhich species were our direct ancestors? Which were close relatives? That\u2019s the tricky part,\u201d he said. \u201cAs species diversity grows, so do the number of plausible reconstructions for how human evolution played out.\u201d",
      "And Wiseman cautioned against making definitive species assignments, as those should rest on well-preserved parts of skull and fossils that belong to multiple associated individuals. While the new research strengthens the case for A. deyiremeda\u2019s existence, she said, it \u201cdoesn\u2019t remove all other alternative interpretations.\u201d"

      "Netanyahu is facing charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate cases. Prosecutors have alleged that he exchanged regulatory favors with media owners in Israel seeking positive press coverage.",

      "Under Israel\u2019s Basic Law, the country\u2019s president has the power to pardon criminals or reduce their sentence.

      "Omar has served in Congress since 2019.",
      "Later, Trump called her \u201cgarbage. Her friends are garbage. These aren\u2019t people that work. These aren\u2019t people that say, 'Let\u2019s go, come on, let\u2019s make this place great.' These are people that do nothing but complain.\u201d",
      "\"You know, if they came from paradise, and they said, 'This isn't paradise,' but when they come from hell and they complain and do nothing but b---, we don\u2019t want them in our country. Let them go back to where they came from and fix it,\" he added.",
      "A representative for Omar did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Trump's remarks come as a senior law enforcement official told NBC News that Immigration and Customs Enforcement is planning an operation in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area this week. The official said ICE officers are not specifically targeting the Somali community, but may be arresting some Somalis who are in violation of immigration laws.",
      "The planned operation was first reported by The New York Times.",

      "Trump said, \"Somalians ripped off that state for billions of dollars, billions, every year, billions of dollars, and they contribute nothing.\"",
      "Walz, the 2024 Democratic vice presidential nominee, told NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday the fraudsters are going to jail, and \"to demonize an entire community on the actions of a few, it\u2019s lazy.\"",
      "There are an estimated 80,000 Somalis in Minnesota, and Walz said Trump is \"demonizing an entire group of people who came here, fleeing civil war, and created a vibrant community that makes Minnesota and this country better. But that\u2019s Donald Trump: deflect, demonize, come up with no solutions. He\u2019s not going to help fix anything on fraud.\"",
      "In his remarks Tuesday, Trump called Walz \"a grossly incompetent man. There's something wrong with him.\""

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s special envoy is meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Tuesday for highly anticipated talks that Washington hopes will convince the Kremlin to end the war in Ukraine.",
      "Fresh off negotiations with Ukrainian officials in Florida this weekend, the envoy, Steve Witkoff, is expected to lay out for Putin a version of the peace plan that Kyiv has agreed to, hoping the Russian leader will compromise on his hard-line demands.",
      "For months, Moscow has reiterated its readiness for peace while also signaling that it is not willing to ease off on its core maximalist demands, which would leave Ukraine weak and isolated.",
      "\"This will be, we have no doubt, a very important step towards a peaceful settlement,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday.",
      "Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner will also participate in the talks between Witkoff and Putin, Peskov said.",
      "Russian state media followed Witkoff's plane arriving in Moscow and then his motorcade driving away from the capital's Vnukovo airport. State news agency Tass shared a video of Witkoff and Kushner walking around a festive Moscow, just outside Red Square, alongside one of Russia's key negotiators, Kirill Dmitriev, before their meeting with Putin.",
      "Shortly before his scheduled meeting with the American delegation, Putin addressed an investment forum where he said his army held the advantage in Ukraine, while criticizing European leaders for hindering the peace process.",
      "Russia has no intention of going to war with European countries, but if Europe starts a war, Russia is ready \u201cright now,\u201d Putin told reporters.",
      "The details of the latest version of Trump's peace plan have not been released. An original proposal approved by Trump last month was seen as heavily biased toward Russia, and would have forced Kyiv to cede its territories to Moscow, including the land that it currently controls. It would have limited the size of Kyiv's army and barred Ukraine from ever joining NATO.",
      "The proposal blindsided Kyiv, which launched a storm of negotiations in Europe and the U.S. to try to amend the plan and make it more palatable to Ukraine.",
      "Putin invaded Ukraine in February 2022 in what has become Europe\u2019s largest conflict since World War II. Despite Russia expecting Ukraine to surrender in a matter of days, the war has dragged on. The Ukrainian army, backed by Western weapons, has managed to not only resist the onslaught, but also counterattack. Still, Russian forces are now in control of roughly one-fifth of Ukrainian territory.",
      "Any resolution that the U.S. manages to broker could shape the future of not just Ukraine, but also the entire continent by either aligning with Russia and rewarding aggression or backing Ukraine and the security structure currently in place.",
      "Ahead of Putin's meeting with Witkoff and Kushner, some Muscovites expressed hope for an agreement and peace.",
      "\"Everyone is tired of this,\" Igor Andreev, 39, told NBC News in central Moscow, standing on a street opposite the U.S. Embassy. \"I can\u2019t afford many products,\" said Andreev, who works in marketing. \"We are in isolation; I can\u2019t go to another country. Everyone is tired of this situation. I think it needs to end in peace. Everyone is tired of [hearing about] victims. We want love to prevail.\"",
      "Sidelined by Washington, Europe has been scrambling to respond to Trump's peace proposals. Its efforts have not been sufficient to turn around Ukraine's fortunes on the battlefield, although it has increased its aid to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's beleaguered government.",
      "As focus shifts to talks in Moscow, Zelenskyy has been on a visible diplomatic offensive in Europe as he struggles to boost backing for Ukraine.",
      "After meeting with Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin in Dublin on Tuesday, Zelenskyy said that \u201cany future steps will depend on the signals\u201d he gets after the meeting between the American and Russian delegations. \u201cIf the signals align and if there is fair play from our partners, we may meet very soon,\u201d he said.",
      "Putin signaled last week that he was ready for a \u201cserious\u201d discussion with the U.S. and said that a version of the plan that was agreed during talks with Ukrainian officials in Geneva last month could form the \"framework\" of a final peace settlement. Still, he said his army had the upper hand on the battlefield and if no agreement was reached, he would get what he wanted by force.",
      "Wearing a military uniform, Putin received reports from his generals Monday that Russian troops have completely \"liberated\" the city of Pokrovsk, an important Ukrainian transport and supply hub in the Donetsk region. Ukraine denied reports that the city was entirely under Russian control. Pokrovsk's capture could serve as a springboard for the Russian military to threaten bigger cities and the whole region.",
      "It comes as Zelenskyy's government has been weakened by a major corruption scandal. His powerful chief of staff and top negotiator, Andriy Yermak, resigned last week after being implicated in the probe."

    "summary": "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Navy Adm. Frank M. Bradley ordered the subsequent strike on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The White House confirmed Monday that the U.S. did launch a second strike on an alleged drug boat from Venezuela in early September and that it was ordered by Adm. Frank M. Bradley, who at the time headed the Joint Special Operations Command.",
      "The follow-up strike killed the survivors of an initial U.S. strike on the vessel, which the Trump administration has said originated from Venezuela. Some lawmakers and legal experts say that second attack could constitute a war crime.",
      "\u201cWith respect to the strikes in question on Sept. 2, Secretary Hegseth authorized Adm. Bradley to conduct these kinetic strikes,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement during Monday's briefing.",
      "\u201cAdm. Bradley worked well within his authority and the law directing the engagement to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the United States of America was eliminated,\" she added.",
      "U.S. Special Operations Command, which Bradley now leads as commander, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Washington Post reported that Bradley had ordered the second strike, and that he was complying with an order from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to \u201ckill everybody.\u201d NBC News has not confirmed the detail about Hegseth.",
      "One U.S. official and a source familiar with the Pentagon\u2019s actions on Sept. 2 told NBC News recently that the first of the two strikes conducted that day left at least two survivors, with the subsequent strike killing them.",
      "Hegseth, in a social media post Monday night, also indicated that Bradley ordered the second strike. \"Let\u2019s make one thing crystal clear: Admiral Mitch Bradley is an American hero, a true professional, and has my 100% support. I stand by him and the combat decisions he has made \u2014 on the September 2 mission and all others since.\"",
      "On Sunday, President Donald Trump told reporters that Hegseth didn't order the second strike.",
      "\"He said he didn't do it,\" said Trump, who also said he didn't know if the second strike even happened. The president said he \"wouldn't have wanted\" it, adding that \"Pete said he did not want them.\" Asked again if there was no second strike, Trump said: \"I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m going to find out about it, but Pete said he did not order the death of those two men.\"",
      "Asked Monday what law the U.S. military relied on to justify the second strike, Leavitt said: \u201cThe strike conducted on Sept. 2 was conducted in self-defense to protect Americans in vital United States interests. The strike was conducted in international waters and in accordance with the law of armed conflict.\u201d",
      "She also confirmed that Trump would be meeting with his national security team \u2014 which includes Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller \u2014 in the Oval Office later Monday. A senior White House official confirmed Monday night that the meeting had wrapped.",
      "Leavitt's comments come amid widespread criticism and bipartisan investigations in the House and Senate into the second boat strike. The leaders of the Senate Armed Services Committee \u2014 chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss., and ranking member Jack Reed, D-R.I. \u2014 said in a statement Friday that they will be \"conducting vigorous oversight to determine the facts related to these circumstances.\"",
      "Similarly, the leaders of the House Armed Services Committee \u2014 chairman Mike Rogers, R-Ala., and ranking member Adam Smith, D-Wash. \u2014 said they were taking \"seriously the reports of follow-on strikes on boats alleged to be ferrying narcotics in the SOUTHCOM region and are taking bipartisan action to gather a full accounting of the operation in question.\"",
      "Smith told reporters Monday night that he would be receiving a classified briefing this week from Bradley about the strikes. He added that it would be \"helpful\" to have Hegseth testify.",
      "The details of the briefing with Bradley are still being worked out, Smith said, but he indicated that they are aiming for it to take place Thursday.",
      "Bradley is expected to be in Washington this week to speak with senior lawmakers about the strikes, according to two people familiar with the matter.",
      "Wicker, who also said he will be speaking with Bradley, said Monday that he has spoken with Hegseth about the second strike. The defense secretary is also expected to have spoken or is soon speaking with other lawmakers, according to two other people familiar with matter.",
      "Wicker and Smith both said they have spoken with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Dan Caine.",
      "A spokesperson for the Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.",
      "Hegseth has defended the numerous U.S. strikes in the Caribbean, saying in a post on X Friday after The Washington Post article was published that \"these highly effective strikes are specifically intended to be 'lethal, kinetic strikes.'\"",
      "\"Our current operations in the Caribbean are lawful under both U.S. and international law, with all actions in compliance with the law of armed conflict \u2014 and approved by the best military and civilian lawyers, up and down the chain of command,\" he wrote.",
      "Hegseth received backlash on social media after he posted on his personal X account what appeared to be an AI-generated image of the children's book character Franklin, with the title, \"Franklin targets Narco Terrorists.\" It shows Franklin, a turtle, standing on the edge of a helicopter aiming a machine gun at boats allegedly carrying drugs.",
      "The strikes in the Caribbean are part of an escalating pressure campaign the Trump administration is waging against Venezuela. Trump declared in a Truth Social post Saturday that Venezuela's airspace should be considered \"closed,\" which came as the U.S. is considering military action against the South American nation."

      "Zelenskyy has previously railed against corrupt officials, but signs that a corruption scandal may have stretched into his inner circle may provide more ammunition to critics of further support for Ukraine. Trump-aligned figures, including Vice President JD Vance, have previously criticized Ukraine for its issues with corruption.",
      "Yermak\u2019s departure may \u201creinforce skepticism within the Trump administration\u201d about Zelenskyy\u2019s inner circle, giving them further reasons to push for concessions, said Natia Seskuria, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank.",
      "But Horowitz said the resignation \u201cremoves a lightning rod for controversy and gives Kyiv a cleaner, more collective mandate to say no to an unfair and unsustainable peace,\u201d adding: \u201cZelenskyy is getting his house in order.\u201d",
      "When it comes to how the rule of law is being enforced in Ukraine, \u201cgenerally this is a good sign,\u201d said Moritz Brake, a senior fellow at the Center for Advanced Security, Strategic and Integration Studies.",
      "\u201cOf course, it\u2019s bad enough that these accusations existed in the first place,\u201d he added, but \u201ceven those in the highest places are prosecuted when suspicions arise.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy said in a video statement on Friday that he was looking for Yermak\u2019s replacement. \u201cRussia really wants Ukraine to make mistakes,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be no mistakes on our part.\u201d",
      "Losing unity could mean losing the country and its future, he added.",
      "But Bociurkiw said time is \u201cnot on Ukraine\u2019s side right now.\u201d",
      "If you\u2019re Ukraine at the moment, he added, \u201cyou need not only a physical army, but an army of diplomats and advocates.\u201d"

      "The rolling plains of Kenya\u2019s Maasai Mara and the millions of animals that live there face a shiny new intrusion: a gleaming Ritz-Carlton safari camp.",
      "With private plunge pools, butler service and panoramic views commanding more than $5,000 a night, the 20-hectare lodge has become a luxury lightning rod for controversy.",
      "Leaders of the Maasai \u2014 an ethnic group of traditionally nomadic herders with ancestral ties to the area \u2014 and conservationists warn the new tourist destination threatens a migration corridor vital to the movement of vast numbers of animals and have filed a lawsuit to halt its operations.",
      "What's at stake, they argue, is not just a new lodge, but the accelerating pressures of tourism on wildlife, biodiversity and the very spectacle that draws these tourists in the first place.",
      "The camp opened on Aug. 15 during the height of the Great Migration, where millions of wildebeest, zebras and other grazing animals move back and forth between the Serengeti plains in Tanzania and the Maasai Mara National Reserve (MMNR) in Kenya, a process that researchers say allows animals to find food and water and maintain genetic diversity among herds.",
      "Tourists have long flocked to the savannah by the hundreds of thousands, hoping to witness one of the largest movements of mammals in the world, as herds cross rivers and plains teeming with predators.",
      "But the new camp, which boasts \u201cfront-row seats to one of the world's greatest natural wonders\u201d on its website, may threaten the migration that visitors come to witness, conservations and Maasai leaders say.",
      "The Ritz-Carlton camp, on a bend in the Sand River, sits on \u201cone of the most favored corridors for these animals,\u201d Maasai elder Meitamei Olol Dapash told NBC News in an interview Sunday.",
      "\u201cAny guide will tell you, that is the crossing they use,\u201d said Dapash, who filed a lawsuit in August in a Kenyan court against Ritz-Carlton's owner, Marriott International, the world\u2019s largest hotel chain, as well as the project\u2019s local owner and operator, Lazizi Mara Limited, and Kenyan authorities.",
      "Dapash, executive director of the Institute for Maasai Education, Research and Conservation (MERC), who has a PhD in Sustainability Education from Prescott College in Arizona, alleges in the lawsuit that the 20-suite camp obstructs the crucial migration corridor and is asking the court to restore the land to its original condition.",
      "He told NBC News in an interview there had been instances of wildebeest turning back to avoid the camp and that an elephant was seen struggling to find a path across the river after using the location for more than a decade.",
      "\u201cAttachment to the land and to the wildlife exists up to this very day,\u201d Dapash said, adding that the Maasai had seen populations dwindling. The new camp, he added, \u201cwas the last straw for us, we just didn\u2019t want to let this happen.\u201d",
      "The Kenya Wildlife Service government agency pushed back at claims the lodge has impacted wildebeest migration, citing monitoring data that it says shows it does not \u201cfall within, obstruct, or interfere with any wildebeest migration corridors\u201d and adding that migrating wildebeest \u201care using the entire breadth of the Kenya-Tanzania border.\u201d",
      "It said that \"all ecological, environmental and regulatory requirements were thoroughly met and validated.\"",
      "Marriott International told NBC News that the development underwent an environmental impact assessment (EIA) \u201cin full compliance with\u201d Kenya's environmental protections.",
      "The company said it is committed to \u201cthe principles of responsible tourism\u201d but declined to comment on Dapash's claims that the Ritz-Carlton blocked a key route for local wildlife or its own steps to mitigate the construction's impact, saying these were matters for Narok County, which manages the reserve on the Maasai\u2019s behalf.",
      "Narok County did not respond to NBC News' request for comment. In court documents seen by NBC News, the county claims that the safari camp complies with the Maasai Mara Management Plan, which imposes a moratorium on new developments amid concerns that poorly regulated tourism was stifling wildlife migration and threatening the reserve\u2019s ecosystem.",
      "Lazizi Mara Limited said the moratorium is part of the case before the court, adding: \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t\u202fwant to comment on\u202fissues\u202fthat are pending determination.\u201d",
      "Dapash told NBC News that he had \"no issue with business, but this is not just about hotel, it is about the long-term survival of the game reserve.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe feel like we are losing the land, we are losing the wildlife,\u201d he said.",
      "The lawsuit comes amid mounting concerns about the health of the 580-square-mile reserve, where tourist numbers have nearly tripled in recent decades. The Maasai Mara National Reserve reported over 300,000 tourists in 2023. In 1980, total visitor entry was 114,000.",
      "Tourism in the Mara generates an estimated $20 million annually and thousands more indirectly, according to the reserve. In 2023, tourism across the country contributed around 7% of Kenya's gross domestic product, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council.",
      "But the rapid growth in lodges and camps has sometimes clashed with conservation efforts.",
      "\u201cA hotel is never just a hotel,\u201d Dr. Chloe Buiting, a vet and wildlife researcher working in the Maasai Mara, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s infrastructure, it\u2019s roads, it\u2019s changes to the water and the resources and the use of land.\u201d",
      "Seasonal variation in the availability and quality of food forces animals to move around, said Joseph Ogutu, a Kenyan researcher at the University of Hohenheim in Germany. But he said developments like the Ritz-Carlton are having \u201ca negative effect on migration, because most of these facilities are close to rivers where animals either drink water or breed or seek refuge.\u201d",
      "Dapash's cause has also found support among experts and tourism groups.",
      "Grant Hopcraft, a professor of conservation ecology at the University of Glasgow, who has been collaring migratory wildebeest in the Serengeti-Mara since 1999, presented maps and data to the court in October showing \u201cregular cross-border movement of wildebeest\u201d at the location of the lodge, according to his affidavit.",
      "RIDE International, a U.S.-based nonprofit providing cultural exchanges and immersive tours in East Africa, has also thrown its support behind Dapash's lawsuit.",
      "The Mara has been suffering for a long time, said Riley Jon Blackwell, the company's executive director, with \u201clarge hotel chains coming in and trying to service the luxury guests who command to see the best of the best for wildlife.\u201d",
      "The Ritz-Carlton safari camp was \u201cnot surprising,\u201d he added in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s just kind of a culmination of a long time, of a direction of things leading this way.\u201d",
      "The camp holds a 2.2-star rating on Google Reviews, with many posters criticizing its environmental impact. Others have praised their stay at the park.",
      "A court is scheduled to hear the case in December.",
      "If Dapash is successful with his lawsuit, Buiting said it could \u201cset a very interesting precedent\u201d for future developments in the reserve.",
      "\u201cFrom a legal perspective, this could actually be groundbreaking, a turning point,\u201d she added."

      "\u201cAt the direction of @POTUS, I have directed a full scale, rigorous reexamination of every Green Card for every alien from every country of concern,\u201d USCIS Director Joseph Edlow said Thursday afternoon in a statement on X.",

      "Asked for details on which countries are considered \u201cof concern,\u201d USCIS pointed to a June presidential proclamation listing 19 countries \"considered deficient with regards to screening and vetting.\" Afghanistan is one of the countries on the list, which also includes Haiti, Iran and Venezuela.",
      "The USCIS announcement comes a day after two National Guard members were shot near the White House. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died of her wounds, Trump said Thursday night, while 24-year-old Andrew Wolfe remained hospitalized in critical condition. They were in Washington as part of Trump\u2019s deployment of federal troops to several U.S. cities.",
      "Federal prosecutors say the suspect, an Afghan national who once assisted American forces, was resettled in the U.S. under a program called Operation Allies Welcome during the Biden administration following the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.",
      "Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, said Thursday morning that her office is reviewing the suspect\u2019s immigration history and the vetting process that allowed his entry into the country.",
      "In a long post on X Friday, Director of the National Counterterrorism Center Joe Kent claimed that 85,000 Afghans were admitted to the U.S. under Biden without the \u201crigorous vetting that has protected us in the past.\u201d",
      "He continued, saying that the suspect was \"only vetted to serve as a soldier to fight against the Taliban, AQ, & ISIS IN Afghanistan, he was NOT vetted for his suitability to come to America and live among us as a neighbor, integrate into our communities, or eventually become an American citizen.\"",
      "Those admitted under the Operation Allies Welcome program were required to undergo \"biometric and biographic screenings\" by law enforcement and counterterrorism authorities, according to a fact sheet prepared by the Biden administration.",
      "The suspect's immigration process continued into the Trump administration. He was granted asylum in April of this year, which typically occurs two weeks after a final interview with immigration authorities.",
      "In a video released by the White House, Trump called the attack in Washington, D.C., an \u201cact of terror\u201d and said additional National Guard troops would be deployed to the nation's capital.",
      "The administration said shortly after Trump's remarks that all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals will be halted indefinitely.",
      "Authorities have not provided a motive, but D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said \u201cthis is a targeted shooting,\u201d and that the suspect appeared to target the guard members.",
      "Four senior law enforcement sources briefed on the investigation said the suspect has been identified as 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal.",
      "Speaking with NBC News on Wednesday, a relative of Lakanwal said he arrived in the U.S. in September 2021 after serving in the Afghan Army for 10 years, alongside U.S. Special Forces. Lakanwal was living in Bellingham, Washington, with his wife and five children, the relative said.",
      "\u201cWe were the ones that were targeted by the Taliban in Afghanistan,\u201d said the relative. \u201cI cannot believe it that he might do this.\u201d",
      "A CIA spokesperson said Thursday that the alleged shooter \u201cpreviously worked with the USG (U.S. government), including CIA, as a member of a partner force in Kandahar that ended in 2021 following the withdrawal from Afghanistan.\u201d",
      "Asked Thursday night about Lakanwal's vetting and the fact that he worked with the CIA, Trump responded: \"He went cuckoo. I mean, he went nuts. And that happens too, it happens too often with these people,\" an apparent reference to Afghans who came to the U.S. around the time of the 2021 withdrawal."
