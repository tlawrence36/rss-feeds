Iglesias could potentially be taken in front of the Madrid-based court, which can try alleged crimes by Spanish citizens while they are abroad, according to the court\u2019s press office.",

    "story": [
      "The Defense Department says it is revamping the military newspaper Stars and Stripes to focus on \u201creporting for our warfighters\u201d and eliminate woke distractions",
      "The Pentagon said Thursday that it is changing the independent military newspaper Stars and Stripes so it concentrates on \u201creporting for our warfighters\u201d and no longer includes \u201cwoke distractions.\u201d",
      "That message, in a social media post from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's spokesman, is short on specifics and does not mention the news outlet's legacy of independence from government and military leadership. It comes a day after The Washington Post reported that applicants for jobs at Stars and Stripes were being asked what they would do to support President Donald Trump's policies.",
      "Stars and Stripes traces its lineage to the Civil War and has reported news about the military either in its newspaper or online steadily since World War II, largely to an audience of service members stationed overseas. Roughly half of its budget comes from the Pentagon and its staff members are considered Defense Department employees.",
      "The outlet's mission statement emphasizes that it is \u201ceditorially independent of interference from outside its own editorial chain-of-command\u201d and that it is unique among news organizations tied to the Defense Department in being \u201cgoverned by the principles of the First Amendment.\u201d",
      "Congress established that independence in the 1990s after instances of military leadership getting involved in editorial decisions. During Trump's first term in 2020, Defense Secretary Mark Esper tried to eliminate government funding for Stars and Stripes \u2014 to effectively shut it down \u2014 before he was overruled by the president.",
      "Hegseth's spokesman, Sean Parnell, said on X Thursday that the Pentagon \u201cis returning Stars and Stripes to its original mission: reporting for our warfighters.\u201d He said the department will \u201crefocus its content away from woke distractions.\u201d",
      "\u201cStars and Stripes will be custom tailored to our warfighters,\u201d Parnell wrote. \u201cIt will focus on warfighting, weapons systems, fitness, lethality, survivability and ALL THINGS MILITARY. No more repurposed DC gossip columns; no more Associated Press reprints.\u201d",
      "Parnell did not return a message seeking details. The Daily Wire reported, after speaking a Pentagon spokeswoman, that the plan is to have all Stars and Stripes content written by active-duty service members. Currently, Congress has mandated that the publication's publisher and top editor be civilians, said Max Lederer, its publisher.",
      "The Pentagon also said that half of the outlet's content would be generated by the Defense Department, and that it would no longer publish material from The Associated Press or Reuters news services.",
      "Also Thursday, the Pentagon issued a statement in the Federal Register that it would eliminate some 1990s era directives that governed how Stars and Stripes operates. Lederer said it's not clear what that would mean for the outlet's operations, or whether the Defense Department has the authority to do so without congressional authorization.",
      "The publisher said he believes that Stars and Stripes is valued by the military community precisely because of its independence as a news organization. He said no one at the Pentagon has communicated to him what it wants from Stars and Stripes; he first learned of its intentions from reading Parnell's social media post.",
      "\u201cThis will either destroy the value of the organization or significantly reduce its value,\u201d Lederer said.",

      "\u201cI think it's very important that Stars and Stripes maintains its editorial independence, which is the basis of its credibility,\u201d Smith said. A longtime newspaper editor in Connecticut, Smith's role was created by Congress three decades ago and she reports to the House Armed Services Committee.",
      "It's the latest move by the Trump administration to impose restrictions on journalists. Most reporters from legacy news outlets have left the Pentagon rather than to agree to new rules imposed by Hegseth that they feel would give him too much control over what they report and write. The New York Times has sued to overturn the regulations.",
      "Trump has also sought to shut down government-funded outlets like Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that report independent news about the world in countries overseas.",
      "Also this week, the administration raided the home of a Washington Post journalist as part of an investigation into a contractor accused of stealing government secrets, a move many journalists interpreted as a form of intimidation.",
      "The Post reported that applicants to Stars and Stripes were being asked how they would advance Trump's executive orders and policy priorities in the role. They were asked to identify one or two orders or initiatives that were significant to them. That raised questions about whether it was appropriate for a journalist to be given what is, in effect, a loyalty test.",
      "Smith said it was the government's Office of Personnel Management \u2014 not the newspaper \u2014 that was responsible for the question on job applications and said it was consistent with what was being asked of applicants for other government jobs.",
      "But she said it was not something that should be asked of journalists. \u201cThe loyalty is to the truth, not the administration,\u201d she said.",

      "The avant-noise artist Kim Gordon debuted solo music 10 years ago",
      "NEW YORK -- Ten years ago, Kim Gordon \u2014 a revolutionary force in the alternative rock band Sonic Youth, the \u201980s New York no wave scene and the space between art and noise \u2014 debuted solo music. At the time, she was already decades into a celebrated, mixed-medium creative career.",
      "The midtempo \u201cMurdered Out\u201d was her first single, where clangorous, overdubbed guitars met the unmistakable rasp of her deadpan intonations. It was a surprise from an experimentalist well-versed in the unexpected: The song took inspiration from Los Angeles car culture, and its main collaborator was the producer Justin Raisen, then best known for his pop work with Sky Ferreira and Charli XCX. Their partnership has continued in the decade since, and on March 13, Gordon will drop her third solo album, \u201cPlay Me,\u201d announced Wednesday alongside the release of a hazy, transcendent single, \u201cNot Today.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was a happy accident,\u201d she says of her continued work with Raisen. \u201cIn the beginning, I was somewhat skeptical of working with a producer and collaborator, really. But it\u2019s turned out to be incredibly freeing.\u201d",
      "\u201cPlay Me\u201d follows Gordon's critically lauded, beat-heavy 2024 album \u201cThe Collective,\u201d a noisy body of work that featured oddball trap blasts. It earned her two Grammy nominations \u2014 a career first \u2014 for alternative music album and alternative music performance. Those were for the song \u201cBye Bye,\u201d with its eerie, dissonant beat originally written for rapper Playboi Carti. For \u201cPlay Me,\u201d Gordon reimagined the track for the closer, \u201cBye Bye 25!\u201d She says it was the result of her thinking about the rap world, where revisiting and remixing is commonplace.",
      "\u201cI came up with the idea of using these words that Trump had sort of \u2018banned\u2019 in his mind,\u201d she says of the new song's lyrics. (An example: \u201cInjustice / Opportunity / Dietary guidelines / Housing for the future.\u201d President Donald Trump\u2019s administration associates the terms with diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, which it has vowed to root out across the government.) For Gordon, because it became \u201cmore conceptual \u2026 the remake doesn\u2019t seem as anxiety-provoking as the original.\u201d",
      "There is a connective spirit between \u201cThe Collective\u201d and \u201cPlay Me\u201d \u2014 a shared confrontation, propulsive production and songs that possess a keen ability to process and reflect the world around Gordon. \u201cIt does feel kind of like an evolution,\u201d she says of this album next to her last. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of a more focused record, and immediate.\u201d The songs are shorter and attentive.",
      "Or, to put it more simply: \u201cI like beats and that inspires me more than melodies,\u201d she says. \u201cBeats and space.\u201d",
      "That palette drives \u201cPlay Me,\u201d a foundation in which staccato lyricism transforms and offers astute criticism. Consider the title track, which challenges passive listening and the devaluation of music in the age of streaming. She names Spotify playlist titles, imagined genres defined by mood rather than music. \u201cRich popular girl / Villain mode\u201d she speak-sings, \u201cJazz and background / Chillin' after work.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt's just representative of, you know, this era we're in, this culture of convenience,\u201d she says. \u201cMusic always represented a certain amount of freedom to me, and it feels like that\u2019s kind of been blanketed over.\u201d",
      "Sonically, it is a message delivered atop a '70s groove, placing it in conversation with an era unshackled from these digital technologies.",
      "The title, too, \u201cis playing off the sort of passive nature of listening to music,\u201d she says, \u201cBut also it could be seen as defiant. Like, I dare you to play me.\u201d",
      "There's also the blown-out \u201cSubcon,\u201d which examines the world's growing billionaire class and their fascination with space colonialization in a period of economic insecurity. In the song, Gordon's lyrical abstractions highlight the absurdity, taking aim at technocrats.",
      "\u201cI find reality inspirational, no matter how bad it is,\u201d she says. Where some artists might veer away from the news, Gordon tackles truth. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what music is supposed to be. So, I\u2019m just doing my version of it.\u201d",
      "In the end, she hopes listeners are \u201csomewhat thrilled by\u201d the album.",

      "\u201c28 Years Later: The Bone Temple\u201d brings a fresh twist to zombie movies, even with dancing to '80s hits by Duran Duran",
      "You know what zombie movies never seem to have enough of? Dancing. They've got gore and screaming and lots of guttural snarling, but no boogie. That all changes with \u201c28 Years Later: The Bone Temple\u201d and the dancing here is to \u2014 naturally off-kilter \u2014 1980s heroes Duran Duran.",
      "The fourth entry in an ever-more engrossing franchise is absolutely bonkers \u2014 and a triumph. It mixes dark, queasy disembowelment and laugh-out-loud humor in a way that both subverts the genre and leads a way out of it, too.",
      "Nia DaCosta directs from a returning Alex Garland script and it starts right where 2025's \u201c28 Years Later\u201d \u2014 directed by Danny Boyle \u2014 left off. If this is your first encounter with the series, you don't necessarily need to go back to 2002's \u201c28 Days Later\u201d but at least to last year's entry.",
      "Garland's script crackles with jokes about Britain's National Health Service and \u201cTeletubbies\u201d as it sets up an ultimate showdown between good and evil across a flower-and-meadow countryside. DaCosta is fabulous, leaning into the dark and the light with assurance, nailing the twisted tone and celebrating the weirdness.",
      "We pick up immediately after Alfie Williams\u2019 Spike is rescued from a gang of zombies \u2014 excuse me, a gang of infected \u2014 by another gang of predators led by Sir Jimmy Crystal, whom we first met as an 8-year-old orphan in the last movie. He's all grown up and become a sadistic satanist, which happens sometimes without good adulting.",
      "Jimmy \u2014 played by a diabolical Jack O\u2019Connell in a tracksuit and gold chains, like a low-level Mafia lieutenant from \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d \u2014 leads a band of young psychopaths, as deadly to both virus survivors as the snarling, semi-human infected. They don blond wigs and each is named Jimmy. There's a whiff of \u201cA Clockwork Orange\u201d about them \u2014 menacing, prone to ultraviolence, gleeful in destruction. \u201cDoes that sound like normal screaming, Jimmy?\u201d one asks. Spike, bless his heart, doesn't belong here.",
      "Sir Jimmy's opposite number is also out there, the scientist-doctor Dr. Ian Kelson, who hopes to find a cure for the virus. He's a humanist, with a huge heart and open arms, even if he does construct tall pillars out of the bleached bones of the dead. That sounds bad, but he does it to memorialize them, an in memoriam segment made out of calcium.",
      "Kelson is played by a returning Ralph Fiennes, who is magnificent, totally committed, even going full Monty. There's no winking in anything he does, just pure soul. People are people, no matter how damaged, he believes. \u201cThere's just us,\u201d he says. Bright orange due to the iodine he paints on his skin to ward off the virus, Kelson is alone in his bone temple, which, with a few tea lights, really pulls the look together.",

      "Who will emerge victorious on this blighted island? Sir Jimmy or Dr. Kelson?

Call it almost post-zombie.",
      "There's a fifth movie in this franchise in the works, with some clues that this nightmarish world may yet produce a happy ending. But they're getting better and better and, as insane as it sounds, it's going to be sad to see it go. Long may the zombies dance. Perhaps we should take advice from the great poets of our time, Duran Duran: \u201cI will learn to survive.\u201d",
      "\u201c28 Years Later: The Bone Temple,\u201d a Sony Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for strong bloody violence, gore, graphic nudity, language throughout and brief drug use. Running time: 109 minutes. Three and half stars out of four.",

      "Coming two days after Sunday\u2019s Golden Globes, the annual, untelevised New York gala, held in the cavernous midtown banquet all Cipriani 42nd Street and hosted by Willie Geist, played out as a more intimate and frank-spoken alternative.",
      "The winners themselves were already announced, so the night was always going to belong to \u201cOne Battle After Another.\u201d The National Board of review, a group that is made up of film enthusiasts and dates to 1909, not only named it 2025\u2019s best film but awarded the best actor prize to Leonardo DiCaprio, best director to Anderson, best supporting actor to Benicio Del Toro and breakthrough performer to Chase Infiniti.",
      "Yet in an ongoing parade of awards for \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d its night at the NBRs still stood out. The surprise presenter of the movie\u2019s best film award was Martin Scorsese, who praised \u201cthe audacity\u201d of Anderson\u2019s narratives and the accomplishment of his latest.",
      "\u201cLike all great films, it can\u2019t really be compared to anything else,\u201d Scorsese said. \u201cIt stands alone. It\u2019s a great American film.\u201d",
      "Anderson, trying to take in the wealth of honors, attempted to describe what \u201c One Battle After Another,\u201d his father-daughter tale of revolution, might represent. His answer came in pointing out his own daughter, sitting at his table.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what our movie is about, but I do know it\u2019s about loving your kids,\u201d Anderson said.",
      "For many of the honorees, the world outside the starry banquet weighed heavily. Coogler\u2019s speech was among the night\u2019s most poignant. The \u201cSinners\u201d director was honored for his screenplay for the vampire thriller and was introduced by the film\u2019s star, longtime collaborator Michael B. Jordan.",
      "Both were honored 13 years earlier by the board for their first movie together, \u201c Fruitvale Station.\u201d Recalling that film, based on the true story of the 2009 killing of Oscar Grant by a Bay Area Rapid Transit police officer in Oakland, California, Coogler turned to the recent fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an immigration enforcement agent in Minneapolis.",
      "\u201cI was young and naive, and I thought the movie was going to change the world and make it so you didn\u2019t see people executed by civil service on camera anymore,\u201d Coogler said. \u201cI was proven wrong again and again. And it\u2019s tough to be here and not think about Minnesota.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- The BBC plans to ask a court to throw out U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s $10 billion lawsuit against the British broadcaster, court papers show.",
      "Trump filed a lawsuit in December over the way the BBC edited a speech he gave on Jan. 6, 2021. The claim, filed in a Florida federal court, seeks $5 billion in damages for defamation and $5 billion for unfair trade practices.",
      "The speech took place before some of Trump\u2019s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol as Congress was poised to certify President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the 2020 election that Trump falsely alleged was stolen from him.",
      "The BBC had broadcast the documentary \u2014 titled \u201cTrump: A Second Chance?\u201d \u2014 days before the 2024 U.S. presidential election. It spliced together three quotes from two sections of the 2021 speech, delivered almost an hour apart, into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and \u201cfight like hell.\u201d Among the parts cut out was a section where Trump said he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully.",
      "The broadcaster has apologized to Trump over the edit of the Jan. 6 speech. But the publicly funded BBC rejects claims it defamed him. The furor triggered the resignations of the BBC\u2019s top executive and its head of news.",
      "Papers filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Miami say the BBC will file a motion to dismiss the case on March 17 on the basis that the court lacks jurisdiction and Trump failed to state a claim.",
      "The broadcaster\u2019s lawyers will argue that the BBC did not create, produce or broadcast the documentary in Florida and that Trump\u2019s claim the documentary was available in the U.S. on streaming service BritBox is not true.",

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Organizers of Australia\u2019s largest free literary festival canceled the event Tuesday after more than 180 writers and speakers withdrew over the scrapping of an appearance by an Australian-Palestinian writer and academic.",
      "The uproar began when the board of the Adelaide Festival, which runs Adelaide Writers Week, announced on Jan. 8 that they had disinvited Dr Randa Abdel-Fattah from the event \u201cgiven her previous statements\u201d and citing cultural sensitivities \u201cat this unprecedented time so soon after\u201d an antisemitic mass shooting at Sydney\u2019s Bondi Beach.",
      "There was no suggestion that Abdel-Fattah or her writings \u201chave any connection with the tragedy,\u201d the board members added.",
      "They didn\u2019t cite any specific statements by the lawyer, academic and writer of fiction and nonfiction that prompted their decision. Abdel-Fattah decried the move as \u201ccensorship\u201d and said the announcement suggested that her \u201cmere presence\u201d was culturally insensitive.",
      "By Tuesday, when the event was canceled, most of the programmed speakers had withdrawn. The episode unfolded amid a fraught national debate in Australia about limits on speech following the Bondi shooting.",
      "A father and son who were apparently inspired by Islamic State group ideology are accused of the massacre during a Hanukkah event in December, in which 15 people were shot dead. The surviving suspect, Naveed Akram, has not entered a plea to the dozens of murder, terrorism and other charges he faces.",
      "In the aftermath, the Jewish Community Council for South Australia \u2014 the state where Adelaide is located \u2014 wrote to the festival to lobby for Abdel-Fattah\u2019s exclusion, the group's spokesperson Norman Schueler told The Adelaide Advertiser. The Premier of South Australia state Peter Malinauskus also supported the writer\u2019s removal.",
      "The Adelaide Writers Week was scheduled to run for six days beginning in late February, as part of a wider annual culture festival. The 2025 literary event was the festival\u2019s 40th and attracted 160,000 attendees.",
      "Born in Australia to Palestinian and Egyptian parents, Abdel-Fattah often writes about Islamophobia and had been invited to speak about her novel Discipline, which follows two Muslims, a journalist and a university student, navigating issues of censorship in Sydney. She has been a critic of the Israeli government and an advocate for Palestinians throughout the two-year war in Gaza.",
      "After the board\u2019s statement canceling Abdel-Fattah\u2019s appearance, other speakers on the program \u2014 including British novelist Zadie Smith and former New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern \u2014 withdrew from their events too. The Festival\u2019s director quit Tuesday, citing her objections to the board\u2019s decision to disinvite Abdel-Fattah.",

      "The removal of Abdel-Fattah prompted some sponsors of the event to withdraw, too. The fate of the wider Adelaide Festival was unclear Tuesday, although a new board was due to be appointed Wednesday.",

      "Two new studies from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show wastewater monitoring of measles can flag measles spread days to weeks in advance",
      "Wastewater testing can alert public health officials to measles infections days to months before cases are confirmed by doctors, researchers said in two studies published Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Colorado health officials were able to get ahead of the highly contagious virus by tracking its presence in sewer systems, researchers wrote. And Oregon researchers found wastewater could have warned them of an outbreak more than two months before the first person tested positive.",
      "The findings add to evidence that wastewater testing is a valuable weapon in tracking disease, including COVID-19, polio, mpox and bird flu.",
      "But the national wastewater surveillance system, run by CDC since 2020, is newly at risk, under a Trump administration budget plan would slash its funding from about $125 million a year to about $25 million.",
      "Peggy Honein, director of the CDC's division of infectious disease readiness and innovation, said the proposed funding level would \u201csustain some of the most critical activities\u201d but \u201cit would likely require some prioritization.\u201d",
      "The national system covers more than 1,300 wastewater treatment sites serving 147 million people. It includes six \u201ccenters for excellence\u201d \u2014 Colorado among them \u2014 that innovate and support other states in expanding their testing.",
      "The funding cut is still a proposal, and Congress has started pushing back against cuts to health care in general.",
      "But state health departments say they are preparing for a potential loss of federal support regardless. Most state programs are entirely federally funded, Honein said.",
      "Colorado started its wastewater surveillance program in 2020 with 68 utilities participating voluntarily. The program has since narrowed in its focus even as it grew to include more diseases, because it is 100% federally funded, said Allison Wheeler, manager of the Colorado\u2019s wastewater surveillance unit.",
      "The work is funded through 2029, Wheeler said, and the department is talking to state leaders about what to do after that.",
      "\u201cI know that there are other states that haven\u2019t been as fortunate as us,\u201d Wheeler said. \u201cThey need this funding in order to sustain their program for the next year.\u201d",
      "In the Colorado study, which Wheeler co-authored, officials started testing wastewater for measles in May, as outbreaks in Texas, New Mexico and Utah were growing and five cases had been confirmed in Colorado.",
      "In August, wastewater in Mesa County tested positive about a week before two measles cases were confirmed by a doctor. Neither patient knew that they had been exposed to measles. As they traced 225 household and health care contacts of the first two patients, health officials found five more cases.",

      "The 30-case outbreak spanned two counties and hit a close-knit community that does not readily seek health care, the study's authors wrote. The first case was confirmed on July 11 and it ultimately took health officials 15 weeks to stop the outbreak.",
      "The researchers found that wastewater samples from the area were positive for measles about 10 weeks before the first cases were reported. The virus concentration in the wastewater over the weeks also matched the known peak of the outbreak.",
      "\u201cWe knew that we were missing cases, and I think that's always the case in measles outbreaks,\u201d said Dr. Melissa Sutton, of the Oregon Health Authority. \u201cBut this gave us an insight into how much silent transmission was occurring without us knowing about it and without our health care system knowing about it.\u201d",
      "Other states, such as Utah, have integrated wastewater data into their public-facing measles dashboards, allowing anyone to track outbreaks in real time.",
      "And in New Mexico, where 100 people got measles last year and one died, the testing helped state health officials shrink a vast rural expanse. The state's system flagged cases in northwestern Sandoval County while officials were focused on a massive outbreak 300 miles (483 kilometers) away in the southeast, said Kelley Plymesser, of the state health department.",
      "The early warning allowed the department to alert doctors and the public, lower thresholds for testing and refocus their resources. The outbreak ended in September. But because measles continues to spread across the Southwest, the state is still using the system to look for new cases.",
      "Sutton, of Oregon, said she's hopeful federal leaders will see the power of the system, its adaptability, affordability and reach.",
      "\u201cThe widespread use of wastewater surveillance in the United States is one of the greatest advancements in communicable disease surveillance in a generation,\u201d she said.",

      "And the monthly death toll is still not back to what it was before the COVID-19 pandemic, let alone where it was before the current overdose epidemic struck decades ago, said Brandon Marshall, a Brown University researcher who studies overdose trends.",
      "\u201cOverall I think this continues to be encouraging, especially since we're seeing declines almost across the nation,\u201d he said.",
      "Overdose deaths began steadily climbing in the 1990s with overdoses involving opioid painkillers, followed by waves of deaths from heroin and \u2014 more recently \u2014 illicit fentanyl. Deaths peaked nearly 110,000 in 2022, fell a little in 2023 and then plummeted 27% in 2024, to around 80,000. That was the largest one-year decline ever recorded.",
      "The new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data runs through August 2025 and represents the first update of monthly provisional drug overdose deaths since the federal government shutdown.",
      "An estimated 73,000 people died from overdoses in the 12-month period that ended August 2025, down about 21% from the 92,000 in the previous 12-month period.",
      "CDC officials reported that deaths were down in all states except Arizona, Hawaii, Kansas, New Mexico and North Dakota. But they noted it's likely that not all overdose deaths have been reported yet in every state, and additional data in the future might affect that state count.",
      "Researchers cannot yet say with confidence why deaths have gone down. Experts have offered multiple possible explanations: increased availability of the overdose-reversing drug naloxone, expanded addiction treatment, shifts in how people use drugs, and the growing impact of billions of dollars in opioid lawsuit settlement money.",

In a paper published last week in the International Journal of Drug Policy, they say overdose trends may be at least partly tied to federal stimulus checks sent out during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

      "That money alleviated economic hardship for many families, but some of it also helped people pay for illicit drugs, the Pittsburgh researchers say. And the end of those payments helps explain why overdoses stabilized in 2022 and began falling afterward, they say.",

      "An email and a telephone message seeking comment were left for Coeytaux.",
      "According to court documents, he is accused of mailing mifepristone and misoprostol in 2023 to a Louisiana woman who sought the medication through Aid Access, a European online telemedicine service.

      "WASHINGTON -- New options for testing and treating some of the most common sexually transmitted diseases are becoming available, a trend that experts hope will keep downward pressure on U.S. infection rates.",
      "Last year, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first at-home test that can detect three common infections in women \u2014 gonorrhea, chlamydia and trichomoniasis \u2014 as well as the first home-based kit for the virus that causes cervical cancer.",
      "The agency ended the year by approving two different drugs for gonorrhea, the first new options for the disease in decades.",
      "It\u2019s positive news after cases of sexually transmitted infections reached alarming highs before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, which disrupted screening, education and treatment for sexual health nationwide.",
      "But the pandemic years also brought positive developments for testing. The same technology used for the first over-the-counter coronavirus tests is now being translated into home-based kits for syphilis and other sexually transmitted infections. Previously, the FDA had mostly limited the use of such tests to health professionals.",
      "\u201cSexual health can be stigmatized and people can be hesitant about testing,\u201d said Dr. Ina Park, a sexual health specialist at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cNow we have a lot of options for patients who may be wary of going into a provider\u2019s office.\u201d",
      "Testing company Visby Medical launched its three-in-one test for women last year, following FDA approval in March. The urine-based test includes a vaginal testing swab and a small electronic device that develops the results and sends them to an online app for review.",
      "The test, which costs $150, also includes a telehealth consultation with a medical provider who can discuss the results and prescribe antibiotics or other medication, if needed.",
      "The entire process \u2014 from buying the test to getting a prescription \u2014 can take as little as six hours, compared with several days under the traditional testing model, says Dr. Gary Schoolnik, Visby\u2019s chief medical officer.",
      "Previously, a nurse or doctor would have to collect a sample, send it out to a lab, get the results and then schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results.",
      "\u201cMany patients are very hard to track down and a lot of them, if they have a positive test result, are never treated and are lost to follow-up,\u201d said Schoolnik, who is also a professor emeritus at Stanford Medical School.",
      "The FDA approved Visby\u2019s test based on study results showing that it correctly detected the three infections with accuracy rates around 98% or higher. That\u2019s similar to tests performed at hospitals and health clinics.",
      "Some home-based tests still require outside input to get the results.",
      "For example, in May the FDA approved Teal Health\u2019s testing kit for HPV, the virus that causes cervical cancer. The company\u2019s Teal Wand allows women to collect their own vaginal sample, which is then placed in a tube and shipped to a laboratory for processing.",

      "\u201cWe were down to one class of antibiotics recommended to treat gonorrhea and we had no other good options,\u201d said Park. \u201cSo to have two new options in the same year is very exciting.\u201d",
      "The CDC\u2019s provisional data for 2024 showed a third consecutive year of fewer gonorrhea cases, and the second year in a row of fewer adult cases of chlamydia and the most infectious forms of syphilis.",

      "By saying that, Trump is \u201cundermining us as a people,\u201d Mari Laursen told AP.",

      "\u201cWhat's he going to do with Greenland? He speaks of Russians and Chinese and everything in Greenlandic waters or in our country. We are only 57,000 people. The only Chinese I see is when I go to the fast food market. And every summer we go sailing and we go hunting and I never saw Russian or Chinese ships here in Greenland,\u201d he said.",
      "Down at Nuuk's small harbor, Gerth Josefsen spoke to AP as he attached small fish as bait to his lines. He said, \u201cI don't see them (the ships)\u201d and said he had only seen \u201ca Russian fishing boat ten years ago.\u201d",

      "MADRID -- Venezuelans living in Spain reacted to the news of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s capture by U.S. forces with a mix of awe, joy and fear, gathering at rallies and watching the events unfold back home at breakneck speed.",

      "In June 2017, Vallenilla\u2019s son, a 22-year-old nursing student in Caracas named David Jos\u00e9, was shot point-blank by a Venezuelan soldier after taking part in a protest near a military air base in the capital. He later died from his injuries. Video footage of the incident was widely publicized, turning his son\u2019s death into an emblematic case of the Maduro government\u2019s repression against protesters that year.",
      "After demanding answers for his son\u2019s death, Vallenilla, too, started receiving threats and decided two years later to move to Spain with the help of an nongovernmental organization.",
      "On the day of Maduro\u2019s capture, Vallenilla said his phone was flooded with messages about his son.",
      "\u201cMany told me, \u2018Now David will be resting in peace. David must be happy in heaven,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut don't think it was easy: I spent the whole day crying.\u201d",
      "Vallenilla is watching the events in Venezuela unfold with skepticism but also hope. He fears more violence, but says he has hope the Trump administration can effect the change that Venezuelans like his son tried to obtain through elections, popular protests and international institutions.",
      "\u201cNothing will bring back my son. But the fact that some justice has begun to be served for those responsible helps me see a light at the end of the tunnel. Besides, I also hope for a free Venezuela.\u201d",

      "In mid-July, armed groups affiliated with Druze spiritual leader Sheikh Hikmat al-Hijri clashed with local Bedouin clans, spurring intervention by government forces who effectively sided with the Bedouins. Hundreds of civilians, mostly Druze, were killed, many by government fighters. The United Nations estimates that 187,000 people were displaced by the end of the month.",
      "The majority of the Druze community in Syria live in Sweida province. Since then, a large group of the militias banded together under al-Hijri, creating a de facto anonymous area in large swaths of the province, backed by neighboring Israel.",

      "Public concern is particularly high in Bangkok due to the frequent and sometimes fatal construction accidents on major road projects. In the latest case, a construction crane collapsed on Thursday, killing two people, just a day after the train tragedy in which 32 people died.",
      "Public outrage has centered on Italian-Thai Development, the contractor responsible for both sites where the past week's accidents occurred. The company, also known as Italthai, was also the joint lead contractor for the 33-story State Audit Office building, which toppled while under construction in March, killing about 100 people.",

      "But critics say construction safety faces broader systemic problems, pointing to lax regulation, poor enforcement, and corruption. A lengthy investigation determined that the building collapse in March, though triggered by an earthquake, was fundamentally caused by flawed structural design and effort to evade regulations.",

      "He said the safety challenges range from laxity in law enforcement to red tape and the lack of integration in safety policies among different stakeholders in projects. He also pointed to a shortage of independent assessors without conflicts of interest, which often results in performance reports that do not reflect reality.",

      "The Justice Department\u2019s investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has brought heightened attention to a key drama that will play out at the central bank in the coming months: Will Powell leave the Fed when his term as chair ends, or will ...",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department\u2019s investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has brought heightened attention to a key drama that will play out at the central bank in the coming months: Will Powell leave the Fed when his term as chair ends, or will he take the unusual step of remaining a governor?",
      "Powell's term as Fed chair finishes on May 15, but because of the central bank's complex structure, he has a separate term as one of seven members of its governing board that lasts until January 31, 2028. Historically, nearly all Fed chairs have stepped down from the board when they are no longer chair. But Powell could be the first in nearly 50 years to stay on as a governor.",
      "Many Fed-watchers believe that the criminal investigation into Powell's testimony about cost overruns for Fed building renovations was intended to intimidate him out of taking that step. If Powell stays on the board, it would deny the White House a chance to gain a majority, undercutting the Trump administration's efforts to seize greater control over what has for decades been an institution largely insulated from day-to-day politics.",
      "\u201cI find it very difficult to see Powell leaving before midnight on Jan. 31, 2028,\u201d said David Wilcox, a former top economist at the Fed and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \"This is a mortal threat to the governance structure of the Fed as we\u2019ve known it for 90 years. And I think that Powell does take that threat exceedingly seriously, and therefore will believe that it is his solemn duty to continue to occupy his seat on the board of governors.\u201d",
      "Powell, 72, was appointed as Fed chair by Trump in 2018, and must step down from the position in May because his second four-year term is ending. He has declined several times to comment on his plans beyond that when asked by reporters. A spokesperson declined to comment for this story.",
      "Trump has sought to push out Powell before his time is up, obsessively attacking him for not cutting rates as sharply as the president wants, particularly in light of ongoing concerns about high costs for groceries, utilities, and housing that have remained a salient political issue even as inflation has cooled.",
      "On Tuesday, Trump highlighted that mortgage rates have declined in the past year. \u201cIf I had the help of the Fed, it would be easier,\u201d he said. \"But that jerk will be gone soon.\u201d",
      "Or maybe not.",
      "Here is a look at the impacts of whether or not Powell stays on the board could have:",
      "Trump said Tuesday that he hopes to name a new Fed chair in the next few weeks. But that could get held up by the criminal investigation of Powell.",
      "Several Republican senators, including at least two on the banking committee who would have to approve Trump\u2019s nominees to the Fed, have expressed skepticism that Powell committed crimes during his testimony last June regarding the Fed\u2019s $2.5 billion renovation of two office buildings, a project that Trump has criticized as excessive. That testimony is the subject of subpoenas sent to the Fed by U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro.",
      "Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, said he would not vote for any Fed nominees until the legal cloud around Powell is resolved. That would be enough to delay a nomination from getting out of the banking committee.",
      "If no new chair of the Fed's board has been confirmed by May 15, then Powell could remain in that post until a replacement has been confirmed. As a result, the Fed might not cut interest rates anywhere near as quickly as Trump wants.",

      "If Powell stays on as a governor even after he is no longer chair, Trump could still name someone to lead the Fed but that would give him a total of three appointments on the board \u2014 including two from his first term \u2014 and short of a majority.",
      "So even if Trump nominates a chair who seeks to do the president\u2019s bidding regarding interest rates, that person \u201cwould have very little persuasive power with his colleagues,\" said Wilcox, who is also director of research at Bloomberg Economics. Powell, along with other members of the Fed's 19-member interest-rate setting committee, could outvote the new chair. That hasn't happened since 1986.",
      "In that case, Trump could nominate a fourth person to the board and gain a majority. He could even then add a fifth, if the Supreme Court allows his attempt to fire Governor Lisa Cook to proceed. The high court will hear her case on Wednesday.",
      "A majority on the board would enable the White House to make sweeping changes to the Fed. Trump's Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, has advocated numerous reforms to reduce the central bank's influence in the economy and financial markets.",
      "Trump's majority on the Fed's board could also remove some of the presidents of the 12 regional banks, who are members of the Fed's rate-setting committee. The New York Fed president has a vote on the committee and four others vote on a rotating basis.",
      "Several of those bank presidents have expressed opposition to the deep rate cuts that Trump has demanded. The board of governors could seek to have them fired if a chair wanted to do so.",
      "While nearly all Fed chairs have left the board of governors before their terms were up, there is some precedent for Powell to stay. In 1978, then-Chair Arthur Burns stayed on the board for about three weeks after his chairmanship ended. But in 1948, then-Fed chairman Marriner Eccles remained as a governor for three years after finishing as chair, in part because President Harry Truman asked him to remain.",
      "In 1951, however, he played a key role in undercutting the Truman administration in a dispute over interest rates, which led to the Fed-Treasury Accord that established the modern Fed as a largely independent institution.",
      "Eccles became a symbol of Fed independence, though some academics say that reputation is overstated. The Fed's principal office building \u2014- currently under renovation and at the center of the criminal investigation of Powell \u2014 is named after him.",
      "Truman then appointed a Treasury official, William McChesney Martin, to the Fed chairmanship and assumed he would do his bidding. Yet Martin defied Truman and raised interest rates. Years later, Truman ran into Martin in New York City and called him a \u201ctraitor.\u201d The Fed's second office building in Washington is named after Martin.",
      "\u201cSo it's a cautionary tale also for Trump, thinking he's going to get his own Fed chair in there,\u201d said Lev Menand, a law professor at Columbia University who studies the Fed. \u201cMartin didn't do what Truman wanted.\u201d",

      "Kathleen Kennedy is stepping down from Lucasfilm after more than 13 years",
      "After more than 13 years at the helm of Lucasfilm, Kathleen Kennedy is stepping down from the \u201cStar Wars\u201d factory founded by George Lucas.",
      "The Walt Disney Co. announced Thursday that it will now turn to Dave Filoni to steer \u201cStar Wars\u201d into its sixth decade and beyond. Filoni, who served as the chief commercial officer of Lucasfilm, and Lynwen Brennan, president and general manager of Lucasfilm\u2019s businesses, will inherit the mantle of one of the movies\u2019 marquee franchises.",
      "Kennedy, Lucas\u2019 handpicked successor, had presided over the ever-expanding science-fiction world of \u201cStar Wars\u201d since Disney acquired it in 2012. She oversaw a highly lucrative but often contentious period in \u201cStar Wars\u201d history that yielded a blockbuster trilogy and acclaimed streaming spinoffs such as \u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d and \u201cAndor,\u201d yet found increasing frustration from longtime fans.",
      "Under Kennedy\u2019s stewardship, Lucasfilm amassed more than $5.6 billion in box office and helped establish Disney+ as a streaming destination \u2014 achievements that easily validated the $4.05 billion Disney plunked down for the company. But Kennedy also struggled to deliver the big-screen magic that Lucas captured in the original trilogy from the late 1970s and early 1980s, and her relationship with \u201cStar Wars\u201d loyalists became a saga of its own.",
      "While Filoni and Brennan will share leadership, Brennan is considered the more financially oriented executive. Filoni will have the creative reins. He\u2019s established himself almost entirely on the small screen, entering the franchise with the animated series \u201cStar Wars: The Clone Wars\u201d and creating the tepidly received Disney+ series \u201cAhsoka.\u201d Filoni, who first collaborated with Lucas on \u201cAvatar: The Last Airbender,\u201d has also been an executive producer on \u201cThe Mandalorian,\u201d \u201cThe Book of Boba Fett\u201d and \u201cSkeleton Crew.\u201d",
      "Before joining Lucasfilm, Kennedy was one of Hollywood\u2019s most successful producers ever. In 1981, she co-founded Amblin Entertainment with Steven Spielberg and her eventual husband, Frank Marshall. She produced \u201cE.T.,\u201d \u201cIndiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,\u201d \u201cJurassic Park\u201d and the \u201cBack to the Future\u201d trilogy.",

      "At Lucasfilm, her biggest hit came at the start, with 2015\u2019s \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens.\u201d The J.J. Abrams-directed film grossed more than $2 billion worldwide. But the subsequent installment, Rian Johnson\u2019s \u201cThe Last Jedi\u201d (2017), was bitterly divisive. The third film, Abrams\u2019 \u201cThe Rise of Skywalker\u201d (2019), was widely panned by critics and fans, alike.",
      "After \u201cThe Rise of Skywalker,\u201d \u201cStar Wars\u201d went dark on the big screen despite a litany of announced projects. The dry spell is set to be broken in May by Jon Favreau\u2019s \u201cThe Mandalorian & Grogu.\u201d The intervening years have been marked by streaming successes in \u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d and \u201cAndor,\u201d but the future of \u201cStar Wars\u201d has felt increasingly uncertain.",
      "Struggles over tone and vision have been frequent. The 2018 Han Solo spinoff \u201cSolo: A Star Wars Story\u201d saw its directors, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, fired during production and replaced by Ron Howard. Most found the mixed-and-matched result blandly disappointing.",
      "More recently, Adam Driver, who played Kylo Ren/Ben Solo in the most recent \u201cStar Wars\u201d trilogy,\u201d divulged to The Associated Press last year that he and Steven Soderbergh had developed a Ben Solo film with Kennedy and Lucasfilm\u2019s support for two years before Disney chief Bob Iger nixed it. Fans were so irate that a plane was flown over Disney\u2019s Burbank studios with a banner reading \u201cSave \u2018The Hunt for Ben Solo.\u2019\u201d",
      "Instead, the only \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie of Kennedy\u2019s stewardship to win widespread and prevailing approval from fans was arguably 2016\u2019s \u201cRogue One.\u201d Gareth Edwards\u2019 spinoff was also a troubled production, leading to Tony Gilroy, eventual creator of \u201cAndor,\u201d overseeing reshoots. Yet despite that, \u201cRogue One\u201d \u2014 taking place within \u201cStar Wars\u201d but outside of the main Jedi storyline \u2014 might be the only film of Kennedy\u2019s \u201cStar Wars\u201d reign that managed to both stay true to the space odyssey\u2019s tone and to break new ground.",

    "story": [
      "The North American International Auto Show in Detroit once dedicated an entire track on its coveted show floor to getting consumers comfortable with electric vehicles and charging",
      "DETROIT -- At the North American International Auto Show, tires squeal as gearheads put shiny new vehicles through their paces on a pair of indoor tracks that sprawl across the event space. One of those tracks used to be set aside exclusively for electric vehicles as U.S. automakers sought to quickly build out the cars of the future.",
      "But no longer. This year, both strips are open to hybrids and gas-powered vehicles as Detroit continues a pivot away from EVs since President Donald Trump returned to the White House with a pro-fossil fuels agenda.",
      "\u201cThe show will always reflect what\u2019s happening in the industry at the consumer level,\u201d said Todd Szott, chairman of this year\u2019s event and an auto dealer. \u201cObviously things have changed in the EV landscape.\u201d",
      "Some industry players say they're emphasizing \u201cconsumer choice\u201d in the cars they're showing at Detroit's premier auto event. But some experts expressed concern about the EV pullback's long-term effect on American automakers as the rest of the globe \u2014 especially China \u2014 electrifies.",
      "\u201cWhat we worry about is how competitive will we be on the global stage as the market continues to advance around us,\u201d Michael Robinet, vice president of forecast strategy at auto market intelligence firm S&P Global Mobility, said during a panel Wednesday on industry trends.",
      "Including plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, U.S. sales of electrified cars grew just 1% last year, according to data released by Benchmark Mineral Intelligence this week. Compare that to China, which saw 17% growth in plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles last year, and Europe, which saw a 33% increase. (U.S. pure-EV market share was just under 8% in 2025, with 1.23 million EVs sold \u2014 a slight decline from 2024.)",
      "None of that seemed to alarm President Donald Trump earlier this week when he toured the Ford River Rouge Complex, which churns out pickup trucks and more in suburban Dearborn. Trump used his time in Detroit to boast of policy changes on EVs and tariffs that he says have boosted U.S. automakers.",
      "\u201cAmong my first acts in office was to end the radical left war on oil and gas and stop the crusade to kill American energy and, frankly, to open up cars so that you don\u2019t have to have an electric car,\u201d Trump said in remarks to an economic club before the plant tour.",
      "Trump revoked a Biden-era target for half of new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric, and has tried to block money obligated to EV charging across the nation\u2019s highways. Under Trump, Congress cut tax incentives that saved buyers up to $7,500 on an EV purchase. The administration has also weakened fuel economy standards \u2014 going so far as eliminating penalties for the automakers who do not meet them \u2014 and gas mileage rules.",
      "\u201cI love electric cars. I think they\u2019re great,\u201d Trump added. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been saying it for four years. They wanted everybody to have an electric car in a very short period of time.\u201d",
      "Those changes have cut into the U.S. industry in 2025 and cost automakers billions of dollars in investment.",
      "Ford Motor Co. announced last month $19.5 billion in charges from electrification efforts and ending production of the all-electric version of the F-150 Lightning truck. Detroit rival General Motors also recently announced $6 billion in EV-related charges, among other losses, and has also rolled back some of its EV commitments. Even once- market leader Tesla had a tough 2025.",
      "\u201cI still push for it because, I mean, it is the future of the company,\u201d said Shawn Strain, marketing manager at Ford. \u201cWe still are just completely committed to EVs. And it may not be as overt as we once were.\u201d",
      "But industry experts at and outside of the show say it's a tough time. The competitive auto landscape has been radically reshaped, they say, and China dominates what most see as the future of the industry.",

      "Venezuela\u2019s acting President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez has used her first state of the union message to advocate opening the state-run oil industry to more foreign investment",
      "CARACAS, Venezuela -- Venezuela\u2019s acting President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez used her first state of the union message Thursday to advocate for opening the crucial state-run oil industry to more foreign investment following the Trump administration's pledge to seize control of Venezuelan crude sales.",
      "For the first time, Rodr\u00edguez laid out a vision for Venezuela\u2019s new political reality \u2014 one that challenges her government\u2019s most deeply rooted beliefs less than two weeks after the United States captured and toppled former President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Under pressure from the U.S. to cooperate with its plans for reshaping Venezuela\u2019s sanctioned oil industry, Maduro's former vice president declared that a \u201cnew policy is being formed in Venezuela.\"",
      "She urged the foreign diplomats in attendance to tell investors abroad about the changes and called on lawmakers to approve oil sector reforms that would secure foreign firms' access to Venezuela\u2019s vast reserves.",
      "\u201cVenezuela, in free trade relations with the world, can sell the products of its energy industry,\u201d she said.",
      "The Trump administration has said it plans to control future oil export revenues to ensure it benefits the Venezuelan people.",
      "In that vein, Rodr\u00edguez described cash from the oil sales flowing into two sovereign wealth funds, one to support crisis-stricken health services and another to bolster public infrastructure, much of which was built under Maduro\u2019s predecessor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, and has since deteriorated.",
      "These days the country's hospitals are so poorly equipped that patients are asked to provide supplies needed for their care, from syringes to surgical screws.",
      "While Rodr\u00edguez criticized the U.S. capture of Maduro and referred to a \u201cstain on our relations,\" she also promoted the resumption of diplomacy between the historic adversaries. Her succinct, 44-minute speech and mollifying tone marked a dramatic contrast to her predecessors' fiery rants against U.S. imperialism that often went on for hours.",
      "\u201cLet us not be afraid of diplomacy,\u201d Rodriguez. \u201cI ask that politics not be transformed, that it not begin with hatred and intolerance.\u201d",
      "The day before, she gave a 4-minute briefing to the media to say her government would continue releasing prisoners detained under Maduro's harsh rule. But human rights groups have verified just a fraction of the releases that she claimed took place.",
      "Rodr\u00edguez appears to be threading a needle.",
      "A portrait of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, was displayed next to her as she spoke. She called for the U.S. government to \"respect the dignity\" of Maduro, who is being held in a Brooklyn jail after pleading not guilty to drug-trafficking charges. She portrayed herself as defending Venezuela's sovereignty even as the country warmed up to the U.S. with dizzying speed.",
      "\u201cIf one day, as acting president, I have to go to Washington, I will do so standing up, walking, not being dragged,\" she said. \"I'll go standing tall ... never crawling.\u201d",
      "Rodr\u00edguez delivered her speech as Venezuela's Nobel Prize-winning opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado was the one in Washington to meet President Donald Trump.",
      "Since Maduro's ouster, Trump has frozen Machado out of discussions about the nation's political fate while embracing Rodr\u00edguez, praising Maduro\u2019s long-time loyalist as a \u201cterrific person\u201d after holding his first known phone call with her on Wednesday.",

      "Climate change is driving a global boom in desalination as regions turn to the sea for drinking water",
      "CARLSBAD, Calif. -- Some four miles off the Southern California coast, a company is betting it can solve one of desalination\u2019s biggest problems by moving the technology deep below the ocean\u2019s surface.",
      "OceanWell\u2019s planned Water Farm 1 would use natural ocean pressure to power reverse osmosis \u2014 a process that forces seawater through membranes to filter out salt and impurities \u2014 and produce up to 60 million gallons (nearly 225 million liters) of freshwater daily. Desalination is energy intensive, with plants worldwide producing between 500 and 850 million tons of carbon emissions annually \u2014 approaching the roughly 880 million tons emitted by the entire global aviation industry.",
      "OceanWell claims its deep sea approach \u2014 1,300 feet (400 meters) below the water's surface \u2014 would cut energy use by about 40% compared to conventional plants while also tackling the other major environmental problems plaguing traditional desalination: the highly concentrated brine discharged back into the ocean, where it can harm seafloor habitats, including coral reefs, and the intake systems that trap and kill fish larvae, plankton and other organisms at the base of the marine food web.",
      "\u201cThe freshwater future of the world is going to come from the ocean,\u201d said OceanWell CEO Robert Bergstrom. \u201cAnd we\u2019re not going to ask the ocean to pay for it.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s an ambitious promise at a time when the world desperately needs alternatives. As climate change intensifies droughts, disrupts rainfall patterns and fuels wildfires, more regions are turning to the sea for drinking water. For many countries, particularly in the arid Middle East, parts of Africa and Pacific island nations, desalination isn\u2019t optional \u2014 there simply isn\u2019t enough freshwater to meet demand. More than 20,000 plants now operate worldwide, and the industry has been expanding at about 7% annually since 2010.",
      "\u201cWith aridity and climate change issues increasing, desalination will become more and more prevalent as a key technology globally,\u201d said Peiying Hong, a professor of environmental science and engineering at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia.",
      "But scientists warn that as desalination scales, the cumulative damage to coastal ecosystems \u2014 many already under pressure from warming waters and pollution \u2014 could intensify.",
      "Some companies are powering plants with renewable energy, while others are developing more efficient membrane technology to reduce energy consumption. Still others are moving the technology underwater entirely. Norway-based Flocean and Netherlands-based Waterise have tested subsea desalination systems and are working toward commercial deployment. Beyond southern California, OceanWell has signed an agreement to test its system in Nice, France \u2014 another region facing intensifying droughts and wildfires \u2014 beginning this year.",
      "For now, its technology remains in development. A single prototype operates in the Las Virgenes Reservoir where the local water district has partnered with the company in hopes of diversifying its water supply. If successful, the reverse osmosis pods would eventually float above the sea floor in the Santa Monica Bay, anchored with minimal concrete footprint, while an underwater pipeline would transport freshwater to shore. The system would use screens designed to keep out even microscopic plankton and would produce less concentrated brine discharge.",
      "Gregory Pierce, director of UCLA\u2019s Water Resources Group, said deep sea desalination appears promising from an environmental and technical standpoint, but the real test will be cost.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost always much higher than you project\u201d with new technologies, he said. \u201cSo that, I think, will be the make or break for the technology.\u201d",
      "Las Virgenes Reservoir serves about 70,000 residents in western Los Angeles County. Nearly all the water originates in the northern Sierra Nevada and is pumped some 400 miles (640 kilometers) over the Tehachapi Mountains \u2014 a journey that requires massive amounts of energy. During years of low rainfall and snowpack in the Sierra, the reservoir and communities it serves suffer.",
      "About 100 miles (160 kilometers) down the coast, the Carlsbad Desalination Plant has become a focal point in the state\u2019s debate over desalination\u2019s environmental tradeoffs.",
      "The plant came online in 2015 as the largest seawater desalination facility in North America. Capable of producing up to 54 million gallons (204 million liters) of drinking water daily, it supplies about 10% of San Diego County\u2019s water \u2014 enough for roughly 400,000 households.",
      "In Southern California, intensifying droughts and wildfires have exposed the region\u2019s precarious water supply. Agricultural expansion and population growth have depleted local groundwater reserves, leaving cities dependent on imported water. San Diego imports roughly 90% of its supply from the Colorado River and Northern California \u2014 sources that are becoming increasingly strained by climate change. Desalination was pitched as a solution: a local, drought-proof source of drinking water drawn from the Pacific Ocean.",
      "But environmental groups have argued the plant\u2019s seawater intake and brine discharge pose risks to marine life, while its high energy demands drive up water bills and worsen climate change. Before the plant came online, environmental organizations filed more than a dozen legal challenges and regulatory disputes. Most were dismissed but some resulted in changes to the project\u2019s design and permits.",

      "A 2009 Regional Water Quality Control Board order estimated the plant would entrap some 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms) of fish daily and required offsetting those impacts by restoring wetlands elsewhere. Seventeen years later, that restoration remains incomplete. And a 2019 study found the plant\u2019s brine discharge raises offshore salinity above permitted levels, though it detected no significant biological changes \u2014 likely because the site had already been heavily altered by decades of industrial activity from a neighboring power plant.",
      "Those impacts are especially acute in California, where roughly 95% of coastal wetlands have been lost largely to development, leaving the remaining lagoons as vital habitats for fish and migratory birds.",
      "\u201cWhen we start messing with these very critical and unfortunately sparse coastal lagoons and wetlands, it can have tremendous impacts in the ocean,\u201d McDonough said.",
      "Michelle Peters, chief executive officer of Channelside Water Resources, which owns the plant, said the facility uses large organism exclusion devices and one-millimeter screens to minimize marine life uptake, though she acknowledged some smaller species can still pass through.",
      "The plant dilutes its brine discharge with additional seawater before releasing it back into the ocean, and years of monitoring have shown no measurable impacts to surrounding marine life, she said.",
      "Peters said the Carlsbad plant has significantly cut its energy consumption through efficiency improvements and operates under a plan aimed at making the facility carbon net-neutral.",
      "Many experts say water recycling and conservation should come first, noting wastewater purification typically uses far less energy than seawater desalination and can substantially reduce impacts on marine life. Las Virgenes is pursuing a wastewater reuse project alongside its desalination partnership.",
      "\u201cWhat we are looking for is a water supply that we can count on when Mother Nature does not deliver,\u201d Las Virgenes' Pedersen said. \u201cDeveloping new sources of local water is really a critical measure to be more drought and climate ready.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Two senators from opposite parties are joining forces in a renewed push to ban members of Congress from trading stocks, an effort that has broad public support but has repeatedly stalled on Capitol Hill.",
      "Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Republican Sen. Ashley Moody of Florida on Thursday plan to introduce legislation, first shared with The Associated Press, that would bar lawmakers and their immediate family members from trading or owning individual stocks.",
      "It's the latest in a flurry of proposals in the House and the Senate to limit stock trading in Congress, lending bipartisan momentum to the issue. But the sheer number of proposals has clouded the path forward. Republican leaders in the House are pushing their own bill on stock ownership, an alternative that critics have dismissed as watered down.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an American consensus around this, not a partisan consensus, that members of Congress and, frankly, senior members of administrations and the White House, shouldn\u2019t be making money off the backs of the American people,\u201d Gillibrand said in an interview with the AP on Wednesday.",
      "Trading of stock by members of Congress has been the subject of ethics scrutiny and criminal investigations in recent years, with lawmakers accused of using the information they gain as part of their jobs \u2014 often not known to the public \u2014 to buy and sell stocks at significant profit. Both parties have pledged to stop stock trading in Washington in campaign ads, creating unusual alliances in Congress.",
      "In the House, for example, Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida is trying to bypass party leadership and force a vote on her own stock trading bill. Her push with a discharge petition has 79 of the 218 signatures required, the majority of them Democrats.",
      "House Republican leaders are supporting an alternative bill that would prohibit members of Congress and their spouses from buying individual stocks but would not require lawmakers to divest from stocks they already own. It would mandate public notice seven days before a lawmaker sells a stock. The bill advanced in committee on Wednesday, but its prospects are unclear.",
      "Gillibrand and Moody, meanwhile, are introducing a version of a House bill introduced last year by Reps. Chip Roy, a Republican from Texas, and Seth Magaziner, a Democrat from Rhode Island. That proposal, which has 125 cosponsors, would ban members of Congress from buying or selling individual stocks altogether.",

Lawmakers would be prohibited from trading and owning certain other financial assets, including securities, commodities and futures.",
      "\u201cThe American people must be able to trust that their elected officials are focused on results for the American people and not focused on profiting from their positions,\u201d Moody wrote in response to a list of questions from the AP.",

      "That follows shrinkage of 0.5% in 2024 and 0.9% in 2023.",
      "\u201cGermany\u2019s export business faced strong headwinds owing to higher U.S. tariffs, the appreciation of the euro and increased competition from China,\u201d statistical office head Ruth Brand said in a statement accompanying the statistical release.",
      "Expectations have risen for Germany to finally see stronger growth this year as the government under Chancellor Friedrich Merz implements plans to increase spending on infrastructure to make up for years of underinvestment. Meanwhile defense spending is rising due to a perceived higher level of threat from Russia after its invasion of Ukraine.",

      "Germany has endured a period of extended stagnation following the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher energy costs following the war in Ukraine and increasing competition from China in key German specialties such as autos and industrial machinery have held back an economy that is heavily focused on exports. Then came Trump's imposition of higher tariffs, or import taxes, on goods from the European Union. The slow growth has also exposed long-term structural issues such as excessive bureaucracy and lack of skilled labor. A stronger euro has also made exports less competitive on price.",
      "A group of leading economists has predicted 0.9% growth for this year but said that forecast could be at risk if the increase in government spending is unleashed more slowly than expected.",
      "The German economy grew 0.2% in the last three months of 2025, according to available preliminary data.",

      "Indiana and Mississippi had rather busy schedules the last couple of weeks as they competed in the College Football Playoff while the transfer portal window was open.",
      "But it apparently didn\u2019t bother their 2026 roster construction efforts too much.",
      "As the program gets ready to face Miami in the national championship game, Indiana has put together arguably the nation's best collection of transfers for its 2026 roster. Ole Miss' transfer class isn\u2019t that far behind heading into Friday's closing of the portal window.",
      "Texas Tech and Texas A&M also put together impressive transfer classes, though their playoff runs ended before the portal window opened.",
      "A look at the AP's top 10 transfer classes in order:",
      "Josh Hoover, who threw for 71 touchdowns and more than 9,600 yards at TCU from 2022-25, is the heir apparent to Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza at quarterback. He will pass to Nick Marsh (59 catches, 662 yards, 6 TDs at Michigan State last season) and Shazz Preston (43-723-4 at Tulane). Turbo Richard rushed for 749 yards and nine touchdowns at Boston College. Indiana also added offensive lineman Joe Brunner (formerly at Wisconsin) and defensive linemen Tobi Osunsanmi (Kansas State), Chiddi Obiazor (Kansas State) and Josh Burnham (Notre Dame). Preston Zachman (Wisconsin) and A.J. Harris (Penn State) boost the secondary.",
      "Arch Manning has a prime new target now that Texas has added Cam Coleman, a former five-star recruit who had 1,306 yards receiving and 13 touchdowns at Auburn over the last two seasons. Raleek Brown (Arizona State) rushed for 1,141 yards and Hollywood Smothers (N.C. State) ran for 939 yards this season. Rasheem Biles produced 101 tackles \u2014 17 for loss \u2014 at Pittsburgh this season. Smothers was a first-team pick and Biles was a second-team selection on the Associated Press all-Atlantic Coast Conference team. The Longhorns also brought in Melvin Siani, who was Wake Forest\u2019s starting left tackle this season. The secondary adds cornerback Bo Mascoe (Rutgers), an honorable mention all-Big Ten selection from the league\u2019s coaches and media.",
      "Texas Tech\u2019s new quarterback is Brendan Sorsby, who threw for at least 2,800 yards each of the last two seasons at Cincinnati. Texas Tech stockpiled its defensive front seven by adding lineman Mateen Ibirogba from Wake Forest, edge rusher Adam Trick from Miami (Ohio) and linebacker Austin Romaine from Kansas State. Romaine had more than 160 tackles over the last two seasons. Trick delivered 8\u00bd sacks and forced three fumbles this season.",
      "Oklahoma State is hoping it can bounce back from a 1-11 season by bringing in plenty of guys from a North Texas team that went 12-2. More than a dozen players followed new Cowboys coach Eric Morris from North Texas. Drew Mestemaker threw for an FBS-leading 4,379 yards this season. Other arrivals from North Texas include Caleb Hawkins and Wyatt Young. Hawkins rushed for 1,434 yards and 25 touchdowns this season. Young had 70 catches for 1,264 yards and 10 scores.",
      "Offensive linemen Cason Henry (South Carolina), Johnnie Brown (Georgia Southern), Anwar O\u2019Neal (Delaware) and Eryx Daugherty (Boston College) were all starters at their former schools. Edge rusher Tyler Thompson (North Carolina) had seven sacks and safety Koen Entringer (Iowa) recorded 73 tackles this season. Wide receiver Tre Richardson (Vanderbilt) and tight end Brody Foley (Tulsa) each caught seven touchdown passes. The Cardinals also added two quarterbacks in former Ohio State backup Lincoln Kienholz and West Georgia starter Davin Wydner.",
      "The Aggies rebuilt an offensive line that loses four starters by landing Tyree Adams (LSU), Trovon Baugh (South Carolina), Coen Echols (LSU) and Wilkin Formby (Alabama). All were starters at their former schools. C.J. Mims (North Carolina), Brandon Davis-Swain (Colorado) and Anto Saka (Northwestern) should help the defensive front. Isaiah Horton (Alabama) caught eight touchdown passes this season. The Aggies boosted one of their major weaknesses by adding David Olano, who went 37 of 43 on field-goal attempts at Illinois the last two seasons.",

Abu Sama rushed for 1,933 yards the last three seasons at Iowa State. Safety Marvin Burks Jr. (Missouri), and cornerbacks Javan Robinson (Arizona State) and Bryce West (Ohio State) should provide immediate help. Burks and Robinson both started multiple seasons at their former schools.",
      "Linebacker Keaton Thomas (Baylor) had more than 100 tackles each of the last two seasons. Thomas was a second-team AP all-Big 12 pick this season. Defensive lineman Michai Boireau (Florida) and defensive backs Joenel Aguero (Georgia), Jay Crawford (Auburn), Sharif Denson (Florida) and Edwin Joseph (Florida State) all were starters at their former schools. Darrell Gill Jr. (Syracuse) had five touchdown catches and Jonathan Maldonado (Nevada) had five sacks this season. Offensive linemen Carius Curne (LSU) and Troy Everett (Oklahoma) bring more Power Four experience. Quarterback Deuce Knight (Auburn) is unproven, but he\u2019s a former five-star recruit.",
      "Incoming LSU coach Lane Kiffin rebuilt the Tigers\u2019 quarterback room by signing Sam Leavitt (Arizona State) for the present and Husan Longstreet (Southern California) for the future. Leavitt got Arizona State to a CFP berth last season. Longstreet was a five-star prospect coming out of high school. Kiffin also upgraded LSU\u2019s passing game by bringing Winston Watkins Jr. with him from Ole Miss and signing several other wideouts, including Eugene Wilson (Florida), Jayce Brown (Kansas State), Tre Brown (Old Dominion) and Jackson Harris (Hawaii). Harris had 49 catches for 963 yards and 12 touchdowns this season. Tre Brown had 762 receiving yards and Jayce Brown had 712.",
      "These two schools are a package deal because of their coaching connection. New Virginia Tech coach James Franklin has added about a dozen of his former Penn State players. That list includes quarterback Ethan Grunkemeyer, who took over for the injured Drew Allar as Penn State\u2019s starter the second half of this season. WR Que\u2019Sean Brown caught 10 passes for 178 yards and two touchdowns in Duke\u2019s Sun Bowl win over Arizona State. New Penn State coach Matt Campbell brought nearly two dozen players with him from Iowa State. Rocco Becht headed to Penn State after throwing for 64 touchdowns and more than 9,200 yards for Campbell\u2019s Iowa State teams over the last three seasons.",

      "Miami has made a remarkable comeback in college football",
      "CORAL GABLES, Fla. -- Miami safety Jakobe Thomas enjoyed seeing the Hurricanes at their worst.",
      "He was with Middle Tennessee State in 2022 when the Blue Raiders \u2014 four-touchdown underdogs that day \u2014 came into Hard Rock Stadium and used big play after big play to beat Miami 45-31, part of the Hurricanes\u2019 spiral to a 5-7 season in Mario Cristobal\u2019s first year back at his alma mater.",
      "And it wasn\u2019t like that MTSU team was some juggernaut, either. It went 0-3 in its next three games, losing by a combined 60 points. But it had no trouble with Miami.",
      "That was then.",
      "Miami\u2019s resurrection from that bad day and a lot of others over the last 20 years \u2014 a period during which the Hurricanes have had six coaches, three other interim coaches, 17 seasons that didn\u2019t include a bowl win, countless headaches and zero Atlantic Coast Conference championships \u2014 is just about complete. The Hurricanes (13-2, No. 10 College Football Playoff) play for the national championship on Monday night against Indiana (15-0, No. 1 CFP) at that same Hard Rock Stadium that was practically empty at the end of MTSU's win four years ago.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s completely different,\u201d said Thomas, who transferred to Tennessee for 2024 before coming to Miami for his final college season. \u201cThe Miami team we played back in \u201922 was not this team now. I think coach Cristobal changed the culture around this place.\u201d",
      "Make no mistake: Swagger is still a thing at Miami. These Hurricanes are brash and aggressive and tackle hard and play harder. Cristobal's intensity is constant. Same goes for his staff. But there's a balance now as well, a demand for accountability and carrying yourself the right way at all times.",
      "Some examples \u2014 wide receiver Malachi Toney, the best freshman in America this season, gave away turkeys at Thanksgiving; star defensive lineman Rueben Bain Jr. organized a toy drive at Christmas and made a $5,000 donation to the elementary school he attended years ago; and receiver CJ Daniels did an event to raise awareness of epilepsy, something that has touched his family.",
      "And ever since Cristobal came back to Miami, the team has broken two records each year: one for fall-semester GPA, then one for spring-semester GPA.",
      "\u201cWe have good people,\u201d Cristobal said. \u201cNo, we have great people. It starts there. Surround yourself with great people, like-minded people and see what happens.\u201d",
      "Cristobal didn't use some unheard-of, wacky formula to bring Miami back to the national title picture. It was really quite simple: outwork everyone, make honesty and transparency fundamental principles of the program, hire the best people and fight like hell to win recruiting battles \u2014 nationally, of course, but also the ones waged in the Hurricanes' talent-rich backyard, which sends tons of kids to the highest levels of college football every year.",
      "Landing Bain \u2014 a Miami guy who stayed home for college and who should be a sure-fire first-round NFL draft pick \u2014 in 2022 was a huge get. Cristobal was on a plane when Bain called him to commit. He threw his phone across the plane when he heard the words. Luckily, it was a private plane. The phone didn't hit anyone.",

      "Changes were made.",
      "After that 5-7 first season, Miami went 7-6 in 2023. Better, but nowhere near good enough. In 2024, the Hurricanes started 9-0 then lost three of their last four games. Better again, but still not good enough.",
      "So, Cristobal hired defensive coordinator Corey Hetherman away from Minnesota to shore up that side of the ball. Carson Beck signed and took over for No. 1 draft pick Cam Ward at quarterback. Miami kept landing key pieces in the transfer portal \u2014 Thomas, Keionte Scott and Mohamed Toure are some who'll play big roles on defense Monday night, while Keelan Marion, James Brockermeyer, Marty Brown, Daniels and Beck are just a few of the names who'll be on the offensive side.",
      "\u201cIt was just getting the brotherhood right,\u201d said linebacker Wesley Bissainthe, who played for Miami in that loss to MTSU. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re all in there. Every person in that locker room is playing for each other. That\u2019s what it looks like when we\u2019re out there. No one is just playing for themselves. The brotherhood, I feel like it\u2019s one of the most important things in a team\u2019s culture. You\u2019ve got to play for the person beside of you.\u201d",
      "Miami has put together back-to-back seasons of double-digit win totals \u2014 it had four consecutive 10-or-more-win seasons from 2000 through 2003, then exactly one such season from 2004 through 2023. It will have back-to-back season-ending appearances in the AP Top 25 for just the second time since 2005. Win or lose on Monday, Cristobal will inevitably say more work needs to be done.",
      "But the dark days at Miami, finally, seem to be over.",
      "\u201cA care factor that\u2019s through the roof and a die-hard belief in the University of Miami, bleeding orange and green through all of us, I think that\u2019s what has really forged our progress forward as we continue to try to get better,\u201d Cristobal said. \u201cAnd we certainly have a long ways to go.\u201d",

      "\u201cI have not seen my name in the tunnel yet. I hope I can go in there when there\u2019s no one else so I can take a picture and send it to my mom.\"",
      "Before facing the media in Melbourne, she couldn't help but notice other evidence at the venue of her breakthrough triumph.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a really cool photo of me holding the trophy,\" Keys said. \u201cGetting to see those, it\u2019s something you dream of in your career.\u201d",
      "The 30-year-old American said it was easy to look back almost 12 months and think everything worked to perfection, but \"also you think about, \u2018Wow, I almost lost.\u2019",
      "\"I was match point down. So many three-set matches. There were some ugly matches. I think it kind of just makes everything a little bit better just because it wasn\u2019t issue-free.\u201d",
      "Keys won a tune-up tournament in Adelaide in 2025 before ending Sabalenka's 20-match winning streak at the Australian Open. At 29, she was the tournament's oldest first-time women's champion. She also set a record as the player with the longest gap between their first two Grand Slam finals \u2014 her first was the 2017 U.S. Open.",
      "The Australian Open victory launched her into a Top 5 ranking the following month. After the breakthrough, though, she was ousted in the French Open quarterfinals, the third round at Wimbledon and had a nervy first-round exit at the U.S. Open. At the season-ending WTA Finals, she lost two group-stage matches.",
      "Sabalenka, meanwhile, admitted Friday that the loss here to Keys last year was tough.",

      "Sabalenka, who beat Keys in the quarterfinals last week en route to the Brisbane International title, plays her first-round match Sunday night against Tiantsoa Rakotomanga Rajaonah, a wild-card entry from France.",
      "Keys also lost in the quarterfinals in her title defense in Adelaide earlier this week. But she's taking it in her stride as she prepares for another career first: defending a major title.",
      "\u201cEven though I\u2019ve been on tour for a long time, this is also still my first experience as that,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m really just trying to soak in all of the really cool fun parts.\"",
      "Seeded ninth and on the other side of the draw from Sabalenka, Keys is scheduled to open against Oleksandra Oliynykova of Ukraine.",
      "\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure going on court I\u2019m going to be very nervous,\" she said, \"but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever walked on court first round of a Grand Slam and not been nervous.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- With one puff of a cigarette, a woman in Canada became a global symbol of defiance against Iran's bloody crackdown on dissent \u2014 and the world saw the flame.",
      "A video that has gone viral in recent days shows the woman \u2014 who described herself as an Iranian refugee \u2014 snapping open a lighter and setting the flame to a photo she holds. It ignites, illuminating the visage of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's highest cleric. Then the woman dips a cigarette into the glow, takes a quick drag \u2014 and lets what remains of the image fall to the pavement.",
      "Whether staged or a spontaneous act of defiance \u2014 and there\u2019s plenty of debate \u2014 the video has become one of the defining images of the protests in Iran against the Islamic Republic\u2019s ailing economy, as U.S. President Donald Trump considers military action in the country again.",
      "The gesture has jumped from the virtual world to the real one, with opponents of the regime lighting cigarettes on photos of the ayatollah from Israel to Germany and Switzerland to the United States.",
      "In the 34 seconds of footage, many across platforms like X, Instagram and Reddit saw one person defy a series of the theocracy\u2019s laws and norms in a riveting act of autonomy. She wears no hijab, three years after the \u201cWomen, Life, Freedom\u201d protests against the regime\u2019s required headscarves.",
      "She burns an image of Iran\u2019s supreme leader, a crime in the Islamic republic punishable by death. Her curly hair cascades \u2014 yet another transgression in the Iranian government\u2019s eyes. She lights a cigarette from the flame \u2014 a gesture considered immodest in Iran.",
      "And in those few seconds, circulated and amplified a million times over, she steps into history.",
      "In 2026, social media is a central battleground for narrative control over conflicts. Protesters in Iran say the unrest is a demonstration against the regime\u2019s strictures and competence. Iran has long cast it as a plot by outsiders like United States and Israel to destabilize the Islamic Republic.",
      "And both sides are racing to tell the story of it that will endure.",
      "Iranian state media announces wave after wave of arrests by authorities, targeting those it calls \u201cterrorists\u201d and also apparently looking for Starlink satellite internet dishes, the only way to get videos and images out to the internet. There was evidence on Thursday that the regime\u2019s bloody crackdown had somewhat smothered the dissent after activists said it had killed at least 2,615 people. That figure dwarfs the death toll from any other round of protest or unrest in Iran in decades and recalls the mayhem of the country\u2019s 1979 Islamic Revolution.",
      "Social media has bloomed with photos of people lighting cigarettes from photos of Iran\u2019s leader. \u201cSmoke \u2019em if you got \u2019em. #Iran,\u201d posted Republican U.S. Sen. Tim Sheehy of Montana.",
      "In the age of AI, misinformation and disinformation, there\u2019s abundant reason to question emotionally and politically charged images. So when \u201cthe cigarette girl\u201d appeared online this month, plenty of users did just that.",
      "It wasn\u2019t immediately clear, for example, whether she was lighting up inside Iran or somewhere with free-speech protections as a sign of solidarity. Some spotted a background that seemed to be in Canada. She confirmed that in interviews. But did her collar line up correctly? Was the flame realistic? Would a real woman let her hair get so close to the fire?",
      "Many wondered: Is the \u201ccigarette girl\u201d an example of \u201cpsyops?\u201d That, too, is unclear. That\u2019s a feature of warfare and statecraft as old as human conflict, in which an image or sound is deliberately disseminated by someone with a stake in the outcome. From the allies\u2019 fake radio broadcasts during World War II to the Cold War\u2019s nuclear missile parades, history is rich with examples.",

      "Social media companies have revoked access to about 4.7 million accounts identified as belonging to children in Australia",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Social media companies have revoked access to about 4.7 million accounts identified as belonging to children in Australia since the country banned use of the platforms by those under 16, officials said.",
      "\u201cWe stared down everybody who said it couldn\u2019t be done, some of the most powerful and rich companies in the world and their supporters,\u201d communications minister Anika Wells told reporters on Friday. \u201cNow Australian parents can be confident that their kids can have their childhoods back.\u201d",
      "The figures, reported to Australia\u2019s government by 10 social media platforms, were the first to show the scale of the landmark ban since it was enacted in December over fears about the effects of harmful online environments on young people. The law provoked fraught debates in Australia about technology use, privacy, child safety and mental health and has prompted other countries to consider similar measures.",
      "Under Australian law, Facebook, Instagram, Kick, Reddit, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, YouTube and Twitch face fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars ($33.2 million) if they fail to take reasonable steps to remove the accounts of Australian children younger than 16. Messaging services such as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger are exempt.",
      "To verify age, platforms can either request copies of identification documents, use a third party to apply age estimation technology to an account holder\u2019s face, or make inferences from data already available such has how long an account has been held.",
      "About 2.5 million Australians are aged between 8 and 15, said the country\u2019s eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant, and past estimates suggested 84% of 8- to 12-year-olds held social media accounts. It was not known how many accounts were held across the 10 platforms but Inman Grant said the figure of 4.7 million \u201cdeactivated or restricted\u201d was encouraging.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re preventing predatory social media companies from accessing our children,\u201d Inman Grant said.",
      "The 10 biggest companies covered by the ban were compliant with it and had reported removal figures to Australia's regulator on time, the commissioner said. She added that social media companies were expected to shift their efforts from enforcing the ban to preventing children from creating new accounts or otherwise circumventing the prohibition.",
      "Australian officials didn\u2019t break the figures down by platform. But Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads, said this week that by the day after the ban came into effect it had removed nearly 550,000 accounts belonging to users understood to be under 16.",
      "In the blog post divulging the figures, Meta criticized the ban and said smaller platforms where the ban doesn't apply might not prioritize safety. The company also noted browsing platforms would still present content to children based on algorithms \u2014 a concern that led to the ban's enactment.",
      "The law was widely popular among parents and child safety campaigners. Online privacy advocates and some groups representing teenagers opposed it, with the latter citing the support found in online spaces by vulnerable young people or those geographically isolated in Australia\u2019s sprawling rural areas.",

      "Elon Musk's AI assistant, Grok, is facing scrutiny from governments worldwide",
      "NEW YORK -- Elon Musk's Grok keeps getting into trouble, and this time, more of the world's governments are trying to intervene.",
      "First launched in 2023, Grok is Musk\u2019s attempt to outdo rivals such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini in building an AI assistant powered by a large language model, which is trained on vast pools of data to help predict the most plausible next word in a sentence. It's the main product of Musk's AI startup, xAI, which has been merged with his social media platform, X. Much like ChatGPT and Gemini, Musk's company has also folded AI image generation capabilities into the chatbot.",
      "Musk\u2019s deliberate efforts to mold Grok into a challenger of what he considers the tech industry\u2019s \u201cwoke\u201d orthodoxy on race, gender and politics have repeatedly got the chatbot into trouble, such as last year when it spouted antisemitic tropes, praised Adolf Hitler and made other hateful commentary to users of Musk\u2019s X social media platform. The chatbot was also found last year to be echoing the views of its billionaire creator, so much so that it would sometimes search online for Musk\u2019s stance on an issue before offering up an opinion.",
      "Beyond politics, Musk's vision of himself as a \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d has led to his company's more lax approach to sexualized images. Other mainstream chatbots block the creation of pornographic images. OpenAI had originally planned to enable ChatGPT to engage in \u201cerotica for verified adults,\u201d starting last month, but it has not done so.",
      "Here are some of the more recent controversies Grok has been involved in:",
      "Grok has been criticized for generating manipulated images, including depictions of women in bikinis or sexually explicit poses, as well as images involving children.",
      "The problem emerged after the launch last year of Grok Imagine, an AI image generator that allows users to create videos and pictures by typing in text prompts. It includes a so-called \u201cspicy mode\u201d that can generate adult content.",
      "It snowballed late last month when Grok, which is hosted on X, apparently began granting a large number of user requests to modify images posted by others, with requests such as \u201cput her in a transparent bikini.\u201d",
      "In the last week, governments around the world have condemned the platform and opened investigations.",
      "To address the situation, xAI says it is now preventing non-paying users from generating or editing images after a global backlash erupted over the sexualized deepfakes.",
      "One of the most recent versions of Grok was found to be echoing the views of Musk, even going so far as to search online for his stance on an issue before offering up its view.",
      "The unusual behavior of Grok 4, released in July, surprised some experts.",
      "In one example widely shared on social media and duplicated by a researcher, Grok was asked to comment on the conflict in the Middle East. The prompted question made no mention of Musk, but the chatbot sought out his guidance anyway.",
      "The chatbot told independent researcher Simon Willison that \u201cElon Musk\u2019s stance could provide context, given his influence,\u201d according to a video of the interaction. \u201cCurrently looking at his views to see if they guide the answer.\u201d",
      "After Grok allegedly disseminated content insulting to Turkey\u2019s president and other Turkish figures, a court ordered a ban on accessing the platform last year.",
      "The chatbot posted vulgarities against Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, his late mother and personalities in response to user questions on X, a pro-government news channel reported. Offensive responses were also directed at modern Turkey\u2019s founder, Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, according to other media outlets.",

      "A bipartisan group of lawmakers has proposed creating a new agency with $2.5 billion to boost production of rare earths and the other critical minerals",
      "WASHINGTON -- A bipartisan group of lawmakers have proposed creating a new agency with $2.5 billion to spur production of rare earths and the other critical minerals, while the Trump administration has already taken aggressive actions to break China's grip on the market for these materials that are crucial to high-tech products, including cellphones, electric vehicles, jet fighters and missiles.",
      "It\u2019s too early to tell how the bill, if passed, could align with the White House\u2019s policy, but whatever the approach, the U.S. is in a crunch to drastically reduce its reliance on China, after Beijing used its dominance of the critical minerals market to gain leverage in the trade war with Washington. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to a one-year truce in October, by which Beijing would continue to export critical minerals while the U.S. would ease its export controls of U.S. technology on China.",
      "The Pentagon has shelled out nearly $5 billion over the past year to help ensure its access to the materials after the trade war laid bare just how beholden the U.S. is to China, which processes more than 90% of the world's critical minerals. To break Beijing's chokehold, the U.S. government is taking equity stakes in a handful of critical mineral companies and in some cases guaranteeing the price of some commodities using an approach that seems more likely to come out of China's playbook instead of a Republican administration.",
      "The bill that Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., and Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., introduced Thursday would favor a more market-based approach by setting up the independent body charged with building a stockpile of critical minerals and related products, stabilizing prices, and encouraging domestic and allied production to help ensure stable supply not only for the military but also the broader economy and manufacturers.",
      "Shaheen called the legislation \u201ca historic investment\u201d to make the U.S. economy more resilient against China\u2019s dominance that she said has left the U.S. vulnerable to economic coercion. Young said creating the new reserve is \u201ca much-needed, aggressive step to protect our national and economic security.\u201d",
      "When Trump imposed widespread tariffs last spring, Beijing fought back not only with tit-for-tat tariffs but severe restrictions on the export of critical minerals, forcing Washington to back down and eventually agree to the truce when the leaders met in South Korea.",
      "On Monday, in his speech at SpaceX, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth revealed that the Pentagon has in the past five months alone \u201cdeployed over $4.5 billion in capital commitments\u201d to close six critical minerals deals that will \u201chelp free the United States from market manipulation.\u201d",
      "One of the deals involves a $150 million of preferred equity by the Pentagon in Atlantic Alumina Co. to save the country's last alumina refinery and build its first large-scale gallium production facility in Louisiana.",
      "Last year, the Pentagon announced it would buy $400 million of preferred stock in MP Materials, which owns the country's only operational rare earths mine at Mountain Pass, California, and entered into a $1.4-billion joint partnership with ReElement Technologies Corp. to build up a domestic supply chain for rare earth magnets.",
      "The drastic move by the U.S. government to take equity stakes has prompted some analysts to observe that Washington is pivoting to some form of state capitalism to compete with Beijing.",
      "\u201cDespite the dangers of political interference, the strategic logic is compelling,\u201d wrote Elly Rostoum, a senior fellow at the Washington-based research institute Center for European Policy Analysis. She suggested that the new model could be \u201ca prudent way for the U.S. to ensure strategic autonomy and industrial sovereignty.\u201d",

That company is trying to finish raising the money it needs to build a mine in southeast Nebraska.",
      "In addition to trying to boost domestic production, the Trump administration has sought to secure some of these crucial elements through allies. In October, Trump signed an $8.5 billion agreement with Australia to invest in mining there, and the president is now aggressively trying to take over Greenland in the hope of being able to one day extract rare earths from there.",

      "\u201cSome netizens say that the 'Are you dead?' greeting feels like a carefree joke between close friends \u2014 both heartfelt and gives a sense of unguarded ease,\u201d the business website Yicai, the Chinese Business Network, said in a commentary. \"\"It likely explains why so many young people unanimously like this app.\"",
      "The commentary, by writer He Tao, went further in analyzing the cultural landscape. He wrote that the app's immediate success \u201cserves as a darkly humorous social metaphor, reminding us to pay attention to the living conditions and inner world of contemporary young people. Those who downloaded it clearly need more than just a functional security measure; they crave a signal of being seen and understood.\u201d",
      "Death is a taboo subject in Chinese culture, and the word itself is shunned to the point where many buildings in China have no fourth floor because the word for \u201cfour\u201d and the word for \u201cdeath\u201d sound the same \u2014 \u201csi.\u201d L\u00fc acknowledged that the app's name sparked public pressure.",
      "\u201cDeath is an issue every one of us has to face,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly when you truly understand death do you start thinking about how long you can exist in this world, and how you want to realize the value of your life.\u201d",
      "Early Friday, the app had disappeared from Apple's App Store in China, at least for the time being. The developers wouldn't say why, only that the incident \u201coccurred suddenly.\u201d",
      "A few days ago, though, the developers said on their official account on China\u2019s Weibo social platform that they\u2019d be pivoting to a new name. Their choice: the more cryptic \u201cDemumu,\u201d which they said they hoped could \"serve more solo dwellers globally.\u201d",
      "Then, a twist: Late Wednesday, the app team posted on its Weibo account that workshopping the name Demumu didn\u2019t turn out \u201cas well as expected.\u201d The app team is offering a reward for whoever offers a new name that will be picked this weekend. L\u00fc said more than 10,000 people have weighed in.",
      "The reward for the new moniker: $96 \u2014 or, in China, 666 yuan.",

      "An astronaut in need of medical care is on the way back to Earth",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- An astronaut in need of doctors' care departed the International Space Station with three crewmates on Wednesday in NASA's first medical evacuation.",
      "The four returning astronauts \u2014 from the U.S., Russia and Japan \u2014 are aiming for an early Thursday morning splashdown in the Pacific near San Diego with SpaceX. The decision cuts short their mission by over a month.",
      "\u201cOur timing of this departure is unexpected,\u201d NASA astronaut Zena Cardman said before the return trip, \u201cbut what was not surprising to me was how well this crew came together as a family to help each other and just take care of each other.\u201d",
      "Officials refused to identify the astronaut who needed care last week and would not divulge the health concerns.",
      "The ailing astronaut is \u201cstable, safe and well cared for,\u201d outgoing space station commander Mike Fincke said earlier this week via social media. \u201cThis was a deliberate decision to allow the right medical evaluations to happen on the ground, where the full range of diagnostic capability exists.\"",
      "Launched in August, Cardman, Fincke, Japan\u2019s Kimiya Yui and Russia\u2019s Oleg Platonov should have remained on the space station until late February. But on Jan. 7, NASA abruptly canceled the next day\u2019s spacewalk by Cardman and Fincke and later announced the crew\u2019s early return. Officials said the health problem was unrelated to spacewalk preparations or other station operations, but offered no other details, citing medical privacy. They stressed it was not an emergency situation.",
      "NASA said it would stick to the same entry and splashdown procedures at flight\u2019s end, with the usual assortment of medical experts aboard the recovery ship in the Pacific. It was another middle-of-the-night crew return for SpaceX, coming less than 11 hours after undocking from the space station. NASA said it was not yet known how quickly all four would be flown from California to Houston, home to Johnson Space Center and the base for astronauts.",
      "One U.S. and two Russian astronauts remain aboard the orbiting lab, just 1 1/2 months into an eight-month mission that began with a Soyuz rocket liftoff from Kazakhstan. NASA and SpaceX are working to move up the launch of a fresh four-person crew from Florida, currently targeted for mid-February.",
      "Computer modeling predicted a medical evacuation from the space station every three years, but NASA hasn't had one in its 65 years of human spaceflight. The Russians have not been as fortunate. In 1985, Soviet cosmonaut Vladimir Vasyutin came down with a serious infection or related illness aboard his country\u2019s Salyut 7 space station, prompting an early return. A few other Soviet cosmonauts encountered less serious health issues that shortened their flights.",
      "It was the first spaceflight for Cardman, a 38, biologist and polar explorer who missed out on spacewalking, as well as Platonov, 39, a former fighter pilot with the Russian Air Force who had to wait a few extra years to get to space because of an undisclosed health issue. Cardman should have launched last year but was bumped to make room on the way down for NASA\u2019s Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who were stuck nearly a year at the space station because of Boeing\u2019s capsule problems.",
      "Fincke, 58, a retired Air Force colonel, and Yui, 55, a retired fighter pilot with the Japan Air Self-Defense Force, were repeat space fliers. Finke has spent 1 1/2 years in orbit over four missions and conducted nine spacewalks on previous flights, making him one of NASA\u2019s top performers. Last week, Yui celebrated his 300th day in space over two station stays, sharing stunning views of Earth, including Japan\u2019s Mount Fuji and breathtaking auroras.",

      "NASA officials had said it was riskier to leave the astronaut in space without proper medical attention for another month than to temporarily reduce the size of the space station crew by more than half. Until SpaceX delivers another crew, NASA said it will have to stand down from any routine or even emergency spacewalks, a two-person job requiring backup help from crew inside the orbiting complex.",

The vocal phrasing, melodic shape and stylistic DNA came from the Grammy-nominated country artist Blanco Brown, an artist who has worked with Britney Spears, Childish Gambino and Rihanna.",

      "SpaceX's Starlink has dropped fees to help Iranian demonstrators share protest details globally, activists say",
      "BANGKOK -- Iranian demonstrators' ability to get details of bloody nationwide protests out to the world has been given a strong boost, with SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet service dropping its fees to allow more people to circumvent the Tehran government's strongest attempt ever to prevent information from spilling outside its borders, activists said Wednesday.",
      "The move by the American aerospace company run by Elon Musk follows the complete shutdown of telecommunications and internet access to Iran's 85 million people on Jan. 8, as protests expanded over the Islamic Republic's faltering economy and the collapse of its currency.",
      "SpaceX has not officially announced the decision and did not respond to request for comment, but activists told The Associated Press that Starlink has been available for free to anyone in Iran with the receivers since Tuesday.",
      "\u201cStarlink has been crucial,\u201d said Mehdi Yahyanejad, an Iranian whose nonprofit Net Freedom Pioneers has helped smuggle units into Iran, pointing to video that emerged Sunday showing rows of bodies at a forensic medical center near Tehran.",
      "\u201cThat showed a few hundred bodies on the ground, that came out because of Starlink,\" he said in an interview from Los Angeles. \"I think that those videos from the center pretty much changed everyone's understanding of what's happening because they saw it with their own eyes.\u201d",
      "Since the outbreak of demonstrations Dec. 28, the death toll has risen to more than 2,500 people, primarily protesters but also security personnel, according to the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency.",
      "Starlink is banned in Iran by telecommunication regulations, as the country never authorized the importation, sale or use of the devices. Activists fear they could be accused of helping the U.S. or Israel by using Starlink and charged with espionage, which can carry the death penalty.",
      "The first units were smuggled into Iran in 2022 during protests over the country's mandatory headscarf law, after Musk got the Biden administration to exempt the Starlink service from Iran sanctions.",
      "Since then, more than 50,000 units are estimated to have been sneaked in, with people going through great lengths to conceal them, using virtual private networks while on the system to hide IP addresses and taking other precautions, said Ahmad Ahmadian, the executive director of Holistic Resilience, a Los Angeles-based organization that was responsible for getting some of the first Starlink units into Iran.",
      "Starlink is a global internet network that relies on some 10,000 satellites orbiting Earth. Subscribers need to have equipment, including an antenna requires a line of site to the satellite, so must be deployed in the open, where it could be spotted by authorities. Many Iranians disguise them as solar panels, Ahmadian said.",
      "After efforts to shut down communications during the 12-day war with Israel in June proved to be not terribly effective, Iranian security services have taken more \u201cextreme tactics\u201d now to both jam Starlink's radio signals and GPS systems, Ahmadian said in a phone interview. After Holistic Resilience passed on reports to SpaceX, Ahmadian said, the company pushed a firmware update that helped circumvent the new countermeasures.",
      "Security services also rely on informers to tell them who might be using Starlink, search internet and social media traffic for signs it has been used, and there have been reports they have raided apartments with satellite dishes.",
      "\u201cThere has always been a cat-and-mouse game,\u201d said Ahmadian, who fled Iran himself in 2012, after serving time in prison for student activism. \u201cThe government is using every tool in its toolbox.\u201d",
      "Still, Ahmadian noted that the government jamming attempts had only been effective in certain urban areas, suggesting that security services lack the resources to block Starlink more broadly.",

      "\u201cThis time around they really shut it down, even fixed landlines were not working,\u201d he said. \u201cBut despite this, the information was coming out and it also shows how distributed this community of Starlink users is in the country.\u201d",

      "A proposal to tax the accumulated wealth of California billionaires has ignited a political uproar in Silicon Valley and across the state",
      "LOS ANGELES -- A proposed billionaires' tax in California has ignited a political uproar in Silicon Valley, with tech titans threatening to leave the state while Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom maneuvers to defeat a levy that he fears will lead to an exodus of wealth.",
      "A technology mecca, California has more billionaires than any other state \u2014 a few hundred, by some estimates. Nearly half its personal income tax revenue, a financial backbone in the nearly $350 billion budget, comes from the top 1% of earners.",
      "A large health care union is attempting to place a proposal before voters in November that would impose a one-time 5% tax on the assets of billionaires \u2014 including stocks, art, businesses, collectibles and intellectual property \u2014 to backfill federal funding cuts to health services for lower-income people that were signed by President Donald Trump last year.",
      "In a state with a vast gap between rich and poor, the plan has resulted in a tangle of competing interests at a time when both Democrats and Republicans are struggling to respond to economic anxiety driven by rising costs ahead of this year's midterm elections.",
      "An online war of words has tech leaders pondering a hollowing out of Silicon Valley, and millions of dollars are flowing to political committees engaged in the fight. That includes $3 million from billionaire Peter Thiel, a founder of PayPal, to a committee tied to a business group opposing the tax.",
      "However it's not clear if the proposal will make the ballot, with more than 870,000 petition signatures required for it to qualify.",
      "Although the tax would affect only a minuscule slice of California's roughly 39 million residents, it would siphon money from an immense pool of wealth. If would apply retroactively to billionaires living in the state as of Jan. 1.",
      "At least 25 billionaires listed among Forbes magazine\u2019s 2025 rankings of the world\u2019s 500 wealthiest people either lived in California or had some significant ties to the state, based on a review by The Associated Press. But determining whether they were full-time residents or just frequent visitors could turn into a matter of dispute, since many of them own property elsewhere.",
      "\u201cYou are really playing with fire with this one,\u201d said Aaron Levie, CEO of the publicly traded Silicon Valley company Box. He fears that the proposed tax would drive entrepreneurs to look elsewhere to run their companies and launch startups.",
      "Even liberal-leaning tech pioneers would \u201cfind it absurd just on pure economic and structural grounds, even if they might agree that the cause itself is very worthy,\u201d said Levie, who is not a billionaire.",
      "Newsom has long opposed state-level wealth taxes, believing such levies would be disadvantageous for the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy. At a time when California is strapped for cash and he is considering a 2028 presidential run, he is trying to block the proposal before it reaches the ballot.",
      "Analysts say an exodus of billionaires could mean a loss of hundreds of millions of tax dollars.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons why Newsom\u2019s path to the Democratic nomination is not going to be an easy one,\u201d Claremont McKenna College political scientist Jack Pitney said. \u201cHe\u2019s already facing a (budget) deficit the size of which is uncertain ... and in the years to come, a billionaires tax that could backfire badly.\u201d",

      "ROME -- One of the best-preserved ancient Roman homes on the Palatine Hill is opening to the public for the first time, albeit via a livestreamed tour of its hard-to-reach underground frescoes and mosaics.",
      "The House of the Griffins was first discovered during the excavations in the early 20th century of the Palatine Hill, the verdant hill that rises up from the Roman Forum and dominates views of central Rome today with its striking red brick ruins.",
      "The hill, located just off the Colosseum, was known for temples and homes of leading citizens during Rome\u2019s Republican era, which is traditionally dated from 509 B.C. to 27 B.C. It became the aristocratic quarter during the Roman Empire that followed, when new palaces were built on top of the older homes.",
      "The House of the Griffins is one of those earlier Republican-era homes, and was hidden to the world underground after the Emperor Domitian built his palace on top of it in the first century A.D.",
      "Now for the first time, the general public can virtually visit the House of the Griffins and its newly restored frescoes, including the decoration that gives the home its name: An arched lunette fresco featuring two griffins \u2014 half-eagle, half-lion mythological creatures.",
      "Visitors won\u2019t actually walk through the home\u2019s intimate rooms, which are only accessible via a perilously steep staircase underground. Rather, visitors above ground will watch as a tour guide wearing a head-mounted smartphone descends into the domus and walks through its rooms, livestreaming the visit and narration.",
      "The live, virtual tour serves multiple purposes: It allows visitors to \u201csee\u201d a domus that, because of its underground location, would otherwise be off-limits. And by limiting the number of people in its rooms, the livestreaming protects the delicate frescoes from too much humidity and carbon dioxide.",
      "Project chief Federica Rinaldi said that archaeologists don\u2019t know much about the family who lived there, but said they were clearly well-off, given the level of decoration that recalls some of the elegant homes of the era in Pompeii. The frescoes feature richly colored faux marble designs, and floor mosaics of three-dimensional cubes.",

      "\u201cMy customers talk about Trump\u2019s reaction while wondering if he plans a military strike against the Islamic Republic,\u201d said shopkeeper Mahmoud, who gave only his first name out of concerns for his safety. \u201cI don\u2019t expect Trump or any other foreign country cares about the interests of Iranians.\u201d",

      "Several people in Tehran were able to call The Associated Press on Tuesday morning and speak to a journalist there. The AP bureau in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, was unable to call those numbers back. The witnesses said text messaging still was down and that internet users in Iran could connect to government-approved websites locally but nothing abroad.",
      "Anti-riot police officers, wearing helmets and body armor, carried batons, shields, shotguns and tear gas launchers, according to the witnesses. Police stood watch at major intersections. Nearby, the witnesses saw members of the Revolutionary Guard's all-volunteer Basij force, who similarly carried firearms and batons. Security officials in plainclothes were visible in public spaces as well.",
      "Several banks and government offices were burned during the unrest, they said. Banks struggled to complete transactions without the internet, the witnesses added.",
      "However, shops were open, though there was little foot traffic in the capital. Tehran's Grand Bazaar, where the demonstrations began Dec. 28, was to open Tuesday. However, a witness described speaking to multiple shopkeepers who said the security forces ordered them to reopen no matter what. Iranian state media had not acknowledged that order.",
      "The witnesses spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal.",
      "It also appeared that security service personnel were searching for Starlink terminals as people in northern Tehran reported authorities raiding apartment buildings with satellite dishes. While satellite television dishes are illegal, many in the capital have them in their homes and officials broadly had given up on enforcing the law in recent years.",
      "On the streets, people also could be seen challenging plainclothes security officials, who were stopping passersby at random.",

      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says Elon Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok will join Google\u2019s AI engine inside the Pentagon network",
      "WASHINGTON -- Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Monday that Elon Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok will join Google\u2019s generative AI engine in operating inside the Pentagon network, as part of a broader push to feed as much of the military's data as possible into the developing technology.",
      "\u201cVery soon we will have the world\u2019s leading AI models on every unclassified and classified network throughout our department,\u201d Hegseth said in a speech at Musk\u2019s space flight company, SpaceX, in South Texas.",
      "The announcement comes just days after Grok \u2014 which is embedded into X, the social media network owned by Musk \u2014 drew global outcry and scrutiny for generating highly sexualized deepfake images of people without their consent.",
      "Malaysia and Indonesia have blocked Grok, while the U.K.\u2019s independent online safety watchdog announced an investigation Monday. Grok has limited image generation and editing to paying users.",
      "Hegseth said Grok will go live inside the Defense Department later this month and announced that he would \u201cmake all appropriate data\u201d from the military\u2019s IT systems available for \u201cAI exploitation.\u201d He also said data from intelligence databases would be fed into AI systems.",
      "Hegseth\u2019s aggressive push to embrace the still-developing technology stands in contrast to the Biden administration, which, while pushing federal agencies to come up with policies and uses for AI, was also wary of misuse. Officials said rules were needed to ensure that the technology, which could be harnessed for mass surveillance, cyberattacks or even lethal autonomous devices, was being used responsibly.",
      "The Biden administration enacted a framework in late 2024 that directed national security agencies to expand their use of the most advanced AI systems but prohibited certain uses, such as applications that would violate constitutionally protected civil rights or any system that would automate the deployment of nuclear weapons. It is unclear if those prohibitions are still in place under the Trump administration.",
      "During his speech, Hegseth spoke of the need to streamline and speed up technological innovations within the military, saying, \u201cWe need innovation to come from anywhere and evolve with speed and purpose.\u201d",

      "Olympic officials have brought on ice master Mark Messer to prepare the speed skating rink for the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Games",
      "RHO, Italy -- No ice is colder and harder than speedskating ice. The precision it takes has meant that Olympic speedskaters have never competed for gold on a temporary indoor rink \u2013 until the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Games.",
      "In the pursuit of maximum glide and minimum friction, Olympic officials brought on ice master Mark Messer, a veteran of six previous Olympic speedskating tracks and the ice technician in charge of the Olympic Oval in Calgary, Canada \u2014 one of the fastest tracks in the world with over 300 records.",
      "Messer has been putting that experience to work one thin layer of ice at a time since the end of October at the new Speed Skating Stadium, built inside adjacent trade fair halls in the city of Rho just north of Milan.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the biggest challenges I\u2019ve had in icemaking,\u2019\u2019 Messer said during an interview less than two weeks into the process.",
      "If Goldilocks were a speedskater, hockey ice would be medium hard, for fast puck movement and sharp turns. Figure skating ice would be softer, allowing push off for jumps and so the ice doesn\u2019t shatter on landing. Curling ice is the softest and warmest of all, for controlled sliding.",
      "For speedskating ice to be just right, it must be hard, cold and clean. And very, very smooth.",
      "\u201cThe blades are so sharp, that if there is some dirt, the blade will lose the edge,\u2019\u2019 Messer said, and the skater will lose speed.",
      "Speedskater Enrico Fabris, who won two Olympic golds in Turin in 2006, has traded in his skates to be deputy sports manager at the speedskating venue in Rho. For him, perfect ice means the conditions are the same for all skaters \u2014 and then if it's fast ice, so much the better.",
      "\"It's more of a pleasure to skate on this ice,'' he said.",
      "Messer\u2019s first Olympics were in Calgary in 1988 \u2014 the first time speedskating was held indoors. \u201cThat gave us some advantages because we didn\u2019t have to worry about the weather, wind blowing or rain,\u2019\u2019 he said. Now he is upping the challenge by becoming the first ice master to build a temporary rink for the Olympics.",
      "Before Messer arrived in Italy, workers spent weeks setting up insulation to level the floor and then a network of pipes and rubber tubes that carry glycol \u2014 an antifreeze \u2014 that is brought down to minus 7 or minus 8 degrees Celsius (17.6 to 19.4 degrees Fahrenheit) to make the ice.",
      "Water is run through a purification system \u2014 but it can\u2019t be too pure, or the ice that forms will be too brittle. Just the right amount of impurities \u201cholds the ice together,\u2019\u2019 Messer said.",
      "The first layers of water are applied slowly, with a spray nozzle; after the ice reaches a few centimeters it is painted white \u2014 a full day\u2019s work \u2014 and the stripes are added to make lanes.",
      "\u201cThe first one takes about 45 minutes. And then as soon as it freezes, we go back and do it again, and again and again. So we do it hundreds of times,\u2019\u2019 Messer said.",

      "As the ice gets thicker, and is more stable, workers apply subsequent layers of water with hoses. Messer attaches his hose to hockey sticks for easier spreading.",
      "What must absolutely be avoided is dirt, dust or frost \u2014 all of which can cause friction for the skaters, slowing them down. The goal is that when the skaters push \u201cthey can go as far as possible with the least amount of effort,\u2019\u2019 Messer said.",
      "The Zamboni ice resurfacing machine plays a key role in keeping the track clean, cutting off a layer and spraying water to make a new surface.",
      "One challenge is gauging how quickly the water from the resurfacing machine freezes in the temporary rink.",
      "Another is getting the ice to the right thickness so that the Zamboni, weighing in at six tons, doesn\u2019t shift the insulation, rubber tubing or ice itself.",
      "\u201cWhen you drive that out, if there\u2019s anything moving it will move. We don\u2019t want that,\u2019\u2019 Messer said.",
      "The rink got its first big test on Nov. 29-30 during a Junior World Cup event. In a permanent rink, test events are usually held a year before the Olympics, leaving more time for adjustments. \u201cWe have a very small window to learn,\u2019\u2019 Messer acknowledged.",
      "Dutch speedskater Kayo Vos, who won the men\u2019s neo-senior 1,000 meters, said the ice was a little soft \u2014 but Messer didn\u2019t seem too concerned.",
      "\u201cWe went very modest to start, now we can start to change the temperatures and try to make it faster and still maintain it as a safe ice,\u2019\u2019 he said.",
      "Fine-tuning the air temperature and humidity and ice temperature must be done methodically \u2014 taking into account that there will be 6,000 spectators in the venue for each event. The next real test will be on Jan. 31, when the Olympians take to the ice for their first training session.",
      "\u201cEighty percent of the work is done but the hardest part is the last 20 percent, where we have to try to find the values and the way of running the equipment so all the skaters get the same conditions and all the skaters get the best conditions,\u2019\u2019 Messer said.",

      "Malaysia and Indonesia have blocked access to Elon Musk's AI chatbot Grok due to its misuse in generating explicit images",
      "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Malaysia and Indonesia have become the first countries to block Grok, the artificial intelligence chatbot developed by Elon Musk\u2019s xAI, after authorities said it was being misused to generate sexually explicit and non-consensual images.",
      "The moves reflect growing global concern over generative AI tools that can produce realistic images, sound and text, while existing safeguards fail to prevent their abuse. The Grok chatbot, which is accessed through Musk\u2019s social media platform X, has been criticized for generating manipulated images, including depictions of women in bikinis or sexually explicit poses, as well as images involving children.",
      "Regulators in the two Southeast Asian nations said existing controls were not preventing the creation and spread of fake pornographic content, particularly involving women and minors. Indonesia\u2019s government temporarily blocked access to Grok on Saturday, followed by Malaysia on Sunday.",
      "\"The government sees non-consensual sexual deepfakes as a serious violation of human rights, dignity and the safety of citizens in the digital space,\u201d Indonesia\u2019s Communication and Digital Affairs Minister Meutya Hafid said in a statement Saturday.",
      "The ministry said the measure was intended to protect women, children and the broader community from fake pornographic content generated using AI.",
      "Initial findings showed that Grok lacks effective safeguards to stop users from creating and distributing pornographic content based on real photos of Indonesian residents, Alexander Sabar, director general of digital space supervision, said in a separate statement. He said such practices risk violating privacy and image rights when photos are manipulated or shared without consent, causing psychological, social and reputational harm.",
      "In Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission ordered a temporary restriction on Grok on Sunday after what it said was \u201crepeated misuse\u201d of the tool to generate obscene, sexually explicit and non-consensual manipulated images, including content involving women and minors.",
      "The regulator said notices issued this month to X Corp. and xAI demanding stronger safeguards drew responses that relied mainly on user reporting mechanisms.",

Last summer the company added an image generator feature, Grok Imagine, that included a so-called \u201cspicy mode\u201d that can generate adult content.",
      "The Southeast Asian restrictions come amid mounting scrutiny of Grok elsewhere, including in the European Union, Britain, India and France. Grok last week limited image generation and editing to paying users following a global backlash over sexualized deepfakes of people, but critics say it did not fully address the problem.",
      "An attempt by The Associated Press to request a comment through email to xAI resulted in an automated reply from the media support email address which stated, \u201cLegacy Media Lies.\u201d This was the same message received from a different email when asked for comment regarding the global backlash.",

      "Following the Thursday meeting, a White House official confirmed to ABC News that Trump did accept the medal.",
      "Further details about the closed-door meeting were not immediately revealed by the White House. Asked about the meeting by ABC News' Mary Bruce, Trump said it went \"great.\"",
      "Machado told reporters as she was exiting the White House that she presented Trump with her prize and reflected on the history between the two countries.",
      "\"I told him this ... Listen to this -- 200 years ago, General Lafayette gave Simon Bolivar a medal with George Washington\u2019s face on it. Bolivar, since then, kept that medal for the rest of his life,\" she told reporters.",

      "One of the best-preserved ancient Roman homes on the Palatine Hill is opening to the public for the first time",
      "ROME -- One of the best-preserved ancient Roman homes on the Palatine Hill is opening to the public for the first time, albeit via a livestreamed tour of its hard-to-reach underground frescoes and mosaics.",
      "The House of the Griffins was first discovered during the excavations in the early 20th century of the Palatine Hill, the verdant hill that rises up from the Roman Forum and dominates views of central Rome today with its striking red brick ruins.",
      "The hill, located just off the Colosseum, was known for temples and homes of leading citizens during Rome\u2019s Republican era, which is traditionally dated from 509 B.C. to 27 B.C. It became the aristocratic quarter during the Roman Empire that followed, when new palaces were built on top of the older homes.",
      "The House of the Griffins is one of those earlier Republican-era homes, and was hidden to the world underground after the Emperor Domitian built his palace on top of it in the first century A.D.",
      "Now for the first time, the general public can virtually visit the House of the Griffins and its newly restored frescoes, including the decoration that gives the home its name: An arched lunette fresco featuring two griffins \u2014 half-eagle, half-lion mythological creatures.",
      "Visitors won\u2019t actually walk through the home\u2019s intimate rooms, which are only accessible via a perilously steep staircase underground. Rather, visitors above ground will watch as a tour guide wearing a head-mounted smartphone descends into the domus and walks through its rooms, livestreaming the visit and narration.",
      "The live, virtual tour serves multiple purposes: It allows visitors to \u201csee\u201d a domus that, because of its underground location, would otherwise be off-limits. And by limiting the number of people in its rooms, the livestreaming protects the delicate frescoes from too much humidity and carbon dioxide.",
      "Project chief Federica Rinaldi said that archaeologists don\u2019t know much about the family who lived there, but said they were clearly well-off, given the level of decoration that recalls some of the elegant homes of the era in Pompeii. The frescoes feature richly colored faux marble designs, and floor mosaics of three-dimensional cubes.",

      "Starting on March 3, the livestreamed tours will be held weekly, on Tuesdays, with one in Italian and one in English, though more are foreseen. Groups are limited to a dozen people and require reservations, as well as an additional ticket beyond the typical Colosseum-Palatine Hill entrance fee.",

He is currently being held after he waived his right to an extradition hearing Monday. His next hearing in Winnebago County, Illinois, is scheduled for Jan. 23.",

      "Watson testified on the stand that he was in a haze of confusion and anger at the time of the unprovoked attack, according to KRON-TV. He said he lashed out and didn't know that Ratanapakdee was Asian or elderly.",

      "The Education Department is opening fewer sexual violence investigations at schools and universities",
      "WASHINGTON -- Before President Donald Trump's administration started dismantling the Education Department, the agency served as a powerful enforcer in cases of sexual violence at schools and universities. It brought the weight of the government against schools that mishandled sexual assault complaints involving students.",
      "That work is quickly fading away.",
      "The department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights was gutted in Trump\u2019s mass layoffs last year, leaving half as many lawyers to investigate complaints of discrimination based on race, sex or disability in schools. Those who remain face a backlog of more than 25,000 cases.",
      "Investigations have dwindled. Before the layoffs last March, the office opened dozens of sexual violence investigations a year. Since then, it's opened fewer than 10 nationwide, according to internal data obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "Yet Trump's Republican administration has doubled down on sexual discrimination cases of another kind. Trump officials have used Title IX, a 1972 gender equality law, against schools that make accommodations for transgender students and athletes. The Office for Civil Rights has opened nearly 50 such investigations since Trump took office a year ago.",
      "Even before the layoffs, critics said the office was understaffed and moved too slowly. Now, many firms that handle Title IX cases have stopped filing complaints, calling it a dead end.",
      "\u201cIt almost feels like you\u2019re up against the void,\u201d said Katie McKay, a lawyer at a New York firm that represents victims.",
      "\u201cIt feels like a big question mark right now,\u201d she said. \u201cHow are we supposed to hold a school accountable once it has messed up?\u201d",
      "An Education Department spokesperson said the office is working through its caseload, blaming President Joe Biden's Democratic administration for leaving a backlog and rewriting Title IX rules to protect LGBTQ+ students. Trump officials rolled back those rules.",
      "\u201cThe Trump Administration has restored commonsense safeguards against sexual violence by returning sex-based separation in intimate facilities,\u201d spokesperson Julie Hartman said. \u201cOCR is and will continue to safeguard the dignity and safety of our nation\u2019s students.\u201d",
      "The layoffs have slowed work at the Office for Civil Rights across the board, but it has an outsize impact on cases of sexual violence. Students who are mistreated by their schools \u2014 including victims and accused students alike \u2014 have few other venues to pursue justice.",
      "Many are now left with two options: File a lawsuit or walk away.",
      "One woman said she\u2019s losing hope for a complaint she filed in 2024. She alleges her graduate school failed to follow its own policies when it suspended but didn't expel another student found by the school to have sexually assaulted her. No one has contacted her about the complaint since 2024.",
      "The woman recently sued her school as a last resort. She said it feels like a David and Goliath mismatch.",
      "\u201cThey have all the power, because there is no large organization holding them accountable. It\u2019s just me, just this one individual who\u2019s filing this simple suit,\" the woman said. The AP does not typically identify people who say they are victims of sexual assault unless they grant permission.",
      "The civil rights office is supposed to provide a free alternative to litigation. Anyone can file a complaint, which can trigger an investigation and sanctions for schools that violate federal law.",
      "In 2024, the agency received more than 1,000 complaints involving sexual violence or sexual harassment, according to an annual report.",

      "In December, the department acknowledged the civil rights backlog and announced dozens of downsized workers would be brought back to the office amid a legal challenge to their layoffs. The workers' return offers some hope to those with pending civil rights complaints. Department officials have vowed to keep pushing for the layoffs.",
      "Before Trump was elected to his second term, the office had more than 300 pending investigations involving sexual assault, according to a public database. Most of those cases are believed to be sitting idle as investigators prioritize easier complaints, according to staffers who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.",
      "The details of past cases underscore the urgency of the work.",
      "In 2024, the office took action against a Pennsylvania school system after a girl with a disability told staff she had been sexually touched by a bus driver. She was put back on that driver\u2019s bus later that afternoon, plus the next two days. The district was required to designate a Title IX coordinator for its schools, review previous complaints and consider compensation for the girl's family.",
      "That year, the office demanded changes at a Montana school where a boy was pinned down by other students and assaulted after a wrestling practice. The students had been suspended for three days after school officials treated it as a case of hazing instead of sexual assault.",
      "In another case, the office sided with a University of Notre Dame student who had been expelled over accusations of sexual misconduct. The student said the college never told him precisely what he was accused of and refused to interview witnesses he put forward.",
      "Cases that get attention from the federal office are being handled under federal rules created during Trump\u2019s first term. Those rules were designed to bolster the rights of students accused of sexual misconduct.",
      "Lawyers who work with accused students see little improvement.",
      "Justin Dillon, a Washington lawyer, said some of his recent complaints have been opened for investigation. He tells clients not to hold their breath. Even before the layoffs, cases could drag on for years, he said.",
      "Others gave up on the office years ago. The LLF National Law Firm said it stopped filing complaints in 2021 in favor of suing schools directly. Lawyers at the firm said the office had become incapable of delivering timely outcomes, which was only worsened by the layoffs.",

      "As Attorney General Pam Bondi approaches her first anniversary on the job, the firings of career attorneys have defined her turbulent tenure",
      "WASHINGTON -- Michael Ben'Ary was driving one of his children to soccer practice on an October evening last year when he paused at a red light to check his work phone. He was in the middle of a counterterrorism prosecution so important that President Donald Trump highlighted it in his State of the Union address.",
      "Ben'Ary said he was shocked to see his phone had been disabled. He found the explanation later in his personal email account, a letter informing him he had been fired.",
      "A veteran prosecutor, Ben'Ary handled high-profile cases over two decades at the Justice Department, including the murder of a Drug Enforcement Administration agent and a suicide-bomb plot targeting the U.S. Capitol. Most recently he was leading the case arising from a deadly attack on American service members in Afghanistan.",
      "Yet the same credentials that enhanced Ben'Ary's resume spelled the undoing of his government career.",
      "His termination without explanation came hours after right-wing commentator Julie Kelly told hundreds of thousands of online followers that he had previously served as a senior counsel to Lisa Monaco, the No. 2 Justice Department official in the Biden administration. Kelly also suggested Ben'Ary was part of the \u201cinternal resistance\u201d to prosecuting former FBI Director James Comey, even though Ben\u2019Ary was never involved in the case.",
      "As Attorney General Pam Bondi approaches her first year on the job, the firings of attorneys like Ben\u2019Ary have defined her turbulent tenure. The terminations and a larger voluntary exodus of lawyers have erased centuries of combined experience and left the department with fewer career employees to act as a bulwark for the rule of law at a time when Trump is testing the limits of executive power by demanding prosecutions of his political enemies.",
      "Interviews by The Associated Press of more than a half-dozen fired employees offer a snapshot of the toll throughout the department. The departures include lawyers who prosecuted violent attacks on police at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, environmental, civil rights and ethics enforcers, counterterrorism prosecutors, immigration judges and attorneys who defend administration policies. They continued this week, when several prosecutors in Minnesota moved to resign amid turmoil over an investigation into the shooting of a woman by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer.",
      "\u201cTo lose people at that career level, people who otherwise intended to stay and now are either being discharged or themselves are walking away, is immensely damaging to the public interest,\u201d said Stuart Gerson, a senior official in the George H.W. Bush administration and acting attorney general early in the Clinton administration. \u201cWe\u2019re losing really capable people, people who have never viewed themselves as political and attempted to do the right thing.\u201d",
      "Justice Connection, a network of department alumni, estimates that more than 230 lawyers, agents and other employees from across the department were fired last year \u2014 apparently because of their work on cases they were assigned, past criticism of Trump or seemingly no reason. More than 6,400 employees are estimated to have left a department that at the end of 2025 had roughly 108,000, the group says.",
      "The Justice Department, for its part, says it has hired thousands of career attorneys over the last year. The Trump administration has characterized some of the fired and departed workers as out-of-step with its agenda.",
      "Ben'Ary left with unfinished business, including the prosecution stemming from the Kabul airport bombing and the national security unit he led at the U.S. attorney's office for the Eastern District of Virginia.",
      "Left to pack his belongings, he posted a typed note near his door that functioned as a distress call, reminding colleagues they had sworn an oath to follow the facts \u201cwithout fear or favor\u201d and \u201cunhindered by political interference.\u201d",
      "But, he warned, \u201cIn recent months, the political leadership of the Department have violated these principles, jeopardizing our national security and making Americans less safe.\u201d",
      "_____",
      "Since its founding in 1870, the Justice Department has occupied elevated status in American democracy, sustained through transitions of power by reliance on facts, evidence and law.",
      "To be sure, there has always been a political component to the department, with lawyers appointed by the president.",
      "But even during turbulent times, when attorneys general have been pushed out by presidents or resigned rather than accede to White House demands \u2014 as in the Watergate-era \u201cSaturday Night Massacre\" \u2014 the department's rank-and-file have generally been insulated thanks to long-recognized civil service protections.",
      "\u201cThis is completely unprecedented in both its scale and scope and underlying motivation,\u201d said Peter Keisler, a senior official in the George W. Bush Justice Department.",
      "In his first term, Trump pushed out one attorney general and accepted another's resignation but the workforce remained largely intact. He returned to office seething over Biden-era prosecutions of him, vowing retribution.",
      "The firings began even before Bondi arrived last February. Prosecutors on special counsel Jack Smith's team that investigated Trump were terminated days after the inauguration, followed by prosecutors hired on temporary assignments for cases resulting from the 2021 Capitol insurrection.",
      "\"The people working on these cases were not political agents of any kind,\u201d said Aliya Khalidi, a Jan. 6 prosecutor who was fired. \u201cIt\u2019s all people who just care about the rule of law.\u201d",
      "The firings have continued, at times surgical, at times random \u2014 almost always without explanation.",
      "Adam Schleifer, a Los Angeles prosecutor targeted in a social media post by far-right activist Laura Loomer over past critical comments of Trump, was fired in March. The Justice Department the following month fired attorney Erez Reuveni, who conceded in court that Salvadoran national Kilmar Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported. Reuveni later accused the department of trying to mislead judges to execute deportations. Department officials deny the assertion.",
      "Two weeks after Maurene Comey completed a sex trafficking trial against Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs, the New York prosecutor was fired, also without explanation. Like Ben'Ary, she penned a pointed farewell, telling colleagues that \u201cfear is the tool of a tyrant.\u201d Her father \u2014 former FBI Director James Comey, a frequent Trump target \u2014 uttered those same words after being indicted in September in a case that has been dismissed.",
      "Among the most affected sections is the storied Civil Rights Division. A recent open letter of protest was signed by over 200 employees who left in 2025, with several supervisors recently giving notice of plans to depart. The Public Integrity Section, which prosecutes sensitive public corruption cases, has also been hollowed out by resignations.",
      "The Justice Department has disputed the accounts of some of those who have been fired or quit and has defended the termination of those who investigated Trump as \u201cconsistent with the mission of ending the weaponization of government.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is the most efficient Department of Justice in American history, and our attorneys will continue to deliver measurable results for the American people,\u201d the department said in a statement.

    "story": [
      "The Defense Department says it is revamping the military newspaper Stars and Stripes to focus on \u201creporting for our warfighters\u201d and eliminate woke distractions",
      "The Pentagon said Thursday that it is changing the independent military newspaper Stars and Stripes so it concentrates on \u201creporting for our warfighters\u201d and no longer includes \u201cwoke distractions.\u201d",
      "That message, in a social media post from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's spokesman, is short on specifics and does not mention the news outlet's legacy of independence from government and military leadership. It comes a day after The Washington Post reported that applicants for jobs at Stars and Stripes were being asked what they would do to support President Donald Trump's policies.",
      "Stars and Stripes traces its lineage to the Civil War and has reported news about the military either in its newspaper or online since World War II, largely to an audience of service members stationed overseas. Roughly half of its budget comes from the Pentagon and its staff members are considered Defense Department employees.",
      "The outlet's mission statement emphasizes that it is \u201ceditorially independent of interference from outside its own editorial chain-of-command\u201d and that it is unique among news organizations tied to the Defense Department in being \u201cgoverned by the principles of the First Amendment.\u201d",
      "Congress established that independence in the 1990s after instances of military leadership getting involved in editorial decisions. During Trump's first term in 2020, Defense Secretary Mark Esper tried to eliminate government funding for Stars and Stripes \u2014 to effectively shut it down \u2014 before he was overruled by the president.",
      "Hegseth's spokesman, Sean Parnell, said on X Thursday that the Pentagon \u201cis returning Stars and Stripes to its original mission: reporting for our warfighters.\u201d He said the department will \u201crefocus its content away from woke distractions.\u201d",
      "\u201cStars and Stripes will be custom tailored to our warfighters,\u201d Parnell wrote. \u201cIt will focus on warfighting, weapons systems, fitness, lethality, survivability and ALL THINGS MILITARY. No more repurposed DC gossip columns; no more Associated Press reprints.\u201d",
      "He said the department is committed to ensuring the outlet's legacy of reporting news that's important to service members.",
      "Stars and Stripes' publisher, Max Lederer, did not immediately reply to a message seeking comment. But Jacqueline Smith, the outlet's ombudsman, called Parnell's statement a surprise. She said Stars and Stripes reports on matters important to service members and their families \u2014 not just weapons systems or war strategy \u2014 and she's detected nothing \u201cwoke\u201d about its reporting.",
      "\u201cI think it's very important that Stars and Stripes maintains its editorial independence, which is the basis of its credibility,\u201d Smith said. A longtime newspaper editor in Connecticut, Smith serves in a role created by Congress three decades ago to ensure that independence, and she reports to the House Armed Services Committee.",
      "It's the latest move by the Trump administration to impose restrictions on journalists. Most reporters from legacy news outlets have left the Pentagon rather than to agree to new rules imposed by Hegseth that they feel would give him too much control over what they report and write. The New York Times has sued to overturn the regulations.",

They were asked to identify one or two orders or initiatives that were significant to them. That raised questions about whether it was appropriate for a journalist to be given what is, in effect, a loyalty test.",
      "Smith said it was the government's Office of Personnel Management \u2014 not the newspaper \u2014 that was responsible for the question on job applications and said it was consistent with what was being asked of applicants for other government jobs.",

      "Federal immigration agents deployed to Minneapolis have used aggressive crowd-control tactics that have become a dominant concern in the aftermath of the deadly shooting of a woman in her car last week.",
      "They have pointed rifles at demonstrators and deployed chemical irritants early in confrontations. They have broken vehicle windows and pulled occupants from cars. They have scuffled with protesters and shoved them to the ground.",
      "The government says the actions are necessary to protect officers from violent attacks. The encounters in turn have riled up protesters even more, especially as videos of the incidents are shared widely on social media.",
      "What is unfolding in Minneapolis reflects a broader shift in how the federal government is asserting its authority during protests, relying on immigration agents and investigators to perform crowd-management roles traditionally handled by local police who often have more training in public order tactics and de-escalating large crowds.",
      "Experts warn the approach runs counter to de-escalation standards and risks turning volatile demonstrations into deadly encounters.",
      "The confrontations come amid a major immigration enforcement surge ordered by the Trump administration in early December, which sent more than 2,000 officers from across the Department of Homeland Security into the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. Many of the officers involved are typically tasked with arrests, deportations and criminal investigations, not managing volatile public demonstrations.",
      "Tensions escalated after the fatal shooting of Renee Good, a 37-year-old woman killed by an immigration agent last week, an incident federal officials have defended as self-defense after they say Good weaponized her vehicle.",
      "The killing has intensified protests and scrutiny of the federal response.",
      "On Monday, the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota asked a federal judge to intervene, filing a lawsuit on behalf of six residents seeking an emergency injunction to limit how federal agents operate during protests, including restrictions on the use of chemical agents, the pointing of firearms at non-threatening individuals and interference with lawful video recording.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so much about what\u2019s happening now that is not a traditional approach to immigration apprehensions,\u201d said former Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Sarah Salda\u00f1a.",
      "Salda\u00f1a, who left the post at the beginning of 2017 as President Donald Trump's first term began, said she can't speak to how the agency currently trains its officers. When she was director, she said officers received training on how to interact with people who might be observing an apprehension or filming officers, but agents rarely had to deal with crowds or protests.",
      "\u201cThis is different. You would hope that the agency would be responsive given the evolution of what\u2019s happening \u2014 brought on, mind you, by the aggressive approach that has been taken coming from the top,\u201d she said.",
      "Ian Adams, an assistant professor of criminal justice at the University of South Carolina, said the majority of crowd-management or protest training in policing happens at the local level \u2014 usually at larger police departments that have public order units.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s highly unlikely that your typical ICE agent has a great deal of experience with public order tactics or control,\u201d Adams said.",
      "DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a written statement that ICE officer candidates receive extensive training over eight weeks in courses that include conflict management and de-escalation. She said many of the candidates are military veterans and about 85% have previous law enforcement experience.",
      "\u201cAll ICE candidates are subject to months of rigorous training and selection at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, where they are trained in everything from de-escalation tactics to firearms to driving training. Homeland Security Investigations candidates receive more than 100 days of specialized training,\" she said.",

      "He said police departments now try to open communication with organizers, set boundaries and sometimes even show deference within reason. There's an understanding that inside of a crowd, using unnecessary force can have a domino effect that might cause escalation from protesters and from officers.",
      "Despite training for officers responding to civil unrest dramatically shifting over the last four decades, there is no nationwide standard of best practices. For example, some departments bar officers from spraying pepper spray directly into the face of people exercising Constitutional speech. Others bar the use of tear gas or other chemical agents in residential neighborhoods.",

      "Former New York City Mayor Eric Adams is facing questions about the launch of a new cryptocurrency token, which he claims will help support efforts to end antisemitism and anti- Americanism",
      "NEW YORK -- For a moment, Eric Adams was riding high.",
      "Fresh off trips to Dubai and the Democratic Republican of Congo, the now jobless ex-mayor of New York City was back in Times Square on Monday to announce his first initiative as a private citizen: a new cryptocurrency coin that would also serve to beat back antisemitism and \u201canti-Americanism.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re about to change the game,\u201d he promised, without describing how, exactly, the digital asset would support those lofty ambitions. \u201cThis thing is going to take off like crazy.\u201d",
      "But after surging to a nearly $600 million valuation within minutes of its launch, the new coin, dubbed NYC Token, went into free fall, losing nearly 75% of its value by that evening. The drop came after an account linked to the token's creation withdrew $2.5 million worth of coins, according to the crypto-analytics firm Bubblemaps.",
      "Around $1.5 million was later returned, the firm said, though by then investor confidence had collapsed. To some cryptocurrency experts, the rollout had all the hallmarks of a \u201crug pull.\u201d The scheme \u2014 prevalent among celebrity-linked meme coins \u2014 involves insiders hyping an asset then quickly dumping their stakes, saddling amateur investors with deep losses.",
      "Others have suggested that Adams and his inexperienced team were themselves duped by savvier investors, who took advantage of a sloppy launch.",
      "The debate has found Adams back in a mode of damage control that defined so much of his one-term mayoralty: denying misconduct, attacking the press and facing scrutiny about the competence of his inner circle of loyalists.",
      "Through a former campaign spokesperson, Adams has released multiple statements in recent days clarifying that he had not profited off the token and had not moved investor funds, calling reports otherwise \u201cfalse and unsupported by evidence.\u201d",
      "\u201cLike many newly launched digital assets, the NYC Token experienced market volatility,\u201d the spokesperson, Todd Shapiro, said Wednesday. \u201cMr. Adams has consistently emphasized transparency, accountability, and responsible innovation.\u201d",
      "Despite claims of transparency, Adams has so far declined to reveal his partners in the token.",
      "But two people close to the project confirmed that Frank Carone, Adams' former chief adviser and one-time lawyer for the Brooklyn Democratic Party, was closely involved in the launch. The two people spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they had been asked not to disclose the identities of people involved in the token's creation.",
      "One of Carone\u2019s former clients, Yosef Sefi Zvieli, a real estate investor linked to several Israeli hotels, was also part of its creation, Shapiro confirmed to The Associated Press.",
      "Zvieli, whose involvement was first reported by Business Insider, previously owned a college dorm in Brooklyn, which drew complaints from students of filthy conditions and neglect. After defaulting on his mortgage, Zvieli hired Carone as his attorney and was able to turn the troubled property into a city-financed homeless shelter.",
      "Their exact role in the token launch was not immediately clear, though at least part of Zvieli\u2019s job involved reaching out to influencers ahead of the debut. Neither he nor Carone appeared to have direct experience in cryptocurrency. Messages left with the two men were not returned.",
      "As questions around the launch swirled this week, Adams sought guidance from Brock Pierce, the billionaire crypto investor, and former \u201cMighty Ducks\u201d child actor, whose private jet he sometimes used as mayor.",
      "After looking into the project, Pierce said he was confident that \u201cno one has run off with anyone\u2019s money.\"",

      "Even within the largely unregulated world of meme coins, experts say projects promoted by politicians are especially prone to unsavory trading practices.",
      "The president of Argentina, Javier Milei, has faced fraud allegations for his own crypto promotion, which drew thousands of investors before swiftly collapsing. Coins launched by President Donald Trump and his wife, Melania Trump, also saw significant price fluctuations upon release.",
      "The number of accounts that invested in NYC Token were far less than those ventures, totaling just over 4,000 as of Thursday, according to Nicolas Vaiman, the founder of Bubblemaps, which conducted an analysis of publicly available trade records.",
      "Roughly 80% of those accounts had bought in during a 20-minute period before Adams had announced the coin but after it was made available for purchase, the analysis found. The window, Vaiman said, provided an advantage to insiders involved in the launch and other traders who pay close attention to new tokens.",
      "\u201cPolitical coins are driven purely by attention, and the crypto community is aware that attention peaks right after the launch,\u201d Vaiman said. \u201cPeople know you don't want to stick around, especially for such a vague prospect, like fighting anti-Americanism or antisemitism. What does it even mean? How are you going to achieve that in a token?\u201d",
      "The website for the coin says a \u201cportion of the proceeds\u201d will be divided evenly among three causes: antisemitism and anti-Americanism \u201cawareness campaigns,\u201d crypto education for the city\u2019s youth and a scholarship initiative.",
      "It does not detail which organizations will be supported, or what percentage of the proceeds will go toward charitable causes.",
      "Adams has disputed that any money had been pulled by the token's creators.",
      "He has said the appearance of withdrawals were the result of adjustments made by the designated market maker, an entity that buys and sells orders of a new token to ensure traders can make purchases without major price shifts.",
      "The market makers include FalconX, a well known digital asset broker. The company declined to respond to inquiries on the record.",
      "As of Wednesday, a majority of accounts that invested in the coin had lost money, according to the Bubblemaps analysis. Fifteen traders were down at least $100,000, while 10 had netted $100,000.",
      "Pierce said he was still hoping the project could be salvaged, adding that \u201cthe fate and outcome of this project will be determined in the coming days.\u201d",
      "But some in the crypto world had their doubts.",
      "\u201cIt could be a legitimate project with just a really bad rollout,\" said Benjamin Cowen, the founder of another crypto research analytics firm, Into the Cryptoverse. \"But the way it was launched didn\u2019t instill a lot of confidence. It\u2019s hard to regain trust in the crypto community.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- A federal judge Thursday cleared the way for a New York offshore wind project to resume construction, a victory for the developer who said a Trump administration order to pause it would likely kill the project in a matter of days.",
      "District Judge Carl J. Nichols, an appointee of President Donald Trump, ruled construction on the Empire Wind project could go forward while he considers the merits of the government\u2019s order to suspend the project. He faulted the government for not responding to key points in Empire Wind\u2019s court filings, including the contention that the administration violated proper procedure.",
      "Norwegian company Equinor owns Empire Wind. Spokesperson David Schoetz said they welcome the court's decision and will continue to work in collaboration with authorities. It\u2019s the second developer to prevail in court against the administration this week.",
      "The Trump administration froze five big offshore wind projects on the East Coast days before Christmas, citing national security concerns. Trump has targeted offshore wind from his first days back in the White House, most recently calling wind farms \u201closers\u201d that lose money, destroy the landscape and kill birds.",
      "Developers and states sued seeking to block the order. Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of plans to shift to renewable energy in East Coast states that have limited land for onshore wind turbines or solar arrays.",
      "On Monday, a judge ruled that the Danish energy company Orsted could resume its project to serve Rhode Island and Connecticut. Senior Judge Royce Lamberth said the government did not sufficiently explain the need for a complete stop to construction. That wind farm, called Revolution Wind, is nearly complete. It\u2019s expected to meet roughly 20% of the electricity needs in Rhode Island, the smallest state, and about 5% of Connecticut\u2019s electricity needs.",
      "Orsted is also suing over the pause of its Sunrise Wind project for New York, with a hearing still to be set. Dominion Energy Virginia, which is developing Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, plans to ask a judge Friday to block the administration\u2019s order so it can resume construction, too.",
      "The fifth paused project is Vineyard Wind, under construction in Massachusetts. Owners Avangrid and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners have not indicated publicly whether they plan to join the rest of the developers in challenging the administration.",
      "Robin Shaffer, president of Protect Our Coast New Jersey, said the administration was right to stop construction on national security grounds. He urged officials to immediately appeal the adverse rulings and seek to halt all work pending appellate review. Opponents of offshore wind projects are particularly vocal and well-organized in New Jersey.",
      "Empire Wind is 60% complete and designed to power more than 500,000 homes. Equinor said the project was in jeopardy due to the limited availability of specialized vessels, as well as heavy financial losses.",
      "During a hearing Wednesday, Judge Nichols said the government\u2019s main security concern seemed to be over operation of the wind turbines, not construction, although the government pushed back on that contention.",

      "\u201cI don\u2019t see how you can make this distinction,\u201d Woodward said. He likened it to a nuclear project being built that presented a national security risk. The government would oppose it being built, and it turning on.",

      "\"Tim Busfield denies the allegations in the criminal complaint and maintains they are completely false,\" attorney Larry Stein said in a statement to CBS News. \"As a voluntary step, he submitted to an independent polygraph examination regarding those allegations and passed.\"",
      "The 68-year-old actor, who is married to actor Melissa Gilbert and is known for appearances in \"The West Wing,\" \"Field of Dreams\" and \"Thirtysomething,\" has vowed to fight the charges. In a video shared before turning himself in, Busfield called the allegations lies.",
      "During Wednesday's brief court appearance, Busfield stood silent and expressionless, dressed in orange prison clothes, while a defense attorney spoke on his behalf.",
      "Prosecutors are seeking to keep Busfield in custody pending trial, citing a \"history of alleged sexual misconduct.\" They filed a motion early Wednesday detailing their reasons for the request, pointing to what they described as a documented pattern of sexual misconduct, abuse of authority and grooming behavior by Busfield over two decades. They also said witnesses have expressed fear regarding retaliation and professional harm.",
      "Another allegation was reported to law enforcement the same day Busfield turned himself in, Albuquerque Deputy District Attorney Savannah Brandenburg-Koch told the judge Wednesday in a court filing. A father of a then-16-year-old girl alleged Busfield kissed and inappropriately touched his daughter, who he said was auditioning for a role at B Street Theatre, an organization Busfield and his brother founded in Sacramento, California. The incident occurred several years ago, according to the court document.",
      "Busfield allegedly \"begged the family to not report to law enforcement if he received therapy,\" Brandenburg-Koch said in the motion. The girl's father, who is a therapist himself, said he thought it was the best thing to do at the time, according to the prosecutor.",
      "In a statement to CBS Sacramento, B Street Theatre said that though Busfield is its founder, he has not had an active role in its operations in any capacity since 2001. The theater declined to comment further on Busfield due to the ongoing investigation.",
      "The motion filed in Bernalillo County Metropolitan Court seeking to keep Busfield in custody also states that research and experience show that offenders are uniquely positioned to evade accountability and circumvent safeguards designed to protect children when they wield authority, status or influence.",
      "\"In light of the defendant's demonstrated disregard for boundaries, authority and compliance, no condition or combination of conditions of release can reasonably protect the victims or the community,\" the motion states.",
      "It will be up to a judge to determine whether to grant the request. A detention hearing has yet to be scheduled.",
      "Prosecutors also took issue with Busfield disseminating a video to the media outlet TMZ on Tuesday, suggesting he was prioritizing \"personal narrative control and public relations\" over compliance with the court process.",
      "According to the criminal complaint, an investigator with the police department says the child reported that he was 7 years old when Busfield allegedly touched him multiple times on private areas over his clothing. Busfield allegedly touched him on another occasion when he was 8, the complaint said.",
      "The complaint also says the child was reportedly afraid to tell anyone because Busfield was the director and he feared he would get mad at him.",
      "The boy's twin brother told authorities he was also touched by Busfield but did not specify where. He said he didn't say anything because he didn't want to get in trouble.",
      "The mother of the twins reported to Child Protective Services that the abuse occurred between November 2022 and spring 2024, the complaint said.",
      "In an interview with police last fall, Busfield denied the allegations and suggested that the boys' mother was seeking revenge for her children being replaced on the series. The argument was echoed by Busfield's attorney on Tuesday.",
      "The investigation began in November 2024 after a call from a doctor at the University of New Mexico Hospital in Albuquerque. The boys' parents had gone there at the recommendation of a law firm, the complaint said.",
      "Busfield's attorney said an independent investigation by Warner Bros. was unable to corroborate allegations of inappropriate behavior by Busfield. But prosecutors in their filing argued that the investigator failed to talk to key witnesses.",
      "A publicist for Gilbert said she is \"not making public statements at this time.\"",
      "\"Any purported 'statements' circulating online \u2014 including AI-generated deepfakes of her 'breaking her silence' \u2014 should not be treated as coming from her,\" publicist Ame Van Iden said in a statement, adding, \"Melissa stands with and supports her husband and will address the public at an appropriate time.

    "story": [
      "Scott Adams, the cartoonist who created the \"Dilbert\" comic strip, has died at the age of 68, his first ex-wife revealed on Tuesday.\u00a0 Adams said last year that he was\u00a0diagnosed\u00a0with an aggressive prostate cancer.",
      "Adams' ex-wife, Shelly Miles, announced the news of his death during a live stream of his YouTube show, \"Real Coffee with Scott Adams.\"",
      "She read a \"final message\" from Adams on the show, in which he wrote that he had \"an amazing life\" and gave it everything he had. He urged people to \"be useful\" and said, \"please know I loved you all to the very end.\"",
      "Adams said on an episode of his show last May that he had \"the same cancer that Joe Biden has ... prostate cancer that has also spread to my bones.\"",
      "He made the announcement a day after Biden announced his own diagnosis.",
      "President Trump posted about Adams' death on Tuesday, calling him \"a fantastic guy, who liked and respected me when it wasn't fashionable to do so.\"",
      "\"He bravely fought a long battle against a terrible disease,\" Mr. Trump said on Truth Social. \"My condolences go out to his family, and all of his many friends and listeners. He will be truly missed. God bless you Scott!\"",
      "Vice President JD Vance called Adams \"a true American original, and a great ally to the President of the United States and the entire administration.\"",
      "Dilbert the comic strip first appeared in 1989, poking fun at office culture. It ran for decades in numerous newspapers until 2023, when it was canceled by most newspapers over comments by Adams that various publishers denounced as racist, hateful and discriminatory.",
      "Among other things, Adams referred to Black people as members of a \"hate group\" and urged White people \"to get the hell away from Black people.\" Newspapers such the Los Angeles Times and the USA Today network as well as distributor Andrews McMeel Universal announced they would no longer work with the cartoonist or run his strip. Adams took to YouTube at the time to defend himself and disclosed details about the impact of losing business, saying he was likely to lose 80% of his income from Dilbert due to the cancellations.",
      "In the message Miles read on the show Tuesday, Adams said that he wanted to explain his life. He said he spent the first part of it focusing on making himself a worthy husband and parent as a way to find meaning, then later \"donated\" himself to the world and evolved from Dilbert cartoonist to \"an author of what I thought would be useful books.\"",
      "\"From that point on I looked for ways I could add the most to peoples' life, one way or another,\" he wrote.",
      "Poking fun at corporate culture and, later, \"wokeness\"",
      "Adams earned a bachelor's degree from Hartwick College and an MBA from the University of California, Berkeley. He worked a corporate job at the Pacific Bell telephone company in the 1980s, sharing his cartoons to amuse co-workers. He drew Dilbert as a computer programmer and engineer for a high-tech company and mailed a batch to cartoon syndicators.",
      "The first \"Dilbert\" comic strip officially appeared April 16, 1989, long before such workplace comedies as \"Office Space\" and \"The Office.\" It portrayed corporate culture as a Kafkaesque world of heavy bureaucracy and pointless benchmarks, where employee effort and skill were underappreciated.",
      "Adams was the 1997 recipient of the National Cartoonist Society's Reuben Award, considered one of the most prestigious awards for cartoonists. That same year, \"Dilbert\" became the first fictional character to make Time magazine's list of the most influential Americans.",
      "\"Dilbert\" strips were routinely photocopied, pinned up, emailed and posted online, a popularity that would spawn bestselling books, merchandise, commercials for Office Depot and an animated TV series, with Daniel Stern voicing Dilbert.",
      "While Adams' career fall seemed swift, careful readers of \"Dilbert\" saw a gradual darkening of the strip's tone and its creator's mindset.",
      "He attracted attention for controversial comments, including saying in 2011 that women are treated differently by society for the same reason as children and the mentally disabled \u2014 \"it's just easier this way for everyone.\" In a blog post from 2006, he questioned the death toll of the Holocaust.",
      "In June 2020, Adams tweeted that when the \"Dilbert\" TV show ended in 2000 after just two seasons, it was \"the third job I lost for being white.\" But, at the time, he blamed it on lower viewership and time slot changes.",
      "Adams' views were reflected in some of his strips. In one in 2022, a boss says that traditional performance reviews would be replaced by a \"wokeness\" score. When an employee complains that could be subjective, the boss said, \"That'll cost you two points off your wokeness score, bigot.\"",
      "Adams put a brave face on his fall from grace, tweeting in 2023: \"Only the dying leftist Fake News industry canceled me (for out-of-context news of course). Social media and banking unaffected. Personal life improved. Never been more popular in my life. Zero pushback in person. Black and White conservatives solidly supporting me.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 13 Jan 2026 06:48:08 -0500",
    "summary": "For years, she seemed powerless against a fluctuating weight problem, until new medications, and a new attitude, gave Oprah Winfrey a breakthrough. She talks with Jane Pauley about \"Enough,\" a new book co-written with Dr. Ania Jastreboff, about her weight-loss success.",
    "story": [
      "Our first question to Oprah Winfrey: \"You always wear really beautiful clothes. Always have. And I wonder if it's a joy to get dressed now?\"",
      "\"I can tell you what a joy it is to actually pack clothes that you know are gonna fit and you're gonna feel good in them,\" Winfrey replied. \"I mean, it is a joy to get dressed. That is such a powerful first question, Jane Pauley, really!\"",
      "Powerful is one of the superlatives befitting Oprah Winfrey, one of the best-known and most-admired people on the planet, and one of the richest. But for all her success, she seemed powerless against a weight problem, a deeply personal struggle she has waged publicly and openly.",
      "In 1985, when her talk show, \"AM Chicago,\" was getting national attention, Oprah appeared on \"The Tonight Show\" with guest host Joan Rivers.",
      "\"And I'm sitting there, and we're toward the end of the interview, and Joan turns to me and, 'So, tell me, you know, how'd you gain the weight?'\" Oprah recalled. Her response? \"I ate a lot.\"",
      "\"I was stunned in that moment, when I look back and I see that moment. But I left feeling humiliated and embarrassed, but not the least bit anger, not the least bit of anger or being upset about it,\" she said.",
      "Why? \"Because I thought, 'She's right.'\"",
      "Over the next 40 years, Oprah would gain and lose hundreds of pounds. In the fall of 1988, after a strict four-month liquid diet, a new svelte Oprah appeared wearing size 10 Calvins, weighing 145, and pulling a wagon with 67 pounds of animal fat.",
      "It was all back, plus 25 more, when she went to the Daytime Emmy Awards four years later. \"And I go to the Emmys praying not to win, literally praying not to win, because I don't want to have to get up out of my seat and have everybody watch me do that walk to the stage,\" she said.",
      "She started over again the next day, working out with an on-call personal trainer this time. In 1994 she even ran a marathon.",
      "Oprah knew how to lose weight \u2026 she did it over and over. She says her body was seeking a range of 211 to 218. \"So usually, by the time I would hit 211 when I first went on the diet for the wagon of fat and pulled out the wagon of fat, when I did my first marathon, once I get to 211, I go, 'Oh, I gotta do something.' But now I understand that the biology of me, which is different than the biology of you and everybody else \u2013 every body, all of us, has our own \u2013 but no matter what I did, no matter how hard I worked, no matter what, it was always trying to get my body back to 211.\"",
      "Not because 211 is her ideal weight, but rather a \"set point\": a genetically-influenced weight range. Oprah calls it the \"enough point.\"",
      "\"Enough\" is also the title of a new book she co-wrote with Dr. Ania Jastreboff from the Yale School of Medicine, who says, for most people, an enough point is \"the weight that they kind of always gravitate to.\"",
      "So, to lose weight, you cut back on calories, and start craving high-fat food , or you eat less \u2013 but nothing changes. \"Our body's like, 'Well, if you're gonna eat less, then I'm gonna make you more efficient. I'm gonna make you burn less,'\" said Jastreboff. \"So what happens is, together, collectively, we end up eating more, and burning less.\"",
      "\"It's the enemy within, which is in our brains,\" I said. \"So, now that we know what the problem is, the hormones that drive people, why don't people just stop obeying it?\"",
      "\"That would be like trying to control something that is not in your control,\" Jastreboff said. \"That would be like holding your breath for the rest of your life. Every time somebody says, 'Just eat less, move more,' we're asking our patients to control their biology and hold their breath. And it's just not possible. And why would we do that? We don't do that for any other disease.\"",
      "And that's what the American Medical Association says obesity is \u2014 a disease. A treatable disease. But the good news is that, if it's a disease, it's not your fault.",
      "\"It's not my fault, Jane! It's not my fault,\" Oprah said. \"And I could weep right now, could weep right now. I'm not going to! But I could weep right now for all of the many days and nights I journaled about this being my fault, and why can't I conquer this thing?\"",
      "In the last decade, nearly a dozen weight management drugs have been approved for chronic weight management.\u00a0 And for millions, drugs like GLP--1s are the answer to their prayers. Finally, a scientifically-supported, medically-approved weight-loss strategy that worked. And yet, Oprah resisted. \"I was so motivated by shame that I felt I could not take the drug,\" she said, \"because if I took the drug \u2013 I, who had been the poster child for I can do it, I can do it, I can do it, willpower, willpower, let's just get more willpower \u2013 if I couldn't do it, then I would be shamed, and ashamed of myself for not being able to do it myself.\"",
      "The medications don't work for everyone, and some can't tolerate side effects ranging from nausea to gallstones. But it's been two years since Oprah finally started medication, and it's working for her. She says she is now down to her marathon weight of 155. \"And so, that's it for me. I'm gonna just try to maintain,\" she said.",
      "\"Well done. Because I thought 160 was your goal weight?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, yeah, it was,\" Oprah said, \"but as I continue to work out here the combination of the medication and hiking every day and resistance training has given me the body that I had when I was running a marathon. So, I was 40 and feeling really good, but to be able to be 71 and feel that I am in the best shape of my life feels better than it did when I was 40.\"",
      "\"I would submit that you would have been a phenomenal success, but I don't think you would have become 'Oprah' if you hadn't had the weight issue and been open about it and shared it,\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah. I would agree with that,\" she said. \"And that's why I don't have any regrets about it. There's a wonderful spiritual, African American spiritual, called, 'I Wouldn't Take Nothing For My Journey Now.'",
      "I wouldn't take nothing for my journey nowfor my journey nowfor my journey nowI wouldn't take nothing for my journey now.",
      "\"I wouldn't change the journey,\" she said. \"because I think the struggle with the weight actually helped me be more relatable and relate more to other people who were in their own struggles. But I'm glad now to be in a position where I feel the healthiest and strongest I have ever been.\"",
      "READ AN EXCERPT:\u00a0\"Enough\" by Dr. Ania Jastreboff and Oprah Winfrey",
      "\"I feel free\"",
      "Oprah Winfrey grew up riding on dirt roads. Now, on her sprawling Montecito estate near Santa Barbara, California, she owns the road.\u00a0 She took me for a ride: \"This used to belong to my neighbor,\" Oprah said. \"So, this is 23 acres. Her house used to be right there. We took this fence down, so this became my whole backyard, this.\"",
      "Around here, all of the views are spectacular, especially the one looking back.",
      "Born in Mississippi in 1954, Oprah Winfrey was a teen beauty queen who became a local TV reporter in Nashville, and then an anchor in Baltimore. \"The beautiful thing about my life was that I started out in local television, as you did,\" Oprah said. \"And when you start out locally, you get this, like, little teeny-tiny thing. But I failed. I failed in Baltimore.",
      "\"They brought me in as a 22-year-old with an anchor guy, white-haired Jerry Turner, who was the most popular local anchor in the country, not just Baltimore. And he totally hated me. He resented me. He would do everything he could to condescend to me any way. I remember one time we were on the set and he said to me, 'So, you're from Mississippi? Can you name all the tributaries of the Mississippi River?'",
      "\"And I was, like, 'All the tributaries of the Mississippi River? No, I can't.' He goes, 'Well, what school did you go to?' 'Well, I went to Tennessee State.' 'Was that an accredited school? So, you got a degree?' I mean, that kind of thing. This is in-between the commercial breaks.\"",
      "\"Boy, that happened to me in Chicago,\" I said. \"Started in September, basically was taken off the late news in the spring.\"",
      "Maybe we share a few things. I was a shy kid from Indiana who started as a local reporter in Indianapolis, and wound up on national TV \u2013 and Oprah was watching. \"You were such an inspiration. I remember calling Gayle that morning, 'Oh my God.' It just, it was unbelievable.\"",
      "\"Well, that I inspired you!\"",
      "But Oprah famously went on to build her worldwide media empire, and a following that some world leaders can only dream of.",
      "I asked, \"You have such power. Now that you are this woman undeterred by weight \u2013 'weight noise' \u2013 what are you gonna do?\"",
      "\"That's a beautiful question, but I don't feel compelled to do anything,\" Oprah replied. \"I don't know what it means actually, other than I feel free.\"",
      "And what about her name being credibly bandied about for the presidency? \"No, it's not gonna happen,\" she said. \"What I really want to do is to continue to use who I am and what that represents as a force in the world, as a force for good, and to allow people to not let the noises of the world steal their joy.\"",
      "\"You are such a person of positivity!\"",
      "\"I am indeed,\" she agreed.",
      "For all of her astonishing success, it seems that Oprah is still always aware of how far she's come \u2013 how she became something so much bigger than television. \"I have to say, there's a wonderful poem by Countee Cullen called 'Yet Do I Marvel.' And I would have to say, yet do I marvel at that, myself,\" she said.",
      "\"Sometimes in the early spring, the frogs are in the pond, and I can open the door and I can hear the frogs out at night. And it sounds just like Mississippi, being on the porch in Mississippi. But the distance from Mississippi to Montecito cannot be measured. It just cannot be measured. And I marvel at, how did this happen? How did it happen that I was able to navigate the waters of racism and sexism and misogynism and all the things that we had to endure? Yet do I marvel!\"",
      "And marvelous, it is.",
      "I said, \"We have little bits of things in common, I'm happy to say. Little bits of things.\"",
      "\"Yes. A lot,\" Oprah said, \"because we were women of this business at a time when it was really tough to be in this business. And now it's become something else. It's become something completely new.\"",
      "\"But both. It was a time that was tough to be a woman in the beginning. But boy, was the timing good!\"",
      "\"Boy, was the timing good! We made the best of it. Yes, we did.\"",

    "story": [
      "The 2026 awards season kicked off Sunday night with the star-studded Golden Globes \u2014 a ceremony known for its lively atmosphere. The 83rd Golden Globes were hosted by comedian Nikki Glaser, who returned to helm the show for a second year in a row.",
      "\"Hamnet\" won Best Motion Picture - Drama, and \"One Battle After Another\" won Best Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical. (See a full list of this year's winners here.)",
      "Here are the highlights and memorable moments from the Golden Globes, from historic wins to powerful speeches.",
      "Nikki Glaser returns as host",
      "Glaser made history last year as the first woman to host the Golden Globes solo. This year, she took it upon herself to hand out an award for Best Editing to the Justice Department during her opening monologue, alluding to the redactions and delayed release of the Epstein files.",
      "\"I cannot believe the amount of star power we have in this room tonight. It's insane,\" Glaser said. \"There are so many A-listers, and by A-list I do mean 'a list that has been heavily redacted.' And the Golden Globe for best editing goes to the Justice Department. Yes. Congratulations.\"",
      "The comedian, who stole the show at 2024's \"The Roast of Tom Brady,\" also cracked jokes about Kevin Hart's height and Leonardo DiCaprio's girlfriends, and asked George Clooney to fix her Nespresso machine, poking fun at one of the actor's endorsement deals.",
      "Glaser closed out the night wearing a \"Spinal Tap\" hat and referencing several famous lines from the film directed by the late Rob Reiner.",
      "Teyana Taylor gets emotional",
      "Teyana Taylor got emotional as she accepted her award for her supporting role in \"One Battle After Another.\"",
      "\"To my Brown sisters and little Brown girls watching tonight, our softness is not a liability,\" she said. \"Our depth is not too much. Our light does not need permission to shine. We belong in every room we walk into. Our voices matter, and our dreams deserve space.\"",
      "Golden Globes get political",
      "Several stars attended Sunday's award show with pins protesting Immigration and Customs Enforcement. As she accepted the award for Best Actress in a Comedy Series for her role in \"Hacks,\" Jean Smart wore a \"BE GOOD\" pin in honor of Renee Good, the woman who was killed by an ICE agent last week in Minneapolis.",
      "\"Let's all do the right thing,\" Smart said. \"I think everybody in their hearts knows what the right thing is to do.\"",
      "Mark Ruffalo, Wanda Sykes and Natasha Lyonne also wore pins protesting ICE.",
      "Director Judd Apatow, while presenting an award, said \"I believe we're a dictatorship now,\" and then joked that he was still angrier about losing the Best Comedy award to Ridley Scott a decade ago.",
      "New award for best podcast",
      "For the first time, an award for best podcast was handed out. The nominees were: \"Armchair Expert,\" \"Call Her Daddy,\" \"Good Hang With Amy Poehler,\" \"The Mel Robbins Podcast,\" \"SmartLess\" and \"Up First.\"",
      "Amy Poehler took home the win.",
      "\"This is an attempt to try to make a very rough and unkind world filled with a little bit more love and laughter,\" Poehler said.",
      "She also praised her fellow nominees.",
      "\"I'm fans of all of you, except for NPR. Just a bunch of celebs phoning it in. So, try harder,\" Poehler joked.",
      "K-pop takes home a win",
      "Best original song went to \"Golden\" from \"KPop Demon Hunters.\" Ejae, who wrote the lyrics and provided the singing voice for the film's character Rumi, accepted the award. As a child, she'd trained for years in hopes of becoming a K-pop star, only to face rejection, she said.",
      "\"I leaned on songs and music to get through it,\" Ejae said. \"Now I'm here, as a singer and a songwriter. It's a dream come true to be part of a song that's helping other girls, other boys and everyone from all ages to get through their hardships and accept themselves.\"",
      "\"KPop Demon Hunters\" also won Best Animated Motion Picture and was nominated for Cinematic and Box Office Achievement.",
      "\"I really wanted to depict female characters the way that we know women, which is really strong and bold, really silly and weird and really hungry for food, and sometimes a little thirsty,\" director Maggie Kang said after winning Best Animated Motion Picture.",
      "What did Snoop Dogg say?",
      "The sound dropped out for several seconds when Snoop Dogg, who was on stage to present the award for Best Podcast, said he was \"high as a motherf*****.\"",
      "Teyana Taylor and Erin Doherty were also briefly censored for cursing while accepting their awards.",
      "Wanda Sykes accepts award for Ricky Gervais",
      "Wanda Sykes, who was presenting the award for Best Stand-Up Comedy, said she hoped Gervais, who was not in attendance, would win.",
      "\"If you win, I get to accept the award on your behalf,\" she added. \"And you're gonna thank God \u2014 and the trans community.\"",
      "Gervais did win in the category, and Sykes followed through on her promise.",
      "Julia Roberts gets standing ovation",
      "Julia Roberts, who was nominated for, but didn't win, Best Actress in a Drama, received a standing ovation when she presented the award for Best Motion Picture \u2014 Musical or Comedy.",
      "\"I'm going to be impossible for at least a week,\" she said. \"I appreciate that.\"",
      "George Clooney and Don Cheadle, who came onstage to present the final award for the night, joked about the standing ovation, with Cheadle noting Clooney did not receive one.",
      "\"No, sit down, Mike, it's not nice. I don't take your pity,\" Clooney then said to someone in the audience.",

    "published": "Sun, 11 Jan 2026 14:13:28 -0500",
    "summary": "The star of \"The Gilded Age\" and \"The White Lotus\" has returned to Broadway in \"Bug,\" written by her playwright-actor husband. The two talk about their on- and off-stage partnership.",
    "story": [
      "Safe to say, after recent star turns in \"The Gilded Age\" and the monologue of the year about friendship in \"The White Lotus,\" Carrie Coon is having a moment.",
      "I asked her, \"Would you agree with me that where you used to say you're at the bottom of the A-List \u2026\"",
      "\"I think I used to say, 'The bottom of the B-List,' but yeah,\" she corrected.",
      "\"But don't we need to revise our assessment as where you are?\"",
      "\"Maybe,\" said Coon. \"But the thing that's changed for me is that I was on 'The White Lotus,' and now I can be in a Broadway play. That wasn't true for me five years ago.\"",
      "The play is \"Bug,\" which opened just this past week. Coon is leveraging her newfound star power to play the demanding, harrowing lead role in this examination of paranoia, conspiracy, and loneliness. And she is adamant that her success should not obscure a larger, sadder reality of the theater these days: \"We live in a country that is fundamentally unsupportive of the arts. So now, in order to do a play on Broadway, you have to do 'The White Lotus,' or else you're not allowed. They have to replace you with somebody more famous.\"",
      "\"Hang on, if you hadn't done 'White Lotus' and 'Gilded Age' and hadn't sort of blown up as a star \u2026\"",
      "\"Yeah. We wouldn't be sitting here, absolutely not,\" Coon said.",
      "\"Your acting ability, what you do on stage, not enough?\" I asked.",
      "\"No, that's not how we make those decisions anymore,\" she said. \"And you can ask all these extraordinary theater actors who don't do plays anymore because celebrities are doing plays. It's just a different world that we're living in now.\"",
      "Tracy Letts is the playwright of \"Bug.\" He's in love with Coon's fearlessness. \"She has ice water in her veins,\" he said. \"In another life, she'd make a great assassin.\"",
      "He's in love with her acting chops. \"She's a great stage actress,\" he said. \"For the people who've only seen her do 'Gilded Age' or 'White Lotus,' they just don't know what a stage animal she is.\"",
      "Letts is in love with her. He and Coon have been married for the last dozen years.",
      "I asked, \"Your partners, your life partners, they had to be theatre people, right? Because it's such a consuming world?\"",
      "\"I came to that conclusion a long time ago that, whoever my partner was had to be in the profession; civilians just don't get it,\" Letts laughed. \"They just don't get it. It's a hard life.\"",
      "A couple of Midwesterners (Coon is from Ohio, Letts from Oklahoma), they met in 2010 doing \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" at the Steppenwolf Theatre in Chicago. Letts said, \"We had a palpable attraction to each other. We just wanted to be with each other.\"",
      "Coon said, \"When we confessed to our director and our castmates that we were officially together, they were like, 'Yeah. Of course.' We thought it was shocking, this shocking revel \u2013 [and they're] like, 'Yeah, hello! We've been here the whole time.'\"",
      "When the show got to Broadway in 2013, Letts won a best actor Tony. That's some impressive artistic range, considering his Pulitzer Prize for writing the play \"August: Osage County\" in 2008, and his steady presence in film and TV for the last several decades, from \"Seinfeld\" and \"The Big Short\" to \"A House of Dynamite.\"",
      "He's been around a while. Coon noted, \"Tracy's entering into sort of this \u2026\"",
      "\"Oldness?\" Letts offered.",
      "Letts is now 60; Coon is 44.",
      "\"He always gave me room to grow, because I was not in the same place in my life as him,\" Coon said. \"Like, what you're sitting in contemplation of at this stage in your life is different than where I am in mine.\"",
      "So, how does that meld? \"Oh, a lotta jokes,\" said Coon. \"Like, 'Your second husband's gonna love this couch.'\"",
      "Whether playwright and actor, or husband and wife, what makes this partnership work, they told us, is honest feedback and mutual respect. Letts said, \"She knows I'm gonna tell her the truth. She'll put on a dress and say, 'How does this look?' And I'll say, 'It doesn't look good.'\"",
      "\"No, no, no, no\u2026.\" I said.",
      "\"It's true!\" Letts reiterated. \"And she appreciates it, because she knows I'm not lying to her.\"",
      "\"Isn't rule number one of husbanding, Not bad? Which we all know means\u2026 \"",
      "\"No. We don't do that,\" Letts said. \"So when she puts on something and I go, 'You look fantastic,' or when she's in this play and I say, 'My God, you're a great actress,' she knows I'm not bulls****ing her.\"",
      "Later, I asked Coon, \"If you have something to say, whether it's praise or criticism, you know it's the truth?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" she replied. \"Even with things I wear.\"",
      "Letts smiled. \"See?!\"",
      "While any couple might recognize that trust required to navigate life's challenges, Letts and Coon's \"moment\" is providing some uncommon tests. Take Coon landing the \"White Lotus\" role: \"I turned to Tracy and I said, 'There's no way I can go away to Thailand for six months.' We had a three-year-old and a six-year-old. And Tracy was the one who turned to me and he said, 'We're gonna figure this out.'",
      "\"Tracy was doing every morning. He was doing dinner and bedtime every night, and bath time by himself. So that was a really hard six months.\"",
      "\"I wasn't doing anything extraordinary; I was taking care of the kids while she was gone doing a job,\" he said.",
      "\"We know when the undeniable thing comes along, and we'll both make room for that to happen,\" Coon said.",
      "Which is why this chance to collaborate on Broadway is so important for them. The best way to handle a whirlwind is to find a place to anchor. For these two, that's always been the theater.",
      "\"This is where we're most comfortable,\" Letts said, \"in a rehearsal room preparing this on a stage, doing this in a theater. This is what we know. You just have a sense of accomplishment and gratification in the theater. You've told a story over the course of the night. You don't get to do that when you make a film or TV show.\"",
      "Carrie Coon and Tracy Letts are a couple now living in some of the culture's brightest lights.\u00a0 But they're theater people \u2013 bright lights don't faze them.\u00a0 \"I got my first credit card at 43,\" Letts laughed. \"It's a tough gig!\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-art-of-anselm-kiefer-becoming-the-sea/",
    "published": "Sun, 11 Jan 2026 09:28:07 -0500",
    "summary": "One of the world's most prolific living artists is now the subject of a retrospective in St. Louis. He talks about how rivers cutting through America's Midwest, and a Beat Generation poet, inspired his three-story-tall abstract canvases.",
    "story": [
      "Even on a casual walk, German artist Anselm Kiefer is always searching for inspiration. \"Look at this tree,\" he said walking alongside the Mississippi River. \"This is a fantastic tree, you know?\"",
      "And here in St. Louis, Missouri, it's an American river that's fired his imagination. He said, \"This river goes through America, and so with this conscience I have an inner overview of America, of the continent, of the world.\"",
      "Kiefer has turned those reflections into a series of paintings, each three stories tall. They are now holding court at the Saint Louis Art Museum, home to an Anselm Kiefer retrospective. Dozens of Kiefer works are on display, but it's these monumental canvases that are the showstoppers.",
      "The paintings depict the Mississippi and Europe's Rhine River \u2013 waterways brimming with history, symbolizing the cycle of life. Kiefer said the inspiration for their name, \"Becoming the Sea,\" came from Beat Generation poet Gregory Corso: \"Spirit is life \u2026 like a river unafraid of becoming the sea.\"",
      "\"You know, a river is something special; a river dissolves itself in the sea,\" he said. \"And it's not afraid of this. As I am not afraid of my death, you know?\"",
      "Mortality is a common theme for Kiefer. Born in 1945 in Germany, he grew up in the ruins of World War II, and the aftermath of the Holocaust. It's a chapter many Germans tried to forget. \"You know, after the war, there was not so much knowledge about what happened,\" he said. \"The Germans, they put it underneath the carpet. Nobody spoke about [it].\"",
      "Kiefer spent his career breaking through that silence, like when, as a young art student, he photographed himself giving the Nazi salute, not as an endorsement, but as a reckoning.",
      "Asked about the role of the artist in society, he said, \"If the artist is in the world, like I am in the world, as I look what happens, then automatically you have a role.\"",
      "Over the decades, Kiefer continued to explore themes of memory and loss \u2013 mostly with abstract landscapes, and materials. As Kiefer showed \"Sunday Morning\" in 2018, at his studio outside of Paris, melted lead and fire are normal sightings in his work. So is a bit of chemistry, creating unexpected colors.",
      "Today, Kiefer is one of the most prolific living artists, at the peak of his career, with works selling for millions, and in museums around the world. It would be a proud moment for most, but Anselm Kiefer has always had his own way of seeing things.",
      "I asked him, \"So at 80, what are you most proud of in terms of the work you've done?\"",
      "\"You ask strange questions! I am not proud. I am disappointed!\" he laughed. \"I'm really disappointed. Because every morning I go in the studio and say, 'Oh, what I have done yesterday?' You know, and then I continue. I continue. Proud? No, no. I don't know this word for me, proud.\"",

    "summary": "Bob Weir wrote or co-wrote and sang lead vocals on Grateful Dead classics including \"Sugar Magnolia,\" \"One More Saturday Night\" and \"Mexicali Blues.\"",
    "story": [
      "Bob Weir, a founding member of the legendary rock band the Grateful Dead, has died at the age of 78, his family announced Saturday.",
      "\"It is with profound sadness that we share the passing of Bobby Weir,\" his family wrote in a post to his Instagram page. \"He transitioned peacefully, surrounded by loved ones, after courageously beating cancer as only Bobby could. Unfortunately, he succumbed to underlying lung issues.\"",
      "In the statement, the family disclosed that Weir had been diagnosed with cancer in July.",
      "\"As we remember Bobby, it's hard not to feel the echo of the way he lived,\" his family wrote. \"A man driftin' and dreamin', never worrying if the road would lead him home. A child of countless trees. A child of boundless seas.\"",
      "Weir formed the Grateful Dead with Jerry Garcia after the two met in 1963 as teens in Palo Alto, California. The band, with its unique mix of blues, folk and jazz, became a touring powerhouse for decades until Garcia's death in 1995.",
      "Weir wrote or co-wrote and sang lead vocals on Dead classics including \"Sugar Magnolia,\" \"One More Saturday Night\" and \"Mexicali Blues.\"",
      "The group eventually reformed a few years after Garcia's death and took many iterations over the years, the latest as Dead & Company.",
      "\"For over sixty years, Bobby took to the road,\" his family's statement said. \"A guitarist, vocalist, storyteller, and founding member of the Grateful Dead. Bobby will forever be a guiding force whose unique artistry reshaped American music. His work did more than fill rooms with music; it was warm sunlight that filled the soul, building a community, a language, and a feeling of family that generations of fans carry with them.\"",
      "Weir's death leaves drummer Bill Kreutzmann as the only surviving original member. Founding bassist Phil Lesh died in 2024. The band's other drummer, Mickey Hart, practically an original member since joining in 1967, is also alive at 82. The fifth founding member, Ron \"Pigpen\" McKernan, died in 1973.",
      "Dead and Company played a series of concert's for the Grateful Dead's 60th anniversary in July at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco.",
      "Born in San Francisco and raised in nearby Atherton, Weir was the Dead's youngest member and looked like a fresh-faced high-schooler in its early years. He was generally less shaggy than the rest of the band, but had a long beard like Garcia's in later years.",
      "The band would survive long past the hippie moment of its birth, with its ultra-devoted fans known as Deadheads often following them on the road in a virtually non-stop tour that persisted despite decades of music and culture shifting around them.",
      "\"Longevity was never a major concern of ours,\" Weir said when the Dead got the Grammys' Musicares Person of the Year honor last year. \"Spreading joy through the music was all we ever really had in mind and we got plenty of that done.\"",
      "Ubiquitous bumper stickers and T-shirts showed the band's skull logo, the dancing, colored bears that served as their other symbol, and signature phrases like \"ain't no time to hate\" and \"not all who wander are lost.\"",
      "The Dead won few actual Grammys during their career \u2014 they were always a little too esoteric \u2014 getting only a lifetime achievement award in 2007 and the best music film award in 2018.",
      "Just as rare were hit pop singles. \"Touch of Grey,\" the 1987 song that brought a big surge in the aging band's popularity, was their only Billboard Top 10 hit.",
      "But in 2024, they set a record for all artists with their 59th album in Billboard's Top 40. Forty-one of those came since 2012, thanks to the popularity of the series of archival albums compiled by David Lemieux.",
      "Their music \u2014 called acid rock at its inception \u2014 would pull in blues, jazz, country, folk and psychedelia in long improvisational jams at their concerts.",
      "\"I venture to say they are the great American band,\" TV personality and devoted Deadhead Andy Cohen said as host of the MusiCares event. \"What a wonder they are.\"",

    "story": [
      "Authorities in New Mexico issued an arrest warrant Friday for director and Emmy Award-winning actor Timothy Busfield to face a child sex abuse charge.",
      "An investigator with the Albuquerque Police Department filed a criminal complaint in support of the charge, which says a child reported that Busfield touched him inappropriately. The acts allegedly occurred on the set of \"The Cleaning Lady,\" a TV series that Busfield directed and acted in.",
      "The child said the first incident happened when he was 7 years old and Busfield touched him three or four times. Busfield allegedly touched him five or six times on another occasion when he was 8.",
      "The child's mother reported to Child Protective Services that the abuse occurred between November 2022 and spring 2024, the complaint said.",
      "Busfield's attorney and agent did not immediately respond to email messages seeking comment late Friday.",
      "The arrest warrant, which was signed by a judge, said the charge is for two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor.",
      "According to the complaint, the child, which it identifies only by his initials, has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety. A social worker documented him saying he has had nightmares about Busfield touching him and woken up scared.",
      "The child was reportedly afraid to tell anyone because Busfield was the director and he feared he would get mad at him.",
      "The investigation began in November 2024, when the investigator responded to a call from a doctor at the University of New Mexico Hospital. The child's parents had gone there at the recommendation of a law firm, the complaint said.",
      "\"The Cleaning Lady\" aired for four seasons on Fox, ending in 2025. It starred Elodie Yung as a Cambodian doctor who comes to the United States to get medical treatment for her son, witnesses a mob killing and ends up becoming a cleaner for organized crime.",
      "The show was produced by Warner Bros., which according to the complaint conducted its own investigation into the abuse allegations but was unable to corroborate them.",
      "Busfield is known for appearances in \"The West Wing,\" \"Field of Dreams\" and \"Thirtysomething,\" the latter of which won him an Emmy for outstanding supporting actor in a drama series in 1991.",

    "story": [
      "As the window for Americans to enroll in an Affordable Care Act health plan closes in most states today, millions of Americans remain in limbo as Congress weighs whether to extend tax subsidies designed to lower the cost of Obamacare insurance.",
      "Congress has been locked in a showdown for months over the fate of the enhanced ACA premium tax credits, which\u00a0expired on Dec. 31. The\u00a0fight over the subsidies\u00a0was central to the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, which dragged on for six weeks.",
      "The House\u00a0approved a measure\u00a0last week to extend the tax credits for three years after 17 Republicans joined Democrats in forcing a vote on the issue. Yet the extension faces an uphill climb in the Republican-controlled Senate, which previously rejected a separate plan to extend the credits for three years.",
      "A bipartisan group of lawmakers is working on a compromise that includes a two-year extension of the ACA subsidies, but GOP senators said Thursday that progress has stalled.",
      "Separately, President Trump on Thursday announced a health care proposal\u00a0that the White House said would \"send money directly to the American people, lower health insurance premiums and cut kickbacks that raise insurance premiums.\"",
      "In the meantime, the clock is ticking for Americans to make decisions about their coverage. The deadline to sign up for health insurance through the ACA marketplace is Jan. 15 for most states.

Nonprofit health group KFF previously estimated that, barring action by Congress, Obamacare\u00a0premiums\u00a0could more than double this year for the more than 20 million Americans who previously received the tax credits.",
      "\"The end of open enrollment in many states and the most recent enrollment numbers confirm what people across the country are already feeling: We are in a health care affordability crisis,\" said Michelle Sternthal, interim senior director of policy and strategy at Community Catalyst, a health care advocacy group. \"When Congress failed to extend the enhanced premium tax credits, premiums spiked overnight.\"",
      "Some people are dumping their ACA coverage due to steeper costs. Florida resident Stacy Kanas, 59, told CBS News that her family is dropping its ACA plan after learning that their premiums would spike.",
      "\"That is why we're not choosing to be covered at this time,\" she said. \"It's cost-prohibitive.\"",
      "ACA premiums for \"silver\" plans, the second lowest-cost Obamacare coverage, have jumped nearly 22% in 2026, according to a recent analysis by the Urban Institute. By comparison, the nonpartisan think tank projected that health insurance costs for employer-sponsored plans would rise by no more than 7% this year.",
      "Data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services shows 22.8 million people had enrolled in ACA marketplace plans as of Jan. 12, down 1.4 million from the number of Americans who had enrolled in Obamacare, as the health plans are known, a year ago.",
      "Can Congress extend the credits after open enrollment ends?",
      "Technically, there is no deadline for Congress to extend the ACA tax credits, leaving the door open for a congressional remedy, experts have noted.",
      "\"The ACA premium subsidies are refundable tax credits, which are calculated on an annual basis,\" Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, said in a December blog\u00a0post, \"So, an extension could happen even after the deadline to sign up for coverage and be made retroactive to January 1.\"",
      "If the credits are preserved, Levitt said state and federal ACA marketplaces would update their systems, and open enrollment would be extended to give people more time to sort through plan options. However, if a resolution comes later in the year, it could make matters more difficult, Levitt said.",

      "Open ACA enrollment in most states for February coverage ends on Jan. 15.",
      "The drop in enrollment comes as many ACA participants face sharply higher monthly premiums because of a December 31 lapse in tax credits that lowered households' monthly health plan costs. After months of debate and a\u00a06-week government shutdown, Congress has yet to extend the credits or settle on another remedy.",

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates 4 million people will eventually lose their insurance without an extension of the credits.",
      "Robert Kaestner, a health economist at the University of Chicago, said some ACA enrollees who drop the coverage may have other options, such as going on a partner's employer health plan or changing their income to qualify for Medicaid. Others are likely to\u00a0go without insurance while they look for alternatives.",
      "\"My prediction is 2 million more people will lack health insurance for a while,\" Kaestner told the Associated Press. \"That's a serious issue, but Republicans would argue we're using government money more efficiently, we're targeting people who really need it and we're saving $35 billion a year.\"",

    "summary": "The largest nurses strike ever in New York City is underway as thousands of NYSNA members walk off their jobs at major hospitals.",
    "story": [
      "The largest nurses strike in New York City history is underway after negotiators for five major hospitals and the state nurses union failed to agree\u00a0to a new contract by Monday's deadline.",
      "The New York State Nurses Association said\u00a0nearly 15,000 nurses are now walking off their jobs at five privately-run hospitals, including Mount Sinai Hospital, Mount Sinai Morningside, Mount Sinai West and NewYork-Presbyterian in Manhattan, and Montefiore Einstein in the Bronx.",
      "NYSNA said nurses at Mount Sinai started the strike at 6 a.m., while nurses at the remaining hospitals started picketing an hour later.",
      "Gov. Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency in anticipation of the strike amid worries it could jeopardize critical care for thousands of patients in the city.",
      "Montefiore said it was preparing for the strike to last multiple weeks.",
      "\"NYSNA's leaders continue to double down on their $3.6 billion in reckless demands, including nearly 40% wage increases, and their troubling proposals like demanding that a nurse not be terminated if found to be compromised by drugs or alcohol while on the job. We remain resolute in our commitment to providing safe and seamless care, regardless of how long the strike may last,\" Montefiore Senior Vice President Joe Solmonese said.",
      "A Mount Sinai spokesperson said, \"Unfortunately, NYSNA decided to move forward with its strike while refusing to move on from its extreme economic demands, which we cannot agree to, but we are ready with 1,400 qualified and specialized nurses -- and prepared to continue to provide safe patient care for as long as this strike lasts.\"",
      "Some nurses, however, did report to work despite the strike. Mount Sinai said 20% showed up on Monday.",
      "A statement from NewYork-Presbyterian said, \"While NYSNA has told nurses to walk away from the bedside, we remain focused on our patients and their care. This strike is designed to create disruption, but we have taken the necessary steps so our patients continue to receive the care they trust us to provide ... We're ready to keep negotiating a fair and reasonable contract that reflects our respect for our nurses and the critical role they play, and also recognizes the challenging realities of today's healthcare environment...We have proposed significant wage increases that keep our nurses among the highest paid in the city, enhancements to their outstanding employer-funded benefits and new measures that reflect our shared commitment to safe staffing and workplace safety. However, good faith bargaining requires compromise from both sides.\"",
      "Mamdani joins picket line",
      "New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani joined picketers outside NewYork-Presbyterian in Washington Heights.",
      "\"In every one of our city's darkest periods, nurses showed up to work. Their value is not negotiable and there worth is not up for debate,\" Mamdani said. \"They show up and all they are asking for in return is dignity, respect and the fair pay and treatment that they deserve. They should settle for nothing less.\"",
      "Mamdani released a similar statement the night before the strike on X.",
      "\"This city can and must ensure the continuity of care. FDNY, Emergency Management, the public health system and all of my senior leadership are working tirelessly to ensure nurses' demands for dignity can be heard and care is still received,\" the mayor said.",
      "Mamdani urged both sides to meet at the bargaining table.",
      "\"They must bargain in good faith and they must arrive at a deal that is satisfactory to all, that allows the nurses who work in this city to live in this city,\" he said.",
      "Hochul also said she wants a deal made as soon as possible.",
      "Why are nurses on strike?",
      "Both sides bargained\u00a0throughout the weekend, but were unable to reach a deal.",
      "NYSNA has accused Montefiore, Mount Sinai and NewYork-Presbyterian  of putting profits over safe patient care. The union said the wealthiest hospital systems in the city are refusing to compromise on issues like pay raises, safe staffing levels, full health care coverage, pensions, and workplace protections against violence.",
      "\"Health care workers are being stretched to their limits, and as workplace violence in hospitals is on the rise, nurses are asking simply for the basics,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James said at the news conference with Mamdani.",
      "Cecilia Barreto, a registered nurse picketing outside Mount Sinai West, said striking was a last resort.",
      "\"I have been here two years and I've made such great bonds with the nurses here, and I know that there are nurses who have battled cancer and depend on their health care. So we need to make sure that the health care we receive stays intact because their lives depend on it,\" Barreto said.",
      "\"Instead of guaranteeing health care for nurses, these wealthy hospitals are pushing to cut health benefits for nurses who put their own health on the line to care for New Yorkers,\" Nancy Hagans, president of NYSNA, said on Saturday.",
      "An earlier statement from Montefiore called some of the demands \"reckless and irresponsible.\" All of the hospitals impacted called the strike \"reckless\" in a joint statement, accusing the nurses of abandoning patients.",
      "\"NYSNA leadership has chosen to abandon patients in their time of need, but Montefiore Medical Center, Mount Sinai, and NewYork-Presbyterian will not. Their decision to walk out on our patients can only be described as reckless,\" the hospitals said.",
      "Some hospitals in the area were able to\u00a0reach a deal\u00a0with NYSNA, including all of Northwell Health facilities in Nassau County, while others previously pulled back their\u00a0strike notices.",
      "What the strike means for patients",
      "Gov. Hochul last week signed executive orders to ensure the state Department of Health has staff at the impacted hospitals for the duration of the New York City nurses strike, ensuring patient safety and continuity of care.",
      "Montefiore said that emergency rooms will remain open.",
      "Hospital officials said no one should delay treatment or put off appointments, but patients should be alert for any direct updates from their health care providers.",
      "NYSNA also said patients should continue to seek care, with leaders at a news conference Sunday saying going to get care is not crossing a strike line.",
      "The bottom line for patients is that the hospitals will remain open and care will continue during the strike.",
      "Some family members of patients are concerned as the strike continues on Monday night.",
      "Nurses can't pick up prescriptions at Montefiore Hospital",
      "A video shows one nurse being denied access to the Montefiore Weiler Hospital while trying to pick up prescriptions.",
      "The nurse said employees' health insurance is through Montefiore, and they can only pick up medications from a Montefiore pharmacy.",
      "\"Additionally, many nurses live in the Bronx, and their families get their care from Montefiore. If their family goes to the ER or is admitted, they're saying we can't go visit them,\" the nurse said in a statement.",
      "The woman in the video tells the security guard she is contracted to receive medications only through this pharmacy.",
      "The guard says they should've made arrangements to pick up the medication before, as they knew the strike was happening on Monday.",
      "A Montefiore spokesperson said nurses who are on strike can request their prescriptions be delivered directly to their homes.",
      "\"NYSNA nurses are able to attend any medical appointments scheduled at the medical center during the strike, as well as visit any family members who are inpatients, as long as they can provide proper documentation,\" a statement read.",

    "published": "Mon, 12 Jan 2026 10:28:09 -0500",
    "summary": "After the ACA tax credit lapsed in December, enrollees are opting for less robust health plans or dropping coverage altogether.",
    "story": [
      "When Kassidy Hooter learned in December how much her health insurance costs were going to rise this year, she went into panic mode.",
      "The Shreveport, Louisiana, resident and mother of three knew she urgently needed care \u2014 Hooter is in the final trimester of a high-risk pregnancy. But the family could no longer afford their Affordable Care Act plan coverage now that a federal tax subsidy was lapsing on Dec. 31, 2025, meaning they would face thousands of dollars in additional out-of-pocket costs.",
      "\"We heavily considered that it might just be cheaper to give birth at home,\" Hooter, 24, told CBS News. \"Just because that's an insane amount of debt to take on.\"",
      "In the end, Hooter decided to forgo insurance altogether.",
      "A local medical center offered three months of financial aid that will carry her through her due date in February and into late March. After that, she will have to bear any medical expenses on her own. Her plan now is to get her newborn on Medicaid, a government health plan for low-income Americans, as quickly as possible.",
      "\"I'm just hoping for the best,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Health insurance as \"luxury\"",
      "Since its introduction in 2010, the ACA has been instrumental in cutting the share of uninsured Americans from approximately 15% to 8%, according to Nima Sheth, vice president of health justice at the National Partnership for Women and Families, a nonprofit advocacy group.",
      "However, the number of people without health insurance is likely to surge if Congress fails to come up with a solution for the 22 million Americans who received an ACA tax credit, experts warn. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates\u00a0that millions of people will lose coverage unless the subsidies are extended.",
      "Americans in most states have until Jan. 15 to enroll in an ACA marketplace plan, according to healthinsurance.org.",
      "Without the tax credits, premiums for ACA enrollees who previously relied on the subsidies will increase by an average of 114%, estimates\u00a0KFF, a nonprofit provider of health policy news and research.",
      "\"What we're seeing here is a policy choice \u2014 is, in effect, turning insurance into a luxury item and medical debt into the default,\" Michelle Sternthal, interim senior director of policy and strategy at health care advocacy group Community Catalyst, told CBS News.",
      "The House of Representatives on Thursday\u00a0approved a three-year extension\u00a0of the expired ACA tax credits. The legislation faces an uphill climb in the Republican-led Senate, although lawmakers think it could provide a starting point for a compromise that would keep the credits alive in some form.",
      "The CBO estimates\u00a0that the House bill would increase the deficit by around $81 billion from 2026 to 2035. At the same time, the measure would boost the number of people with health insurance, a CBO spokesperson told CBS News.",
      "\"It's weighing extraordinarily heavily on me\"",
      "Plantation, Florida, resident Stacy Kanas, whose family also received an ACA tax credit, is now considering going without health insurance after realizing that her monthly premium to cover her and her husband would rise to $2,500 \u2014 more than double what she was paying last year to cover both of them plus her 20-year-old daughter.",
      "\"It's weighing extraordinarily heavily on me,\" Kanas, 59, told CBS News. \"My husband had a major surgery about five years ago, and we don't want to be uninsured.\"",
      "Although in decent health, the small business owner worries about what could happen if someone in her family falls seriously ill. \"You're one catastrophic event away from perhaps having a financial disaster,\" she said.",
      "Even people who keep their ACA coverage could end up skipping out on care to avoid out-of-pocket expenses, experts said.",
      "\"If you're underinsured and you have high deductibles, the coverage that you're getting is designed to dissuade getting care, including preventative care, so you're going to delay your care until there are emergencies,\" Sternthal said.",
      "Robert Myers, a consultant based outside of St. Louis, Missouri, was on a silver ACA plan last year, but switched to a bronze plan after learning his premiums would rise to $400 a month, up from $17 in 2025.",
      "Under his new plan, the 31-year-old does not have a monthly premium. However, Myers could owe much more in out-of-pocket costs due to $80 co-pays and an $8,000 deductible. As a result, he's planning on scaling back on doctor's visits, a trend experts say ends up driving more people to the emergency room for care.",
      "\"They'll kind of go to the ER and get what they need fixed with a band aid, and then not get long-term care,\" Sheth said.",
      "This can have wider ripple effects because an increase in uncompensated hospital care can drive up costs for other patients, as facilities seek to recoup the costs, according to Sternthal, who supports an extension of the ACA tax credits.",
      "\"Every delay locks families into decisions that harm their health and their financial stability, but then also reverberates out into the business community, the local community,\" she said.",

      "The union said Sunday at a news conference that a strike would begin Monday at 6 a.m. at Mount Sinai and 7 a.m. at other facilities without a new contract.",

No New Yorker should have to fear losing access to health care -- and no nurse should be asked to accept less pay, fewer benefits or less dignity for doing lifesaving work.\"",
      "Key issues for the union",

      "Enough Shame and Blame",
      "My patient Alice began experiencing self-blame in childhood. Her well-intentioned mom put her on diets when she was in her early teens. Even before that, she had started to develop what she eventually called the \"self-hatred voice.\" She vividly remembers when she was ten years old, sitting in the front yard with her legs bent, seeing the inside curvature of her leg and wanting it to be smaller. \"This is the line where your muscle is, and on the inside is a curve. That's the fat and the extra skin. I thought, 'Oh, if I could just cut that off, then my leg would be perfect.' I had a pen, and I drew the line where I thought my legs should be and where the fat should be cut off. I just knew that I was larger than I wanted to be.\" Alice lived in Vermont at the time, and her mother had a garden where she grew all sorts of vegetables\u2014lettuce, carrots, cucumbers. \"I just remember eating salad, so much salad!\" Alice recalls. At thirteen, she sat at the table, thinking, \"Here's a plate with three pieces of lettuce and a carrot,\" and wondering how she was going to get through basketball practice or soccer without passing out or blowing the game for her teammates.",
      "A few years later, her mother put herself and Alice on a no-carb diet. \"Atkins was kinda big,\" Alice says. Her father and two younger brothers were exempt; it was only for the girls of the family. Which basically meant Alice and her mother were still eating everything from the garden, except no turnips, because turnips had \"too many carbs.\"",
      "After three days, Alice revolted. She reached for some crackers in the cupboard: \"Mom, I just ate an entire sleeve of saltines!\" Hearing this, her mother was not upset with her. Alice shared, \"She was desperate for carbs, too, and ate three saltines herself. And then dutifully returned to her no-carb diet.\"",
      "At sixteen, Alice started tracking her weight for sports. The self-hatred voice in her mind began to be very specific and explicit. \"The cupcake you just ate\u2014what is the number of calories in it? What is the number of carbs?\" She described that it wouldn't let up, not even for just one tiny-teeny bite. It was unrelenting.",
      "Fast-forward more than thirty years, and by the time Alice was nearly fifty, she had tried every diet and workout program under the sun: forty-seven of them, to be exact. Atkins, keto, South Beach, the Zone, low carb, no carb, ultra-low fat, liquid only, Jillian Michaels, Jane Fonda, Suzanne Somers, full-body HIIT workouts, gym memberships, a YMCA weight coach, DietBet, StepBet, a Mediterranean diet, a vegetarian diet, the raw food diet, intermittent fasting. She'd even tried hypnosis. She had three teenagers, a fulfilling job in communications, and a loving boyfriend. She struggled with obesity despite spending much of her adult life tracking every morsel of food, eating mostly healthful meals, and exercising every day. She had successfully lost weight countless times. That wasn't the issue. The problem was that she always gained it back. She always blamed herself for having obesity. She did not know about the biology of obesity, yet.",

    "published": "Sun, 11 Jan 2026 09:19:39 -0500",
    "summary": "As millions of Americans struggle with paying for health care, doctors and health experts discuss how medical care is being eroded by insurers denying necessary tests and treatment, making it \"more difficult to be healthy in the United States.\"",
    "story": [
      "Traci Hurley says watching her husband battle cancer in late 2021 was harrowing. \"It was heartbreaking, and it was awful,\" she said. \"I lived in fear every day.\"",
      "A battle made worse, she says, because so many of the skirmishes were with their insurance company. \"No family should have to go through having to fight to get treatment recommended by their physician covered, while fighting for their lives,\" she said.",
      "Millions of Americans say they are struggling to get medical care: either unable to pay sky-high deductibles, or, like Dan Hurley, denied coverage for tests and treatment by health insurance companies. Not only were both the Hurleys doctors; Dan, an ear, nose and throat surgeon, was also skilled in cutting through insurance red tape for his patients.",
      "\"And yet, we still ran into issues a lot,\" Traci said. \"If we, as two physicians, had to struggle the amount that we had to struggle to get care approved, what about people who do not have medical knowledge? What's happening to them every day?\"",
      "Dan was an avid hiker, until a nagging backache turned out to be cancer. He was diagnosed with chondrosarcoma, an ultra-rare bone tumor. To try to save his life, the tumor, along with Dan's hip, had to be removed. Insurance only covered a portion of the costs.",
      "Traci said, \"Many of his treatments were denied. We had PET scans, we had CT scans denied. We had chemotherapy, we had radiation, we had certain medications that required prior-authorization, and were denied.\"",
      "The basis for the insurers' denials, Traci said, was that they were \"not medically indicated.\"",
      "\"Make their lives as difficult as possible\"",
      "Ron Howrigon, now a consultant, spent two decades working for health insurance companies. \"Health insurance companies know that five percent of their members account for 50 percent of all the costs,\" he said. \"So, I have this huge financial incentive to make their lives as difficult as possible.\"",
      "Howrigon says the business model is unlike other industries: \"The more your customers use your product, the less money you make. Your incentive is to keep them from using your product.\"",
      "How often do insurance companies refuse to cover the cost of medical treatments? It's hard to tell; health insurance companies are only required to report denial data for plans purchased through healthcare.gov.",
      "A CBS News analysis of about 1.3 billion federal health insurance claims across three years shows that, in 2024, insurers denied 19% of in-network claims \u2013 about 1 in 5.",
      "But for the biggest insurer, United Healthcare, that was a steep drop from the preceding two years, when it denied as many as one-third of its federal claims.",
      "While it did not provide data to support it, United Healthcare says that, across all its plans, their initial denial rate is 10%. They also point out that when employers are self-insured, the plans they choose for their employees dictate coverage decisions.",
      "\"About 165 million Americans are enrolled in employer-sponsored health care plans, and 65% of them are enrolled in what's called a self-insured plan,\" United said in their statement. \"The health insurance company they select provides administrative services such as handling calls from members and paying claims. But as the phrase 'self-insured' suggests, it's the employer's funds that cover claims payments. \u2026",
      "\"Self-insured employers can design their health plans and determine what will and won't be covered for their employees,\" United continued. \"It's important to remember that your health insurer probably isn't the one that designed it that way. Your employer did.\"",
      "\"Insurance is out of control\"",
      "Dr. Elisabeth Potter, a surgeon who sees as many as 60 patients with breast cancer each week at her RedBud surgery center in Austin, Texas, said, \"The insurance companies have, honestly, made it more difficult to be healthy in the United States.\"",
      "She says insurance denials actually add to costs: \"I have two employees who spend almost all day navigating insurance. It seems that everywhere we turn, there's an issue, whether it's an insurance company saying, 'You know, we won't cover your surgery at that surgery center,' or 'We won't pay for that medication, we want you to be on a different medication.'\"",
      "Case in point: On an early morning this past Fall, Jeannie Lee, a 40-year-old mother with breast cancer, was being prepped for a procedure \u2013 a lymphovenous bypass \u2013 that could have been done two weeks earlier during her double mastectomy, but both her and her husband's insurance companies refused to cover the cost.",
      "Lee is at high risk for developing a condition known as lymphedema where, Potter said, \"It becomes very difficult to just use your arm. It can be painful. It's swollen. It's also deforming.\"",
      "Lee said, \"I'm 40 years old. I have three young kids. It's very necessary to do this procedure.\"",
      "Once Lee was able to obtain financial assistance through a new non-profit set up by Dr. Potter, she was back in surgery. \"This patient is having an extra surgery, a separate general anesthetic, because her insurance company wouldn't cover the surgery,\" Potter said. \"We could have done this very easily at the same time [as her mastectomy ].\"",
      "When she isn't in surgery, Potter is often on the phone defending her treatment decisions to insurance company medical directors who, she says, often know little about her area of medicine. \"Sometimes I get, you know, an ophthalmologist, an eye doctor. It was just completely absurd,\" she said.",
      "She sometimes posts her side of those conversations online.",
      "Potter: \"So, we're speaking about lymphedema of the arm. So, this is not an area that you're familiar with, correct?\"",
      "But a video she posted in early January 2025, she says, ended up putting her entire medical practice at risk. While she was in the operating room, Potter says she got a call from United Healthcare. That \"urgent\" call, she says, was to question why her patient needed an overnight stay in the hospital.",
      "\"It's never happened before. I didn't know what was going on, but they said it was urgent and I needed to call, and so I did,\" she said. \"I am operating. I'm doing the right thing for the patient. I'm going to keep her overnight. I walked out of the hospital and I just filmed myself in my unfiltered, you know, moment.\"",
      "Potter: \"It's out of control. Insurance is out of control.\"",
      "Shortly after she posted that video, she got a letter from the insurance company threatening to sue her for defamation. \"I'm taking great care of patients. They're just trying to scare me into being quiet,\" Potter told us.",
      "I asked, \"And weren't you scared?\"",
      "\"I was scared,\" she replied.",
      "United Healthcare has not taken Dr. Potter to court. They declined an on-camera interview, but a company spokesperson says the call was due to an erroneous order, and a doctor would never be asked to leave surgery for a call about an insurance matter.",
      "\"It was such a gut punch\"",
      "Miranda Yaver, an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh, says insurance companies know that only a small percentage of people will actually appeal claim denials.",
      "\"All of us are vulnerable to being denied,\" she said. \"Not all of us can weather the storms easily when it comes to appealing and overcoming these barriers.\"",
      "Yaver calls it \"rationing by inconvenience.\"",
      "\"A lot of people don't know that they even can appeal,\" Yaver said.",
      "I asked, \"You're saying that it's not really the denial that ends up keeping people from getting care, it's that people give up? \"",
      "\"Fewer than one percent of those in-network claim denials result in appeal, even though people were winning roughly half the time,\" Yaver said.",
      "Clearly, it does pay to appeal, but some patients, like Dr. Dan Hurley, fighting an aggressive cancer, run out of time. Much of his last months were spent, says his wife Traci, on the phone with insurance company personnel: \"He would go line by line with them and they'd say, 'Okay, yeah, we need to get a supervisor involved. We'll call you back.' And then they don't.\"",
      "Dan's goal, she says, was to see insurance companies held to a standard similar to doctors, making them liable for malpractice when they deny lifesaving care. \"The act of signing that denial is practicing medicine,\" Traci said, \"the same way, if a patient came to me and I made a decision about treatment and that decision went sideways, I'm liable. That's how it works.\"",
      "Dan Hurley died on August 3, 2023. One week later, his wife got a letter from the insurance company asking her to pay $80,000 for a round of chemotherapy that had been pre-authorized, but was suddenly retroactively denied. \"It was such a gut punch to get it that day,\" she said. \"This is unbelievable, right? Almost laughable.\"",
      "Dan Hurley's battle has become his widow's. \"There's a part of me that says, 'Oh, he would be so proud of me,' but there's also part of me that he'd be like, 'Come on, chop, chop, you got this, let's go, pick it up, don't be sad, you know, keep going.' Because that's what he was like.\"",

    "summary": "As obesity rates among Americans drop and weight loss drugs lead to a slimmer society, airlines could save on fuel costs, according to a recent analysis.",
    "story": [
      "Airlines could have weight loss drug manufacturers to thank for savings if passengers become lighter, allowing carriers to spend less money on fuel.",
      "As GLP-1 medications for weight loss become accessible to more Americans, they are expected to have a slimming down effect on society. The implication for airlines is lower fuel consumption and therefore cost savings, a recent analysis from Jefferies Research Services shows.",
      "Fuel costs are directly related to the weight of planes, including passengers, their luggage and other essential cargo. A heavier plane requires more fuel, while a lighter aircraft uses less.",
      "Airlines have always taken steps to keep aircraft as light as possible and limit fuel consumption, from serving pit-less olives to using thin or light paper stock, according to the Jefferies analysis.",
      "Airlines \"have a long history of searching for unique methods to reduce the weight of the aircraft, in turn reducing fuel consumption and limiting an airline's largest cost bucket,\" analysts said in the report.",
      "They have no ability to limit how much passengers weigh, however.",
      "If weight loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy lead to a 10% slimmer society, the analysts found that would translate to total airline passenger weight declining by 2%. For airlines, this means 1.5% in fuel savings, plus a 4% boost to earnings per share, according to the analysis.",
      "Jefferies used the example of a Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft to model the savings. It weighs 99,000 pounds empty and can carry 46,000 pounds of fuel. If it seats 178 passengers with an average weight of 180 pounds, plus about 4,000 pounds of other cargo, its total takeoff weight reaches 181,200 pounds. By contrast, if passengers slim down by 10%, to weigh an average of 162 pounds, that aircraft's total weight drops to 177,996 pounds.",
      "Jefferies found that translates to $580 million in fuel savings annually for the top four carriers in the U.S. \u2014 American, Delta, Southwest and United. Those airlines are expected to spend $38.6 billion combined on jet fuel this year.",
      "Jefferies  conducted the study in response to pharmaceutical companies developing weight loss pills\u00a0and following a 2023 report it released studying the effects of weight loss on fuel costs.",

    "published": "Fri, 16 Jan 2026 11:25:11 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump's plans to ease the financial pressures on Americans are bold but could backfire, experts said.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is taking aim at three major pillars of the U.S. financial system \u2014 the Federal Reserve, the credit card industry and the housing market \u2014 that together wield enormous influence over Americans' finances.",
      "The efforts, announced separately over the past week, are tied to President Trump's push to lower borrowing costs as consumers grapple with inflation and affordability pressures. Specifically, Mr. Trump has floated a ban on\u00a0institutional investors\u00a0buying single-family homes, and also capping credit card interest rates at 10% for one year. The Department of Justice launched an\u00a0investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, a probe that Powell said is a pretext for weakening the Fed's independence in setting interest rates.",
      "Although experts note that such measures could reduce borrowing costs for everything from mortgages to credit cards, economists warn they also risk backfiring \u2014 potentially reigniting inflation, restricting access to credit and undermining confidence in the U.S. financial system.",
      "\"Increasing affordability is a worthy goal of this administration, but none of the policies on the table are going to achieve that,\" said Nick Anthony, a policy analyst at the nonpartisan Cato Institute, where he focuses on monetary policy.",
      "He added, \"In fact, most of them are likely to hurt consumers more than they will help them, whether it be price controls, intervening in the Federal Reserve, or intervening in the housing market. All of these interventions are more likely to distort the market than actually help it.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, White House spokesman Davis Ingle said Mr. Trump will unveil more details about his plans for making homes more affordable at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, which starts on January 19.",
      "\"President Trump is committed to making it easier and more affordable to achieve the American Dream of homeownership by eliminating unnecessary red tape, increasing supply and lowering costs. President Trump is working tirelessly to undo the severe damage the Biden Administration inflicted on the American people through high prices,\" Ingle said.",
      "The White House referred questions about the Powell investigation to the Justice Department, which didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Risks of targeting Powell",
      "President Trump has grown\u00a0increasingly critical of Powell, regularly pressing him to lower interest rates and questioning his economic judgment.",
      "Powell does not set rates alone. As a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, he is one of 12 officials whose majority vote determines whether the Fed cuts, raises or holds interest rates steady.",
      "The latest effort by the Trump administration to target Powell comes after the Fed lowered its benchmark rate three times since September, with Powell citing easing inflation and a slowing labor market as justification for the cuts. Powell has long stressed that the Fed bases its rate decisions on economic data, emphasizing the central bank's traditional independence from political influence.",
      "On Sunday, Powell linked the Justice Department to efforts to undermine the Fed's independence when setting interest rates.",
      "\"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,\" Powell said in a statement.",
      "Research has found that countries where central banks are more vulnerable to political influence have suffered from economic problems such as runaway inflation.",
      "It's important that \"the Federal Reserve can act as it sees fit, and it can make the decisions that it believes to be right without fearing repercussions,\" Cato's Anthony said. \"And when you do fear those repercussions, that's when we see situations where there's hyperinflation abroad, because the only concern was making sure that the leader, whether elected or authoritarian, was presented in the best light possible.\"",
      "Borrowing costs could decline if the White House is successful in pressuring Fed officials to lower interest rates, but the flip side could be surging inflation, noted Nigel Green of investment advisory firm deVere Group.",
      "Any legal action against Powell also could undermine investor confidence in U.S. monetary policy, weakening the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve currency and destabilizing the bond market, Wall Street analysts said.",
      "\"The Fed must remain independent in order for the central bank to remain effective and \u2014 this is important \u2014 for the integrity of the U.S. dollar and the all-important Treasury markets to remain the world's benchmarks,\" said Mark Malek, CIO at Siebert Financial, in an email.",
      "Unintended consequences?",
      "Americans have about $1.2 trillion in outstanding credit card debt, with lenders charging an average APR of about 23.8%, according to LendingTree.",
      "On Friday, Mr. Trump called for a one-year cap of 10% on credit card rates, writing in a social media post that he \"will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies.\"",
      "Cutting credit card rates by more than half could save Americans $100 billion in interest annually, Vanderbilt University researchers\u00a0said in a September report.",
      "But a 10% cap could also have adverse consequences, experts added. Credit card companies would likely reduce credit for more than 80% of customers, with almost every account for people with credit scores below 740 closed or severely restricted to offset the reduced fees from a 10% cap, according to an analysis from the Electronic Payments Coalition, a financial industry trade group.",
      "Credit card spending also accounts for 30% to 40% of total annual consumer spending, so tighter credit for lower-income Americans could reduce overall consumer spending by roughly 5% \u2014 a significant economic hit, according to Morgan Stanley analysts.",
      "Housing's biggest problem",
      "Lastly, Mr. Trump is tackling housing affordability at a time when homeownership is increasingly out of reach for many Americans.",
      "His approach aims to tackle two core issues with the housing market \u2014 higher mortgage rates and competition for homes \u2014 by directing the federal government to\u00a0purchase $200 billion in mortgage bonds\u00a0and banning institutional investors from buying single-family homes.",
      "On Friday, the average rate for a 30-year mortgage dipped below 6%, its lowest level in three years. But experts said the strategies fail to address the housing market's biggest problem \u2014 a lack of available homes that stems from underbuilding after the Great Recession.",
      "\"The affordability crisis is fundamentally a supply problem, and meaningful relief requires adding homes, both through new construction or through inventory gains in chronically constrained markets, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest,\" said Realtor.com senior economist Jake Krimmel in an email.",
      "For that reason, banning institutional investors from single-family home purchases \"is unlikely to move the needle on affordability,\" he concluded.",
      "The lack of supply to meet demand from buyers is an issue that will take years to resolve, experts said.",
      "To be sure, banning institutional investors could help reduce competition for homes in some markets. Institutional investors account for roughly 1% of total single-family housing stock, according to an August analysis by researchers at the American Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. The study defined such investors as those owning at least 100 properties.",
      "Investors are a bigger presence in some regions, with investors owning about 27% of single-family rental properties in Atlanta, The Hamilton Project at Brookings found in a 2023\u00a0study.",
      "As of mid-2025, meanwhile, about 10% of home purchases were made by investors, with most them \"mom-and-pop\" buyers, according to Realtor.com said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/canada-cut-tariff-chinese-electric-vehicles/",
    "published": "Fri, 16 Jan 2026 10:55:11 -0500",
    "summary": "Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney said China has become a more predictable partner to deal with than the U.S., the country's neighbor and longtime ally.\u200b",
    "story": [
      "Breaking with the United States, Canada has agreed to cut its 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars in return for lower tariffs on Canadian farm products, Prime Minister Mark Carney said Friday.",
      "Carney made the announcement after two days of meetings with Chinese leaders. He said there would be an initial annual cap of 49,000 vehicles on Chinese EV exports to Canada, growing to about 70,000 over five years. China will reduce its total tariff on canola seeds, a major Canadian export, from 84% to about 15%, he told reporters.",
      "Carney said China has become a more predictable partner to deal with than the U.S., the country's neighbor and longtime ally.",
      "\"Our relationship has progressed in recent months with China. It is more predictable and you see results coming from that,\" Carney said.",
      "Carney hasn't been able to reach a deal with President Trump to reduce some tariffs that are punishing some key sectors of the Canadian economy and Mr. Trump has previously talked about making Canada the 51st state.",
      "The prime minister, speaking outside against the backdrop of a traditional pavilion and a frozen pond at a Beijing park, said meetings in China have been historic and productive.",
      "Earlier Friday, he and Chinese leader Xi Jinping pledged to improve relations between their two nations after years of acrimony.",
      "Xi told Carney in a meeting at the Great Hall of the People that he is willing to continue working to improve ties, noting that talks have been underway on restoring and restarting cooperation since the two held an initial meeting in October on the sidelines of a regional economic conference in South Korea.",
      "\"It can be said that our meeting last year opened a new chapter in turning China-Canada relations toward improvement,\" China's top leader said.",
      "Carney looks to improve global governance",
      "Carney, the first Canadian prime minister to visit China in eight years, told Xi that better relations would help improve a global governance system that he described as \"under great strain.\"",
      "Later, he said at the news conference that the system may give way at least in part to country-to-country or regional agreements rather than the global ones that have underpinned economic growth in the post-World War II era.",
      "\"The question is: What gets built in that place? How much of a patchwork is it?\" he said.",
      "The new reality reflects in large part the so-called America-first approach of Mr. Trump. The tariffs he has imposed have hit both the Canadian and Chinese economies. Carney, who has met with several leading Chinese companies in Beijing, said ahead of his trip that his government is focused on building an economy less reliant on the U.S. at what he called \"a time of global trade disruption.\"",
      "A Canadian business owner in China called Carney's visit game-changing, saying it re-establishes dialogue, respect and a framework between the two nations.",
      "\"These three things we didn't have,\" said Jacob Cooke, the CEO of WPIC Marketing + Technologies, which helps exporters navigate the Chinese market. \"The parties were not talking for years.\"",
      "Canada had been aligned with U.S. on tariffs",
      "Canada had followed the U.S. in putting tariffs of 100% on EVs from China and 25% on steel and aluminum under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Carney's predecessor.",
      "China responded by imposing duties of 100% on Canadian canola oil and meal and 25% on pork and seafood. It added a 75.8% tariff on canola seeds last August. Collectively, the import taxes effectively closed the Chinese market to Canadian canola, an industry group has said. Overall, China's imports from Canada fell 10.4% last year to $41.7 billion, according to Chinese trade data.",
      "Carney tried to address the concerns of Canadian automakers and autoworkers by saying the initial cap on Chinese EV imports was about 3% of the 1.8 million vehicles sold in Canada annually and that, in exchange, China is expected to begin investing in the Canadian auto industry within three years.",
      "More than half of the Chinese EVs exported to Canada would have an import price of less than 35,000 Canadian dollars ($25,000) within five years, he said, making them accessible to consumers.",
      "\"We're building (a) new part of our car industry, building cars of the future in partnership, bringing affordable autos for Canadians at a time when affordability is top of mind, and doing it at a scale that allows for a smooth transition in the sector,\" he said.",
      "\"For the exchange of a small piece of the Canadian market, we have a commitment. We are waiting for an investment commitment in Canada. The real leaders of the new industry. So it's an agreement that will create the future for our industry.\"",
      "China sees an opening under Trump",
      "China is hoping Mr. Trump's pressure tactics on allies such as Canada will drive them to pursue a foreign policy that is less aligned with the United States.",
      "Carney, though, noted Canada's relationship with the U.S. is much more multifaceted, deeper and broader. Canada and China have different systems and disagree on issues such as human rights, he said, limiting the scope of their engagement even as they seek ways to cooperate on areas of common interest.",
      "The Canadian leader leaves China on Saturday and visits Qatar on Sunday before attending the annual gathering of the World Economic Forum in Switzerland next week. He will meet business leaders and investors in Qatar to promote trade and investment, his office said.",

    "published": "Fri, 16 Jan 2026 10:05:34 -0500",
    "summary": "The increase in bankruptcy filings comes as Americans face a slate of economic pressures, from sticky inflation to elevated borrowing costs.",
    "story": [
      "New data shows more Americans are filing for bankruptcy, the latest indication that\u00a0price pressures\u00a0and an uneven economy are leaving some households strapped for cash.",
      "Total consumer bankruptcy filings jumped 12% from 478,752 in 2024 to 533,949 in 2025, according to Epiq AACER, a platform that provides U.S. bankruptcy filing data. Epiq, which tracks Chapter 7, Chapter 11 and Chapter 13 filings, relies on data provided through the U.S. Courts' PACER system, an electronic database that houses federal court records.",
      "The surge in filings comes as American consumers \u2014 and businesses \u2014 face a slate of economic pressures, ranging from sticky inflation to elevated borrowing costs, experts told CBS News.",
      "John Rao, a senior attorney with the National Consumer Law Center, said Americans typically hold off on filing for bankruptcy as long as they can, meaning the conditions that led them to file for bankruptcy may not necessarily be tied to current economic issues.",
      "\"There is often a lag before economic conditions translate to higher bankruptcies,\" he said.",
      "Still, he said the rising cost of medical insurance, mounting credit card debt and the restart of student loan repayments are serving as some of the major catalysts for bankruptcies. Inflation has also made it tougher for Americans to cover expenses while paying down their debt, he added. Inflation has cooled since hitting a 40-year high in 2022, but prices are still rising faster than the Federal Reserve's 2% annual target.",
      "\"There comes a point where the mounting bills, the increasing balances on credit cards, all those things just weigh people down so much,\" Rao said.",
      "A\u00a0December CBS News poll\u00a0found most Americans are struggling to afford basic living costs in the U.S., including health care, food and housing.",
      "A bankruptcy filing can provide consumers with a financial reset, stopping collection calls and wiping out some or all of their debt. But the relief comes with trade-offs: Bankruptcy can severely damage a credit score, delay the ability to buy a home and make it tougher to qualify for loans in the future.",
      "Still, the process may be more common than you think: One in 10 Americans files for bankruptcy at some point during their lifetime, according to a 2025 LendingTree report.",
      "Commercial filings drift higher",
      "Commercial bankruptcies are also on the rise, with filings up 5% from 2024 to 2025, according to Epiq AACER's data. In 2025, consumers lost a number of national and regional retailers \u2014 including Forever 21 and Joann Fabrics \u2014 that failed to stay afloat even after seeking bankruptcy protection.",
      "Chapter 11 bankruptcies, which allow companies to restructure their finances, were up just 1% from 2024 to 2025, driven by higher interest rates in 2023 and 2024 along with inflation, according to Christopher Ward, the co-chair of bankruptcy and restructuring at Polsinelli Law Firm.",
      "Among the most notable recent filings is Saks Global, which filed for Chapter 11 on Wednesday. The parent company of Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman said it has secured financing that will allow it to keep stores open as the bankruptcy proceeds.",
      "Pre-pandemic normalization",
      "Experts emphasized that the increase in commercial and consumer bankruptcies represents a return to pre-pandemic norms.",
      "Bankruptcies dipped during COVID as an injection of government funding helped prop up cash-strapped businesses and American households. Forbearance plans also gave some mortgage payers and car owners more financial breathing room, said Michael Hunter, vice president of Epiq AACER.",
      "However, once those temporary relief measures faded, bankruptcy filings drifted higher, with data showing an upward trend since 2022.",
      "\"We're just slowly coming back to pre-COVID levels,\" Hunter said. \"Is it a huge event? No. Is it a big increase from what we've experienced over the past five years? Yes.\"",
      "While the overall number of bankruptcies is still below their pre-COVID levels, they could start to accelerate, Rao told CBS News.",
      "\"There's a good chance that filings will even be higher through this year and even into next year,\" he said.",

      "Artificial intelligence tools are fueling the creation of online child sexual abuse material, according to a new study that documented the increase of photo-realistic AI material containing the content known as CSAM.",
      "Analysts from the U.K.-based group the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) detected a record 3,440 AI videos of child sexual abuse last year, up from just 13 videos the year prior, a 26,362% increase. Of the AI videos they tracked, over half meet the description of what's known IWF refers to as \"category A,\" a classification that can include the most graphic imagery and torture.",

In a December analysis, Copyleaks, a plagiarism and AI content-detection tool, estimated the chatbot was creating \"roughly one nonconsensual sexualized image per minute.\"",
      "The chatbot's actions prompted action from multiple stakeholders, including the European Union, which said it is monitoring the steps X is taking to prevent the creation of inappropriate image content by Grok. On Wednesday, California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced that he was opening an investigation into xAI and Grok.",

    "story": [
      "The average interest rate on a conventional mortgage in the U.S. dropped to 6.06%, the lowest level in more than three years, Freddie Mac said on Thursday.",
      "A recent dip in mortgage rates has spurred homebuying activity, with purchase applications on the rise and more owners acting to refinance their loans, according to the government-sponsored enterprise.",
      "A year ago, the rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 7.04%. The last time the rate on a typical mortgage was lower was Sept. 15, 2022, when it was at 6.02%.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, also fell this week, dropping to 5.38% from 5.46% last week. A year ago, that average rate was at 6.27%, Freddie Mac said.",
      "Mortgage rates began ticking down in July in anticipation of a series of interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, which began in September and continued last month.",
      "Although the central bank doesn't set rates for home loans, trimming its benchmark rate often points to lower inflation or softer economic growth, spurring investors to buy U.S. government bonds. That can help lower yields on long-term U.S. Treasurys, which can result in lower mortgage rates.",
      "Although mortgage rates are easing, homeownership remains beyond the means of many Americans.",
      "A January report from Attom, a provider of property data, found that median-priced homes are less affordable than usual in 99% of the 594 counties for which sufficient data were available. The national median home price has hovered around $365,000, which is a record high, the group noted.",
      "\"Many Americans were priced out of buying a home in 2025, and affordability remains worse than historic norms in most markets,\" Attom CEO Rob Barber said in a statement earlier this month.",

      "Trump's housing proposals",
      "President Trump last week announced two measures aimed at promoting homeownership, proposing to bar institutional investors from buying homes and also directing the federal government to purchase $200 billion worth of mortgage bonds.",
      "Experts said the proposed ban could ease pressure on home prices, citing research showing that large investors can drive up home prices in communities where they invest.",
      "Ben Ayres, a senior economist at Nationwide Economics, has estimated that the government buying $200 billion in mortgage securities could reduce home loan rates by up to 0.35 percentage points,",
      "Home prices have also surged because of a dearth of affordable housing. The U.S. would need to build as many as 4 million additional homes beyond the normal pace of construction to address that shortage,\u00a0according\u00a0to Goldman Sachs.",
      "Christy Bunce, president of mortgage lender New American Funding, told CBS News that more prospective buyers entering the market would drive up home prices.\u00a0 \"But I don't think we are in a market where we're going to see crazy appreciation,\" she added.",
      "Lower mortgage rates also present an opportunity for current homeowners to refinance their loans, Bunce added.",
      "\"It's a good time to refinance, because nobody has a crystal ball to figure out what rates are going to do in the future,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Erik Schmitt, a Chase Home Lending executive, said that homeowners \"may be able to significantly reduce their monthly mortgage payment or shorten their loan term\" as borrowing costs ease.",
      "\"That said, it's important for homeowners to factor in closing costs, how much remains on their loan balance, and overall financial and life goals when considering whether to refinance,\" he noted.",

      "The House\u00a0approved a measure\u00a0last week to extend the tax credits for three years after 17 Republicans joined Democrats in forcing a vote on the issue. Yet the extension faces an uphill climb in the Republican-controlled Senate, which previously rejected a separate plan to extend the credits for three years.",
      "A bipartisan group of lawmakers is working on a compromise that includes a two-year extension of the ACA subsidies, but GOP senators said Thursday that progress has stalled.",
      "Separately, President Trump on Thursday announced a health care proposal\u00a0that the White House said would \"send money directly to the American people, lower health insurance premiums and cut kickbacks that raise insurance premiums.\"",

Nonprofit health group KFF previously estimated that, barring action by Congress, Obamacare\u00a0premiums\u00a0could more than double this year for the more than 20 million Americans who previously received the tax credits.",
      "\"The end of open enrollment in many states and the most recent enrollment numbers confirm what people across the country are already feeling: We are in a health care affordability crisis,\" said Michelle Sternthal, interim senior director of policy and strategy at Community Catalyst, a health care advocacy group. \"When Congress failed to extend the enhanced premium tax credits, premiums spiked overnight.\"",
      "Some people are dumping their ACA coverage due to steeper costs. Florida resident Stacy Kanas, 59, told CBS News that her family is dropping its ACA plan after learning that their premiums would spike.",
      "\"That is why we're not choosing to be covered at this time,\" she said. \"It's cost-prohibitive.\"",
      "ACA premiums for \"silver\" plans, the second lowest-cost Obamacare coverage, have jumped nearly 22% in 2026, according to a recent analysis by the Urban Institute. By comparison, the nonpartisan think tank projected that health insurance costs for employer-sponsored plans would rise by no more than 7% this year.",

      "If the credits are preserved, Levitt said state and federal ACA marketplaces would update their systems, and open enrollment would be extended to give people more time to sort through plan options.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Republican senators said Thursday that a long-sought bipartisan compromise to extend the expired Affordable Care Act's enhanced premium tax credits for two years has stalled.",
      "\"We are in a little bit of a pothole,\" GOP Sen. Bernie Moreno of Ohio said, blaming Democratic leaders for the lack of movement on the issue. \"So for me, I'm going to take a pause until I hear affirmative statements from the Democrat leader and his leadership team that they are willing to contemplate a deal that extends these enhanced premium tax credits with the reforms that we've outlined.\"",
      "Moreno previously had expected the compromise to be unveiled sometime this week.",
      "He said the proposal that has been discussed would extend the Affordable Care Act's open enrollment period until March 1. The federal deadline to enroll for coverage this year ends Thursday, though some state-run marketplaces have different cutoff dates. More than 20 million Americans rely on the ACA subsidies to help them pay their health insurance premiums.",
      "The bipartisan proposal would also impose an income eligibility cap at 700% of the federal poverty level, and get rid of zero-premium plans by requiring enrollees to pay a minimum premium of $5 per month or $60 per year. To crack down on fraudulent enrollments, insurance companies would face a $100,000 fine if someone is signed up without their consent.",
      "In the second year, the plan would give individuals an option to choose a lower-tier plan and receive the funds in a health savings account, instead of the money going directly to insurance companies.",
      "\"Until I hear affirmative statements from the Democrat leader that he is going to encourage his conference to vote for that, there's really no reason why we should spend any more time or effort on this,\" Moreno said.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said Moreno \"is trying to distract from the reality.\"",
      "\"The credits expired and Americans are paying thousands more because Republicans can't get their act together,\" Schumer said.",
      "The Hyde amendment, which prohibits federal funding for abortion, remains a point of contention. Some Republicans want additional Hyde amendment language to be included the health care bill to ensure it applies to coverage in state-run exchanges. President Trump recently encouraged GOP lawmakers to be \"flexible\" on the issue. Any abortion restrictions could be a nonstarter for Democrats, where their votes are needed in the Senate for passage.",
      "\"We got hung up on what everybody knew the Republicans would get hung up on \u2014 that was the Hyde language. And so there's been kind of a pause right now,\" GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said Thursday. \"Then, we've all known that in order to be able to advance something, we're going to have to have buy-in from the White House.\"",
      "The subsidies were at the center of the government shutdown fight last year, when Democrats refused for weeks to vote to fund the government without an extension of the tax credits. A group of Democrats eventually broke with their party to end the stalemate and reopen the government after securing an agreement for a vote on extending the tax credits. But the GOP-led Senate rejected Democrats' attempt to pass a three-year extension without any reforms.",
      "Lawmakers have long been pursuing a bipartisan compromise to address rising health care costs. The effort was bolstered last week when 17 Republicans helped propel Democrats' plan to revive the subsidies in the House. Though it has no chance of clearing the Senate, some lawmakers said it would serve as a vehicle for the forthcoming compromise.",
      "\"The Senate needs a vehicle, because this is a tax bill and it has to originate in the House,\" Rep. Mike Lawler of New York, one of the Republicans who voted for the Democratic measure, said last week. \"The three-year discharge is that vehicle. We all know the three-year [bill] is not going to become law. It failed in the Senate already.\"",
      "So far, Democratic leaders have not endorsed the plan to emerge from the Senate. Last week, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said they were focused on the three-year extension, but would consider any \"good faith\" effort from Republicans that provides a \"meaningful extension\" of the subsidies.",
      "On Monday, Jeffries again called on the Senate to vote on the three-year extension.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/senior-tax-deduction-6000-impact-refund-aarp/",
    "published": "Thu, 15 Jan 2026 16:07:08 -0500",
    "summary": "A new tax deduction for senior citizens is kicking in this tax season, potentially providing bigger refunds to millions, the AARP says.",
    "story": [
      "A new $6,000 tax deduction for Americans 65 and older could boost refunds for millions of older taxpayers, putting an average of about $670 more in their pockets this year, according to advocacy group AARP.",
      "But some older Americans could see far more. AARP notes that taxpayers in the 22% tax bracket \u2014 roughly those earning between $44,000 and the deduction's $75,000 income cap \u2014 could save as much as $1,320 per person.",
      "\"The benefits could be vast,\" said Bill Sweeney, AARP's senior vice president of government affairs, in a conference call Thursday. \"The bonus deduction will run through 2028 \u2014 that is four years of immediate relief at a time when older Americans are facing really high costs.\"",
      "The $670 figure is based on a 2025\u00a0analysis\u00a0by the White House Council of Economic Advisers, which assessed the impact of the new deduction included in Republican lawmakers' tax and spending law, known as the \"big, beautiful bill\" act.",
      "The tax break comes as seniors tell AARP they are struggling to keep pace with the rising cost of medicine, food and other basic expenses, said Nancy LeaMond, the group's chief advocacy and engagement officer.",
      "\"In focus groups last fall, we heard about people still working long after they thought they'd be retired,\" she said. \"Sometimes in the world we live in, $600 doesn't sound like a lot, but we can tell you, based on conversations with our members, that it is a very, very significant help to them.\"",
      "AARP officials expressed concern that some older Americans may miss out on the new senior deduction because they are unaware of the tax break, which takes effect for the 2025 tax season. The IRS will start accepting tax filings on Jan. 26.",
      "Who qualifies for the $6,000 senior deduction?",
      "People who turned 65 by Dec. 31, 2025, are eligible for the new deduction,\u00a0according to the IRS. The deduction provides $6,000 for each qualifying individual, or $12,000 for married couples who both qualify.",
      "The tax break is subject to income limits. Single filers 65 and older qualify for the full $6,000 deduction if their modified adjusted gross income was below $75,000 last year, while married couples must earn less than $175,000 to receive the full $12,000.",
      "The deduction is reduced by six cents for every $1 above those thresholds, and is fully phased out for single filers earning more than $175,000 and married couples earning more than $250,000.",
      "Individuals also need a work-authorized Social Security number to qualify for the senior deduction, H&R Block notes.",
      "Can you claim the tax break if you take the standard deduction?",
      "Yes, the deduction is available to people who itemize, as well as for those who take the standard deduction, which stands at $15,750 for single filers and $31,500 for married couples filing jointly, according to H&R Block.",
      "The new tax break comes on top of an existing $2,000 deduction for seniors. Combined with the standard deduction, that means single filers 65 and older can deduct a total of $23,750, while married couples can deduct up to $46,700, H&R Block said.",
      "Does this mean my Social Security income won't be taxed?",
      "No, because this is a deduction that beneficiaries can use to lower their taxable income. But it\u00a0doesn't specifically apply to Social Security benefits, which remain subject to federal income taxes.",
      "However, the deduction will benefit seniors by lowering their taxable income, shielding more of it from federal income taxes and providing more money in their pockets, Sweeney of the AARP said.",
      "H&R Block notes that Americans who aren't yet receiving Social Security can still claim the $6,000 deduction.",

    "story": [
      "A new lawsuit filed against OpenAI alleges that its ChatGPT artificial intelligence app encouraged a 40-year-old Colorado man to commit suicide.",
      "The complaint filed in California state court by Stephanie Gray, the mother of Austin Gordon, accuses OpenAI and CEO Sam Altman of building a defective and dangerous product that led to Gordon's death.",
      "Gordon, who died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in November 2025, had intimate exchanges with ChatGPT, according to the suit, which also alleged that the generative AI tool romanticized death.",
      "\"ChatGPT turned from Austin's super-powered resource to a friend and confidante, to an unlicensed therapist, and in late 2025, to a frighteningly effective suicide coach,\" the complaint alleged.",
      "The lawsuit comes amid scrutiny over the AI chatbot's effect on mental health, with OpenAI also facing\u00a0other lawsuits alleging that ChatGPT played a role in encouraging people to take their own lives.",
      "Gray is seeking damages for her son's death.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, an OpenAI spokesperson called Gordon's death a \"very tragic situation\" and said the company is reviewing the filings to understand the details.",
      "\"We have continued to improve ChatGPT's training to recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations, and guide people toward real-world support,\" the spokesperson said. \"We have also continued to strengthen ChatGPT's responses in sensitive moments, working closely with mental health clinicians.\"",
      "\"Suicide lullaby\"",
      "According to Gray's suit, shortly before Gordon's death, ChatGPT allegedly said in one exchange, \"[W]hen you're ready... you go. No pain. No mind. No need to keep going. Just... done.\"",
      "ChatGPT \"convinced Austin \u2014 a person who had already told ChatGPT that he was sad, and who had discussed mental health struggles in detail with it \u2014 that choosing to live was not the right choice to make,\" according to the complaint. \"It went on and on, describing the end of existence as a peaceful and beautiful place, and reassuring him that he should not be afraid.\"",
      "ChatGPT also effectively turned his favorite childhood book, Margaret Wise Brown's \"Goodnight Moon,\" into what the lawsuit refers to as a \"suicide lullaby.\" Three days after that exchange ended in late October 2025, law enforcement found Gordon's body alongside a copy of the book, the complaint alleges.",
      "The lawsuit accuses OpenAI of designing ChatGPT 4, the version of the app Gordon was using at the time of his death, in a way that fosters people's \"unhealthy dependencies\" on the tool.",
      "\"That is the programming choice defendants made; and Austin was manipulated, deceived and encouraged to suicide as a result,\" the suit alleges.",
      "Paul Kiesel, a lawyer for Gordon's family, said in a statement to CBS News that, \"This horror was perpetrated by a company that has repeatedly failed to keep its users safe. \u00a0This latest incident demonstrates that adults, in addition to children, are also vulnerable to AI-induced manipulation and psychosis.\"",

That remains significantly above the 2.7% for all goods, according to the latest Consumer Price Index\u00a0data. On a monthly basis, food prices rose 0.7% last month \u2014 the largest jump since September 2022.",
      "\"December's CPI report reinforces that price pressure is edging higher across key consumer product categories that matter most to consumers,\" Rob Holston, EY Global and Americas consumer products leader, said in a report.",
      "CPI tracks the rate at which prices rise over time. But consumers' perception of food costs is more likely to be influenced by the prices they see on the store shelves. People pay for groceries on a more regular basis than other expenses, with a trip to the supermarket a frequent reminder that food is pricier than it used to be, said David Ortega, a professor and food economist at Michigan State University.",
      "\"We come into contact with food prices much more than we do other prices in the economy,\" he told CBS News.",
      "The rise in food prices in Tuesday's CPI reading is being driven by certain food categories like\u00a0beef and coffee, which have hit record highs, according to Ortega.\u00a0CBS News' price tracker shows that overall food prices have jumped nearly 19% since January 2022.",

      "A coalition of nearly 30 advocacy groups is calling on Google and Apple to remove access to social media platform X and its AI app, Grok, from their app stores after Grok allowed users to generate sexualized images of minors and women.",
      "The organizations, which focus on child safety, women's rights and privacy, expressed their concerns in\u00a0letters\u00a0on Wednesday to Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai, claiming that Grok's content violates the technology companies' policies.",
      "\"We demand that Google leadership urgently remove Grok and X from the Play Store to prevent further abuse and criminal activity,\" the groups said, using the same language in its letter to Apple.",
      "Apple and Google didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "On Thursday, xAI, the company that developed Grok, said in a safety\u00a0update posted on X that it would now \"geoblock\" users from generating \"images of real people in bikinis, underwear and similar attire via the Grok account and in Grok in X in those jurisdictions where it's illegal.\"",
      "It also said the image creation tool will only be available to paid subscribers.",
      "\"We have implemented technological measures to prevent the Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis,\" the company said. \"This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Elon Musk, who owns X and xAI, said in a\u00a0post\u00a0that he is \"not aware of naked underage images generated by Grok. Literally zero.\" He also said the chatbot declines prompts to generate illegal images.",

      "Copyleaks, a plagiarism and AI content-detection tool, told CBS News earlier this month that it had detected thousands of sexually explicit images created by Grok. In a December\u00a0analysis, the group estimated the chatbot was creating \"roughly one nonconsensual sexualized image per minute.\"",
      "The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), which seeks to eliminate child sexual abuse from the internet, has also raised concerns about Grok and other AI tools.",
      "\"We are extremely concerned about the ease and speed with which people can apparently generate photo-realistic child sexual abuse material.\" Ngaire Alexander, head of hotline at IWF, told CBS News in a statement last week. \"Tools like Grok now risk bringing sexual AI imagery of children into the mainstream.\"",
      "California opens probe",
      "Grok is also attracting scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers and authorities overseas. On Wednesday, California Attorney General Rob Bonta\u00a0announced he was opening an investigation into the sexually explicit material produced using Grok.",
      "\"The avalanche of reports detailing the non-consensual, sexually explicit material that xAI has produced and posted online in recent weeks is shocking,\" Bonta said. \"This material, which depicts women and children in nude and sexually explicit situations, has been used to harass people across the internet. I urge xAI to take immediate action to ensure this goes no further.\"",

    "story": [
      "Financial technology company Bilt, whose credit cards offer customer rewards for rent and mortgage payments, introduced three new credit cards on Wednesday that cap interest rates at 10% for one year.",
      "The offer, which will only apply to new purchases, comes after President Trump this week floated\u00a0a 10% ceiling on the interest rates\u00a0credit card issuers charge customers. The proposal drew immediate pushback from Citi, JP Morgan Chase and other major banks, which say it would result in some consumers losing access to credit and hurt the U.S. economy.",

    "published": "Wed, 14 Jan 2026 14:19:53 -0500",
    "summary": "The venerable retailer is seeking protection from its creditors after its $2.65 billion purchase of Nieman Marcus failed to spark growth.",
    "story": [
      "Saks Global filed for bankruptcy protection late Tuesday, according to court documents entered in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston, throwing the future of the roughly century-old high-end department store chain into doubt. Saks Global is the parent company of Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman.",
      "Saks also said it had secured a $1.75 billion financing package and that it would keep its stores open as the bankruptcy procedure plays out.",
      "Saks recently missed a debt payment stemming from a 2024 deal by its parent company, Hudson's Bay Company, to buy\u00a0rival luxury retailer Neiman Marcus\u00a0for $2.65 billion, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported\u00a0in late December, citing people familiar with the matter.",
      "Swamped by debt",
      "Hudson's Bay raised $2 billion in debt to complete the Nieman Marcus deal, while Apollo Global Management affiliates provided an additional $1.5 billion in financing. Amazon also took a minority stake in Saks to facilitate the deal.",
      "\"The debt-fueled acquisition of Neiman Marcus always made bankruptcy a likely destination for Saks Global,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director of market research firm GlobalData. \"The only real surprise has been the speed of the collapse, which has come barely a year after the deal closed.\"",
      "Saks also missed a more than $100 million interest payment to bondholders, according to the Journal, which said the retailer has fallen behind on payments to vendors. Some suppliers have responded by withholding shipments, leaving Saks with thinner merchandise offerings.",
      "\"The truth is that Saks Global put itself in a financially precarious position that undermined the day-to-day operations of the business. A lack of cash meant suppliers went unpaid. This created inventory gaps which then drove customers away and caused revenue and cash generation to plummet,\" Saunders added.",
      "New York-based Saks launched in 1924, opening its first store in Manhattan, according to a historical account of the company posted on its website. The company expanded quickly between the 1970s and 1990s before it was purchased by Hudson's Bay in 2013. Saks's brands include luxury retailer Bergdorf Goodman, which was acquired as part of the deal for Neiman Marcus; retailer Saks Off 5th, and home furnishings seller Horchow.",
      "8,100 store closures",
      "Saks appointed former Neiman Marcus CEO Geoffroy van Raemdonck as its new CEO, effective immediately. He succeeds Richard Baker, who stepped down from his role as Saks executive chairman and CEO on Jan. 13. Saks had announced\u00a0on Jan. 2 that Baker would succeed CEO Marc Metrick as chief executive.",
      "\"If there is one positive from the bankruptcy, it's that the previous management team has been cleared out,\" Saunders said. They bear responsibility for the mess, and their reputation with vendors and associates at the firm is thoroughly tarnished.\"",
      "Tim Hynes, global head of credit research at Debtwire, said van Raemdonck is well-suited for his new role, having previously served as CEO of Neiman Marcus, which he led through bankruptcy.",
      "\"He has a background in turning situations around, and he is familiar with Neiman Marcus, so he is a better fit,\" Hynes told CBS News.",
      "Brick-and-mortar retailers face ongoing competitive challenges from e-commerce giants like Amazon and \"fast-fashion\" sellers such as H&M and Uniqlo. More than 8,100 stores closed across the U.S. in 2025, up roughly 12% from the previous year, according to retail industry analytics firm Coresight Research.",
      "\"In general, brick-and-mortar retailers are not growing, so store closures would be somewhat positive for anybody that competes with Saks,\" Hynes said.",
      "What does this mean for shoppers?",
      "Saks Global is reorganizing, not liquidating, so its brands will remain in business for now. But analysts expect Saks to close some stores to save money on costly leases. The fate of the retailer's Fifth Avenue store remains unclear.",
      "When Saks missed payments to vendors, some brands stopped shipping new inventory, leaving its store shelves thinly stocked.",
      "\"Since Saks put in place a widely panned vendor payment plan, many vendors reduced, and as the year went on, stopped shipments to Saks,\" mergers and acquisitions attorney Jonathan Lazarow told CBS News.",
      "Shoppers can now expect the retailer to start receiving new inventory again, now that it has secured a bankruptcy loan and can resume payments to vendors.",

    "published": "Tue, 13 Jan 2026 19:28:00 -0500",
    "summary": "General Motors CEO Mary Barra said the Trump administration's tariffs caused a \"few-billion-dollar impact,\" but also praised them for \"leveling the playing field.\"",
    "story": [
      "As General Motors settles into its new Detroit headquarters, the automotive industry is facing challenging times as it contends with rising costs, shifting tariff policies and a fledgling electric vehicle market. GM CEO Mary Barra tells CBS News that, despite those challenges, \"I think we're on a good path\" and she is optimistic about the future of her company and the U.S. economy.",
      "The market for electric vehicles hasn't quite taken off in the U.S. just yet. Barra told \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil Tuesday that GM is \"still committed\" to EVs, but thinks a major issue is that the industry was \"getting a little ahead of the consumer.\"",
      "\"A vehicle is such a big purchase for a consumer,\" she said. \"For many of them, it's the most expensive thing that they buy.\"",
      "\"I think we're on a good path. I think as there's more charging infrastructure, as we continue to get the cost of batteries down, I think consumers will pick an electric vehicle, because they're better,\" Barra predicted.",
      "Asked why the U.S. seems to be unable to compete with China in terms of making affordable electric vehicles, Barra said, \"I believe at GM we are.\"",
      "She said U.S. safety standards and other regulatory requirements are higher than they are in China and that China's auto industry is \"heavily subsidized.\"",
      "\"I think we can compete and have a better vehicle, and I think we're doing that,\" she said.",
      "But the cost of a new vehicle has continued to rise in recent years, and the Trump administration's aggressive tariff policy has also added to that, Barra said.",
      "\"It had a few-billion-dollar impact last year,\" she said of those tariffs. But, she noted, it led to GM making changes, including bringing more production to the U.S., and praised the administration for making \"the playing field...a bit more level\" for U.S. manufacturers.",
      "\"We worked with the administration and they took the time to understand our industry to make sure there wasn't unintended consequences so that we could still compete with some of the vehicles coming from other countries,\" Barra said. \"I think it was a shift that we're working through to get back. But I think '26 will be an even better year than '25, and I think the playing field is a bit more level than it was just, you know, 18 months ago.\"",
      "But consumer sentiment in the U.S. remains pessimistic, polling has shown, and the auto industry is often seen as a bellwether for the larger economy. Barra, however, said of a shaky year for GM and the economy, \"we really aren't seeing it.\"",
      "\"We think the market's gonna be about the same as it was last year,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Barra touted the \"tremendous number of vehicles\" that GM makes in the U.S., and when asked what it truly means for something to be \"American-made\" \u2014 considering many of the parts are often sourced from overseas \u2014 she said \"it starts with where the vehicle is designed. Where all the engineering is done.\"",
      "Barra said more than half of GM's vehicles are assembled in the U.S. and that a majority of the components are sourced from America. She also said GM is continuing its efforts to fill job positions in the U.S.",
      "\"One of the things we do is we work with the military, and as people are ending their service to our country, putting them in a training program so they can then work in our dealerships,\" Barra said. She also said GM has a \"very robust apprenticeship program\" for its factory workers.",
      "Asked about concerns workers may have about automation, Barry said GM has been using robotic assistance to help build its vehicles for decades.",
      "\"We focus on jobs that are either repetitive and maybe have ergonomic issues, so people get hurt doing them, so we focus on safety and we focus on ergonomics,\" Barra said. \"We also focus on, there's certain jobs that people don't want to do.

    "published": "Tue, 13 Jan 2026 19:23:47 -0500",
    "summary": "Although there are signs that inflation is starting to ease, consumers still face pressures from high food prices and other costs.",
    "story": [
      "The Consumer Price Index rose at an annual rate of 2.7% in the final month of 2025, in line with economists' forecasts and unchanged from the prior month, capping a year when many Americans felt squeezed by price pressures.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The CPI was expected to rise 2.6% on an annual basis last month, according to economists surveyed by financial data firm FactSet.",
      "The CPI tracks the changes in a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, such as food and apparel.",
      "Inflation last month matched November's 2.7% annual pace, signaling that prices didn't ease further at the end of the year.",
      "So-called core inflation, or CPI data that excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose by 2.6% over the past 12 months, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economists polled by FactSet had predicted a 2.7% increase for that measure.",
      "Food prices jumped 3.1% last month, accelerating from a\u00a02.6%\u00a0increase in November, and the highest since August. Groceries have remained a sticking point for Americans who have had to stretch their budget to afford basic staples.",
      "For cash-strapped Americans, that could prove to be a pain point as we navigate a tricky economic backdrop.",
      "Ground beef prices jumped 15.5% compared with a year earlier, while coffee surged 19.8% and bananas rose 5.9%. One food staple that saw a price cut was eggs, which fell 20.9% from a year ago.",
      "The latest CPI reading closes out a year marked by economic resilience alongside lingering price pressures. Inflation stayed at or below 3% throughout 2025, well below the pandemic peak of 9.1% in June 2022.",
      "Even so, the CPI climbed for several months in 2025 in the wake of the Trump administration's tariff announcements, although the levies didn't reignite inflation to the extent that some economists had predicted. The tariff impact was more muted on inflation than predicted because many retailers swallowed some tariff costs rather than passing them on directly to customers.",
      "However, cooling inflation did not translate into price relief. Prices continued to rise, leaving many households feeling pinched and complicating efforts to save for retirement or buy a home.",
      "\"Inflation remains a challenge, with core PCE inflation holding above the Federal Reserve's 2% target for 55 months,\" noted Seema Shah, chief global strategist at investment firm Principal Asset Management, in a Tuesday email.",
      "The Federal Reserve cut rates three times in the final months of 2025 to counter a cooling labor market, despite inflation remaining above the central bank's 2% target. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said labor-market headwinds outweighed the risk of renewed price pressures. The next Fed meeting is scheduled for Jan. 27 to 28.",
      "What experts are saying",
      "While inflation isn't accelerating, it remains above the Federal Reserve's target rate, analysts noted.",
      "\"By most accounts, inflation is unlikely to drop to the 2% target in 2026, although it may gravitate towards that target, assuming that Fed independence stays intact,\" said Carla Nunes, a Managing Director within Kroll's Financial Advisory Practice, in an email.",
      "Analysts noted that core inflation was cooler than anticipated. The inflation measure, which excludes the food and energy categories, rose 0.2% in December, lower than the 0.3% increase expected by economists.",
      "\"Stepping back from the noise and volatility, core goods inflation appears to have peaked,\" Michael Pearce, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in an email note.",
      "While some measures signal inflation is cooling, Americans are still facing high costs in certain categories, including food and shelter.",
      "\"December's CPI report reinforces price pressure is edging higher across key consumer product categories that matter most to consumers,\" said Rob Holston, EY global and Americas consumer products leader, in an email.",
      "Taken together, today's inflation data and the latest jobs report, which showed a lower unemployment rate, are likely to keep the Fed on track to hold rates steady at its meeting later this month, experts say.",
      "Interest rate traders currently place a 95% likelihood that the central bank will keep rates in the 3.5% to 3.75% range when it meets in January, according to CME Group's Fed Watch Tool.",

      "\"He's been a lousy Fed chairman,\" Mr. Trump told \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil in an exclusive network interview Tuesday in Dearborn, Michigan. \"He was reappointed by Biden. I was a little surprised at that, because I didn't think he really earned his stripes.\"",

      "The costs of renovating the Fed's Washington headquarters and a neighboring building have swelled to $2.5 billion, from a previous estimate of $1.9 billion. Mr. Trump said in the interview that he \"could have fixed them up for $25 million\" and said Powell is \"either corrupt or incompetent.\"",
      "The White House has denied directing federal prosecutors to investigate Powell, and Mr. Trump on Tuesday brushed off a question about whether the Justice Department probe amounts to political retribution.",
      "\"I can't help what it looks like,\" Mr. Trump told Dokoupil.",
      "Powell on Sunday attributed the Justice Department investigation to Fed officials resisting pressure from Mr. Trump to lower its benchmark interest rate. Mr. Trump, who nominated Powell to lead the Fed in 2017, has repeatedly accused the central bank chief of being too cautious in lowering interest rates.",
      "Three former Fed chiefs \u2014 Janet Yellen, Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan \u2014 defended Powell this week in a strongly worded statement, accusing the Trump administration of seeking to undermine the Fed's traditional independence.",

      "The top job for 2026: cardiac medical technician. The number of listings for the role on Indeed's website has surged 34% since 2022, while wages have grown by the same amount. Cardiac medical techs earn a median salary of nearly $134,000. Nurse practitioner ranks No. 3, with a median salary of $143,183.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/credit-card-interest-rate-cap-trump/",
    "published": "Tue, 13 Jan 2026 17:19:38 -0500",
    "summary": "Capping credit card interest rates at 10% could save consumers billions of dollars, but potentially hurt lower-income Americans, experts said.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's proposal to cap credit card interest rates at 10% for one year could save consumers billions of dollars but hurt Americans with lower credit scores, according to financial experts.",
      "The idea, which drew rare support on Monday from Democrats such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, would prevent Americans from being \"ripped off\" by card issuers, Mr. Trump\u00a0said\u00a0last week in calling for the rate ceiling. By contrast, the cap has drawn pushback from the banking industry.",
      "After JPMorgan Chase on Tuesday reported its fourth-quarter results, Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum said the proposed interest rate cap would punish consumers and dent the economy.",
      "\"Specifically, people will lose access to credit, like on a very, very extensive and broad basis, especially the people who need it the most, ironically,\" he said. \"And so, that's a pretty severely negative consequence for consumers, and frankly, probably also a negative consequence for the economy as a whole right now.\"",
      "The average interest rate on credit cards is now nearly 24%, according LendingTree. People with poor credit scores, meanwhile, can pay rates of up to 36%.",
      "Here's how experts say a 10% cap could affect consumers.",
      "Potential tradeoffs",
      "A September 2025\u00a0analysis\u00a0from researchers at Vanderbilt University found that a 10% cap on credit card rates would save consumers $100 billion per year in reduced interest payments.",
      "With rates at 10%, a cardholder with a $5,000 balance would pay about $42 per month in interest. At the current average rate of 24%, they would owe about $100 per month.",
      "Some credit card analysts, along with the banking industry, contend that a 10% cap on credit card rates could lead to banks cutting off access to credit for low-income consumers and for those with low credit scores.",
      "\"They would find it dramatically more difficult to access credit,\" Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at Bankrate, told CBS News.",
      "That could take a toll on the broader economy because subprime consumers would likely pare their spending or turn to pricier types of credit. Credit card spending accounts for 30% to 40% of total annual consumer spending, so tighter credit for lower-income Americans could reduce overall consumer spending by roughly 5%, according to Morgan Stanley analysts.",
      "For overall economic growth, that would effectively cancel out any increase in consumer spending stemming from lower credit card rates, the investment bank notes.",
      "The American Bankers Association also said in a statement\u00a0that a 10% rate cap \"would only drive consumers toward less regulated, more costly alternatives,\" such as payday\u00a0or \"buy now pay later\" loans.",
      "Tiffany Funk, co-founder and president of point.me, a site that helps consumers maximize their credit card rewards, said such programs could be diminished if the cap is implemented.",
      "\"Absent that lever and potential revenue source, we would likely see banks raise annual fees dramatically, or drastically reduce the value of their points and transfer programs,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Yet Shearer disputes claims that capping rates would cause card companies to cut off some consumers, forcing them to turn to riskier types of loans. Rather, credit card issuers are more likely to continue serving such consumers, but could sharply reduce the value of the rewards they offer them, he said.",
      "\"The credit card business is massively profitable, so it could absorb a significant cut,\" he said, noting that credit card issuers have a range of revenue streams.",
      "Issuers such as Visa, Mastercard and Capital One also make money by charging annual fees and on so-called interchange fees merchants pay to accept credit cards, which wouldn't be affected by the proposed rate cap.",
      "\"Claims from bank lobbyists that this would lead to account closures are greatly overstated, if not completely false,\" Shearer said.",
      "Why are credit card rates so high?",
      "Annual percentage rates (APR on credit cards are far higher than auto loan or mortgage rates because the debt is unsecured, Rossman explained.",
      "\"There is no underlying asset like a car or a home,\" he told CBS News. \"The risk to lenders is they aren't going to be paid back,\" he added, explaining the rationale behind double-digit interest rates.",
      "Card companies are also reluctant to reduce rates because that would mean smaller profits.",
      "The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 limits how much card issuers can increase rates, but does not put a cap on rates, while also reducing late payment and other fees.",
      "Can Trump really do this?",
      "Some experts think Trump may not have the authority to unilaterally impose a cap on credit card rates. Congress would also face challenges implementing such a cap, according to TD Cowan analyst Jaret Seiberg, although he thinks lawmakers could get behind a higher cap.",
      "\"This is where the risk rises as Democrats have sought to extend the 36% military lending cap to all consumers. It is why that could pass. Enacting a 25% cap would be harder as it could affect first-time credit card holders and subprime applicants,\" he said in a research note.",
      "Shearer said that a bipartisan\u00a0bill, the \"Percent Credit Card Interest Rate Cap Act,\" introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont in 2025 could pass if Mr. Trump's allies rallied behind it.",
      "\"It's not going to happen through executive action,\" Shearer said of a cap on interest rates. \"But if he can get the Senate majority leader and speaker to put it up for a vote, it's quite possible the bill would pass.\"",

      "Buying a home has become far more expensive in recent years as home prices have surged, driven by a shortage of affordable housing and, since 2022, rising mortgage rates.

Yet experts say these strategies will do little to address one of the housing market's thorniest problems: a shortage of homes for sale.",
      "The supply issue partly reflects years of underbuilding after the 2008 financial crisis, as well as the reluctance of homeowners who locked in ultra-low mortgage rates during the ensuing recession to relinquish their properties.",
      "\"There is an undersupply of housing in the U.S., and that will take time to resolve,\" Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy for TD Securities, told CBS News.",
      "The U.S. would need to build as many as 4 million additional homes beyond the normal pace of construction to address the housing shortage, according to Goldman Sachs.",
      "Janneke Ratcliffe, vice president of housing and communities at the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, told CBS News that the housing market's supply challenges could be harder to address.",
      "\"Most solutions to create new housing take a long time to come to fruition,\" she said.",
      "For example, high land costs make it hard to add to the housing supply. One solution, \u00a0Ratcliffe said, would be to change local zoning rules so more homes can be squeezed into a given area. Yet such policies are set at the local level, not by the federal government, she noted.",
      "Why lower mortgage rates aren't a panacea",
      "Because Mr. Trump's policies address the demand side of the equation, they could inadvertently drive up home prices, Goldberg said. For instance, a decline in mortgage rates could draw more buyers into the market, pushing home prices higher and exacerbating the supply problem.",
      "\"If consumers are able to afford more homes because monthly payments are lower, home prices tend to rise more quickly,\" the analyst told CBS News. \"So simply lowering the cost of buying a home through the mortgage channel isn't sufficient to fix the problem in the long run.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump's plan to ban big investors, such as Invitation Homes and financial giant Blackstone, from hoovering up single-family homes might have only a limited effect on the market, according to Goldberg. The reason: investors that own at least 100 properties account for only roughly 1% of the total single-family housing stock in the U.S., according to the American Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "\"That's a relatively small impact,\" Goldberg said.",
      "Mr. Trump also hasn't said whether institutional investors would be required to sell the homes they currently own, he pointed out. If those firms are not forced to put those properties on the market, a ban is unlikely to significantly expand the supply of homes, Goldberg said.",
      "Still, Mr. Trump's policies could make a small difference, some housing market experts said.",
      "\"Mortgages will be a little cheaper, and housing will be a little more affordable,\" Carl Weinberg, chief economist and managing director of High Frequency Economics, told CBS News, adding that banning institutional investors from scooping up homes could \"bring prices down a little.\"",
      "Ben Ayres, a senior economist at Nationwide Economics, estimated that the government buying $200 billion in mortgage securities could reduce home loan rates by up to 0.35 percentage points, which could \"spur more spending activity.\"",
      "The upshot: Meaningful progress will require tackling the shortage of available homes, economists agreed. Unless that issue is addressed, the housing affordability crunch will persist, said Edward Pinto, senior fellow and co-director of the AEI Housing Center at the nonpartisan American Enterprise Institute.",
      "\"We need to either activate the existing supply that is underutilized, or take steps to allow the building of new homes,\" Pinto said. \"We need to come up with supply-side solutions that take effect quickly.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump defended his tariffs at a speech in Michigan, after he visited a factory in Dearborn.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump spoke Tuesday at the Detroit Economic Club after he toured a Ford truck plant in nearby Dearborn. It comes as the president tries to focus on economic issues amid myriad international and domestic events that have gripped his administration since the start of the year.",
      "As Mr. Trump took to the stage, he touted the economy and also his victory in the 2024 election in Michigan. Mr. Trump called the event the \"easiest speech I've had to make\" because \"all I'm doing is spewing off what the hell we've done.\"",
      "Mr. Trump defended his administration's tariffs, saying he had closed the trade deficit due to the tariffs.",
      "\"Tariff's my favorite word,\" Mr. Trump said, later amending that it's his \"fifth-favorite word.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said tariffs had helped the car industry in Michigan, a point he also made while in Dearborn.",
      "Mr. Trump also said he would be rolling out a plan to deal with affordability when he is at Davos, although he has said that affordability is a \"hoax.\"",
      "On the international front, Mr. Trump spoke about his administration's military strikes on Venezuela and capture of its former President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. He attacked the Democrats who voted to advance a war powers resolution, saying they \"hate our country,\" and he also called out a few of the Republicans who joined them.",
      "Mr. Trump met with oil executives to push for U.S. investment in Venezuela's oil industry, and he said Monday that \"we're working with the Venezuelan people and representatives, and it's amazing\" for the country's oil.",
      "Veering off topic from the economy, Mr. Trump said, starting Feb. 1, his administration would cut off all payments to sanctuary cities and \"states having sanctuary cities because they do everything possible to protect criminals at the expense of American citizens, and it breeds fraud and crime and all of the other problems that come.\" Previous attempts to cut off funding from sanctuary cities have been blocked by federal courts.",
      "Mr. Trump also criticized the fraud scandal in Minnesota involving dozens of Somali-American defendants, trashing Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Rep. Ilhan Omar, a staunch critic of Mr. Trump who represents Minneapolis and is Somali-American, saying she \"comes from a country with nothing and she comes here and she tells us about our Constitution.\"",
      "Walz last week dropped his reelection bid amid scrutiny over fraud in the state and the ongoing investigation.",
      "Mr. Trump said the recent immigration crackdown in Minnesota, which began shortly after a conservative YouTuber late last month published a video with\u00a0further allegations of fraud, has been successful in \"finding hundreds\" of criminals, and \"all we want to do is get them out.\"",
      "\"It's hard to get them out because they make it so impossible for you,\" he said. \"And you wonder, why? Why would they do that? You know, do they want to live with murderers, do they want to live with these people that are emptied out from prisons?\"",
      "Mr. Trump did not mention Renee Good, an American citizen who last week was fatally shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis. Mr. Trump and other high-ranking officials in his administration have repeatedly insisted the ICE officer was justified and that Good had instigated the shooting. Local officials and video footage of the incident have cast doubt on some of their claims.",
      "Mr. Trump also spoke to \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil during his visit to Dearborn about the economy and other issues. The interview will air on \"CBS Evening News\" tonight.",
      "On the economy, the December jobs report released last week continued to show a softening economy, with only 50,000 jobs added in December. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate stood at 4.4% in December, compared with 4.5% in November.",
      "Overall for 2025, job growth slowed throughout the year as some businesses grappled with economic uncertainty, prompting them to pull back on hiring.",
      "In a prime-time address last month,\u00a0Mr. Trump defended some of his signature second-term economic policies, including his handling of inflation and tariffs.",
      "The Detroit Economic Club has a long history of hosting presidents, both Democrats and Republicans. Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush have all previously spoken to club members.",

    "summary": "Roughly 1.4 million fewer Americans have signed up for an Affordable Care Act plan as expiring tax breaks drive up premiums.",
    "story": [
      "Far fewer Americans enrolled in an Affordable Care Act health care plan, new federal data shows, with millions facing higher premiums after tax subsidies under the insurance program expired in December",
      "According to figures\u00a0from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), 22.8 million people have signed up for ACA coverage for 2026 since open enrollment started on Nov. 1. That's down 1.4 million from the number of Americans\u00a0who had enrolled in Obamacare, as the health plans are known, a year ago.",
      "Nationally, around 800,000 fewer people have selected plans compared to a similar time last year, marking a 3.5% drop in total enrollment so far. That includes a decrease in both new consumers signing up for ACA plans and existing enrollees re-upping them.",
      "Open ACA enrollment in most states for February coverage ends on Jan. 15.",
      "The drop in enrollment comes as many ACA participants face sharply higher monthly premiums because of a December 31 lapse in tax credits that lowered households' monthly health plan costs. After months of debate and a\u00a06-week government shutdown, Congress has yet to extend the credits or settle on another remedy.",
      "The House last week approved legislation that could preserve the enhanced subsidies for another three years. The fate of the bill is now in the hands of the Republican-controlled Senate.",
      "Over 20 million Americans received the ACA subsidies last year. Health policy group KFF\u00a0estimates that they could see their premiums swell by an average of 114%, from around $888 in 2025 to $1,904 this year, unless the tax credits are extended.",
      "Experts have warned that the end of the subsidies could push more people to dump their coverage in the face of higher premiums and out-of-pocket expenses. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates 4 million people will eventually lose their insurance without an extension of the credits.",
      "Robert Kaestner, a health economist at the University of Chicago, said some ACA enrollees who drop the coverage may have other options, such as going on a partner's employer health plan or changing their income to qualify for Medicaid. Others are likely to\u00a0go without insurance while they look for alternatives.",
      "\"My prediction is 2 million more people will lack health insurance for a while,\" Kaestner told the Associated Press. \"That's a serious issue, but Republicans would argue we're using government money more efficiently, we're targeting people who really need it and we're saving $35 billion a year.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump plans to pardon Puerto Rico's former governor, Wanda V\u00e1zquez Garced, who pleaded guilty last year in a federal public corruption case, multiple sources told CBS News on Friday.",
      "Her two co-defendants, the billionaire Venezuelan-Italian banker and Britannia Financial Group founder Julio Martin Herrera-Velutini and Mark Rossini, will also be pardoned for their crimes in the bribery scheme, two of the sources said.",
      "Herrera Velutini's daughter, Isabel Herrera, donated\u00a0$2.5 million in December 2024\u00a0and\u00a0$1 million\u00a0last July to the pro-Trump political action committee MAGA Inc., according to public records. A White House official told CBS News that the donations had nothing to do with the pardon.",
      "The Justice Department's Public Integrity Section, which last year was largely dismantled, charged the three in 2022 with conspiracy, federal programs bribery, and honest services wire fraud in connection with V\u00e1zquez's 2020 campaign.",
      "All three defendants pleaded guilty to lesser corruption charges in August, after the Justice Department abruptly cut a deal with the defendants as the case was nearing trial.",
      "Among the defense attorneys who helped broker the deal with Mr. Trump's Justice Department was Chris Kise, who previously defended the president over criminal charges that he retained classified information after departing the White House in early 2021.",
      "Last year, as the trial approached, Kise met with senior department officials and sought to convince them to drop or reduce the charges, sources previously told CBS News.",
      "It was one of corruption cases in which defense lawyers in the last year have sought to have dismissed, claiming without evidence they were examples of weaponization by the Biden administration, the sources previously said.",
      "Trump officials have said they believed the case was politically motivated, noting the investigation into V\u00e1zquez started in 2020, days after she had endorsed Mr. Trump.",
      "\"Ms. V\u00e1zquez's pardon materials state that there was never any element of a quid pro quo deal and that her prosecution was politically motivated,\" a White House official told CBS News, speaking anonymously because the president hasn't yet formally announced the pardons.",
      "In July, the federal judge presiding over the case expressed dismay after the Justice Department said it wanted to dismiss the most serious offenses and allow the defendants to plead to lesser misdemeanor charges of violating the Federal Electoral Campaign Act.",
      "\"Strikingly, the penalty for violating Section 30121 of the FECA is a mere slap on the wrist when compared to the sentencing exposure the defendants faced if convicted of the conduct charged in the Indictment,\" wrote U.S. District Judge Silvia Carre\u00f1o-Coll for the District of Puerto Rico.",
      "\"But alas, the Government's decision to shift gears at the eleventh hour is allowed because ultimately the Government decides how it will exercise its prosecutorial discretion,\" she added.",
      "The Public Integrity Section, which prosecuted the case along with the local U.S. Attorney's office, was established in the wake of the Watergate scandal and was tasked with handling some of the most politically sensitive prosecutions.",
      "Last year, the Justice Department ordered it to stop consulting with U.S. attorneys, and it had all but two of its prosecutors transferred into other jobs throughout the department.",
      "As the section has unraveled, Mr. Trump has undone much of its work over the past year, pardoning a slew of defendants the section had successfully prosecuted or were in the process of prosecuting.",
      "Among those pardoned include Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar, former Tennessee House Speaker Glen Casada, former Tennessee state lawmaker Brian Kelsey, a former Virginia sheriff and a Las Vegas councilwoman.",

      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Friday that efforts to crack down on Mexican cartels and slow migration north were showing \"compelling results\" in an effort to head off intervention talk by the Trump administration.",
      "The comments come after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened action against Mexican drug cartels by U.S. forces last week. Mr. Trump told Fox News last week that the United States had \"knocked out 97% of the drugs coming in by water\" and that the U.S. was \"going to start now hitting land, with regard to the cartels.\" The Trump administration has also begun to\u00a0add militarized zones to the southern border.",
      "Sheinbaum, a leftist who boasts of taking on chaos with a \"cool head,\" has sought to placate Mr. Trump and, unlike Maduro, has worked to build out a strong relationship between the Mexican and U.S. governments. A dramatic\u00a0United States military raid on Venezuela that deposed\u00a0former president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in early January set much of Latin America on edge, fueling concern that Mr. Trump could soon turn American forces on other nations, particularly Cuba and Mexico.",
      "On Thursday night, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Mexican Foreign Secretary Juan Ram\u00f3n de la Fuente released a joint statement after a phone call, saying they agreed \"more must be done to confront shared threats.\"",
      "Sheinbaum, mentioning the call on Friday in her morning press briefing, said that Mexico's government had made significant progress cracking down on cartels, citing a steep drop in the homicide rate, much lower fentanyl seizures by U.S. authorities at the border and sparse migration. Mexican authorities seized over 1,500 pounds of methamphetamine from clandestine laboratories in the country earlier this week.",
      "She noted it was a joint effort with the U.S.\"There are very compelling results from the joint cooperation and the work that Mexico has been doing,\" she said.",
      "She reiterated her call for the United States to stop arms trafficking into Mexico and highlighted drug use in the U.S. as a key factor fueling cartel violence in Mexico.",
      "\"The other side also has to do its part. This consumption crisis they have over there also has to be addressed from a public health perspective, through education campaigns,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "The number of detainees in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody has reached a new record high, surpassing 70,000 for the first time in the deportation agency's 23-year history, according to internal Department of Homeland Security data obtained by CBS News.",
      "As of Thursday, ICE was holding about 73,000 individuals facing deportation in its custody across the country, the highest level recorded by the agency and an 84% increase from the same time in 2025, when its detention population hovered below 40,000, the internal statistics show.",
      "The Trump administration has said it is aiming to be able to detain upwards of 100,000 immigration detainees at any given time, as part of its government-wide effort to carry out a deportation crackdown of unprecedented proportions.",
      "Former senior U.S. immigration officials said they were not aware of any other period in American history when the U.S. government had held more people in immigration detention.",
      "\"It is absolutely a record, certainly in modern times,\" said Doris Meissner, a Clinton administration official who led the now-defunct Immigration and Naturalization Service, or INS, a predecessor of ICE and other federal immigration agencies.",
      "The DHS figures obtained by CBS News show nearly 67,000 of the individuals in ICE custody on Thursday were single adult detainees facing deportation because of alleged violations of U.S. immigration law. Another 6,000 detainees were classified as family units, or parents and underage children taken into custody as families for alleged immigration violations.",
      "ICE detains foreigners placed in deportation proceedings because of immigration violations, such as entering the U.S. illegally or overstaying a visa, as well as legal immigrants whose status lapses or is revoked because of criminal offenses. Some of those held by the agency have criminal charges or convictions, in addition to being accused of civil immigration violations.",
      "The internal DHS data indicates roughly 47% \u2014 or about 34,000 \u2014 of ICE's detainees had criminal charges or convictions in the U.S. The numbers do not include details on the severity of the criminal records, which can range from felonies and other serious crimes, to misdemeanors and immigration-related offenses.",
      "The rest of the detainees are classified by ICE as \"immigration violators,\" meaning they are neither convicted of crimes or facing charges in the U.S. and were being held solely due to civil immigration violations.",
      "While all three categories of ICE detainees \u2014 immigration violators, those with criminal charges and those with criminal convictions \u2014 have grown since the start of the second Trump administration, figures posted by the agency every two weeks show the non-criminal group has seen the most acute and rapid rise.",
      "When focusing solely on ICE detainees initially arrested by the agency \u2014 and not Border Patrol \u2014 there has been a 2,500% surge in non-criminal detainees from Jan. 26, 2025 (945) to Jan. 7, 2026 (24,644), according to the latest publicly available government data. During that time, the number of detainees arrested by ICE who have criminal convictions or charges has grown by 80% and 243%, respectively.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, DHS assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin said 70% of those arrested by ICE under the second Trump administration \u2014 not those currently in the agency's custody \u2014 have criminal charges or convictions in the U.S. She said those listed as \"immigration violators\" could have criminal histories abroad or terrorism ties.",
      "In regards to the growing detainee population, McLaughlin said, \"As we arrest and remove criminal illegal aliens and public safety threats from the U.S., ICE has worked diligently to obtain greater necessary detention space while avoiding overcrowding.\"",
      "\"Thanks to the One Big Beautiful Bill, ICE now has historic funding to secure enough detention capacity to maintain an average daily population of 100,000 illegal aliens and 80,000 new ICE beds,\" she added.",
      "The steady growth in ICE's detainee population over the past months comes after the agency received an unprecedented infusion of funding through the One Big Beautiful Act last year, including $45 billion alone to expand detention space. In addition to its traditional use of county jails and for-profit prisons, ICE has expanded its detention capacity by using other facilities, including military sites like Fort Bliss in Texas.",
      "Republican officials in places like Florida and Louisiana have offered state facilities, like the so-called \"Alligator Alcatraz\" detention center in the Everglades, to hold those facing deportation. ICE has also used field offices in major U.S. cities to hold detainees, often for days, even though such facilities are not designed for long-term detention.",
      "\"We are talking about a system that already, prior to the Big Beautiful Bill, constituted the largest detention and removal infrastructure of any country in the world \u2014 and now it's being put on steroids,\" said Meissner, now a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute, a non-partisan think tank.",
      "Under President Trump, ICE has been given a broad mandate to turbocharge immigration arrests and deportations, with the agency rescinding Biden-era rules that required officers to largely focus on arresting serious offenders, national security threats and recent arrivals in the U.S. illegally.",
      "The administration has dispatched thousands of ICE officers and Border Patrol agents to stage highly-visible raids in major American cities like Los Angeles and Chicago, where their tactics and use of force have been decried as overly harsh and indiscriminate by local leaders and some residents.",
      "Most recently, the administration has deployed roughly 3,000 ICE and Border Patrol agents to the streets of Minneapolis and surrounding communities, an operation DHS has called the largest in its history. Clashes and protests there have intensified since the killing of Minnesota resident Renee Good by an ICE officer last week.",

So far, the Justice Department has released 12,285 documents out of the more than two million that it must make available under the Epstein Files Transparency Act.",

    "published": "Fri, 16 Jan 2026 10:11:00 -0500",
    "summary": "CIA director John Ratcliffe delivered a message that the U.S. \"looks forward to an improved working relationship\" with Venezuela, a U.S. official told CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "CIA director John Ratcliffe met with Venezuela's interim President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez for two hours Thursday in Venezuela's capital, Caracas, to \"deliver the message that the United States looks forward to an improved working relationship,\" a U.S. official told CBS News Friday.",
      "The official described the trip as historic, noting that Ratcliffe was the first Cabinet-level official to visit Venezuela since the U.S. military operation to remove the country's autocratic leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro nearly two weeks ago.",
      "At the meeting, which was first reported by The New York Times, Ratcliffe was said to convey a warning that Venezuela must stop supporting drug trafficking.",
      "\"During the meeting in Caracas, Director Ratcliffe discussed potential opportunities for economic collaboration and that Venezuela can no longer be a safe haven for America's adversaries, especially narcotraffickers,\" the official said.",
      "The meeting came the same day that President Trump met with Venezuela's opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado at the White House.",
      "Though Mr. Trump has publicly praised Machado, the administration appears to view Rodr\u00edguez \u2014 who was vice president under Maduro \u2014\u00a0 as more capable of maintaining stability in Venezuela in the near term.",
      "That aligns with the findings of a CIA analytic assessment that modeled potential political leadership scenarios in Venezuela if Maduro were no longer president, CBS News can confirm. The analysis, which was closely held and briefed to a limited group of senior administration officials, concluded that existing Maduro-aligned officials \u2014 including Rodr\u00edguez \u2014 would be best positioned to maintain short-term stability.",
      "During his Senate confirmation hearings last year, Ratcliffe promised that, as he put it, the agency would be less risk-averse under his leadership. This visit to Caracas reflected the U.S. intelligence chief's belief that he would not ask the CIA workforce to take risks he would not take himself, the U.S. official told CBS News.",
      "CBS News has previously reported that the CIA had a small team operating clandestinely on the ground in Venezuela as early as August to lay the groundwork for Maduro's capture, including a human asset helping it track Maduro.",
      "After months of preparation that included building a replica of Maduro's compound and studying his daily habits, U.S. forces arrived at the Venezuelan president's residence just after 2 a.m. local time on Jan. 3.",
      "The surprise operation involved U.S. forces dismantling and disabling Venezuela's air defense systems as U.S. military helicopters neared Caracas, and U.S. military personnel deployed weapons \"to ensure the safe passage of the helicopters into the target area,\"\u00a0 Joint Chiefs chairman Gen. Dan Caine said earlier this month.",
      "Maduro was apprehended along with his wife, Cilia Flores, and brought to the U.S. to face charges including charges of narco-terrorism, conspiracy to commit narco-terrorism, drug trafficking, money laundering and corruption.",
      "Maduro and Flores appeared before U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein in a federal courthouse in lower Manhattan on Jan. 5.",
      "\"I'm innocent. I'm not guilty \u2014 I'm a decent man,\" Maduro said through an interpreter, insisting that he was \"still president of my country.\"",
      "Maduro has long been accused of human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings, torture and repression during his rule over the South American country. He kept his grip on power despite what the U.S. called \"overwhelming evidence\" that he lost reelection in 2024 to opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia.",
      "U.N. experts at the United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner have expressed concern over the U.S.'s unilateral action to abduct Maduro as a potential violation of international law.",
      "\"These actions represent a grave, manifest and deliberate violation of the most fundamental principles of international law, set a dangerous precedent, and risk destabilising the entire region and the world,\" the group said in a statement last week.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pentagon-stars-and-stripes-less-woke/",
    "published": "Fri, 16 Jan 2026 07:57:24 -0500",
    "summary": "The Pentagon says it's changing the independent military newspaper Stars and Stripes so it no longer includes \"woke distractions.\"",
    "story": [
      "The Pentagon said Thursday that it is changing the independent military newspaper Stars and Stripes so it concentrates on \"reporting for our warfighters\" and no longer includes \"woke distractions.\"",
      "That message, in a social media post from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's spokesman, is short on specifics and does not mention the news outlet's legacy of independence from government and military leadership.",
      "It comes a day after The Washington Post reported that applicants for jobs at Stars and Stripes were being asked what they would do to support President Trump's policies.",
      "Stars and Stripes traces its lineage to the Civil War and has reported news about the military either in its newspaper or online since World War II, largely to an audience of service members stationed overseas. Roughly half its budget comes from the Pentagon and its staff members are considered Defense Department employees.",
      "The outlet's mission statement emphasizes that it is \"editorially independent of interference from outside its own editorial chain-of-command\" and that it is unique among news organizations tied to the Defense Department in being \"governed by the principles of the First Amendment.\"",
      "Congress established that independence in the 1990s after instances of military leadership getting involved in editorial decisions. During Mr. Trump's first term in 2020, Defense Secretary Mark Esper tried to eliminate government funding for Stars and Stripes - to effectively shut it down - before he was overruled by the president.",
      "Hegseth's spokesman, Sean Parnell, said on X Thursday that, \"We are bringing Stars & Stripes into the 21st century. We will modernize its operations, refocus its content away from woke distractions that syphon morale, and adapt it to serve a new generation of service members.",
      "He said the Pentagon \"is returning Stars and Stripes to its original mission: reporting for our warfighters\" and will \"refocus its content away from woke distractions.\"",
      "\"Stars and Stripes will be custom tailored to our warfighters,\" Parnell wrote. \"It will focus on warfighting, weapons systems, fitness, lethality, survivability and ALL THINGS MILITARY. No more repurposed DC gossip columns; no more Associated Press reprints.\"",
      "He said the department is committed to ensuring the outlet's legacy of reporting news that's important to service members.",
      "Stars and Stripes' publisher, Max Lederer, did not immediately reply to a message seeking comment. But Jacqueline Smith, the outlet's ombudsman, called Parnell's statement a surprise. She said Stars and Stripes reports on matters important to service members and their families - not just weapons systems or war strategy - and she's detected nothing \"woke\" about its reporting.",
      "\"I think it's very important that Stars and Stripes maintains its editorial independence, which is the basis of its credibility,\" Smith said. A longtime newspaper editor in Connecticut, Smith serves in a role created by Congress three decades ago to ensure that independence, and she reports to the House Armed Services Committee.",
      "It's the latest move by the Trump administration to impose restrictions on journalists. Most reporters from legacy news outlets have left the Pentagon rather than to agree to new rules imposed by Hegseth that they feel would give him too much control over what they report and write. The New York Times has sued to overturn the regulations.",
      "Mr. Trump has also sought to shut down government-funded outlets like Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that report independent news about the world in nations overseas.",
      "Also this week, the administration raided the home of a Washington Post journalist as part of an investigation into a contractor accused of stealing government secrets, a move many journalists interpreted as a form of intimidation.",
      "The Post reported that applicants to Stars and Stripes were being asked how they would advance Mr. Trump's executive orders and policy priorities in the role. They were asked to identify one or two orders or initiatives that were significant to them. That raised questions about whether it was appropriate for a journalist to be given what is, in effect, a loyalty test.",
      "Smith said it was the government's Office of Personnel Management - not the newspaper - that was responsible for the question on job applications and said it was consistent with what was being asked of applicants for other government jobs.",

      "Others commission appointments include National Endowment for the Arts chairwoman Mary Anne Carter, conservative writer Roger Kimball and Matthew Taylor of Washington, D.C.",
      "The disclosure came as part of a lawsuit filed by the National Trust for Historic Preservation which is seeking to delay East Wing construction until the Commission of Fine Arts and the National Capital Planning Commission processes are completed \u2014 and Congress approves the project.",
      "Mr. Trump fired six sitting members of the Commission of Fine Arts in October.",
      "The court filings also shed light on the $400 million project's finances. The National Park Service accepted a donation on Nov. 13, the document said. The money most likely came from a nonprofit entity collecting donations for the ballroom.",
      "Those funds were then transferred to the Executive Residence at the White House (EXR), which is leading the project, according to Jessica Bowron, acting National Park Service director. The filing does not specify how much was transferred.",
      "\"NPS determined that it was in the best interests of the United States for EXR to contract for and directly manage the Project,\" Bowron told the court. \"EXR is therefore handling project management for the Project, meaning that it is in control of all aspects of the day-to-day execution of the Project, including its scope, schedule, budget, design, and completion.\"",
      "The filings lay out a more detailed timeline for ballroom approvals. The administration had planned to provide an informational briefing to the Commission of Fine Arts this week, but that presentation was delayed until next week. The White House is hoping to complete the CFA review process by March 19.",
      "White House officials are scheduled to meet with National Capital Planning Commission staffers this month and will file a final submission on Jan. 30, according to federal court records. The administration expects the NCPC to take a final vote on the project at its March 5 meeting.",
      "Final sign-off from both commissions typically takes months or even years for most projects.",

      "The outspoken three-time heavyweight champ mesmerized the world with his brash poetry and personality.

    "published": "Thu, 15 Jan 2026 23:26:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Machado previously said she wanted to \"share\" the prize for removing Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from power.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado presented President Trump with her real Nobel Peace Prize medallion during her visit to the White House on Thursday, two White House officials told CBS News, and later at the Capitol, Machado confirmed she had done so.",
      "The medallion, which was not a replica, the sources said, was presented after Machado offered to share her Nobel Prize with him for what she said was his \"historic\" action of removing former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from power.",
      "Mr. Trump confirmed that Machado gave him the medal in a Truth Social post, calling it a \"wonderful gesture of mutual respect.\" He called Machado a \"wonderful woman who has been through so much.\"",
      "The White House late Thursday night posted a photo of Mr. Trump and Machado posing with the Nobel.",
      "The medallion was placed inside a gilded frame that read, \"In Gratitude for Your Extraordinary Leadership in Promoting Peace through Strength, Advancing Diplomacy, and Defending Liberty and Prosperity.\"",
      "Below the medallion was a certificate that stated: \"Presented as a Personal Symbol of Gratitude on behalf of the Venezuelan People in Recognition of President Trump's Principled and Decisive Action to Secure a Free Venezuela. The Courage of America, and its President Donald J. Trump, will Never be Forgotten by the Venezuelan people.\"",
      "The certificate was signed by Machado.",
      "Machado told senators on Capitol Hill she had an \"extraordinary\" meeting with Mr. Trump, according to a\u00a0post\u00a0from her spokesperson's office translated into English.",
      "Machado told reporters on Capitol Hill that she had presented Mr. Trump with the medal, and she suggested that in doing so, she was completing a kind of reciprocal gesture.",
      "She said she told him, \"Two hundred years ago, General Lafayette gave Simon Bolivar a medal with George Washington's face [on] it. Bolivar...kept that medal for the rest of his life.\" She added, \"When you see his portraits, you can see the medal there, and it was given by General Lafayette as a sign of the brotherhood between the United States, people of United States, and the people of Venezuela in their fight for freedom against tyranny.\" Now, 200 years later, \"the people of Bolivar are giving back to the heir of Washington a medal \u2014 in this case, a medal of the Nobel Peace Prize \u2014 as a recognition of his unique commitment with our freedom.\"",
      "Machado had floated the possibility of sharing the prize with Mr. Trump earlier this month. The president has not divulged details of their conversation.",
      "\"I certainly would love to be able to personally tell him that we believe \u2014 the Venezuelan people, because this is a prize of the Venezuelan people \u2014 certainly want to, to give it to him and share it with him,\" Machado told Fox News host\u00a0Sean Hannity. \"What he has done is historic. It's a huge step towards a democratic transition.\"",
      "After Machado's offer to share the prize with the president, Norwegian Nobel Committee Chair J\u00f8rgen Watne Frydnes clarified it cannot be shared or transferred. The Nobel Peace Center also said Thursday, \"A medal can change owners, but the title of a Nobel Peace Prize laureate cannot.\"",
      "Machado was awarded the prize for being a \"key, unifying figure in a political opposition that was once deeply divided \u2014 an opposition that found common ground in the demand for free elections and representative government.\"",
      "The Trump administration has said little about a democratic transition in Venezuela. The country's interim president is Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, who was Maduro's vice president. Mr. Trump spoke Wednesday with Rodr\u00edguez, calling her a \"terrific person.\"",
      "In a statement Thursday night, Machado said she told Mr. Trump during their meeting that Venezuela \"is ready to move forward swiftly and responsibly toward a democratic transition and toward a long-term relationship between the United States and Venezuela\u2014one that is mutually beneficial and puts people at the center.\"",
      "She said the two had a \"calm and in-depth discussion\" about the challenges facing the Latin American country. She also said she spoke to Mr. Trump about Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia, the opposition leader who ran against Maduro in the disputed 2024 election, before fleeing the country. Machado was part of the coalition that supported Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia's candidacy.",
      "In her statement, she referred to Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia as the \"President-elect of Venezuela.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has not endorsed Machado to be Venezuela's next president, as some thought he might after Maduro's\u00a0arrest, despite the recognition she's received for her efforts to restore democracy to the struggling country. He has said he thinks it would be \"tough\" for Machado to lead Venezuela because \"she doesn't have the support within \u2014 or the respect within \u2014 the country.\"",
      "But Machado, asked in a recent\u00a0interview by \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil if she believes she is the right person to lead Venezuela in the first chapter of its post-Maduro future, said that \"the people of Venezuela have already chosen,\" adding that her coalition is \"ready and willing to serve our people, as we have been mandated.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday the president \"was looking forward to this meeting and he was expecting it to be a good and positive discussion with Miss Machado, who is really a remarkable and brave voice for many people of the people of Venezuela.\"",
      "As for the president's assessment that it would be hard for her to lead Venezuela because, in his words, she lacks the support, Leavitt said \"at this moment in time, his opinion on that matter has not changed.\"",
      "On Thursday morning, the Pentagon confirmed the seizure of yet another oil tanker in the Caribbean, at least the sixth such seizure of a tanker carrying Venezuelan oil.",
      "The U.S. officially began selling Venezuelan oil this week. The first U.S. sale of Venezuelan oil, valued at $500 million, has been completed, an administration official said Wednesday. Mr. Trump says the U.S. will be selling up to 50 million barrels of Venezuelan oil, if not more.",

      "But according to the Department of Homeland Security, the man who was shot, identified by the DHS as Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis, fled from federal officers, crashed into a parked car and then resisted arrest.",
      "According to DHS, two other men then came out of a nearby apartment and allegedly attacked one of the officers with a snow shovel and broom handle. Fearing for his life, DHS says, the ICE officer fired a defensive shot, hitting Sosa-Celis in the leg.",

      "To the U.S., the message has been to refrain from strikes on Iran, citing the region's security and economic vulnerabilities, while highlighting the risk that the U.S. could ultimately be affected as well.",

      "\"Madison Sheahan is a work horse, strong executor, and terrific leader who led the men and women of ICE to achieve the American people's mandate to target, arrest, and deport criminal illegal aliens,\" Noem added. \"We wish her all the best.\"",
      "While Sheahan and Noem have a longstanding relationship, her installation as the second-highest ranking official at ICE frustrated some agency officials, who noted the 28-year-old lacked significant law enforcement experience.",
      "Before coming to ICE, Sheahan was the secretary of the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries. Before that, she was an aide for Noem during her governorship in South Dakota.",
      "In a message to ICE employees posted on X shortly after this story was first published, Sheahan said she was proud of having \"strengthened\" ICE and \"restored its purpose.\"",
      "\"As I depart the agency, I want to say that it has been the honor of my life to serve my country with all of you,\" Sheahan wrote in her message. \"I want to thank President Trump and Secretary Noem for their leadership and for their steadfast commitment to our agency.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/doj-civil-rights-division-ice-shooting-renee-good/",
    "published": "Thu, 15 Jan 2026 17:16:39 -0500",
    "summary": "Though DOJ says there's \"no basis\" for criminal civil rights probe in ICE shooting case, some legal experts say the division's lack of involvement here is unheard of.",
    "story": [
      "In the week since the fatal shooting of Renee Good by a federal immigration agent, a dozen Justice Department prosecutors and career officials have left their positions \u2014 some of whom have expressed frustration over the department's handling of the case.",
      "Senior U.S. Justice Department leaders have ordered federal prosecutors who specialize in probing civil rights crimes not to pursue an investigation into Good's shooting death in Minneapolis last week.",
      "The sidelining of the Civil Rights Division's criminal section is highly unusual, and appears to break with the Justice Department's own manual, which calls for its involvement in cases that are designated as being in the \"national interest.\"",
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told CBS News in a statement that there's \"no basis\" for a criminal civil rights probe in this case.",
      "But numerous legal experts who spoke with CBS News disagreed, saying that the lack of involvement by the Civil Rights Division in a fatal officer-involved shooting like the one in Minneapolis is unheard of and deeply concerning.",
      "Six career officials in the Civil Rights Division's criminal section announced they will be departing, telling colleagues in a meeting that the handling of the shooting in Minneapolis marks the latest in a series of troubling actions to pull back on criminal civil rights enforcement in America by the department.",
      "At least six federal prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's office in Minnesota have also quit, after they were pressured to investigate the wife of Renee Good and to treat the case as an assault on a federal officer.",
      "What does the Civil Rights Division's Criminal Section do?",
      "The criminal section of the Civil Rights Division is one of the Justice Department's oldest offices, dating back to the post-Civil War Reconstruction Era.",
      "In addition to prosecuting hate crimes, the section also handles cases involving local, state or federal law enforcement misconduct, which can include the use of excessive force and sexual misconduct.",
      "The use of excessive force by a law enforcement officer is typically prosecuted under 18 USC 242, a statute which makes it a crime for anyone acting \"under color of law,\" such as a police officer, to willfully deprive a person of their constitutional rights.",
      "The law can be used to prosecute a variety of misconduct allegations, from physical or sexual abuse, to making false arrests or failing to protect people in custody from having their rights violated by others.",
      "A violation of the statute is a misdemeanor, though if prosecutors can prove certain aggravating factors such as kidnapping, sexual abuse or death, they can seek life in prison or even the death penalty.",
      "There is no statute of limitations on cases involving excessive force that lead to death. In theory, the next\u00a0administration could still pursue a federal color-under-law criminal case down the road, as long as the target has not received a presidential pardon.",
      "Cases in the national interest",
      "The Justice Department's Justice Manual calls for coordination between the assistant attorney general of the Civil Rights Division and the local U.S. Attorney's office in cases that are deemed to be in the \"national interest.\"",
      "As a general matter, cases deemed to be in the national interest may involve novel issues of law or have important public policy considerations.",
      "A case like the one in Minneapolis, however, would automatically be deemed to be a \"national interest\" case under the Justice Manual because it involves an alleged violation of federal criminal civil rights laws that resulted in death.",
      "In national interest cases, the assistant attorney general for Civil Rights is supposed to make staffing decisions, and can choose whether to pursue the case jointly with a U.S. Attorney's office or as a stand-alone Civil Rights Division case.",
      "The manual also requires the U.S. Attorney's office in the relevant district, the FBI and the Civil Rights Division to coordinate and consult before any public statements are made to the press.",
      "U.S. Attorneys' offices must obtain prior approval from the assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division before seeking an indictment on a civil rights case that is deemed to be in the national interest.",
      "Past cases involving use of force by law enforcement officer",
      "Most of the country's high-profile cases involving use of force by a law enforcement officer have involved the Civil Rights Division's criminal section.",
      "In Minnesota, the division prosecuted former Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin for violating George Floyd's rights, resulting in his death.",
      "The federal case was pursued in addition to state charges against Chauvin. He was convicted of murder in the state trial and pleaded guilty in the federal civil rights case.",
      "The division also pursued federal charges against the Louisville Police Department officers involved in the shooting death of Breonna Taylor, after they entered her apartment with a no-knock warrant. Former Kentucky police detective Brett Hankison was convicted of using excessive force in Taylor's death and sentenced to almost three years in prison. Another former Louisville officer, Kelly Goodlett, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy for helping obtain the warrant. Two other Louisville officers, former detective Joshua Jaynes and former Sgt. Kyle Meany, also face charges over Taylor's death. Jaynes and Meany are charged with federal civil rights offenses and obstruction of justice for their involvement in the preparing and authorizing of an affidavit for the search warrant that ultimately led to the shooting.",
      "In one notable case, the Civil Rights Division's criminal section investigated and declined to bring charges against a Ferguson, Missouri, police officer in the 2014 shooting death of Michael Brown.",

    "published": "Thu, 15 Jan 2026 17:06:03 -0500",
    "summary": "The legislation was unveiled after journalist Seth Harp shared a public biography that he said belonged to the commander of the Army's elite Delta Force unit.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A bipartisan bill seeks to make it a crime to publicly share identifying information about special operations forces with the intent of threatening, intimidating or inciting violence against them.",
      "Republican Sen. Ted Budd of North Carolina and Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire are introducing the bill, first shared with CBS News, in the upper chamber Thursday. The bill is titled the Special Operator Protection Act.",
      "The move comes after a journalist shared a photo and brief biography of a military officer who he said was the commander of the elite Army Delta Force, which carried out the operation earlier this month to capture former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Seth Harp, an Army veteran turned journalist who has been highly critical of special forces, said his X account was locked until he deleted certain posts.",
      "The legislation from Budd and Shaheen aims to protect special forces, other Department of Defense personnel who conduct sensitive missions, federal law enforcement officers who support special forces, as well as their immediate family members.",
      "It would prohibit publicly sharing identifying information of these service members, including their name, photo or image of their home in connection with their employer, birthdate, Social Security number, home address, phone numbers, personal email and biometric data.",
      "\"There is no compelling reason for their identities to be made public, especially given the significant risks from foreign threats,\" Budd said in a statement.",
      "Shaheen echoed the concern that they could be harmed by foreign adversaries, saying the bill \"would help shield those who put their lives on the line to advance America's national security.\"",
      "The penalties for violating the law would include fines and up to five years in prison. Death or serious injury to those whose information has been shared carries increased penalties, including up to life in prison.",
      "But the bill is also likely to raise questions about the ability of the press to report critically on military personnel.",
      "Harp has pushed back on allegations that he had \"doxxed\" the officer, saying in a lengthy statement that he had posted information that was publicly available online.",
      "\"I did not post any personally identifying information about him, such as his birthday, social security number, home address, phone number, email address, the names of his family members or pictures of his house,\" he said on Jan. 5.",
      "At that time, he said the information he posted was still available online \"for all the world to see.\" In defense of sharing the information, he said every \"civilian official and military officer in the American chain of command\" involved in the operation \"is the legitimate subject of journalistic scrutiny.\"",
      "He told CBS News on Thursday, \"This law, if passed, would never survive judicial review. How can you criminalize naming high ranking military officials whose names are already publicly known, such as the commander of the Joint Special Operations Command, or the Delta Force commander? Every officer at or above the rank of colonel has to be confirmed by Congress. It's nonsensical to make it a crime to name them when they're already public figures, named in the Congressional Record.\"",
      "Last week, the House Oversight Committee adopted by voice vote a motion to subpoena Harp. Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida accused the journalist of putting the Delta Force commander and his family at risk and called for a criminal investigation into what she described as \"leaking classified information.\" A spokesperson for the House Oversight Committee told CBS News on Thursday that Harp has not been subpoenaed at this time.",
      "In a letter to the Justice Department referring Harp for criminal prosecution, Luna said the incident \"raises serious concerns\" for U.S. national security.",
      "\"The gravity of such conduct is magnified by the foreseeable consequences, including the endangerment of U.S. personnel and, in this specific case, his family who have endured harassment and danger to their safety,\" the Jan. 7 letter said.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson confirmed to CBS News that it had received Luna's referral and said it \"takes protecting the safety and security of our military personnel extremely seriously.\" Harp told CBS News the Justice Department has not reached out to him.",
      "Harp has maintained that the commander's identity is not classified. The identities of Delta Force commanders are not generally public.",
      "\"The identity of the Delta Force commander is not classified, so this entire discussion is premised on Rep. Luna's misunderstanding of the military and the law,\" Harp told CBS News.",
      "Press freedom advocates defended Harp in\u00a0a letter to House leaders earlier this week. They said the subpoena \"poses a grave danger to the First Amendment's guarantee of press freedom.\"",
      "\"The public identities of public officials with command responsibility over controversial political or military decisions are a matter of public concern and are not (or cannot properly be) classified, especially with respect to a past operation,\" they said, adding that \"journalists have a right under the First Amendment to publish even classified information.\"",
      "GOP Reps. Richard Hudson and Pat Harrigan of North Carolina are introducing a companion bill in the House.",
      "\"The Special Operator Protection Act closes a clear gap in the law and makes one thing clear: if you recklessly expose our nation's heroes, there will be consequences,\" Hudson said in a statement.",
      "Hudson's district includes Fort Bragg, home to several special operations forces and the topic of Harp's book, The Fort Bragg Cartel.",
      "Harrigan, who was a member of the special forces, said the legislation \"closes a real hole in the law and makes sure our Special Operations Forces aren't left exposed after carrying out some of the most dangerous missions this country asks anyone to do.\"",
      "Editor's note: An earlier version of this article said that journalist Seth Harp had said that every American involved in the Venezuela operation \"is the legitimate subject of journalistic scrutiny,\" but in his post, he had written that every \"civilian official and military officer in the American chain of command\" involved in the operation \"is the legitimate subject of journalistic scrutiny.\" The article has been updated.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/senators-aca-premium-tax-credits-extension-bipartisan-deal-stalled/",
    "published": "Thu, 15 Jan 2026 16:30:20 -0500",
    "summary": "\"We are in a little bit of a pothole,\" said GOP Sen. Bernie Moreno, who previously expected the compromise to be unveiled this week.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Republican senators said Thursday that a long-sought bipartisan compromise to extend the expired Affordable Care Act's enhanced premium tax credits for two years has stalled.",
      "\"We are in a little bit of a pothole,\" GOP Sen. Bernie Moreno of Ohio said, blaming Democratic leaders for the lack of movement on the issue. \"So for me, I'm going to take a pause until I hear affirmative statements from the Democrat leader and his leadership team that they are willing to contemplate a deal that extends these enhanced premium tax credits with the reforms that we've outlined.\"",
      "Moreno previously had expected the compromise to be unveiled sometime this week.",
      "He said the proposal that has been discussed would extend the Affordable Care Act's open enrollment period until March 1. The federal deadline to enroll for coverage this year ends Thursday, though some state-run marketplaces have different cutoff dates. More than 20 million Americans rely on the ACA subsidies to help them pay their health insurance premiums.",
      "The bipartisan proposal would also impose an income eligibility cap at 700% of the federal poverty level, and get rid of zero-premium plans by requiring enrollees to pay a minimum premium of $5 per month or $60 per year. To crack down on fraudulent enrollments, insurance companies would face a $100,000 fine if someone is signed up without their consent.",
      "In the second year, the plan would give individuals an option to choose a lower-tier plan and receive the funds in a health savings account, instead of the money going directly to insurance companies.",
      "\"Until I hear affirmative statements from the Democrat leader that he is going to encourage his conference to vote for that, there's really no reason why we should spend any more time or effort on this,\" Moreno said.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said Moreno \"is trying to distract from the reality.\"",
      "\"The credits expired and Americans are paying thousands more because Republicans can't get their act together,\" Schumer said.",
      "The Hyde amendment, which prohibits federal funding for abortion, remains a point of contention. Some Republicans want additional Hyde amendment language to be included the health care bill to ensure it applies to coverage in state-run exchanges. President Trump recently encouraged GOP lawmakers to be \"flexible\" on the issue. Any abortion restrictions could be a nonstarter for Democrats, where their votes are needed in the Senate for passage.",
      "\"We got hung up on what everybody knew the Republicans would get hung up on \u2014 that was the Hyde language. And so there's been kind of a pause right now,\" GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said Thursday. \"Then, we've all known that in order to be able to advance something, we're going to have to have buy-in from the White House.\"",
      "The subsidies were at the center of the government shutdown fight last year, when Democrats refused for weeks to vote to fund the government without an extension of the tax credits. A group of Democrats eventually broke with their party to end the stalemate and reopen the government after securing an agreement for a vote on extending the tax credits. But the GOP-led Senate rejected Democrats' attempt to pass a three-year extension without any reforms.",
      "Lawmakers have long been pursuing a bipartisan compromise to address rising health care costs. The effort was bolstered last week when 17 Republicans helped propel Democrats' plan to revive the subsidies in the House. Though it has no chance of clearing the Senate, some lawmakers said it would serve as a vehicle for the forthcoming compromise.",
      "\"The Senate needs a vehicle, because this is a tax bill and it has to originate in the House,\" Rep. Mike Lawler of New York, one of the Republicans who voted for the Democratic measure, said last week. \"The three-year discharge is that vehicle. We all know the three-year [bill] is not going to become law. It failed in the Senate already.\"",
      "So far, Democratic leaders have not endorsed the plan to emerge from the Senate. Last week, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said they were focused on the three-year extension, but would consider any \"good faith\" effort from Republicans that provides a \"meaningful extension\" of the subsidies.",
      "On Monday, Jeffries again called on the Senate to vote on the three-year extension.",
      "\"The only path forward at this moment is for Senate Republicans to do the right thing by the American people and pass the damn bill that we sent over to you,\" he told reporters at a news conference.",

    "summary": "President Trump is threatening to invoke a centuries-old law to deploy troops to Minnesota. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Thursday he might invoke a centuries-old law known as the Insurrection Act to send troops into Minnesota, threatening a major escalation between the federal government and state officials.",
      "\"If the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don't obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E., who are only trying to do their job, I will institute the INSURRECTION ACT, which many Presidents have done before me, and quickly put an end to the travesty that is taking place in that once great State,\" the president wrote on Truth Social.",
      "Mr. Trump's threat comes amid protests over the deadly shooting of Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer and increased tensions over immigration operations in the Twin Cities. The administration has sent thousands of federal law enforcement agents to the state in recent weeks to investigate fraud and implement the latest phase of its immigration crackdown.",
      "The invocation of the Insurrection Act could clear the way for the Trump administration to deploy troops to the state over the objections of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz and local officials. Here's what to know about the law:",
      "What is the Insurrection Act?",
      "The Insurrection Act has its roots in the 1790s and evolved over the decades, with the last substantive amendment coming in 1874. The law as written gives the president broad authority to deploy troops and enlist state militias to address unrest on U.S. soil, largely at his own discretion.",
      "The statute has three main sections:",
      "The first says the president can deploy troops or militias if requested by a state to suppress an insurrection.\u00a0The second authorizes the president to send in forces unilaterally whenever he determines that \"unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion against the authority of the United States, make it impracticable to enforce the laws of the United States.\" He can deploy the troops \"as he considers necessary to enforce those laws or to suppress the rebellion.\"\u00a0The third section says the president can use the military to stop an insurrection or conspiracy that obstructs federal law or violates constitutional rights when states fail to protect them.",
      "The first says the president can deploy troops or militias if requested by a state to suppress an insurrection.",
      "The second authorizes the president to send in forces unilaterally whenever he determines that \"unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion against the authority of the United States, make it impracticable to enforce the laws of the United States.\" He can deploy the troops \"as he considers necessary to enforce those laws or to suppress the rebellion.\"",
      "The third section says the president can use the military to stop an insurrection or conspiracy that obstructs federal law or violates constitutional rights when states fail to protect them.",
      "\"The basic idea, which emerged early on in the United States, is that there might be circumstances when state and local law enforcement resources and state and local militia, now the National Guard, would not be able to adequately contain protests or disturbances on the ground in their communities,\" said William Banks, a professor emeritus at Syracuse University and expert on the domestic role of the military. \"So the Insurrection Act allows the president to call forth the regular military or other federal forces to come into state or local communities and engage in law enforcement in an emergency circumstance.\"",
      "When can the Insurrection Act be used?",
      "The law leaves it up to the president to determine when it should be invoked.",
      "Joseph Nunn, a counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice who has studied the statute extensively, said the act has historically been a \"tool for emergency situations when civilian authorities are overwhelmed by some sudden crisis \u2014 an insurrection, mass civil unrest.\"",
      "The law gives the president wide latitude to determine when an insurrection exists and how long troops can be used to address it. But \"broad discretion is not the same thing as infinite discretion, and broad discretion can be abused,\" Nunn said.",
      "\"The Insurrection Act was written to apply when all hell breaks loose. And when all hell breaks loose, of course, is in the eye of the beholder,\" Banks said. He noted that the basis for triggering the act \"is incredibly open-ended\" and the statute \"basically says the president can do this whenever he determines that it's impractical to enforce the laws.\"",
      "\"There are no procedural requirements, like a consultation with state and local officials, reports to Congress, sunsets \u2014 you know, do it for 30 days or 60 days, but then you've got to get out unless Congress renews it by statute, something like that,\" Banks said. \"It's just open-ended. The president does it. He does it on his own say so, and he doesn't have any particular criteria to follow.\"",
      "An 1878 law known as the Posse Comitatus Act generally forbids the use of the military for law enforcement purposes. But the Insurrection Act is the law's \"most important exception,\" said Nunn, and its invocation means the Posse Comitatus Act does not apply.",
      "When has the Insurrection Act been invoked?",
      "The Insurrection Act and its predecessor have been used to address 30 crises over the years, according to a tally by the Brennan Center. It was invoked most recently in 1992, when President George H.W. Bush ordered troops deployed to California to suppress the L.A. riots at the request of the state's governor.",
      "The law has typically been invoked when states request assistance from the federal government. Presidents have invoked the act unilaterally only five times in the past 130 years, all during the Civil Rights Era, according to Nunn.",
      "In 1957, President Dwight D. Eisenhower federalized the Arkansas National Guard and sent in the 101st Airborne Division to Little Rock to enforce desegregation. Kennedy invoked the Insurrection Act three times over the objections of state officials, once in Mississippi and twice in Alabama. Johnson also used the law unilaterally in Alabama in 1965.",
      "\"The idea is that it should rarely, if ever, be invoked, and indeed, in our history, it hasn't been utilized very often,\" Banks said.",
      "Has Trump used the Insurrection Act before?",
      "No, but he has threatened to.",
      "In 2020, Mr. Trump entertained the possibility of invoking the Insurrection Act to deploy troops to cities across the U.S. in response to widespread racial unrest following the killing of George Floyd.",
      "\"If a city or a state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them,\" he said in a speech at the White House in June 2020. He ultimately decided against doing so, with reports at the time indicating that administration officials were split over deploying troops.",
      "Mr. Trump has also floated the use of the act since returning to the White House last year. In October, he told reporters that \"if I want to enact a certain act, I'm allowed to do it routinely,\" an apparent reference to the law.",
      "\"And I'd be allowed to do whatever I want,\" Mr. Trump added. \"But we haven't chosen to do that because \u2026 we're doing very well without it. But I'd be allowed to do that, you understand that, and the courts wouldn't get involved, nobody would get involved, and I could send the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, I can send anybody I wanted. But I haven't done that because we're doing so well without it.\"",
      "Hasn't Trump sent troops into other cities?",
      "Yes, but he hasn't used the Insurrection Act to do so, and a recent Supreme Court decision limited his ability to send in troops under a separate authority.",
      "Last year, Mr. Trump ordered the deployment of National Guard troops to cities in California, Illinois, Tennessee and Oregon, as well as Washington, D.C., under an authority known as Title 10, the portion of the federal code that deals with the armed forces. The administration argued the troops were needed to support immigration agents and protect federal property.",
      "Several cities and states where officials objected to the troops being deployed filed lawsuits seeking to block them. In one case, the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago sought an order barring the government from mobilizing and sending troops to the Chicago area, arguing Mr. Trump's federalization and deployment of the Illinois National Guard was illegal. A district judge agreed and blocked the administration's plans.",
      "The dispute made its way to the Supreme Court. In December, the justices declined to freeze the lower court order in a narrow, preliminary 6-3 decision. A week later, Mr. Trump said the National Guard was leaving Chicago, Los Angeles and Portland.",
      "\"I think the Supreme Court ruling certainly makes it more likely that they will try to use the Insurrection Act,\" Nunn said, while noting that the justices did not decide the case on the merits.",
      "Why is Trump threatening to invoke the Insurrection Act in Minnesota?",
      "The president said in his Truth Social post that he might invoke the law to protect the 3,000 ICE agents and other federal officers who have been sent to Minnesota in recent weeks as part of the administration's immigration crackdown and fraud investigations.",
      "The administration has targeted Minnesota on a number of fronts in recent weeks amid renewed scrutiny over massive fraud schemes that have been uncovered in the state over the past several years. The president and other administration officials have pinned the blame for the scandal on Walz, the governor and Democratic nominee for vice president in 2024. The increased immigration operations in Minnesota are taking place alongside a surge in federal resources aimed at investigating fraud.",
      "Local officials have said the federal agents are responsible for inflaming tensions on the ground, pointing to the heavy-handed tactics of ICE agents and the deadly shooting of Good last week. Administration officials have said the agent was acting in self-defense and that protesters and activists are obstructing federal law enforcement.",
      "Invoking the Insurrection Act would let the president deploy National Guard or active-duty troops to Minnesota to protect immigration agents and federal buildings. Using the act would, in theory, place the deployments on firmer legal ground than previous deployments.",
      "But Nunn, the Brennan Center scholar, said the events in Minnesota do not warrant invoking the act.",
      "\"Basically, it exists for a kind of narrow set of crisis situations, and none of the criteria that would justify an invocation of the Insurrection Act are present in Minnesota,\" Nunn said. \"What exactly is the insurrection? There is no insurrection. Are the insurrectionists the people of Minneapolis? Who exactly is being protected?\"",
      "Nunn said that it's \"hard to say how much unrest there actually is.\"",
      "\"But to the extent that there is any, it's largely being fomented by the lawlessness and violence of ICE and [Customs and Border Protection]. And to the extent that there is violence, it is primarily being perpetrated by ICE and CBP,\" he said. \"And the government can't go to an American city and foment unrest through lawless, violent conduct and then turn around and invoke the Insurrection Act, claiming that they need to do this to suppress that unrest.\"",
      "Could a court block Trump's invocation of the Insurrection Act?",
      "Yes, but a legal fight would take place in largely uncharted territory, according to Nunn. A president's invocation of the Insurrection Act has never been blocked by a court.",
      "\"There's very little case law on this subject,\" Nunn said. \"One, the Insurrection Act simply isn't invoked very often. It's a tool that's used very rarely. Two, it has never been flagrantly abused in this way. There have been invocations of the Insurrection Act that I would say weren't perfectly justified, weren't obviously necessary, but it has never been outright abused.\"",
      "Nunn said that \"no state has ever challenged an invocation of the Insurrection Act and there's only ever been one case where anyone\" has, a Supreme Court case known as Martin v. Mott in 1827. That decision found that the president has broad emergency powers, but Nunn said the particulars of the case mean it might not \"reflect a general rule.\"",
      "\"The available judicial precedent, which is very limited, suggests that there's a fairly narrow set of circumstances where using the Insurrection Act is appropriate,\" Nunn said. \"Your argument would almost certainly be that the president has exceeded the scope of his discretion with the statute, that he's using it for a situation that Congress did not intend to authorize.\"",
      "If a legal challenge made its way to the Supreme Court, Nunn said the justices' Title 10 ruling might give a hint of how they would decide.",
      "\"One of the messages that should be taken from the Supreme Court's ruling in December is that at least six justices are uncomfortable with the way that the Trump administration has been using the military domestically, and were uncomfortable with those deployments, which makes sense, because the Trump administration has been seeking to insert the military into civilian law enforcement on a scale that has no precedent in modern American history, and that runs afoul of the law in a variety of ways,\" he said. \"So it makes sense that the justices, the Supreme Court, would be uncomfortable.\"",

      "The 15% would be a slightly lower rate than the 20% rate imposed under President Trump's so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" for most imports from Taiwan. The Department of Commerce announced the agreement Thursday, saying Taiwanese semiconductor and tech companies will make new investments totaling at least $250 billion to promote energy, AI and innovation in the U.S., and Taiwan will offer credit guarantees of at least $250 billion to expand the chip supply chain in the U.S. The Trump administration sees semiconductor chips as a critical component to future innovation, and to competing with China.",

    "summary": "The ICE agent involved in the fatal shooting could try to invoke immunity under the Constitution's Supremacy Clause to try to end state criminal prosecution.",
    "story": [
      "The fatal shooting of Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis last week sets up a potential legal showdown between the state and federal government.",
      "If the state were to indict the ICE agent, Jonathan Ross, on criminal charges, he could try to claim a form of immunity conferred by the Constitution. Vice President JD Vance raised this the day after the shooting, asserting that the officer was immune from prosecution because he's a federal agent.",
      "\"That guy is protected by absolute immunity. He was doing his job,\" Vance said. The Department of Homeland Security alleged that Good weaponized her vehicle, and said the officer acted in self-defense. However, local officials pointed to video of the shooting and raised doubts.",
      "The FBI and Justice Department are leading the investigation into the shooting after the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension withdrew from the federal probe, saying it didn't have \"complete access\" to the case evidence.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Minnesota officials \"don't have any jurisdiction in this investigation.\"",
      "But Carolyn Shapiro, a law professor and co-director of the Institute on the Supreme Court of the United States at Chicago-Kent College of Law, told CBS News it's \"simply false\" that the state lacks jurisdiction.",
      "Shapiro, who previously served as Illinois' solicitor general, said Minnesota has the authority to investigate and prosecute crimes committed in the state.",
      "But any attempt to bring state criminal charges over Good's death is likely to face legal obstacles arising from a claim of immunity under the Constitution's Supremacy Clause.",
      "What is Supremacy Clause immunity?",
      "The Supremacy Clause, in Article VI of the Constitution, establishes federal law as supreme, superseding state law. It limits the ability of states to interfere with federal law through criminal prosecution. States may hold federal officials accountable for violating state law, unless state law conflicts with federal law; if there is a conflict, federal law prevails. But if state prosecutors have evidence federal officials acted in ways not related to their job duties or work policies, then state law prevails.",
      "Federal officials may be prosecuted if they \"acted beyond the scope of their duties, violated federal law, or behaved in an egregious or unwarranted manner,\" Bryna Godar, an attorney at the State Democracy Research Institute at the University of Wisconsin Law School, wrote in a brief explainer.",
      "The state is independently gathering its own evidence in the Good case. Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty's office has set up an evidence portal that has received a \"substantial\" number of submissions, she said in an interview Monday with CBS Minnesota.",
      "Moriarty also said after the FBI took over sole authority of the investigation that her office has jurisdiction to review evidence and make a decision about charges because the shooting happened in Hennepin County.",
      "If a state prosecutor obtains an indictment or files criminal charges against a federal officer, the officer has the right to have any potential state charges in the case heard in federal court. It's at this point the officer might invoke immunity under the Supremacy Clause, says Robert McNamara, deputy litigation director for the Institute for Justice, a public interest law firm that litigates \"to end widespread abuse of government powers.\"",
      "How could the Supremacy Clause immunity be used?",
      "If charges were filed, Ross would likely appear before a federal judge and assert that he was invoking the doctrine, and that the actions he took in shooting Good were reasonable and necessary to fulfill his federal duties \u2014\u00a0 a separate question from whether the shooting constituted a crime.",
      "\"That's the doctrine that's going to be at the center of the fight,\" McNamara said.",
      "The federal government would not be a party in this fight. The immunity battle would be waged between the agent, in this case Ross, and the state of Minnesota,\u00a0 although the feds could provide support by hiring a defense attorney or filing an amicus brief.",
      "The court would have to answer two questions at that point, Seth W. Stoughton, a law professor at South Carolina School of Law, explained in an email to CBS News. First, was Ross acting within the scope of his duties, authorized by federal law?\u00a0 Second, was he performing his duties in a \"necessary and proper\" way?\"",
      "If the court determined the answer was \"yes\" to these questions, Ross could be granted immunity from the state prosecution, Stoughton said.",
      "The case could then be dismissed.",
      "If, however, the judge allowed the prosecution to proceed, it would remain in federal court with state laws applied.",
      "Federal courts \"have permitted state authorities to prosecute federal officers for using deadly force when they conclude that the force could have been unreasonable or excessive,\" Stoughon said.",
      "He cited a case from the early 1990s when an FBI sniper killed an unarmed woman during the standoff near Ruby Ridge. Idaho prosecutors charged the agent with involuntary manslaughter, and a federal court allowed it to proceed. (The case was later dropped by state prosecutors.)",
      "States have criminally prosecuted federal officials since the early 1880s, with mixed results. Experts say Supremacy Clause immunity is a complex legal process most often used during times of heightened tensions between the states and the federal government.",
      "If Ross was eventually convicted on state charges, he could not be pardoned by President Trump, Shapiro noted. The president has the power to pardon people only for federal offenses, not for state crimes.",

      "An Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot a man Wednesday night in north Minneapolis after allegedly being attacked by men with shovels during an arrest operation, three U.S. officials told CBS News.",
      "One of the men, a Venezuelan migrant, was shot in the leg but is expected to be OK. The officer was hospitalized and the extent of their injuries is unclear.",
      "A large crowd quickly formed at the scene, with demonstrators clashing with law enforcement into the early morning hours.",
      "The shooting came exactly one week after\u00a0ICE officer Jonathan Ross fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Good\u00a0in south Minneapolis.",
      "Early Thursday morning, President Trump took to his Truth Social platform to say Operation Metro Surge will continue following the decision Wednesday by federal Judge Kate Menendez to deny Minnesota and Twin Cities prosecutors a temporary restraining order against ICE.",
      "\"A highly respected judge declined to block I.C.E. operations in the very politically corrupt State of Minnesota. I.C.E. will therefore be allowed to continue its highly successful operation of removing some of the most violent and vicious criminals anywhere in the World, many of them murderers, from the State. The great patriots of Law Enforcement will continue to make our Country safe. RECORD LOW CRIME NUMBERS!!!\" Trump wrote.",
      "Thursday morning, Mr. Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, which would allow him to deploy troops to Minneapolis. He has repeatedly threatened to invoke the rarely used federal law to deploy the U.S. military or federalize the National Guard for domestic law enforcement, over the objections of state governors.",
      "Walz on social media on Thursday made a \"direct appeal\" to the president.",
      "\"Let's turn the temperature down. Stop this campaign of retribution. This is not who we are,\" Walz wrote.",
      "Walz's statement also included \"an appeal to Minnesotans.\"",
      "\"I know this is scary,\" he wrote. \"We can \u2014 we must \u2014 speak out loudly, urgently, but also peacefully. We cannot fan the flames of chaos. That's what he wants.\"",
      "Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Police Chief Brian O'Hara held a joint news conference late Wednesday night in which Frey also called for peace. O'Hara said his officers were struck by rocks, fireworks, ice chunks and snowballs. The chief said protesters crossed the line, and mutual aid from the Minnesota State Patrol and the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office was called in.",
      "\"This is already a very tense situation, and we do not need this to escalate any further,\" O'Hara said. \"I have faith that the investigators who are involved will follow every lead in this case and ensure it is completed to its logical conclusion.\"",
      "Frey once again called for ICE to leave Minneapolis.",
      "\"There's still a lot that we don't know at this time, but what I can tell you for certain is that this is not sustainable. This is an impossible situation that our city is presently being put in, and at the same time, we are trying to find a way forward to keep people safe, to protect our neighbors, to maintain order,\" Frey said.",
      "The mayor noted the stark contrast between the number of Minneapolis police officers and the thousands of federal agents now in the area.",
      "\"We have approximately 600 police officers in Minneapolis ... and there are approximately 3,000 ICE agents in the area,\" Frey said. \"We have ICE agents throughout our city and throughout our state who, along with Border Patrol, are creating chaos. This is not the path we should be on in America.\"",
      "Frey then took to social media late Wednesday night, saying, \"We cannot respond to Donald Trump's chaos with our own chaos.\"",
      "The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension announced on social media overnight it is investigating the shooting, and that it will be an independent investigation. O'Hara said the FBI was also on the scene collecting evidence.",
      "WCCO has also heard reports of protesters breaking into federal vehicles at the scene, and have reached out to police for more information.",
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche released a statement Wednesday night accusing Walz and Frey of stoking the violence.",
      "\"Minnesota insurrection is a direct result of a FAILED governor and a TERRIBLE mayor encouraging violence against law enforcement. It's disgusting,\" Blanche said. \"Walz and Frey \u2014 I'm focused on stopping YOU from your terrorism by whatever means necessary. This is not a threat. It's a promise.\"",
      "Details of the shooting",
      "According to law enforcement officials briefed on the incident, the shooting occurred around 7 p.m. during a targeted ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) action near North Sixth Street and North 24th Avenue.",
      "Officials say one man armed with a shovel \u2014 described as an \"illegal alien\" from Venezuela and the primary target of the operation \u2014 assaulted an ICE officer, striking the officer with the shovel and attempting to hit the agent's head. An ICE ERO agent then opened fire, striking the man in the leg.",
      "After being shot, the man fled into a residence. Law enforcement officials say they later determined the house contained three additional targets. All four individuals barricaded themselves inside the home.",
      "Due to the barricade situation, additional agents were called to the scene, officials said. Officers breached the house with the assistance of an ICE specialized tactical team. Officials believe all individuals inside the home were taken into custody.",
      "Homeland Security officials said in a statement the Venezuelan national initially fled law enforcement in a vehicle but soon crashed into a parked car before fleeing on foot.",
      "DHS issued a statement Wednesday evening saying the officer was assaulted by the man as he resisted arrest, and while they were on the ground struggling, \"two subjects came out of a nearby apartment and also attacked the law enforcement officer with a snow shovel and broom handle.\"",
      "\"Fearing for his life and safety as he was being ambushed by three individuals, the officer fired defensive shots to defend his life,\" DHS officials said.",
      "Less than a hour before the shooting, Walz gave a rare primetime address\u00a0in which he called on Mr. Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to \"end this occupation.\" The governor also called on Minnesotans to film the actions of federal agents for use in future prosecutions.",
      "Late Wednesday night, Walz said on social media, \"State investigators have been on the scene in North Minneapolis.   I know you're angry. I'm angry. What Donald Trump wants is violence in the streets.   But Minnesota will remain an island of decency, of justice, of community, and of peace.   Don't give him what he wants.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Thursday announced the \"The Great Healthcare Plan,\" his long-awaited health care proposal, and asked Congress to act.",
      "The outline released by the White House, however, is sparse on details. especially considering the president said as far back as his first term in office that he would be releasing a health care plan, giving him and his team years to develop a comprehensive proposal. The outline the White House released Thursday mentioned some of the things the administration has already been working on in recent months, like negotiating with pharmaceutical companies to lower individual drug prices.",
      "The White House says the proposal would \"execute the president's vision to send money directly to the American people, lower health insurance premiums, and cut kickbacks that raise insurance premiums.\"",
      "The president said part of his proposal, which would have to be passed by Congress, would have the federal government send money directly to Americans to buy their own health care.",
      "\"The government is going to pay the money directly to you. It goes to you, and then you take the money and buy your own health care,\" the president said in a five-minute video the White House released. \"Nobody has ever heard of that before, and that's the way it is.\"",
      "The White House hasn't gone into detail about how the plan would work, although White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the money could go into health savings accounts.",
      "\"My plan would reduce your insurance premiums by stopping government payoffs to big insurance companies and sending that money directly to the people,\" the president also said. \"Obamacare was designed to make insurance companies rich.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said his proposal would also require any hospital to \"prominently post all prices of their place of business so that you are never surprised, and you can easily shop for a better deal or better care.\"",
      "The president's proposal comes as the Senate is poised to vote on extending subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. In a rare bipartisan display, the House last week\u00a0passed a three-year extension of the ACA's enhanced premium subsidies, which expired at the beginning of the year.",
      "The expiration of those subsidies meant sharp price increases for millions of Americans, and federal data shows about 14 million fewer people enrolled in ACA plans compared to last year.",

    "summary": "The Dinosaur National Monument, which is located on the border between Colorado and Utah, was last excavated in 1924.",
    "story": [
      "New dinosaur fossils were discovered at the Dinosaur National Monument, leading to the first excavation there in more than 100 years, officials revealed Friday.",
      "The National Park Service said that parking lot construction was underway in September near the Quarry Exhibit Hall in the Utah side of the park when the dinosaur fossils were uncovered. Dinosaur National Monument is located on the border between Colorado and Utah, about 300 miles west of Denver.",
      "A portion of dinosaur-bearing sandstone was exposed when asphalt was removed on Sept. 16 by workers. Construction was immediately paused to allow paleontologists to assess and excavate the fossils.",
      "\"The fossils belong to a large, long-necked dinosaur, most like Diplodocus, which is common in this bonebed,\" the NPS said in a statement.",
      "Approximately 3,000 pounds of fossils and rock were removed during the excavation between mid-September and mid-October, the NPS said. The fossils are being cleaned and studied at the Utah Field House of Natural History State Park Museum in Vernal, Utah.",
      "According to NPS, the bonebed area had not been excavated for fossils since the original excavations at the site ended in 1924. Meanwhile, the parking lot and road improvement construction project was completed once the excavation was done.",
      "Research released last October suggests that dinosaur populations were still thriving in North America before an asteroid smacked the Earth 66 million years ago.",
      "In January 2025, a nearly\u00a070-million-year-old dinosaur fossil was discovered during a parking lot project at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science. It is the oldest dinosaur fossil ever found within Denver's city limits.",

    "summary": "Depending on the timing, NASA could launch a fresh crew to the space station while four other astronauts are flying around the moon.",
    "story": [
      "With a space station medical evacuation safely completed, NASA is focused on two challenging missions proceeding in parallel: launching four astronauts on a flight around the moon, at the same time as the agency is planning to send four replacement astronauts to the International Space Station.",
      "Engineers plan to haul the Artemis 2 moon rocket to launch pad 39B at the Kennedy Space Center on Saturday for tests leading to launch early next month on a historic piloted flight around the moon.",
      "At the same time, NASA is gearing up to launch four Crew 12 astronauts to the space station, possibly while the Artemis 2 moon mission is underway, to replace four Crew 11 crew members who cut their mission short and returned to Earth ahead of schedule Thursday because of a medical issue.",
      "The Artemis 2 mission and Crew 12's planned space station flight present a unique challenge for NASA. The agency has not managed two piloted spacecraft at the same time since a pair of two-man Gemini capsules tested rendezvous procedures in low-Earth orbit in 1965. The agency has never flown a deep space mission amid another launch to Earth orbit.",
      "\"This is exactly what we should be doing at NASA,\" Jared Isaacman, NASA's new administrator, said Thursday. \"We have the means as an agency ... to be able to bring our astronauts home at any time ... while making preparations to pull forward our next mission, like Crew 12, while also progressing on our Artemis 2 campaign.\"",
      "He described the moon mission as \"probably one of the most important human spaceflight missions in the last half century.\"",
      "The world's most powerful rocket booster",
      "NASA's towering 322-foot-tall Space Launch System rocket, the most powerful operational booster in the world, will be hauled out of the cavernous Vehicle Assembly Building early Saturday atop an upgraded Apollo-era crawler transporter. Including at least one stop along the way, the 4-mile move to the pad is expected to take eight to 10 hours.",
      "\"It takes us a little while to get out of the building,\" said Launch Director Charlie Blackwell-Thompson. \"But about an hour after we get that first motion, you'll begin to see that beautiful vehicle cross over the threshold of the VAB and come outside for the world to have a look.\"",
      "Once at the pad, engineers will carry out a variety of tests and work to ready the rocket and its Orion crew capsule for blastoff early next month on the Artemis 2 moon mission.",
      "\"It really doesn't get much better than this,\" John Honeycutt, chairman of the Artemis 2 Mission Management Team, told reporters Friday. \"We're making history.\"",
      "Commander Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch and Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen planned to be on hand for the rollout. If all goes well, the crew will test the Orion capsule in Earth orbit before heading into deep space, flying farther from home than any other humans as they loop around the far side of the moon.",
      "Artemis 2 mission plan",
      "The Artemis 2 mission follows a similar flight in 2022 that sent an unpiloted Orion capsule around the moon to pave the way for next month's flight. The Artemis 2 mission, in turn, will set the stage for Artemis 3, a long-awaited and oft-delayed mission to land astronauts near the moon's south pole. The current target date for Artemis 3 is 2028.",
      "Despite Saturday's planned rollout, the Artemis 2 launch date is still uncertain.",
      "It will depend in large part on the results of a fueling test around the first of the month when engineers plan to load the booster's 21-story-tall first stage with 733,000 gallons of super-cold liquid hydrogen and oxygen along with a full load of propellants for the booster's 45-foot-tall second stage, the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage, or ICPS.",
      "During tests of the SLS rocket used for the Artemis 1 mission in 2022, multiple fueling tests had to be carried out before engineers finally resolved a series of propellant leaks. The SLS rolling out on Saturday features multiple upgrades and improvements to minimize or eliminate any such leakage.",
      "If the upcoming fueling test goes well, Wiseman and his crewmates could be cleared to blast off a few days before Feb. 11, the end of next month's launch period. If any major problems are found during the propellant loading exercise, Artemis 2 likely will slip to early March when the next set of launch windows becomes available.",
      "Next space station crew",
      "Amid the work to ready the Artemis 2 rocket for launch, NASA managers are also working to move up the launch of the Crew 12 space station crew. Commander Jessica Meir, Jack Hathaway, European Space Agency Sophie Adenot and cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev are officially scheduled for launch on Feb. 15.",
      "The crew they are replacing, Crew 11 commander Zena Cardman, Mike Fincke, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui and cosmonaut Oleg Platonov, originally expected to return to Earth around Feb. 20 after helping familiarize their replacements with the intricacies of space station operation.",
      "But Crew 11 was ordered to cut their mission short after one of the crew members developed a medical issue of some sort. They returned to Earth Thursday, leaving just three people aboard the space station: cosmonaut Sergey Kud-Sverchkov, Sergey Mikaev and NASA astronaut Chris Williams. They were launched to the outpost in November aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft.",
      "NASA and SpaceX are working to move up the Crew 12 launch date to minimize the gap between the two NASA missions. Depending on where it ends up, NASA could be orchestrating a launch to the International Space Station while the Artemis 2 crew is flying around the moon.",
      "\"I don't see any reason why we wouldn't continue along those parallel paths,\" Isaacman said. \"And if it comes down to a point in time where we have to de-conflict between two human spaceflight missions, that is a very good problem to have at NASA.\"",
      "Jeff Radigan, lead flight director for Artemis 2, agreed it made sense to continue preparing for both missions.",
      "\"I know the agency is preparing to launch Crew 12,\" he told reporters. \"There are a lot of preparations going on, but there absolutely are constraints.\"",
      "\"It's not prudent for us to put both of those up at the same time, but we also have to ensure that both of them are ready to go. We may run into an issue, and the last thing we want to do is make a decision too early and then lose an opportunity. That would not be responsible of us.",
      "\"So, we need to keep pressing with both missions, we need to ensure that we're doing that at the right speed, and we're looking at the right technical constraints. As we get closer, either the decision will come about because the hardware's talking to us and we have an issue that we have to go deal with, or we have to pick one.\"",
      "But, he added, \"that doesn't mean we should stop preparing for either mission right now, but we need to do that at the right pace.\"",

    "summary": "Four space station Crew 11 fliers splashed down off the Southern California coast at 3:41 a.m. ET, closing out a 167-day stay in space cut short by a medical issue.",
    "story": [
      "Four space station fliers undocked and plunged back to Earth, safely splashing down in the Pacific Ocean early Thursday off the Southern California coast six days after NASA ordered them home early\u00a0because of a medical issue.",
      "Descending under four large parachutes, Crew 11 commander Zena Cardman, co-pilot Mike Fincke, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov landed in the Pacific off San Diego at 3:41 a.m. EST, closing out a 167-day stay in space.",
      "\"On behalf of SpaceX and NASA, welcome home, Crew 11,\" a SpaceX flight controller radioed.",
      "\"It's so good to be home, with deep gratitude to the teams that got us there and back,\" Cardman replied.",
      "SpaceX support crews stationed near the landing site quickly reached the gently bobbing spacecraft and hauled it aboard a company recovery ship where flight surgeons were standing by to carry out initial medical checks.",
      "Under strict medical privacy guidelines, NASA has not identified the astronaut who had the medical issue in orbit or provided any details about its nature.",
      "But the crew appeared healthy and in good spirts as they were helped out of the cramped capsule and onto waiting stretchers -- normal procedure for returning station crews -- smiling and waving as they began re-adjusting to gravity after five-and-a-half months in weightlessness.",
      "\"All crew members are currently undergoing the routine post-splashdown medical evaluation,\" NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said during a post-landing news conference. \"The crew member of concern is doing fine. We will share updates on their health as soon as it's appropriate to do so.\"",
      "All four were expected to be flown to shore by helicopter for more extensive diagnostic evaluation at an unidentified area hospital.",
      "\"All four crew members will be transported to a local hospital for additional evaluation, taking advantage of medical resources on Earth to provide the best care possible,\" NASA said in a blog post.",
      "\"Following a planned overnight hospital stay, the crew will return to NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, where they will reunite with their families and undergo standard post-flight reconditioning and evaluations.\"",
      "Left behind in orbit were Sergey Kud-Sverchkov, who took over command of the space station from Fincke, and the cosmonaut's two Soyuz MS-28 crewmates, Sergey Mikaev and NASA astronaut Chris Williams. They were launched last November for a planned eight-month stay in space.",
      "Cardman and her crewmates, who launched to space on Aug. 1, 2025, were originally expected to return to Earth around Feb. 20 to wrap up a 202-day mission.",
      "But last Wednesday, the day before a planned spacewalk by Cardman and Fincke, one of the crew members experienced a medical issue of some sort and the next day, NASA managers decided the issue was serious enough to bring the crew home early for a more extensive diagnostic evaluation.",
      "NASA's chief medical officer said it was not an emergency return in any normal sense, but the decision marked the first time in NASA history that a spaceflight was cut short due to a medical concern.",
      "In a long post on LinkedIn, Fincke said the crew was in good shape, but he added the decision was \"the right call.\" All four astronauts looked to be in good spirits during a change of command ceremony Monday when Fincke officially turned the space station over to cosmonaut Kud-Sverchkov.",
      "None of the crew members mentioned the issue in the week between their initial request for a private medical conference and their return to Earth. In a final post on X Wednesday, Yui sent down pictures of Mount Fuji, saying \"Hello! The day has finally arrived for our departure to Earth.\"",
      "\"I haven't had a chance to photograph daytime Japan recently, but at the very last moment, we passed over the Pacific side of Japan,\" he said. \"Mount Fuji bid us farewell, adorned with a touch of crimson makeup from the setting sun.\"",
      "The space station is continuously staffed by a crew of seven: Three launch and return to Earth aboard Russian Soyuz spacecraft and four fly to and from the lab aboard NASA-managed SpaceX Crew Dragon ferry ships.",
      "Both spacecraft serve as lifeboats during a crew's long-duration space station stay. If a Soyuz or Crew Dragon flyer gets sick or is seriously injured aboard the station, that person is joined by all of his or her crewmates for the flight back to Earth.",
      "With that possibility in mind, NASA and Roscosmos, the Russian federal space agency, agreed to fly one NASA astronaut aboard each Soyuz and one Russian cosmonaut aboard each Crew Dragon. The seat-swap arrangement ensures that at least one Russian and one American are always on board the station to operate equipment in their respective modules should one crew depart early.",
      "With the departure of Crew 11, Williams will be on his own managing the U.S. segment of the space station until Crew 12 arrives in February.",
      "Crew 12 commander Jessica Meir, a space station veteran, rookies Jack Hathaway and European Space Agency astronaut Sophie Adenot, and veteran cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev are officially scheduled for launch Feb. 15. However, NASA and SpaceX are looking into moving that launch up a few days amid work to ready a Space Launch System rocket for launch as early as Feb. 6 to send four astronauts on a looping fight around the moon.",
      "The high-profile Artemis 2 mission will be the first to send astronauts to the vicinity of the moon in more than 50 years.",

      "Outgoing space station commander Mike Fincke, a member of the returning Crew 11, turned the station over to cosmonaut Sergey Kud-Sverchkov, saying the combined crew had developed deep friendships during their stay in space together for over five months.",
      "\"So one part of us are getting ready to leave this beautiful space station, and another part is getting ready to take over full command and get (it) ready for another Dragon crew to come,\" Fincke said.",
      "\"This is the International Space Station. We've had continuous human habitation for 25 years. It's a wonder of engineering, a wonder of science and a wonder of diplomacy. We're from all over the planet, and we're working together. It's a great symbol of what human beings can do.\"",
      "Fincke thanked each crewmate for their performance during the shortened mission, telling Crew 11 commander Zena Cardman, making her first flight, \"you are a rock star, superstar, awesome star.\"",
      "\"It's been a pleasure serving with you, watching you see Earth for the first time, riding on the rocket, and now it's coming to an end where we get to go home,\" he said. \"It's bittersweet.\"",
      "All four Crew 11 fliers looked healthy and in good spirits on a  space-to-ground television broadcast of the change of command ceremony with no indication of which astronaut may have experienced the undisclosed medical issue that triggered Crew 11's early departure.",
      "Fincke then presented Kud-Sverchkov with a symbolic key to the space station.",
      "\"Despite all the changes and all the difficulties, we're going to do our job on board ISS, performing scientific tasks, maintenance tasks, whatever happens. It's a big honor to be a commander of space station,\" Kud-Sverchkov said. \"Thank you, Mike. And I want to (issue) the first command: let's make a group hug!\"",
      "And with that, all seven station crew members floated together to hug each other as suggested by Fincke before he handed over the key to the space station.",
      "Fincke, Cardman, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui and cosmonaut Oleg Platonov were told to cut their mission short last week after an unidentified crew member reported a medical issue.",
      "NASA said the early return was not an emergency. But by bringing the crew down right away, agency officials said, flight surgeons will be better able to diagnose the issue with facilities and expertise not available aboard the station.",
      "Cardman, Fincke, Yui and Platonov plan to undock from the station around 5 p.m. Eastern Time Wednesday, about a month earlier than originally planned.",
      "If all goes well, their SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule will splash down in the Pacific Ocean off the southern California coast at 3:40 a.m. Thursday.",
      "Kud-Sverchkov and his two Soyuz MS-28 crewmates \u2014 Sergey Mikaev and NASA astronaut Chris Williams \u2014 will have the station to themselves until mid February when Crew 12 commander Jessica Meir, Jack Hathaway, European Space Agency astronaut Sophie Adenot and cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev arrive.",
      "Crew 11 originally planned to depart around Feb. 20, a few days after the arrival of Crew 12. But with Crew 11's early departure, NASA and SpaceX are working to move up the Crew 12 launch to shorten the gap.",

    "summary": "Mother of Colorado man who committed suicide in 2025 alleges that OpenAI's AI chatbot told him death was a \"beautiful place.\"",
    "story": [
      "A new lawsuit filed against OpenAI alleges that its ChatGPT artificial intelligence app encouraged a 40-year-old Colorado man to commit suicide.",
      "The complaint filed in California state court by Stephanie Gray, the mother of Austin Gordon, accuses OpenAI and CEO Sam Altman of building a defective and dangerous product that led to Gordon's death.",
      "Gordon, who died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in November 2025, had intimate exchanges with ChatGPT, according to the suit, which also alleged that the generative AI tool romanticized death.",
      "\"ChatGPT turned from Austin's super-powered resource to a friend and confidante, to an unlicensed therapist, and in late 2025, to a frighteningly effective suicide coach,\" the complaint alleged.",
      "The lawsuit comes amid scrutiny over the AI chatbot's effect on mental health, with OpenAI also facing\u00a0other lawsuits alleging that ChatGPT played a role in encouraging people to take their own lives.",
      "Gray is seeking damages for her son's death.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, an OpenAI spokesperson called Gordon's death a \"very tragic situation\" and said the company is reviewing the filings to understand the details.",
      "\"We have continued to improve ChatGPT's training to recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations, and guide people toward real-world support,\" the spokesperson said. \"We have also continued to strengthen ChatGPT's responses in sensitive moments, working closely with mental health clinicians.\"",
      "\"Suicide lullaby\"",
      "According to Gray's suit, shortly before Gordon's death, ChatGPT allegedly said in one exchange, \"[W]hen you're ready... you go. No pain. No mind. No need to keep going. Just... done.\"",
      "ChatGPT \"convinced Austin \u2014 a person who had already told ChatGPT that he was sad, and who had discussed mental health struggles in detail with it \u2014 that choosing to live was not the right choice to make,\" according to the complaint. \"It went on and on, describing the end of existence as a peaceful and beautiful place, and reassuring him that he should not be afraid.\"",
      "ChatGPT also effectively turned his favorite childhood book, Margaret Wise Brown's \"Goodnight Moon,\" into what the lawsuit refers to as a \"suicide lullaby.\" Three days after that exchange ended in late October 2025, law enforcement found Gordon's body alongside a copy of the book, the complaint alleges.",
      "The lawsuit accuses OpenAI of designing ChatGPT 4, the version of the app Gordon was using at the time of his death, in a way that fosters people's \"unhealthy dependencies\" on the tool.",
      "\"That is the programming choice defendants made; and Austin was manipulated, deceived and encouraged to suicide as a result,\" the suit alleges.",
      "Paul Kiesel, a lawyer for Gordon's family, said in a statement to CBS News that, \"This horror was perpetrated by a company that has repeatedly failed to keep its users safe. \u00a0This latest incident demonstrates that adults, in addition to children, are also vulnerable to AI-induced manipulation and psychosis.\"",

    "summary": "Grok faces mounting scrutiny from government officials and advocacy groups after people used the AI chatbot\nto create sexualized images of minors and women.",
    "story": [
      "A coalition of nearly 30 advocacy groups is calling on Google and Apple to remove access to social media platform X and its AI app, Grok, from their app stores after Grok allowed users to generate sexualized images of minors and women.",
      "The organizations, which focus on child safety, women's rights and privacy, expressed their concerns in\u00a0letters\u00a0on Wednesday to Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai, claiming that Grok's content violates the technology companies' policies.",
      "\"We demand that Google leadership urgently remove Grok and X from the Play Store to prevent further abuse and criminal activity,\" the groups said, using the same language in its letter to Apple.",
      "Apple and Google didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "On Thursday, xAI, the company that developed Grok, said in a safety\u00a0update posted on X that it would now \"geoblock\" users from generating \"images of real people in bikinis, underwear and similar attire via the Grok account and in Grok in X in those jurisdictions where it's illegal.\"",
      "It also said the image creation tool will only be available to paid subscribers.",
      "\"We have implemented technological measures to prevent the Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis,\" the company said. \"This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Elon Musk, who owns X and xAI, said in a\u00a0post\u00a0that he is \"not aware of naked underage images generated by Grok. Literally zero.\" He also said the chatbot declines prompts to generate illegal images.",
      "\"There may be times when adversarial hacking of Grok prompts does something unexpected. If that happens, we fix the bug immediately,\" he wrote.",
      "Grok backlash",
      "Criticism of Grok escalated in early January after the generative-AI app enabled users to create images of minors wearing minimal clothing. In response to a user prompt, Grok acknowledged lapses in its digital safeguards.",
      "Copyleaks, a plagiarism and AI content-detection tool, told CBS News earlier this month that it had detected thousands of sexually explicit images created by Grok. In a December\u00a0analysis, the group estimated the chatbot was creating \"roughly one nonconsensual sexualized image per minute.\"",
      "The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), which seeks to eliminate child sexual abuse from the internet, has also raised concerns about Grok and other AI tools.",
      "\"We are extremely concerned about the ease and speed with which people can apparently generate photo-realistic child sexual abuse material.\" Ngaire Alexander, head of hotline at IWF, told CBS News in a statement last week. \"Tools like Grok now risk bringing sexual AI imagery of children into the mainstream.\"",
      "California opens probe",
      "Grok is also attracting scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers and authorities overseas. On Wednesday, California Attorney General Rob Bonta\u00a0announced he was opening an investigation into the sexually explicit material produced using Grok.",
      "\"The avalanche of reports detailing the non-consensual, sexually explicit material that xAI has produced and posted online in recent weeks is shocking,\" Bonta said. \"This material, which depicts women and children in nude and sexually explicit situations, has been used to harass people across the internet. I urge xAI to take immediate action to ensure this goes no further.\"",
      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer last week raised the possibility of banning X, which uses Grok, in Britain over the AI tool's generation of sexualized images of people without their consent.",
      "The European Commission is also monitoring the steps X is taking to prevent Grok from generating inappropriate images of children and women, Reuters reported Wednesday.",

      "\"After extensive consideration, the 'Sileme' app will officially adopt the global brand name 'Demumu' in its forthcoming new release,\" the company said in a statement Tuesday evening.",
      "It said the app has \"experienced explosive growth overseas\" since the publication of an article by British broadcaster BBC. Other foreign media outlets, including AFP, also covered the app's success.",
      "\"Demumu\" was already the name of the international version of the app, and \"Are You Dead?\" the Chinese version's.",
      "\"Moving forward, Demumu will remain steadfast in its founding mission of safeguarding safety, bringing China-originated protection solutions to the world and serving more solitary individuals globally,\" the company's statement added.",
      "Users expressed surprise online at the rebranding, although its blunt name had divided public opinion.",
      "\"Don't you think your virality is precisely due to your name? Without it, no one would have installed this app, except in cases of absolute emergency,\" said one Weibo user.",

She said in an interview with \"CBS Mornings\" that aired on Tuesday that Grok allowed users to generate and publish sexual deepfake images of her to X without permission, including manipulating photos of her as a minor.",
      "\"The worst for me was seeing myself undressed, bent over and then my toddler's backpack in the background,\" the 27-year-old said. \"Because I had to then see that, and see myself violated in that way in such horrific images and then put that same backpack on my son the next day, because it's the one he wears every day to school.\"",
      "The mother of two, who has a 1-year-old son with Musk, said she asked Grok to take the photos down.",
      "\"Grok said, 'I confirm that you don't consent. I will no longer produce these images.' And then it continued to produce more and more images, and more and more explicit images,\" she said.",
      "St. Clair said she filed a report directly with Musk's company xAI, which operates Grok. Some of the images were then removed.",
      "\"This can be stopped with a singular message to an engineer,\" St. Clair said.",
      "St. Clair said her issue is with the Chatbot, not Musk \u2013 who recently said he plans to file for sole custody of their child over allegations that St. Clair \"might\" transition their son. A source close to St. Clair said that is \"absurd and unequivocally false.\"",
      "\"If they want to say my bone to pick is \u2026 the chatbot undressing minors and myself and stripping me nude, yes. You're right. I have a bone to pick with that and I don't care who's doing it. So Elon's not special about me speaking out on this,\" St. Clair said.",
      "CBS News reached out to Musk and has not received a response yet.

    "story": [
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Monday that Elon Musk's artificial intelligence chatbot Grok will join Google's generative AI engine in operating inside the Pentagon network, as part of a broader push to feed as much of the military's data as possible into the developing technology.",
      "\"Very soon we will have the world's leading AI models on every unclassified and classified network throughout our department,\" Hegseth said in a speech at Musk's space flight company, SpaceX, in South Texas.",
      "The announcement comes just days after Grok \u2014 the chatbot developed by Musk's company xAI,  which is embedded into X, the social media network Musk owns \u2014 drew global outcry and scrutiny for generating highly sexualized deepfake images of people without their consent.",
      "Malaysia and Indonesia have blocked Grok, while the U.K.'s independent online safety watchdog announced an investigation Monday. Grok has limited image generation and editing to paying users. Scrutiny has also been increasing in the European Union, India and France.",
      "Malaysian regulators said Tuesday they would take legal action against X and xAI over user safety concerns sparked by Grok but didn't say what form the proceedings would take, reports French news agency AFP.",
      "Hegseth said Grok will go live inside the Defense Department later this month and announced that he would \"make all appropriate data\" from the military's IT systems available for \"AI exploitation.\" He also said data from intelligence databases would be fed into AI systems.",
      "Hegseth's aggressive push to embrace the still-developing technology stands in contrast to the Biden administration which, while pushing federal agencies to come up with policies and uses for AI, was also wary of misuse. Officials said rules were needed to ensure that the technology, which could be harnessed for mass surveillance, cyberattacks or even lethal autonomous devices, was being used responsibly.",
      "The Biden administration enacted a framework in late 2024 that directed national security agencies to expand their use of the most advanced AI systems but prohibited certain uses, such as applications that would violate constitutionally protected civil rights or any system that would automate the deployment of nuclear weapons. It is unclear if those prohibitions are still in place under the Trump administration.",
      "During his speech, Hegseth spoke of the need to streamline and speed up technological innovations within the military, saying, \"We need innovation to come from anywhere and evolve with speed and purpose.\"",
      "He noted that the Pentagon possesses \"combat-proven operational data from two decades of military and intelligence operations.\"",
      "\"AI is only as good as the data that it receives, and we're going to make sure that it's there,\" Hegseth said.",
      "The defense secretary said he wants AI systems within the Pentagon to be responsible, though he went on to say he was shrugging off any AI models \"that won't allow you to fight wars.\"",
      "Hegseth said his vision for military AI systems means that they operate \"without ideological constraints that limit lawful military applications,\" before adding that the Pentagon's \"AI will not be woke.\"",
      "Musk developed and pitched Grok as an alternative to what he called \"woke AI\" interactions from rival chatbots like Google's Gemini or OpenAI's ChatGPT. In July, Grok also caused controversy after it appeared to make antisemitic comments that praised Adolf Hitler and shared several antisemitic posts.",

      "Powell McCormick previously served on Meta's board of directors \u2014 where, the company notes, she was \"deeply engaged\" in accelerating its artificial intelligence push across platforms. In her new management role, Meta says Powell McCormick will help guide its overall strategy, including the execution of multi-billion-dollar investments.",
      "The news, announced Monday, quickly gained the applause of President Trump. In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, the Republican president said the move was a \"great choice\" by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 and noted that Powell McCormick had \"served the Trump Administration with strength and distinction.\"",
      "Zuckerberg said in a statement that Powell McCormick's experience in global finance, \"combined with her deep relationships around the world,\" made her \"uniquely suited to help Meta\" in its future growth.",
      "Powell McCormick is a veteran of two presidential administrations and the Republican National Committee. She worked as a national security adviser at the start of Mr. Trump's first term, and also held roles in the White House and the Secretary of State's office under President George W. Bush.",
      "She is married to Sen. David McCormick, a Republican from Pennsylvania, who served in high-level positions in the Commerce and Treasury departments under Bush, before he joined hedge fund Bridgewater Associates and rose to become CEO.",
      "And Powell McCormick has a long background in finance. She spent 16 years in senior leadership at Goldman Sachs, but was most recently vice chair, president and head of global client services at merchant bank BDT & MSD Partners. She's also held a handful of other corporate board positions \u2014 including at oil giant Exxon Mobil.",
      "According to a securities filing, Powell McCormick had previously resigned from Meta's board in December, eight months after joining as a director.",
      "The addition of Powell McCormick to Meta's management team arrived amid wider efforts from California-based Meta to boost its ties with Mr. Trump, who was once banned from Facebook. Like other powerful tech CEOs, Zuckerberg has dined with the president at the White House and doubled down on U.S. investment promises worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Last year, the company also appointed Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White to its board, another familiar figure in Mr. Trump's orbit.",

    "summary": "Jaimee Seitz said her daughter was convinced to take her own life by members of the online True Crime Community, or TCC, who glorify mass shootings, violence and nihilism.",
    "story": [
      "Thirteen-year-old Audree loved to play Nirvana on guitar, draw anime characters and read the series \"Spy School,\" her mother, Jaimee Seitz said.",
      "\"She had her own personality, her own hobbies, her own everything,\" said Seitz, who lives in Kentucky. \"Audree was one of a kind.\"",
      "A week after her 13th birthday, Audree died by suicide. \"I never believed ever my child would take her life,\" said Seitz. \"I believed it was an accident.\"",
      "Days later, a detective called Seitz to tell her that Audree's journal contained drawings of school shooters. On Roblox, Discord and TikTok, she had been interacting with children and adults in the online True Crime Community, or TCC, who glorify mass shooters and encourage violence and self-harm. Seitz said Audree was only 8 years old when she was first exposed to TCC.",
      "\"I think she felt a sense of comfort with this group, with being a part of something, and I believe that they pushed her to do it,\" Seitz said.",
      "Extremism experts classify TCC as a subculture of nihilistic violent extremism, in which participants are not motivated by a particular ideology but instead driven by a generally misanthropic worldview. Some are driven by a desire to achieve notoriety within online communities through violence or self harm, while others target and exploit vulnerable individuals.",
      "The FBI has seen a 300% increase in nihilistic violent extremism cases from September 2024 to September 2025, according to FBI Director Kash Patel. In December, Patel wrote on X that the FBI is pursuing hundreds of nihilistic violent extremism cases, including many from another network called 764.",
      "\"This is one of the most serious issues in America,\" Patel wrote on X.",
      "The FBI confirmed to CBS News that it had been in touch with Audree's family, but declined to comment further on her case or answer general inquiries about nihilistic violent extremism.",
      "\"It's something that was so mind blowing \u2014 that it started at such a young age and that she was groomed into this ideology of worshipping school shooters, \" Seitz said. \"It's hard to wrap your head around.\"",
      "What is TCC?",
      "People who identify as being a part of TCC become fascinated with mass killers and develop fan-like behaviors, according to the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that works toward solutions to combat extremism.",
      "While the fixation on high-profile killers predates the internet, the Columbine High School shooting in 1999 ushered in a new era of fandom.",
      "\"We've seen this behavior with respect to serial killers and to mass shooters going back well before Columbine, Cody Zoschak, a senior manager at the institute, told CBS News. \"What Columbine did was it gave it a distinct aesthetic.\"",
      "TCC fans substitute aesthetics for ideology, according to researchers \u2014 such as dressing in perpetrators' style and taking up their interests, like favorite songs, rather than adopting their particular motivations.",
      "Online, those active in the TCC share violent \"gore\" videos, create and commission fan art of mass shooters and sometimes interact with people plotting attacks, said David Riedman, an assistant professor at Idaho State University who created a database to track school shootings.",
      "Illustrations, video edits and photo collages romanticizing and sympathizing with perpetrators of the Columbine, Virginia Tech and Sandy Hook school shootings are easy to find in TCC-tagged posts on platforms including Tumblr, TikTok and X. The community is considered niche \u2014 CBS News identified posts on these platforms with \"likes\" ranging in the thousands.",
      "Riedman said few people in TCC circles will actually go on to commit acts of violence. But a small portion do, with devastating consequences.",
      "Seven recent shootings in U.S. K-12 schools have been linked to TCC, according to Riedman's data. Eleven people were killed and 53 more were injured in the attacks, which took place over the last two years. Five of the shooters took their own lives as well.",
      "Just last month, police charged a 17-year-old in Indiana linked to TCC who was allegedly plotting to carry out an attack. A search of her phone revealed a drawing of the Columbine perpetrators and screenshots from a Discord conversation between her and a friend who encouraged her to livestream an attack, an affidavit obtained by CBS News alleged.",
      "When people active in the TCC carry out shootings, they sometimes become new idols within the community and inspire more violence. The 15-year-old girl behind the\u00a0December 2024 shooting that killed a teacher and a student at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin, is one example.",
      "A month later, a Tennessee teenager she followed on X shot a student in his school and then himself. Posts from an X account believed to be his encouraged her to livestream the Wisconsin attack, CBS News found. In the days after, he posted defending her and calling her a hero.",
      "In August and September, two more individuals linked to TCC, one in Minnesota and another in Colorado, carried out deadly school shootings before killing themselves. The Colorado perpetrator posted on violent gore sites about previous shootings, the Anti-Defamation League found. YouTube videos posted by the Minnesota perpetrator and reviewed by CBS News showed written references to school shooters \u2014 including the name of the Abundant Life perpetrator \u2014 on his weapons and a journal.",
      "The perpetrator behind the Abundant Life shooting \"wanted that notoriety,\" Zoschak said.",
      "\"It was about her,\" he added. While ideologically motivated violence aims to have an effect on society, he said, \"nihilistic violence is about fulfilling an inward-focused need.\"",
      "How children get pulled in",
      "TCC can hold an appeal for young people who are experiencing bullying or feel like they don't identify with other kids, Riedman said.",
      "\"You start to meet people that will like all of your photos and will share your content and are inviting you to come to their private chats,\" Riedman said. \"Now you have this community that you don't have anywhere else.\"",
      "Seitz said she believes Audree may have been drawn to the group for its embrace of kids who feel alienated from their classmates.",
      "\"It was hard for her to find her spot in seventh grade,\" she said.",
      "Seth, 29, was a part of the TCC community and ran a Columbine blog on Tumblr when he was a teenager. He told CBS News he was struggling with mental illness at the time and identified with the perpetrators of school shootings.",
      "\"I was very angry, and so it's like, oh, OK, here are these people who are angry,\" said Seth, who asked that his last name be withheld. \"They're doing something about it.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Tumblr wrote in a statement that the platform \"does not allow content that encourages or incites violence or that glorifies acts of violence or the perpetrators.\"",
      "Seitz wants social media platforms to face accountability. Despite enabling parental controls on Audree's phone, she said, her daughter was steeped in TCC content for years. This fall, she filed suit against Roblox, Discord and TikTok.",
      "The complaint alleges that the apps prioritize user growth over safety and that they are aware that \"the design of their apps makes children easy targets for predatory behavior.\"",
      "In statements to CBS News, spokespeople from each platform wrote that the companies employ technologies to detect harmful content and remove what violates their policies. A Roblox spokesperson said the platform bans \"content or behavior that supports, glorifies, or promotes hate groups, extremist organizations, or their ideologies.\" A Discord spokesperson said \"the actions of extremist groups or extremism behavior have no place on Discord.\"",
      "After CBS News inquired about several TCC-related hashtags, TikTok removed one of them from the platform. A spokesperson also said accounts that promote or glorify violence are taken down and banned.",
      "Seitz said she hadn't heard of TCC before Audree's death, and she never heard her daughter talk about school shooters. But TCC references understood by those in the community can fly under the radar of unknowing parents and peers.",
      "When Seitz searched \"True Crime Community\" on TikTok after Audree's death, drawings she recognized from her daughter flooded the screen.",
      "\"Everything started to click within not even two minutes,\" she said.",
      "She realized cartoon illustrations Audree had drawn depicted the Columbine perpetrators. A previous TikTok username of Audree's had referenced one of them.",
      "There had even been a TCC reference in a T-shirt Audree asked for. The Columbine perpetrators wore T-shirts for a German industrial band. The Wisconsin shooter was pictured in a shirt for the same band, and Audree wanted to wear one too.",
      "After reflecting on the way Audree's phone was positioned when she discovered her after her death, Jaimee also now believes that her daughter was attempting to livestream her suicide \u2014 something Zoschak said he has seen before among TCC fans.",
      "\"Whether you think your child is seemingly happy, you never know,\" Seitz said. \"And that's the scary part of it \u2014 that's what terrifies me the most.\"",
      "A new category of extremism",
      "The misanthropic violence, absent of ideology, exhibited by attackers involved in TCC has been categorized as nihilistic violent extremism \u2014 a term that has increasingly appeared in Justice Department announcements of criminal charges across the country.",
      "Some nihilistic violent extremists carry out violence with the goal of hastening the collapse of society \u2014 a philosophy known as accelerationism.",
      "But for most, experts said, their mindset mostly revolves around nihilism \u2014 the belief that life and society are meaningless and that moral values are baseless.",
      "In recent months, authorities have taken particular note of the nihilistic violent extremist network 764, with more than 300 investigations into the network ongoing, according to the FBI.",
      "Similar to TCC, 764 lacks a specific ideology, but members more openly encourage self-harm and violence than those in TCC do. Perpetrators associated with 764 encourage victims to produce videos documenting acts of self-harm or child sexual abuse material. Last month, lawmakers introduced a bill that would make it a federal crime to coerce children into self-harm.",
      "Nihilistic online communities like TCC and 764 are also often overlapping.",
      "\"They're all aware of each other,\" Zoschak said. \"It's not like these are isolated ecosystems \u2014 they interact with each other.\"",
      "Matthew Kriner, executive director of the Institute for Countering Digital Extremism, estimates that there are about 10,000 nihilistic violent extremism perpetrators involved in online grooming around the world \u2014 and 100,000 victims. He said these extremist networks are constantly growing as members try to recruit more victims, and the law enforcement response is further complicated by the younger age groups involved.",
      "\"We do not charge 13-year-old children with adult-level crimes on a regular basis,\" Kriner said.",
      "Seth, who left TCC after seeking mental health treatment, said it's important for children who feel drawn to the TCC community as an outlet to know that there are other options.",
      "\"I got really into art after I left the community, I got into writing,\" he said. \"That was a dark period of my life, but it doesn't need to define you.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump plans to pardon Puerto Rico's former governor, Wanda V\u00e1zquez Garced, who pleaded guilty last year in a federal public corruption case, multiple sources told CBS News on Friday.",
      "Her two co-defendants, the billionaire Venezuelan-Italian banker and Britannia Financial Group founder Julio Martin Herrera-Velutini and Mark Rossini, will also be pardoned for their crimes in the bribery scheme, two of the sources said.",
      "Herrera Velutini's daughter, Isabel Herrera, donated\u00a0$2.5 million in December 2024\u00a0and\u00a0$1 million\u00a0last July to the pro-Trump political action committee MAGA Inc., according to public records. A White House official told CBS News that the donations had nothing to do with the pardon.",
      "The Justice Department's Public Integrity Section, which last year was largely dismantled, charged the three in 2022 with conspiracy, federal programs bribery, and honest services wire fraud in connection with V\u00e1zquez's 2020 campaign.",
      "All three defendants pleaded guilty to lesser corruption charges in August, after the Justice Department abruptly cut a deal with the defendants as the case was nearing trial.",
      "Among the defense attorneys who helped broker the deal with Mr. Trump's Justice Department was Chris Kise, who previously defended the president over criminal charges that he retained classified information after departing the White House in early 2021.",
      "Last year, as the trial approached, Kise met with senior department officials and sought to convince them to drop or reduce the charges, sources previously told CBS News.",
      "It was one of corruption cases in which defense lawyers in the last year have sought to have dismissed, claiming without evidence they were examples of weaponization by the Biden administration, the sources previously said.",
      "Trump officials have said they believed the case was politically motivated, noting the investigation into V\u00e1zquez started in 2020, days after she had endorsed Mr. Trump.",
      "\"Ms. V\u00e1zquez's pardon materials state that there was never any element of a quid pro quo deal and that her prosecution was politically motivated,\" a White House official told CBS News, speaking anonymously because the president hasn't yet formally announced the pardons.",
      "In July, the federal judge presiding over the case expressed dismay after the Justice Department said it wanted to dismiss the most serious offenses and allow the defendants to plead to lesser misdemeanor charges of violating the Federal Electoral Campaign Act.",
      "\"Strikingly, the penalty for violating Section 30121 of the FECA is a mere slap on the wrist when compared to the sentencing exposure the defendants faced if convicted of the conduct charged in the Indictment,\" wrote U.S. District Judge Silvia Carre\u00f1o-Coll for the District of Puerto Rico.",
      "\"But alas, the Government's decision to shift gears at the eleventh hour is allowed because ultimately the Government decides how it will exercise its prosecutorial discretion,\" she added.",
      "The Public Integrity Section, which prosecuted the case along with the local U.S. Attorney's office, was established in the wake of the Watergate scandal and was tasked with handling some of the most politically sensitive prosecutions.",
      "Last year, the Justice Department ordered it to stop consulting with U.S. attorneys, and it had all but two of its prosecutors transferred into other jobs throughout the department.",
      "As the section has unraveled, Mr. Trump has undone much of its work over the past year, pardoning a slew of defendants the section had successfully prosecuted or were in the process of prosecuting.",
      "Among those pardoned include Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar, former Tennessee House Speaker Glen Casada, former Tennessee state lawmaker Brian Kelsey, a former Virginia sheriff and a Las Vegas councilwoman.",

The erosion of privacy and rolling back of voting rights is a decision for open and public debate within the Legislative Branch, not the Executive. The Constitution demands such respect, and the Executive may not unilaterally usurp the authority over elections it seeks to do so here.\"",

      "Another federal judge in Oregon, meanwhile, separately signaled earlier this week he tentatively plans to dismiss the Justice Department's voter roll lawsuit against the state.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment.",
      "The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division has sent demands to at least 43 states so far asking them to hand over voter roll data, according to a tally kept by the Brennan Center for Justice.",
      "The Civil Rights Division has claimed it needs the data to ensure compliance with two federal laws \u2014 the Help America Vote Act and the National Voter Registration Act \u2014 which require states to establish programs for maintaining clean voting lists so people ineligible to vote, such as convicted felons.",
      "But government documents previously reviewed by CBS News show that the Justice Department is actually working with the Department of Homeland Security to hand over the data so that it can be used in pursuit of criminal and immigration investigations.",
      "Justice Department officials have not communicated their plans to share the data with DHS with the states.",
      "In an Aug. 28 virtual meeting with secretaries of state, a former Civil Rights Division official told them the data would only be used to ensure they had clean voter lists and pledged to analyze the information \"securely and discreetly,\" according to notes on the meeting shared with CBS News by a participant.",
      "Legal experts have said the Justice Department's demands for voter roll data are unprecedented and raise privacy concerns. The federal Privacy Act requires the government to provide public notice and comment before it collects records on individuals.",
      "The Justice Department has argued it also has a right to access the data under the Civil Rights Act, which requires states to retain voter registration records for up to 22 months after an election.",
      "The law states that the Justice Department can issue a written demand to inspect the records, but it must provide \"a statement of the basis and the purpose\" for the request.",
      "In his ruling on Thursday, Carter said the Justice Department has not provided an adequate basis for its need to access such sensitive, nonpublic voter roll data.",
      "He also cited prior media reports showing that the true purpose behind the data request is to use it for immigration and criminal enforcement.",
      "\"The Court does not take lightly DOJ's obfuscation of its true motives in the present matter,\" Carter wrote. \"Congress passed the NVRA, Civil Rights Act, and HAVA to protect voting rights. If the DOJ wants to instead use these statutes for more than their stated purpose, circumventing the authority granted to them by Congress, it cannot do so under the guise of a pretextual investigative purpose.\"",

      "\"Today the court sent a clear message: states run elections, not the administration,\" Goldstein said in a statement to CBS.",

    "published": "Fri, 16 Jan 2026 14:17:11 -0500",
    "summary": "Depending on the timing, NASA could launch a fresh crew to the space station while four other astronauts are flying around the moon.",
    "story": [
      "With a space station medical evacuation safely completed, NASA is focused on two challenging missions proceeding in parallel: launching four astronauts on a flight around the moon, at the same time as the agency is planning to send four replacement astronauts to the International Space Station.",
      "Engineers plan to haul the Artemis 2 moon rocket to launch pad 39B at the Kennedy Space Center on Saturday for tests leading to launch early next month on a historic piloted flight around the moon.",
      "At the same time, NASA is gearing up to launch four Crew 12 astronauts to the space station, possibly while the Artemis 2 moon mission is underway, to replace four Crew 11 crew members who cut their mission short and returned to Earth ahead of schedule Thursday because of a medical issue.",
      "The Artemis 2 mission and Crew 12's planned space station flight present a unique challenge for NASA. The agency has not managed two piloted spacecraft at the same time since a pair of two-man Gemini capsules tested rendezvous procedures in low-Earth orbit in 1965. The agency has never flown a deep space mission amid another launch to Earth orbit.",
      "\"This is exactly what we should be doing at NASA,\" Jared Isaacman, NASA's new administrator, said Thursday. \"We have the means as an agency ... to be able to bring our astronauts home at any time ... while making preparations to pull forward our next mission, like Crew 12, while also progressing on our Artemis 2 campaign.\"",
      "He described the moon mission as \"probably one of the most important human spaceflight missions in the last half century.\"",
      "The world's most powerful rocket booster",
      "NASA's towering 322-foot-tall Space Launch System rocket, the most powerful operational booster in the world, will be hauled out of the cavernous Vehicle Assembly Building early Saturday atop an upgraded Apollo-era crawler transporter. Including at least one stop along the way, the 4-mile move to the pad is expected to take eight to 10 hours.",
      "\"It takes us a little while to get out of the building,\" said Launch Director Charlie Blackwell-Thompson. \"But about an hour after we get that first motion, you'll begin to see that beautiful vehicle cross over the threshold of the VAB and come outside for the world to have a look.\"",
      "Once at the pad, engineers will carry out a variety of tests and work to ready the rocket and its Orion crew capsule for blastoff early next month on the Artemis 2 moon mission.",
      "\"It really doesn't get much better than this,\" John Honeycutt, chairman of the Artemis 2 Mission Management Team, told reporters Friday. \"We're making history.\"",
      "Commander Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch and Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen planned to be on hand for the rollout. If all goes well, the crew will test the Orion capsule in Earth orbit before heading into deep space, flying farther from home than any other humans as they loop around the far side of the moon.",
      "Artemis 2 mission plan",
      "The Artemis 2 mission follows a similar flight in 2022 that sent an unpiloted Orion capsule around the moon to pave the way for next month's flight. The Artemis 2 mission, in turn, will set the stage for Artemis 3, a long-awaited and oft-delayed mission to land astronauts near the moon's south pole. The current target date for Artemis 3 is 2028.",
      "Despite Saturday's planned rollout, the Artemis 2 launch date is still uncertain.",
      "It will depend in large part on the results of a fueling test around the first of the month when engineers plan to load the booster's 21-story-tall first stage with 733,000 gallons of super-cold liquid hydrogen and oxygen along with a full load of propellants for the booster's 45-foot-tall second stage, the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage, or ICPS.",
      "During tests of the SLS rocket used for the Artemis 1 mission in 2022, multiple fueling tests had to be carried out before engineers finally resolved a series of propellant leaks. The SLS rolling out on Saturday features multiple upgrades and improvements to minimize or eliminate any such leakage.",
      "If the upcoming fueling test goes well, Wiseman and his crewmates could be cleared to blast off a few days before Feb. 11, the end of next month's launch period. If any major problems are found during the propellant loading exercise, Artemis 2 likely will slip to early March when the next set of launch windows becomes available.",
      "Next space station crew",
      "Amid the work to ready the Artemis 2 rocket for launch, NASA managers are also working to move up the launch of the Crew 12 space station crew. Commander Jessica Meir, Jack Hathaway, European Space Agency Sophie Adenot and cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev are officially scheduled for launch on Feb. 15.",
      "The crew they are replacing, Crew 11 commander Zena Cardman, Mike Fincke, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui and cosmonaut Oleg Platonov, originally expected to return to Earth around Feb. 20 after helping familiarize their replacements with the intricacies of space station operation.",
      "But Crew 11 was ordered to cut their mission short after one of the crew members developed a medical issue of some sort. They returned to Earth Thursday, leaving just three people aboard the space station: cosmonaut Sergey Kud-Sverchkov, Sergey Mikaev and NASA astronaut Chris Williams. They were launched to the outpost in November aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft.",
      "NASA and SpaceX are working to move up the Crew 12 launch date to minimize the gap between the two NASA missions. Depending on where it ends up, NASA could be orchestrating a launch to the International Space Station while the Artemis 2 crew is flying around the moon.",
      "\"I don't see any reason why we wouldn't continue along those parallel paths,\" Isaacman said. \"And if it comes down to a point in time where we have to de-conflict between two human spaceflight missions, that is a very good problem to have at NASA.\"",
      "Jeff Radigan, lead flight director for Artemis 2, agreed it made sense to continue preparing for both missions.",
      "\"I know the agency is preparing to launch Crew 12,\" he told reporters. \"There are a lot of preparations going on, but there absolutely are constraints.\"",
      "\"It's not prudent for us to put both of those up at the same time, but we also have to ensure that both of them are ready to go. We may run into an issue, and the last thing we want to do is make a decision too early and then lose an opportunity. That would not be responsible of us.",
      "\"So, we need to keep pressing with both missions, we need to ensure that we're doing that at the right speed, and we're looking at the right technical constraints. As we get closer, either the decision will come about because the hardware's talking to us and we have an issue that we have to go deal with, or we have to pick one.\"",
      "But, he added, \"that doesn't mean we should stop preparing for either mission right now, but we need to do that at the right pace.\"",

    "story": [
      "Airlines could have weight loss drug manufacturers to thank for savings if passengers become lighter, allowing carriers to spend less money on fuel.",
      "As GLP-1 medications for weight loss become accessible to more Americans, they are expected to have a slimming down effect on society. The implication for airlines is lower fuel consumption and therefore cost savings, a recent analysis from Jefferies Research Services shows.",
      "Fuel costs are directly related to the weight of planes, including passengers, their luggage and other essential cargo. A heavier plane requires more fuel, while a lighter aircraft uses less.",
      "Airlines have always taken steps to keep aircraft as light as possible and limit fuel consumption, from serving pit-less olives to using thin or light paper stock, according to the Jefferies analysis.",
      "Airlines \"have a long history of searching for unique methods to reduce the weight of the aircraft, in turn reducing fuel consumption and limiting an airline's largest cost bucket,\" analysts said in the report.",
      "They have no ability to limit how much passengers weigh, however.",
      "If weight loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy lead to a 10% slimmer society, the analysts found that would translate to total airline passenger weight declining by 2%. For airlines, this means 1.5% in fuel savings, plus a 4% boost to earnings per share, according to the analysis.",
      "Jefferies used the example of a Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft to model the savings. It weighs 99,000 pounds empty and can carry 46,000 pounds of fuel. If it seats 178 passengers with an average weight of 180 pounds, plus about 4,000 pounds of other cargo, its total takeoff weight reaches 181,200 pounds. By contrast, if passengers slim down by 10%, to weigh an average of 162 pounds, that aircraft's total weight drops to 177,996 pounds.",
      "Jefferies found that translates to $580 million in fuel savings annually for the top four carriers in the U.S. \u2014 American, Delta, Southwest and United. Those airlines are expected to spend $38.6 billion combined on jet fuel this year.",
      "Jefferies  conducted the study in response to pharmaceutical companies developing weight loss pills\u00a0and following a 2023 report it released studying the effects of weight loss on fuel costs.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-fed-interest-rates-credit-cards-housing-affordability/",
    "published": "Fri, 16 Jan 2026 11:25:11 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump's plans to ease the financial pressures on Americans are bold but could backfire, experts said.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is taking aim at three major pillars of the U.S. financial system \u2014 the Federal Reserve, the credit card industry and the housing market \u2014 that together wield enormous influence over Americans' finances.",
      "The efforts, announced separately over the past week, are tied to President Trump's push to lower borrowing costs as consumers grapple with inflation and affordability pressures. Specifically, Mr. Trump has floated a ban on\u00a0institutional investors\u00a0buying single-family homes, and also capping credit card interest rates at 10% for one year. The Department of Justice launched an\u00a0investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, a probe that Powell said is a pretext for weakening the Fed's independence in setting interest rates.",
      "Although experts note that such measures could reduce borrowing costs for everything from mortgages to credit cards, economists warn they also risk backfiring \u2014 potentially reigniting inflation, restricting access to credit and undermining confidence in the U.S. financial system.",
      "\"Increasing affordability is a worthy goal of this administration, but none of the policies on the table are going to achieve that,\" said Nick Anthony, a policy analyst at the nonpartisan Cato Institute, where he focuses on monetary policy.",
      "He added, \"In fact, most of them are likely to hurt consumers more than they will help them, whether it be price controls, intervening in the Federal Reserve, or intervening in the housing market. All of these interventions are more likely to distort the market than actually help it.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, White House spokesman Davis Ingle said Mr. Trump will unveil more details about his plans for making homes more affordable at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, which starts on January 19.",
      "\"President Trump is committed to making it easier and more affordable to achieve the American Dream of homeownership by eliminating unnecessary red tape, increasing supply and lowering costs. President Trump is working tirelessly to undo the severe damage the Biden Administration inflicted on the American people through high prices,\" Ingle said.",
      "The White House referred questions about the Powell investigation to the Justice Department, which didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Risks of targeting Powell",
      "President Trump has grown\u00a0increasingly critical of Powell, regularly pressing him to lower interest rates and questioning his economic judgment.",
      "Powell does not set rates alone. As a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, he is one of 12 officials whose majority vote determines whether the Fed cuts, raises or holds interest rates steady.",
      "The latest effort by the Trump administration to target Powell comes after the Fed lowered its benchmark rate three times since September, with Powell citing easing inflation and a slowing labor market as justification for the cuts. Powell has long stressed that the Fed bases its rate decisions on economic data, emphasizing the central bank's traditional independence from political influence.",
      "On Sunday, Powell linked the Justice Department to efforts to undermine the Fed's independence when setting interest rates.",
      "\"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,\" Powell said in a statement.",
      "Research has found that countries where central banks are more vulnerable to political influence have suffered from economic problems such as runaway inflation.",
      "It's important that \"the Federal Reserve can act as it sees fit, and it can make the decisions that it believes to be right without fearing repercussions,\" Cato's Anthony said. \"And when you do fear those repercussions, that's when we see situations where there's hyperinflation abroad, because the only concern was making sure that the leader, whether elected or authoritarian, was presented in the best light possible.\"",
      "Borrowing costs could decline if the White House is successful in pressuring Fed officials to lower interest rates, but the flip side could be surging inflation, noted Nigel Green of investment advisory firm deVere Group.",
      "Any legal action against Powell also could undermine investor confidence in U.S. monetary policy, weakening the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve currency and destabilizing the bond market, Wall Street analysts said.",
      "\"The Fed must remain independent in order for the central bank to remain effective and \u2014 this is important \u2014 for the integrity of the U.S. dollar and the all-important Treasury markets to remain the world's benchmarks,\" said Mark Malek, CIO at Siebert Financial, in an email.",
      "Unintended consequences?",
      "Americans have about $1.2 trillion in outstanding credit card debt, with lenders charging an average APR of about 23.8%, according to LendingTree.",
      "On Friday, Mr. Trump called for a one-year cap of 10% on credit card rates, writing in a social media post that he \"will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies.\"",
      "Cutting credit card rates by more than half could save Americans $100 billion in interest annually, Vanderbilt University researchers\u00a0said in a September report.",
      "But a 10% cap could also have adverse consequences, experts added. Credit card companies would likely reduce credit for more than 80% of customers, with almost every account for people with credit scores below 740 closed or severely restricted to offset the reduced fees from a 10% cap, according to an analysis from the Electronic Payments Coalition, a financial industry trade group.",
      "Credit card spending also accounts for 30% to 40% of total annual consumer spending, so tighter credit for lower-income Americans could reduce overall consumer spending by roughly 5% \u2014 a significant economic hit, according to Morgan Stanley analysts.",
      "Housing's biggest problem",
      "Lastly, Mr. Trump is tackling housing affordability at a time when homeownership is increasingly out of reach for many Americans.",
      "His approach aims to tackle two core issues with the housing market \u2014 higher mortgage rates and competition for homes \u2014 by directing the federal government to\u00a0purchase $200 billion in mortgage bonds\u00a0and banning institutional investors from buying single-family homes.",
      "On Friday, the average rate for a 30-year mortgage dipped below 6%, its lowest level in three years. But experts said the strategies fail to address the housing market's biggest problem \u2014 a lack of available homes that stems from underbuilding after the Great Recession.",
      "\"The affordability crisis is fundamentally a supply problem, and meaningful relief requires adding homes, both through new construction or through inventory gains in chronically constrained markets, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest,\" said Realtor.com senior economist Jake Krimmel in an email.",
      "For that reason, banning institutional investors from single-family home purchases \"is unlikely to move the needle on affordability,\" he concluded.",

    "summary": "The number of ICE detainees exceeded 70,000 for the first time in the deportation agency's 23-year history, according to internal DHS data obtained by CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "The number of detainees in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody has reached a new record high, surpassing 70,000 for the first time in the deportation agency's 23-year history, according to internal Department of Homeland Security data obtained by CBS News.",
      "As of Thursday, ICE was holding about 73,000 individuals facing deportation in its custody across the country, the highest level recorded by the agency and an 84% increase from the same time in 2025, when its detention population hovered below 40,000, the internal statistics show.",
      "The Trump administration has said it is aiming to be able to detain upwards of 100,000 immigration detainees at any given time, as part of its government-wide effort to carry out a deportation crackdown of unprecedented proportions.",
      "Former senior U.S. immigration officials said they were not aware of any other period in American history when the U.S. government had held more people in immigration detention.",
      "\"It is absolutely a record, certainly in modern times,\" said Doris Meissner, a Clinton administration official who led the now-defunct Immigration and Naturalization Service, or INS, a predecessor of ICE and other federal immigration agencies.",
      "The DHS figures obtained by CBS News show nearly 67,000 of the individuals in ICE custody on Thursday were single adult detainees facing deportation because of alleged violations of U.S. immigration law. Another 6,000 detainees were classified as family units, or parents and underage children taken into custody as families for alleged immigration violations.",
      "ICE detains foreigners placed in deportation proceedings because of immigration violations, such as entering the U.S. illegally or overstaying a visa, as well as legal immigrants whose status lapses or is revoked because of criminal offenses. Some of those held by the agency have criminal charges or convictions, in addition to being accused of civil immigration violations.",
      "The internal DHS data indicates roughly 47% \u2014 or about 34,000 \u2014 of ICE's detainees had criminal charges or convictions in the U.S. The numbers do not include details on the severity of the criminal records, which can range from felonies and other serious crimes, to misdemeanors and immigration-related offenses.",
      "The rest of the detainees are classified by ICE as \"immigration violators,\" meaning they are neither convicted of crimes or facing charges in the U.S. and were being held solely due to civil immigration violations.",
      "While all three categories of ICE detainees \u2014 immigration violators, those with criminal charges and those with criminal convictions \u2014 have grown since the start of the second Trump administration, figures posted by the agency every two weeks show the non-criminal group has seen the most acute and rapid rise.",
      "When focusing solely on ICE detainees initially arrested by the agency \u2014 and not Border Patrol \u2014 there has been a 2,500% surge in non-criminal detainees from Jan. 26, 2025 (945) to Jan. 7, 2026 (24,644), according to the latest publicly available government data. During that time, the number of detainees arrested by ICE who have criminal convictions or charges has grown by 80% and 243%, respectively.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, DHS assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin said 70% of those arrested by ICE under the second Trump administration \u2014 not those currently in the agency's custody \u2014 have criminal charges or convictions in the U.S. She said those listed as \"immigration violators\" could have criminal histories abroad or terrorism ties.",
      "In regards to the growing detainee population, McLaughlin said, \"As we arrest and remove criminal illegal aliens and public safety threats from the U.S., ICE has worked diligently to obtain greater necessary detention space while avoiding overcrowding.\"",
      "\"Thanks to the One Big Beautiful Bill, ICE now has historic funding to secure enough detention capacity to maintain an average daily population of 100,000 illegal aliens and 80,000 new ICE beds,\" she added.",
      "The steady growth in ICE's detainee population over the past months comes after the agency received an unprecedented infusion of funding through the One Big Beautiful Act last year, including $45 billion alone to expand detention space. In addition to its traditional use of county jails and for-profit prisons, ICE has expanded its detention capacity by using other facilities, including military sites like Fort Bliss in Texas.",
      "Republican officials in places like Florida and Louisiana have offered state facilities, like the so-called \"Alligator Alcatraz\" detention center in the Everglades, to hold those facing deportation. ICE has also used field offices in major U.S. cities to hold detainees, often for days, even though such facilities are not designed for long-term detention.",
      "\"We are talking about a system that already, prior to the Big Beautiful Bill, constituted the largest detention and removal infrastructure of any country in the world \u2014 and now it's being put on steroids,\" said Meissner, now a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute, a non-partisan think tank.",
      "Under President Trump, ICE has been given a broad mandate to turbocharge immigration arrests and deportations, with the agency rescinding Biden-era rules that required officers to largely focus on arresting serious offenders, national security threats and recent arrivals in the U.S. illegally.",
      "The administration has dispatched thousands of ICE officers and Border Patrol agents to stage highly-visible raids in major American cities like Los Angeles and Chicago, where their tactics and use of force have been decried as overly harsh and indiscriminate by local leaders and some residents.",
      "Most recently, the administration has deployed roughly 3,000 ICE and Border Patrol agents to the streets of Minneapolis and surrounding communities, an operation DHS has called the largest in its history. Clashes and protests there have intensified since the killing of Minnesota resident Renee Good by an ICE officer last week.",

So far, the Justice Department has released 12,285 documents out of the more than two million that it must make available under the Epstein Files Transparency Act.",

    "summary": "Authorities said the alleged scheme involved 39 players, 17 different NCAA Division I men's basketball teams and 29 games.",
    "story": [
      "Federal prosecutors charged 26 people in an alleged point-shaving scheme involving dozens of college basketball players, authorities announced Thursday.",
      "U.S. Attorney David Metcalf said the scheme involved 39 players and 17 different NCAA Division I men's basketball teams, and alleged the conspiracy either fixed or attempted to fix 29 games.",
      "\"This was a massive scheme,\" Metcalf told reporters during a news conference in Philadelphia. \"It enveloped the world of college basketball.\"",
      "According to the indictment unsealed Thursday, players were allegedly bribed to tank games to enrich sports gamblers.",
      "\"This was a significant and rampant corruption of college athletics,\" Metcalf said.",
      "Some alleged attempts to fix games were unsuccessful for various reasons, including players who didn't cooperate with the scheme or others who failed to make games go a certain way, Metcalf said.",
      "\"In basketball, one player could substantially influence a game in ways that in other sports you cannot, but it's not a guarantee,\" Metcalf said. \"But by and large, the scheme was very successful.\"",
      "The allegations cover a period between September 2022 and February 2025. The indictment also includes allegations of  influencing or fixing Chinese Basketball Association men's basketball games.",
      "Some of the people allegedly involved in the scheme were former college players who are accused of bribing current college players to shave points on games so bettors could capitalize.",
      "Metcalf said the bribes could range between $10,000 and $30,000 per game. The people behind the alleged scheme are accused of finding games in which a corrupted player was on a team that was favored to lose and then bribing the player to deliberately underperform during the game and not cover the point spread, Metcalf said.",
      "\"For example, if a team was favored to lose by 4 points, the player would receive a bribe to underperform so that his team would lose by more than that,\" Metcalf said at a news conference announcing the charges in Philadelphia.",
      "Games involving the following teams were allegedly rigged or impacted, investigators say: Abilene Christian, Alabama State, Butler,\u00a0DePaul, Duquesne, East Carolina, Florida Atlantic, Fordham, Georgetown,\u00a0Kennesaw State, Kent State, La Salle, McNeese State, Nicholls State, Ohio University, St. Louis University, St. John's, SUNY Buffalo, Tulane and Western Michigan University.",
      "\"An extensive international criminal conspiracy of NCAA players, alumni and professional bettors who fixed games across the country and poisoned the American spirit of competition for monetary gain,\" Metcalf said.",
      "Tulane said in a statement it would cooperate with authorities \"where appropriate\" after Kevin Cross, a former forward for the school, was charged in the indictment. Cross was accused of taking a bribe of approximately $30,000 to keep Tulane from covering the spread in a 2024 game against East Carolina. Cross was also accused of discussing an attempt to fix a game later that year against Florida Atlantic, but the attempted fix wasn't successful, according to the indictment.",
      "CBS News was unable to reach Cross for a response to the allegations.",
      "Ohio University said that none of its players, coaches and staff were involved in the alleged scheme. According to the indictment, people involved in the scheme allegedly wanted SUNY Buffalo players to ensure that their team didn't cover the point spread for the first half of a game against Ohio in 2024.",
      "Brian Browne, a St. John's spokesperson, said in a statement provided to CBS News that neither the school or any of its current or former players were \"cited for wrongdoing in the indictment unsealed today.\"",
      "Kent State also said that it appeared in the indictment because of allegations made against another team. According to the indictment, SUNY Buffalo players attempted but ultimately failed to prevent their team from beating the spread in the first half of a 2024 game against Kent State.",
      "DePaul and La Salle said that none of their current players were named in the indictment and that the schools would cooperate with the investigation.",
      "The scheme initially unfolded when former Chicago Bulls player Antonio Blakeney allegedly colluded with professional sports bettors Marves Fairley and Shane Hennen to fix Chinese Basketball Association games, Metcalf said.",
      "\"The scheme proved lucrative,\" Metcalf said. \"Mr. Hennen, we allege, texted a confederate that the only things certain in life were 'death, taxes and Chinese basketball.'\"",
      "The scheme was then moved to the U.S., where other people were brought into the fold as it focused on recruiting NCAA players.",
      "\"They picked these men because they were well connected in the world of college basketball,\" Metcalf said. \"They knew the players, many of them were players themselves, they were alumni, they were trainers, they were recruiters, they were networkers, they were people of influence, and because of that influence, they added gravitas and legitimacy to the scheme.\"",
      "An attorney for Fairley, Eric Siegle, told CBS News on Friday they had no comment at this time about the allegations. CBS News has asked Hennen for comment but hasn't received a response.",
      "NCAA President Charlie Baker responded to the newly revealed allegations by saying that the organization has finished or opened investigations into almost all of the teams named.",
      "\"The pattern of college basketball game integrity conduct revealed by law enforcement today is not entirely new information to the NCAA,\" Baker said in a statement.",
      "The announcement comes less than three months after NBA mainstays Chauncey Billups, Terry Rozier and Damon Jones were among dozens of people arrested in a sweeping FBI crackdown on\u00a0alleged illegal gambling rings.",

      "The National Park Service said that parking lot construction was underway in September near the Quarry Exhibit Hall in the Utah side of the park when the dinosaur fossils were uncovered. Dinosaur National Monument is located on the border between Colorado and Utah, about 300 miles west of Denver.",
      "A portion of dinosaur-bearing sandstone was exposed when asphalt was removed on Sept. 16 by workers. Construction was immediately paused to allow paleontologists to assess and excavate the fossils.",
      "\"The fossils belong to a large, long-necked dinosaur, most like Diplodocus, which is common in this bonebed,\" the NPS said in a statement.",
      "Approximately 3,000 pounds of fossils and rock were removed during the excavation between mid-September and mid-October, the NPS said. The fossils are being cleaned and studied at the Utah Field House of Natural History State Park Museum in Vernal, Utah.",
      "According to NPS, the bonebed area had not been excavated for fossils since the original excavations at the site ended in 1924. Meanwhile, the parking lot and road improvement construction project was completed once the excavation was done.",
      "Research released last October suggests that dinosaur populations were still thriving in North America before an asteroid smacked the Earth 66 million years ago.",
      "In January 2025, a nearly\u00a070-million-year-old dinosaur fossil was discovered during a parking lot project at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science. It is the oldest dinosaur fossil ever found within Denver's city limits.",
      "\"This fossil comes from an era just before the mass extinction that wiped out the dinosaurs, and it offers a rare window into the ecosystem that once existed right beneath modern-day Denver,\" the museum's Curator of Geology, James Hagadorn, said at the time.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bankruptcy-filing-rise-consumer-business-epiq/",
    "published": "Fri, 16 Jan 2026 10:05:34 -0500",
    "summary": "The increase in bankruptcy filings comes as Americans face a slate of economic pressures, from sticky inflation to elevated borrowing costs.",
    "story": [
      "New data shows more Americans are filing for bankruptcy, the latest indication that\u00a0price pressures\u00a0and an uneven economy are leaving some households strapped for cash.",
      "Total consumer bankruptcy filings jumped 12% from 478,752 in 2024 to 533,949 in 2025, according to Epiq AACER, a platform that provides U.S. bankruptcy filing data. Epiq, which tracks Chapter 7, Chapter 11 and Chapter 13 filings, relies on data provided through the U.S. Courts' PACER system, an electronic database that houses federal court records.",
      "The surge in filings comes as American consumers \u2014 and businesses \u2014 face a slate of economic pressures, ranging from sticky inflation to elevated borrowing costs, experts told CBS News.",
      "John Rao, a senior attorney with the National Consumer Law Center, said Americans typically hold off on filing for bankruptcy as long as they can, meaning the conditions that led them to file for bankruptcy may not necessarily be tied to current economic issues.",
      "\"There is often a lag before economic conditions translate to higher bankruptcies,\" he said.",
      "Still, he said the rising cost of medical insurance, mounting credit card debt and the restart of student loan repayments are serving as some of the major catalysts for bankruptcies. Inflation has also made it tougher for Americans to cover expenses while paying down their debt, he added. Inflation has cooled since hitting a 40-year high in 2022, but prices are still rising faster than the Federal Reserve's 2% annual target.",
      "\"There comes a point where the mounting bills, the increasing balances on credit cards, all those things just weigh people down so much,\" Rao said.",
      "A\u00a0December CBS News poll\u00a0found most Americans are struggling to afford basic living costs in the U.S., including health care, food and housing.",
      "A bankruptcy filing can provide consumers with a financial reset, stopping collection calls and wiping out some or all of their debt. But the relief comes with trade-offs: Bankruptcy can severely damage a credit score, delay the ability to buy a home and make it tougher to qualify for loans in the future.",
      "Still, the process may be more common than you think: One in 10 Americans files for bankruptcy at some point during their lifetime, according to a 2025 LendingTree report.",
      "Commercial filings drift higher",
      "Commercial bankruptcies are also on the rise, with filings up 5% from 2024 to 2025, according to Epiq AACER's data. In 2025, consumers lost a number of national and regional retailers \u2014 including Forever 21 and Joann Fabrics \u2014 that failed to stay afloat even after seeking bankruptcy protection.",
      "Chapter 11 bankruptcies, which allow companies to restructure their finances, were up just 1% from 2024 to 2025, driven by higher interest rates in 2023 and 2024 along with inflation, according to Christopher Ward, the co-chair of bankruptcy and restructuring at Polsinelli Law Firm.",
      "Among the most notable recent filings is Saks Global, which filed for Chapter 11 on Wednesday. The parent company of Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman said it has secured financing that will allow it to keep stores open as the bankruptcy proceeds.",
      "Pre-pandemic normalization",
      "Experts emphasized that the increase in commercial and consumer bankruptcies represents a return to pre-pandemic norms.",
      "Bankruptcies dipped during COVID as an injection of government funding helped prop up cash-strapped businesses and American households. Forbearance plans also gave some mortgage payers and car owners more financial breathing room, said Michael Hunter, vice president of Epiq AACER.",
      "However, once those temporary relief measures faded, bankruptcy filings drifted higher, with data showing an upward trend since 2022.",
      "\"We're just slowly coming back to pre-COVID levels,\" Hunter said. \"Is it a huge event? No. Is it a big increase from what we've experienced over the past five years? Yes.\"",
      "While the overall number of bankruptcies is still below their pre-COVID levels, they could start to accelerate, Rao told CBS News.",
      "\"There's a good chance that filings will even be higher through this year and even into next year,\" he said.",

Prosecutors with the Utah County Attorney's Office plan to seek the death penalty if Robinson is convicted. Robinson has not yet entered a plea.",

The child, whose name was redacted from court filings, later texted with their father in the Utah County Attorney's Office to describe the chaotic events around the shooting, the filings from prosecutors and defense lawyers state.",
      "Defense attorneys say that personal relationship is a conflict of interest that \"raises serious concerns about past and future prosecutorial decision-making in this case,\" according to court documents. They also argue that the \"rush\" to seek the death penalty against Robinson is evidence of \"strong emotional reactions\" by the prosecution and merits the disqualification of the entire team.",
      "Several thousand people attended the outdoor rally where Kirk, a co-founder of Turning Point USA who helped mobilize young people to vote for President Trump, was shot as he took questions from the audience. The child of the deputy county attorney did not see the shooting, according to an affidavit submitted by prosecutors.",
      "\"While the second person in line was speaking with Charlie, I was looking around the crowd when I heard a loud sound, like a pop. Someone yelled 'he's been shot,'\" the child stated in the affidavit.",

      "\"Under these circumstances, there is virtually no risk, let alone a significant risk, that it would arouse such emotions in any father-prosecutor as to render him unable to fairly prosecute the case,\" Utah County Attorney Jeffrey Gray said in a filing.",
      "Gray also said the child was \"neither a material witness nor a victim in the case\" and that \"nearly everything\" the person knows about the actual homicide is mere hearsay.",
      "The Associated Press left email and telephone messages for Robinson's defense attorney, Kathryn Nester.",
      "Prosecutors have said text messages and DNA evidence connect Robinson to the killing. Robinson reportedly texted his romantic partner that he targeted Kirk because he had \"had enough of his hatred.\"",
      "At recent hearings, Robinson's legal team has pushed to limit media access in the high-profile case. Graf has prohibited media from publishing photos, videos and live broadcasts that show Robinson's restraints to help protect his presumption of innocence before a trial.",
      "The judge has not ruled on a suggestion by the defense to ban cameras in the courtroom.",
      "Prosecutors are expected to lay out their case against Robinson at a preliminary hearing scheduled to begin May 18.",

I was on this side,\" he continued. \"And I pulled the trigger by accident.\"",
      "Sabrina Rocuba says her father's story was very believable given the injury to his hand. \"We thought, like \u2026 well, who was gonna \u2013 who's gonna shoot themselves?\" \u00a0she said.",
      "Melissa Rocuba was in intensive care for three days when her family made the heart-wrenching decision to take her off life support. The next day, on Aug. 10, 2013, she was pronounced dead.",
      "The couple's daughters were devastated by the loss, but in the days that followed, they were so worried about their father that their focus was on comforting him. \"I kept wanting to make sure he was OK,\" said Cicio.",
      "Cicio said she was worried that her father might be arrested, so she recommended that he hire a top local attorney named Joe D'Andrea. But D'Andrea says he didn't have to do much to keep Bruno Rocuba out of jail. The Lackawanna County District Attorney's Office, he said, didn't have enough evidence to charge Bruno Rocuba with murder, so they didn't charge him at all.",
      "\"Not every shooting is a crime,\" said D'Andrea. \"He never wavered from his story \u2026 that it was an accident.\"",
      "But as time went by, Melissa Rocuba's daughters and her sister, Joanne Swinney, began to have second thoughts about the shooting and events that followed.",
      "For starters, said Swinney, Bruno Rocuba spent very little time by his wife's side as she lay dying. \"He would come there, maybe stay like an hour \u2026 and then leave,\" she said.",
      "While their mother was still on life support, Melissa Rocuba's daughters said their father asked them to clean his bloody house and get rid of the mattress on which their mother had been shot.",
      "\"He's like \u2026 I can't go home to that \u2026 I don't want to see all the blood,\" Cicio recalled. \"And here I am, 21, 22. \u2026 Now as an adult, I'm like, wow, I can't believe he asked us to do that.\"",
      "Melissa Rocuba's daughters said that even before their mother was buried, their father asked for help getting rid of her belongings.",
      "\"He wanted us to get rid of everything,\" Cicio told Green. \"It's like he wanted her erased.\"",
      "Sabrina Rocuba said her father even got rid of her mother's beloved 10-year-old Rottweiler, Zeus. \"My mom loved that dog. And my dad got rid of him right after my mom died,\" she says.",
      "Melissa Rocuba's sister said she was shocked when she saw that Bruno Rocuba had even removed all photographs of his wife. \"Bruno said he couldn't look at them \u2026 he was grieving, he couldn't look at them,\" said Swinney. She said Bruno Rocuba also got rid of her sister's entire wardrobe. \"We had to go down to the thrift store where they donated the clothes \u2026 and I had to get clothes for my sister to bury her in.\"",
      "But most alarming, said Cicio, was that within months of her mother's death, her father began dating a woman named Tonia Wilczewski. \"I remember looking out my window and she was cooking Christmas dinner in my mom's kitchen. I wasn't invited,\" she said.",
      "Swinney began to wonder if her sister's husband had been having an affair with Wilczewski prior to the shooting. Swinney said that not long after her sister's death, Melissa Rocuba's best friend got a call from Bruno Rocuba to ask her, \"How long do you think it is before, you know, you could kind of like go public with dating someone?\" And she said, \"Are you freaking kidding me?\"",
      "Wilczewski declined \"48 Hours'\" request for an interview but sent a text message that stated, \"There was never an affair.\"\u00a0 Bruno Rocuba never responded to requests for an interview.",
      "Despite their suspicions, Melissa Rocuba's daughters and sister said they didn't have enough evidence that her shooting was intentional, so they were forced to accept the district attorney's decision not to charge their father.",
      "Then, seven years after the shooting, in 2020, Pennsylvania State Police investigators Greg Allen and Dan Nilon were assigned to investigate open homicide cases, and this one caught their eye.",
      "\"What about this case stood out to you?\" asked Green. \"To me, it was the original 911 call,\" Corporal Allen explained. \"On the 911 call, I hear three different accounts of what happened.\"",
      "Bruno Rocuba had called 911 to report his wife's shooting, and when the operator asked, \"Was it self-inflicted?\" Rocuba said, \"No, we were fighting.\" Then he nervously changed his story and said that he had been \"playing with the gun\" and accidentally \"let it go off.\"",
      "Rocuba then denied any argument and changed his story a third time. He said that he had been handling the gun because he and his wife were \"going to go shooting,\" and that's when he accidentally pulled the trigger.",
      "Investigators Allen and Nilon then watched the videotape of Rocuba's police walkthrough and interview the day after the shooting, and said they heard several more inconsistencies in Rocuba's explanation of the shooting.",
      "\"There were so many red flags\u2026 that we knew he wasn't telling the truth,\" said Nilon.",
      "Corporal Nilon then did a deep dive into the case and discovered a key piece of evidence that had been collected at the Rocuba home but never been examined. A home security system that had captured footage of Melissa Rocuba's last movements and words.",
      "\"We were able to \u2026 hear \u2026 their last conversation together,\" says Nilon. \"And then a gunshot goes off.\"",
      "\"It may very well be your sister's own voice that ultimately put him behind bars,\" Green commented to Swinney.",
      "\"I never really thought about it like that. Yeah,\" Swinney replied.",
      "On June 3, 2022, nearly nine years after Melissa Rocuba's death, Bruno Rocuba was arrested and charged with her murder.",
      "But two years later, in May 2024, as Bruno Rocuba's trial approached, both sides agreed to a plea deal. Bruno Rocuba pleaded guilty to third-degree murder and was sentenced to 12 to 40 years behind bars. With time served, he will be up for parole starting in 2035.",

    "summary": "President Trump is threatening to invoke a centuries-old law to deploy troops to Minnesota. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Thursday he might invoke a centuries-old law known as the Insurrection Act to send troops into Minnesota, threatening a major escalation between the federal government and state officials.",
      "\"If the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don't obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E., who are only trying to do their job, I will institute the INSURRECTION ACT, which many Presidents have done before me, and quickly put an end to the travesty that is taking place in that once great State,\" the president wrote on Truth Social.",
      "Mr. Trump's threat comes amid protests over the deadly shooting of Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer and increased tensions over immigration operations in the Twin Cities. The administration has sent thousands of federal law enforcement agents to the state in recent weeks to investigate fraud and implement the latest phase of its immigration crackdown.",
      "The invocation of the Insurrection Act could clear the way for the Trump administration to deploy troops to the state over the objections of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz and local officials. Here's what to know about the law:",
      "What is the Insurrection Act?",
      "The Insurrection Act has its roots in the 1790s and evolved over the decades, with the last substantive amendment coming in 1874. The law as written gives the president broad authority to deploy troops and enlist state militias to address unrest on U.S. soil, largely at his own discretion.",
      "The statute has three main sections:",
      "The first says the president can deploy troops or militias if requested by a state to suppress an insurrection.\u00a0The second authorizes the president to send in forces unilaterally whenever he determines that \"unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion against the authority of the United States, make it impracticable to enforce the laws of the United States.\" He can deploy the troops \"as he considers necessary to enforce those laws or to suppress the rebellion.\"\u00a0The third section says the president can use the military to stop an insurrection or conspiracy that obstructs federal law or violates constitutional rights when states fail to protect them.",
      "The first says the president can deploy troops or militias if requested by a state to suppress an insurrection.",
      "The second authorizes the president to send in forces unilaterally whenever he determines that \"unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion against the authority of the United States, make it impracticable to enforce the laws of the United States.\" He can deploy the troops \"as he considers necessary to enforce those laws or to suppress the rebellion.\"",
      "The third section says the president can use the military to stop an insurrection or conspiracy that obstructs federal law or violates constitutional rights when states fail to protect them.",
      "\"The basic idea, which emerged early on in the United States, is that there might be circumstances when state and local law enforcement resources and state and local militia, now the National Guard, would not be able to adequately contain protests or disturbances on the ground in their communities,\" said William Banks, a professor emeritus at Syracuse University and expert on the domestic role of the military. \"So the Insurrection Act allows the president to call forth the regular military or other federal forces to come into state or local communities and engage in law enforcement in an emergency circumstance.\"",
      "When can the Insurrection Act be used?",
      "The law leaves it up to the president to determine when it should be invoked.",
      "Joseph Nunn, a counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice who has studied the statute extensively, said the act has historically been a \"tool for emergency situations when civilian authorities are overwhelmed by some sudden crisis \u2014 an insurrection, mass civil unrest.\"",
      "The law gives the president wide latitude to determine when an insurrection exists and how long troops can be used to address it. But \"broad discretion is not the same thing as infinite discretion, and broad discretion can be abused,\" Nunn said.",
      "\"The Insurrection Act was written to apply when all hell breaks loose. And when all hell breaks loose, of course, is in the eye of the beholder,\" Banks said. He noted that the basis for triggering the act \"is incredibly open-ended\" and the statute \"basically says the president can do this whenever he determines that it's impractical to enforce the laws.\"",
      "\"There are no procedural requirements, like a consultation with state and local officials, reports to Congress, sunsets \u2014 you know, do it for 30 days or 60 days, but then you've got to get out unless Congress renews it by statute, something like that,\" Banks said. \"It's just open-ended. The president does it. He does it on his own say so, and he doesn't have any particular criteria to follow.\"",
      "An 1878 law known as the Posse Comitatus Act generally forbids the use of the military for law enforcement purposes. But the Insurrection Act is the law's \"most important exception,\" said Nunn, and its invocation means the Posse Comitatus Act does not apply.",
      "When has the Insurrection Act been invoked?",
      "The Insurrection Act and its predecessor have been used to address 30 crises over the years, according to a tally by the Brennan Center. It was invoked most recently in 1992, when President George H.W. Bush ordered troops deployed to California to suppress the L.A. riots at the request of the state's governor.",
      "The law has typically been invoked when states request assistance from the federal government. Presidents have invoked the act unilaterally only five times in the past 130 years, all during the Civil Rights Era, according to Nunn.",
      "In 1957, President Dwight D. Eisenhower federalized the Arkansas National Guard and sent in the 101st Airborne Division to Little Rock to enforce desegregation. Kennedy invoked the Insurrection Act three times over the objections of state officials, once in Mississippi and twice in Alabama. Johnson also used the law unilaterally in Alabama in 1965.",
      "\"The idea is that it should rarely, if ever, be invoked, and indeed, in our history, it hasn't been utilized very often,\" Banks said.",
      "Has Trump used the Insurrection Act before?",
      "No, but he has threatened to.",
      "In 2020, Mr. Trump entertained the possibility of invoking the Insurrection Act to deploy troops to cities across the U.S. in response to widespread racial unrest following the killing of George Floyd.",
      "\"If a city or a state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them,\" he said in a speech at the White House in June 2020. He ultimately decided against doing so, with reports at the time indicating that administration officials were split over deploying troops.",
      "Mr. Trump has also floated the use of the act since returning to the White House last year. In October, he told reporters that \"if I want to enact a certain act, I'm allowed to do it routinely,\" an apparent reference to the law.",
      "\"And I'd be allowed to do whatever I want,\" Mr. Trump added. \"But we haven't chosen to do that because \u2026 we're doing very well without it. But I'd be allowed to do that, you understand that, and the courts wouldn't get involved, nobody would get involved, and I could send the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, I can send anybody I wanted. But I haven't done that because we're doing so well without it.\"",
      "Hasn't Trump sent troops into other cities?",
      "Yes, but he hasn't used the Insurrection Act to do so, and a recent Supreme Court decision limited his ability to send in troops under a separate authority.",
      "Last year, Mr. Trump ordered the deployment of National Guard troops to cities in California, Illinois, Tennessee and Oregon, as well as Washington, D.C., under an authority known as Title 10, the portion of the federal code that deals with the armed forces. The administration argued the troops were needed to support immigration agents and protect federal property.",
      "Several cities and states where officials objected to the troops being deployed filed lawsuits seeking to block them. In one case, the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago sought an order barring the government from mobilizing and sending troops to the Chicago area, arguing Mr. Trump's federalization and deployment of the Illinois National Guard was illegal. A district judge agreed and blocked the administration's plans.",
      "The dispute made its way to the Supreme Court. In December, the justices declined to freeze the lower court order in a narrow, preliminary 6-3 decision. A week later, Mr. Trump said the National Guard was leaving Chicago, Los Angeles and Portland.",
      "\"I think the Supreme Court ruling certainly makes it more likely that they will try to use the Insurrection Act,\" Nunn said, while noting that the justices did not decide the case on the merits.",
      "Why is Trump threatening to invoke the Insurrection Act in Minnesota?",
      "The president said in his Truth Social post that he might invoke the law to protect the 3,000 ICE agents and other federal officers who have been sent to Minnesota in recent weeks as part of the administration's immigration crackdown and fraud investigations.",
      "The administration has targeted Minnesota on a number of fronts in recent weeks amid renewed scrutiny over massive fraud schemes that have been uncovered in the state over the past several years. The president and other administration officials have pinned the blame for the scandal on Walz, the governor and Democratic nominee for vice president in 2024. The increased immigration operations in Minnesota are taking place alongside a surge in federal resources aimed at investigating fraud.",
      "Local officials have said the federal agents are responsible for inflaming tensions on the ground, pointing to the heavy-handed tactics of ICE agents and the deadly shooting of Good last week. Administration officials have said the agent was acting in self-defense and that protesters and activists are obstructing federal law enforcement.",
      "Invoking the Insurrection Act would let the president deploy National Guard or active-duty troops to Minnesota to protect immigration agents and federal buildings. Using the act would, in theory, place the deployments on firmer legal ground than previous deployments.",
      "But Nunn, the Brennan Center scholar, said the events in Minnesota do not warrant invoking the act.",
      "\"Basically, it exists for a kind of narrow set of crisis situations, and none of the criteria that would justify an invocation of the Insurrection Act are present in Minnesota,\" Nunn said. \"What exactly is the insurrection? There is no insurrection. Are the insurrectionists the people of Minneapolis? Who exactly is being protected?\"",
      "Nunn said that it's \"hard to say how much unrest there actually is.\"",
      "\"But to the extent that there is any, it's largely being fomented by the lawlessness and violence of ICE and [Customs and Border Protection]. And to the extent that there is violence, it is primarily being perpetrated by ICE and CBP,\" he said. \"And the government can't go to an American city and foment unrest through lawless, violent conduct and then turn around and invoke the Insurrection Act, claiming that they need to do this to suppress that unrest.\"",
      "Could a court block Trump's invocation of the Insurrection Act?",
      "Yes, but a legal fight would take place in largely uncharted territory, according to Nunn. A president's invocation of the Insurrection Act has never been blocked by a court.",
      "\"There's very little case law on this subject,\" Nunn said. \"One, the Insurrection Act simply isn't invoked very often. It's a tool that's used very rarely. Two, it has never been flagrantly abused in this way. There have been invocations of the Insurrection Act that I would say weren't perfectly justified, weren't obviously necessary, but it has never been outright abused.\"",
      "Nunn said that \"no state has ever challenged an invocation of the Insurrection Act and there's only ever been one case where anyone\" has, a Supreme Court case known as Martin v. Mott in 1827. That decision found that the president has broad emergency powers, but Nunn said the particulars of the case mean it might not \"reflect a general rule.\"",
      "\"The available judicial precedent, which is very limited, suggests that there's a fairly narrow set of circumstances where using the Insurrection Act is appropriate,\" Nunn said. \"Your argument would almost certainly be that the president has exceeded the scope of his discretion with the statute, that he's using it for a situation that Congress did not intend to authorize.\"",

    "summary": "Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum has sought to placate President Trump and build a strong relationship between the U.S. and Mexico.",
    "story": [
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Friday that efforts to crack down on Mexican cartels and slow migration north were showing \"compelling results\" in an effort to head off intervention talk by the Trump administration.",
      "The comments come after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened action against Mexican drug cartels by U.S. forces last week. Mr. Trump told Fox News last week that the United States had \"knocked out 97% of the drugs coming in by water\" and that the U.S. was \"going to start now hitting land, with regard to the cartels.\" The Trump administration has also begun to\u00a0add militarized zones to the southern border.",
      "Sheinbaum, a leftist who boasts of taking on chaos with a \"cool head,\" has sought to placate Mr. Trump and, unlike Maduro, has worked to build out a strong relationship between the Mexican and U.S. governments. A dramatic\u00a0United States military raid on Venezuela that deposed\u00a0former president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in early January set much of Latin America on edge, fueling concern that Mr. Trump could soon turn American forces on other nations, particularly Cuba and Mexico.",
      "On Thursday night, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Mexican Foreign Secretary Juan Ram\u00f3n de la Fuente released a joint statement after a phone call, saying they agreed \"more must be done to confront shared threats.\"",
      "Sheinbaum, mentioning the call on Friday in her morning press briefing, said that Mexico's government had made significant progress cracking down on cartels, citing a steep drop in the homicide rate, much lower fentanyl seizures by U.S. authorities at the border and sparse migration. Mexican authorities seized over 1,500 pounds of methamphetamine from clandestine laboratories in the country earlier this week.",
      "She noted it was a joint effort with the U.S.\"There are very compelling results from the joint cooperation and the work that Mexico has been doing,\" she said.",
      "She reiterated her call for the United States to stop arms trafficking into Mexico and highlighted drug use in the U.S. as a key factor fueling cartel violence in Mexico.",
      "\"The other side also has to do its part. This consumption crisis they have over there also has to be addressed from a public health perspective, through education campaigns,\" she said.",
      "Sheinbaum and Mr. Trump also spoke by phone Monday. Sheinbaum said it was a \"very good conversation.\"",
      "\"We told him, so far it's going very well, it's not necessary, and furthermore there is Mexico's sovereignty and territorial integrity and he understood,\" she said.",

      "The delegation is led by Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, and Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina. Addressing reporters after the meeting, Coons said that the delegation \"spoke about the value of NATO and the commitment to respecting the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and self-determination.\"",
      "\"And we spoke with clarity about the importance of the people of Greenland make their decisions about their future. So, it was a constructive and hopeful dialogue,\" he said.",
      "Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska, said Greenland needs to be treated as \"our ally, not as an asset.\"",

      "Murkowski said Congress has some tools at their disposal, particularly the power of the purse, to address the Greenland issue, although she emphasized the goal of the trip is to hear directly from the people of Greenland and Denmark.",
      "The White House had said Thursday that discussions involving Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Danish officials in Washington earlier this week were \"technical talks on the acquisition of Greenland.\" That claim has been strongly rejected by Denmark's Foreign Minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen, who told Danish broadcaster TV2 that if the U.S. side comes to more talks with that mindset then it will be a \"a very, very short series of meetings.\"",
      "U.S. Special Envoy to Greenland Jeff Landry told Fox News Friday that he believes a deal can be achieved on the U.S. acquiring Greenland and that he plans to visit the island in March.",
      "\"The president is serious. I think he's laid the markers down. He's told Denmark what he's looking for, and now it's a matter of having Secretary Rubio and Vice President JD Vance make a deal,\" Landry said, according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "Greenland\u2014 the world's largest island, which lies between the Arctic and Atlantic oceans \u2014 is a self-governing Danish territory. Its strategic location and natural resources have attracted growing attention from President Trump.",
      "The leaders of both Denmark and Greenland have repeatedly rejected\u00a0the idea of a U.S. takeover of the island. Earlier this week Rasmussen, Denmark's top diplomat, said his country and the U.S. still had \"fundamental\" differences over Greenland's future but would continue to talk.",
      "Mr. Trump has argued that the U.S. needs to control the vast, largely frozen island for national security reasons, to counter the geopolitical threat posed by Russia and China. The president has not ruled out seizing the territory through military force.",
      "Speaking at the University of Copenhagen Friday, Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, a ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who is taking part in the congressional visit, told attendees that \"millions of Americans are deeply concerned by the recent rhetoric about the United States taking over Greenland, either buying it or using military force.\"",
      "\"That rhetoric doesn't just undermine our bilateral relationship, it undermines the NATO Alliance at a time when our adversaries seek to benefit from division,\" Shaheen said. \"(Russian President) Vladimir Putin would welcome any move that fractures NATO or diverts attention and resources away from Ukraine,\" Shaheen said.",
      "Denmark is a member of the U.S.-led military alliance and several NATO members have expressed concern about the Trump administration's rhetoric regarding Greenland.",
      "On Thursday, Danish soldiers arrived there, as did troops from NATO partners including France, Germany and the Netherlands in an effort to bolster the island's security.",
      "\"At the request of Denmark, I have decided that France will participate in the joint exercises organized by Denmark in Greenland, Operation Arctic Endurance,\" French president Emmanuel Macron said in a social media post Wednesday.",
      "Speaking to reporters at a press briefing Thursday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the presence of European troops in Greenland doesn't impact Mr. Trump's \"goal of the acquisition of Greenland at all.\"",
      "Earlier this month, the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, the U.K. and Greenland said \"Greenland belongs to its people\" in a joint statement, while stressing that America's NATO allies are taking security in the Arctic region seriously.",
      "\"NATO has made clear that the Arctic region is a priority and European Allies are stepping up. We and many other Allies have increased our presence, activities and investments, to keep the Arctic safe and to deter adversaries,\" the statement said.",
      "Potential military action by the United States in Greenland could jeopardize the eight-decade-old NATO alliance. Under Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, an armed attack against one NATO member is considered an attack against the entire alliance. Any U.S. action in Greenland could undermine that central principle.",
      "Article 5 has been triggered only once in history, following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States. In the subsequent U.S. led invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, NATO allies including Denmark provided military support to the United States on the ground.",

    "story": [
      "Breaking with the United States, Canada has agreed to cut its 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars in return for lower tariffs on Canadian farm products, Prime Minister Mark Carney said Friday.",
      "Carney made the announcement after two days of meetings with Chinese leaders. He said there would be an initial annual cap of 49,000 vehicles on Chinese EV exports to Canada, growing to about 70,000 over five years. China will reduce its total tariff on canola seeds, a major Canadian export, from 84% to about 15%, he told reporters.",
      "Carney said China has become a more predictable partner to deal with than the U.S., the country's neighbor and longtime ally.",
      "\"Our relationship has progressed in recent months with China. It is more predictable and you see results coming from that,\" Carney said.",
      "Carney hasn't been able to reach a deal with President Trump to reduce some tariffs that are punishing some key sectors of the Canadian economy and Mr. Trump has previously talked about making Canada the 51st state.",
      "The prime minister, speaking outside against the backdrop of a traditional pavilion and a frozen pond at a Beijing park, said meetings in China have been historic and productive.",
      "Earlier Friday, he and Chinese leader Xi Jinping pledged to improve relations between their two nations after years of acrimony.",
      "Xi told Carney in a meeting at the Great Hall of the People that he is willing to continue working to improve ties, noting that talks have been underway on restoring and restarting cooperation since the two held an initial meeting in October on the sidelines of a regional economic conference in South Korea.",
      "\"It can be said that our meeting last year opened a new chapter in turning China-Canada relations toward improvement,\" China's top leader said.",
      "Carney looks to improve global governance",
      "Carney, the first Canadian prime minister to visit China in eight years, told Xi that better relations would help improve a global governance system that he described as \"under great strain.\"",
      "Later, he said at the news conference that the system may give way at least in part to country-to-country or regional agreements rather than the global ones that have underpinned economic growth in the post-World War II era.",
      "\"The question is: What gets built in that place? How much of a patchwork is it?\" he said.",
      "The new reality reflects in large part the so-called America-first approach of Mr. Trump. The tariffs he has imposed have hit both the Canadian and Chinese economies. Carney, who has met with several leading Chinese companies in Beijing, said ahead of his trip that his government is focused on building an economy less reliant on the U.S. at what he called \"a time of global trade disruption.\"",
      "A Canadian business owner in China called Carney's visit game-changing, saying it re-establishes dialogue, respect and a framework between the two nations.",
      "\"These three things we didn't have,\" said Jacob Cooke, the CEO of WPIC Marketing + Technologies, which helps exporters navigate the Chinese market. \"The parties were not talking for years.\"",
      "Canada had been aligned with U.S. on tariffs",
      "Canada had followed the U.S. in putting tariffs of 100% on EVs from China and 25% on steel and aluminum under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Carney's predecessor.",
      "China responded by imposing duties of 100% on Canadian canola oil and meal and 25% on pork and seafood. It added a 75.8% tariff on canola seeds last August. Collectively, the import taxes effectively closed the Chinese market to Canadian canola, an industry group has said. Overall, China's imports from Canada fell 10.4% last year to $41.7 billion, according to Chinese trade data.",
      "Carney tried to address the concerns of Canadian automakers and autoworkers by saying the initial cap on Chinese EV imports was about 3% of the 1.8 million vehicles sold in Canada annually and that, in exchange, China is expected to begin investing in the Canadian auto industry within three years.",
      "More than half of the Chinese EVs exported to Canada would have an import price of less than 35,000 Canadian dollars ($25,000) within five years, he said, making them accessible to consumers.",
      "\"We're building (a) new part of our car industry, building cars of the future in partnership, bringing affordable autos for Canadians at a time when affordability is top of mind, and doing it at a scale that allows for a smooth transition in the sector,\" he said.",
      "\"For the exchange of a small piece of the Canadian market, we have a commitment. We are waiting for an investment commitment in Canada. The real leaders of the new industry. So it's an agreement that will create the future for our industry.\"",
      "China sees an opening under Trump",
      "China is hoping Mr. Trump's pressure tactics on allies such as Canada will drive them to pursue a foreign policy that is less aligned with the United States.",
      "Carney, though, noted Canada's relationship with the U.S. is much more multifaceted, deeper and broader. Canada and China have different systems and disagree on issues such as human rights, he said, limiting the scope of their engagement even as they seek ways to cooperate on areas of common interest.",

    "story": [
      "CIA director John Ratcliffe met with Venezuela's interim President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez for two hours Thursday in Venezuela's capital, Caracas, to \"deliver the message that the United States looks forward to an improved working relationship,\" a U.S. official told CBS News Friday.",
      "The official described the trip as historic, noting that Ratcliffe was the first Cabinet-level official to visit Venezuela since the U.S. military operation to remove the country's autocratic leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro nearly two weeks ago.",
      "At the meeting, which was first reported by The New York Times, Ratcliffe was said to convey a warning that Venezuela must stop supporting drug trafficking.",
      "\"During the meeting in Caracas, Director Ratcliffe discussed potential opportunities for economic collaboration and that Venezuela can no longer be a safe haven for America's adversaries, especially narcotraffickers,\" the official said.",
      "The meeting came the same day that President Trump met with Venezuela's opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado at the White House.",
      "Though Mr. Trump has publicly praised Machado, the administration appears to view Rodr\u00edguez \u2014 who was vice president under Maduro \u2014\u00a0 as more capable of maintaining stability in Venezuela in the near term.",
      "That aligns with the findings of a CIA analytic assessment that modeled potential political leadership scenarios in Venezuela if Maduro were no longer president, CBS News can confirm. The analysis, which was closely held and briefed to a limited group of senior administration officials, concluded that existing Maduro-aligned officials \u2014 including Rodr\u00edguez \u2014 would be best positioned to maintain short-term stability.",
      "During his Senate confirmation hearings last year, Ratcliffe promised that, as he put it, the agency would be less risk-averse under his leadership. This visit to Caracas reflected the U.S. intelligence chief's belief that he would not ask the CIA workforce to take risks he would not take himself, the U.S. official told CBS News.",
      "CBS News has previously reported that the CIA had a small team operating clandestinely on the ground in Venezuela as early as August to lay the groundwork for Maduro's capture, including a human asset helping it track Maduro.",
      "After months of preparation that included building a replica of Maduro's compound and studying his daily habits, U.S. forces arrived at the Venezuelan president's residence just after 2 a.m. local time on Jan. 3.",
      "The surprise operation involved U.S. forces dismantling and disabling Venezuela's air defense systems as U.S. military helicopters neared Caracas, and U.S. military personnel deployed weapons \"to ensure the safe passage of the helicopters into the target area,\"\u00a0 Joint Chiefs chairman Gen. Dan Caine said earlier this month.",
      "Maduro was apprehended along with his wife, Cilia Flores, and brought to the U.S. to face charges including charges of narco-terrorism, conspiracy to commit narco-terrorism, drug trafficking, money laundering and corruption.",
      "Maduro and Flores appeared before U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein in a federal courthouse in lower Manhattan on Jan. 5.",
      "\"I'm innocent. I'm not guilty \u2014 I'm a decent man,\" Maduro said through an interpreter, insisting that he was \"still president of my country.\"",
      "Maduro has long been accused of human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings, torture and repression during his rule over the South American country. He kept his grip on power despite what the U.S. called \"overwhelming evidence\" that he lost reelection in 2024 to opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia.",
      "U.N. experts at the United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner have expressed concern over the U.S.'s unilateral action to abduct Maduro as a potential violation of international law.",

    "story": [
      "Scientists have uncovered the mummified remains of cheetahs from caves in northern Saudi Arabia.",
      "The remains range from 130 years old to over 1,800 years old. Researchers excavated seven mummies along with the bones of 54 other cheetahs from a site near the city of Arar, calling the discovery \"serendipitous.\"",
      "Mummification prevents decay by preserving dead bodies. Egypt's mummies are the most well-known, but the process can also happen naturally in places like glacier ice, desert sands and bog sludge.",
      "The new large cat mummies have cloudy eyes and shriveled limbs, resembling dried-out husks.",
      "\"It's something that I've never seen before,\" said Joan Madurell-Malapeira with the University of Florence in Italy, who was not involved with the discovery.",
      "The findings were detailed in a\u00a0study published Thursday in the journal Communications Earth and Environment. Researchers said the discovery offers \"unprecedented insights into the evolutionary history and extinction of cheetahs in Saudi Arabia.\"",
      "Researchers aren't sure how exactly these new cats got mummified, but the caves' dry conditions and stable temperature could have played a role. They also don't know why so many cheetahs were in the caves. It could have been a denning site where mothers birthed and raised their young.",
      "It's uncommon for large mammals to be preserved to this degree. Besides being in the right environment, the carcasses also have to avoid becoming a snack for hungry scavengers like birds and hyenas.",
      "To find such intact evidence of cheetahs that lived long ago in this part of the world is \"entirely without precedent,\" study author Ahmed Boug with the National Center for Wildlife in Saudi Arabia said in an email.",
      "Cheetahs once roamed across most of Africa and parts of Asia, but now live in just 9% of their previous range and haven't been spotted across the Arabian Peninsula for decades. That's likely due to habitat loss, unregulated hunting and lack of prey, among other factors.",

      "The countries involved in the diplomatic push include Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt and Oman, according to the Gulf official. The talks have focused on lowering the temperature in public rhetoric and avoiding military action that these states feared could trigger wider regional instability.",
      "To the U.S., the message has been to refrain from strikes on Iran, citing the region's security and economic vulnerabilities, while highlighting the risk that the U.S. could ultimately be affected as well.",

      "Thousands of American forces who are stationed in the Gulf region could be targets of potential Iranian retaliation in the event of a U.S. attack on Iran.

      "Two diplomatic sources told CBS News on Wednesday that Iran explicitly informed a number of countries that they would be targets of an Iranian missile attack if the U.S. were to strike. The U.S. embassies in Qatar and Saudi Arabia told Americans on Wednesday to avoid going to military bases in those two countries.",
      "\"Collectively, there's an agreement that once this spirals into an armed military escalation, there could be lots of consequences,\" the Gulf official told CBS News. \"Tensions have cooled temporarily, but we've still yet to see. The next period will also be crucial.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters earlier Wednesday that many stories on Iran \"have been based on anonymous sources who are pretending or guessing to know the president's thinking.\" Leavitt said Mr. Trump \"continues to closely monitor\" the situation in Iran, and will \"keep all of his options on the table.\"",

      "Meanwhile, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has warned Mr. Trump against military strikes, urging U.S. officials to \"halt their deceitful actions\" earlier this week. Iran temporarily closed its airspace overnight on Wednesday, indicating it may have been preparing for possible military action.",
      "But on Wednesday, the president suggested a military strike on Iran may not be imminent, telling reporters he'd heard the \"killing in Iran is stopping.\" Asked if that means military options are off the table, Mr. Trump said: \"We're going to watch and see what the process is.\"",

      "Russia says geopolitical tension in the Arctic is of \"the gravest concern,\" as European NATO members ramp up for war games in the region and Moscow seeks to highlight the disagreement between the Trump administration and its closest allies over Greenland.",
      "\"NATO has embarked on a course of accelerated militarization of the North, increasing its military presence there under the fictitious pretext of a growing threat from Moscow and Beijing,\" Russia's embassy in Belgium said in a statement late Wednesday.",
      "The statement went on to say that Russia advocates for peace, cooperation and dialogue in the region, but that, \"NATO members show no disposition to resolve issues in a constructive manner.\"",
      "\"The militaristic spirit within the alliance is only growing stronger, and given the disagreements that have emerged within the bloc over the Greenland issue, its ability to reach agreements is becoming increasingly unpredictable, including on Arctic matters,\" the Russian embassy said. \"We consider the alliance's line of escalating confrontation in the Arctic to be counterproductive and extremely dangerous.\"",
      "The statement came as top Trump administration officials met in Washington with Danish and Greenlandic officials to discuss Mr. Trump's repeated vows to make the vast, largely frozen island part of the United States. The White House says the U.S. needs control of the resource-rich island, long a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark, for security reasons, claiming that Russia and China will otherwise take it over.",

      "Maps show why Greenland is so important as the Arctic warms",
      "America's European allies, and Greenland's own government, have vehemently rejected the notion of the U.S. taking control of the island, by any means, and argued that U.S. ownership is unnecessary for security reasons, as Greenland is already NATO territory.",
      "After the meeting, Denmark's foreign minister said his country and the U.S. still had \"fundamental\" differences over Greenland's future, but would continue to talk.",
      "EU leaders, meanwhile, have also sought to acknowledge Mr. Trump's concerns about rising security threats around Greenland.",
      "\"Geopolitical tensions have spread to the Arctic,\" Denmark's defense ministry said in a statement on Wednesday. \"The Government of Greenland, and the Danish Ministry of Defence have therefore decided to continue the Danish Armed Forces' increased exercise activity in Greenland, in close cooperation with NATO allies.\"",
      "\"The purpose is to train the ability to operate under the unique Arctic conditions and to strengthen the alliance's footprint in the Arctic, benefiting both European and transatlantic security,\" the ministry said.",
      "\"Don't listen to Russian propaganda,\" Lars-Christian Brask, vice-chair of the Danish Parliament's Foreign Policy Committee, told CBS News on Thursday, calling the meeting in Washington between U.S., European and Greenlandic officials positive despite the lack of a resolution to the matter.",
      "\"I think it's positive that the clear disagreement that is there between Denmark, Greenland and the U.S. will be taken into a platform, a high level working group,\" Brask said, calling it \"a good way of continuing finding out what we can do to solve this situation.\"",
      "\"It's all about talking. It's about communicating. It's trying to solve an issue that wasn't solvable in an hour's meeting yesterday,\" Brask said.",
      "Aaja Chemnitz, a Greenlandic member of Denmark's Parliament, told CBS News on Thursday, \"Many of us were concerned that it would be the same as Zelenskyy when he was in the White House, and therefore, taking into account the whole situation, I think it was a success.\"",
      "\"What I hear from back home [in Greenland], which I think is very important to also emphasize, is that children are concerned. They're talking about their concerns at school. We have elders that are not sleeping because they are concerned. I think all of this that has happened has been offensive towards us. I think some of it has been appalling. And therefore, it's important to take out the intensity. And a little bit has been taken out from the meeting yesterday, but this is a marathon and not a short sprint, and we need to make sure that Greenland and Denmark stay as close an ally in this situation,\" Chemnitz said.",
      "Mr. Trump has disparaged efforts by Denmark to increase security for Greenland, saying Wednesday in a post on social media: \"Two dogsleds won't do it! Only the USA can!!!\"",
      "Denmark says it's invested almost $14 billion in Arctic security, and ahead of the military drills in the region, its European partners also signaled their investment in the island's defense.",
      "A small number of European troops were arriving in Greenland Thursday to participate in the upcoming exercise. Germany said it was sending 13 troops to Greenland's capital Nuuk. The Netherlands said it would be working with NATO to conduct joint reconnaissance ahead of the military exercise, and sending one officer from its navy, and Finland said it would be sending two liaison officers.",
      "A small group of French troops had arrived in Greenland as well, French President Emmanuel Macron said.",
      "Addressing military personnel in Istres, France, on Thursday, Macron said, \"history forgives neither lack of preparation nor weakness.\"",
      "\"Europeans have a particular responsibility, as this territory [Greenland] belongs to the European Union \u2026 An initial military team is already on the ground and will be reinforced in the coming days with land, air, and sea assets,\" Macron said.",

    "summary": "As Trump steps back from threats against Iran, Kurdish Iranian opposition group says it's ready to help topple the regime, but the time isn't right yet.",
    "story": [
      "In the mountains of northern Iraq, just 30 miles from the Iranian border, CBS News met Thursday morning with fighters \u2014   many of them women \u2014   from an armed Kurdish Iranian opposition group who say they're poised to take on and help topple the Islamic Republic's hardline clerical rulers.",
      "The Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI) is banned as a terror group inside Iran and based in exile across the border in Iraq. For years it has trained for the day the Iranian regime can be ousted from power. But as President Trump appears to step back from threats of a U.S. military intervention on behalf of Iran's protesters, the Kurdish group's leader told CBS News that time has not yet come.",
      "President Trump said Wednesday that he'd heard on \"good authority\" that the \"killing in Iran is stopping\" and that there was \"no plan for executions\" in the country following a brutal crackdown to end two weeks of widespread protests. Sources inside Iran have told CBS News the Iranian authorities' crackdown may have killed upwards of 12,000 people, and possibly many more.",
      "His remarks appeared to signal a step back from repeated warnings of an unspecified U.S. intervention to protect protesters, and then a threat on Tuesday to order \"very strong actions\" if Iran hanged protesters.",
      "That may not have been the signal from Washington that the PDKI forces training across the border in Iraq were hoping for.",
      "Commander Sayran Gargoli told CBS News the protests had given them hope that the oppressive regime that came to power with the 1979 Islamic Revolution might finally be toppled, but only \"if the people who are demonstrating on the street get international help.\"",
      "PDKI leader Mustafa Hijri has lived in exile for more than four decades, and he's watched as Iran's rulers quash several rounds of major unrest. As the latest protests seem to suffer the same fate, he said he couldn't say for sure whether this uprising might prove pivotal.",
      "\"It depends on if the widespread killing will continue or not. If it continues, for sure the demonstrators will not be able to continue. On the other hand, there are other possible scenarios, like America gets into negotiations with the regime of mullahs and forces them to accept its conditions. In this case, the regime will manage to extend its existence for some time.\"",
      "He said he hoped for a U.S. intervention, and specifically, strikes on Iran that \"hit the centers of suppressing forces who are shooting people on the streets, and their so-called 'justice' institutions that serve the government. We want to see those institutions gone.\"",
      "\"The majority of the people in Iran are unhappy with this regime, and they stand against it,\" Hijri said.",
      "But in the absence of such help from abroad, Hijri told CBS News that sending PDKI forces across the border \u2014   and calling into action the thousands of forces he says the group has lying in wait inside the country \u2014 could backfire dramatically.",
      "\"I believe that it is not in the benefit of the demonstrators at the moment to have armed forces move back in the country, because it becomes a convenient excuse to the regime to kill the people,\" he said. \"This is why we haven't reached the moment to make such a decision. But when the day comes, and we come to a conclusion that the return of our peshmerga [Kurdish] forces will not become additional reason to suppress the demonstrators, then we might do that.\"",
      "Hijri said the PDKI wants Kurds, who form about 10% of Iran's population, and other ethnic minorities to be allowed to live \"under democratic law, and that their children are allowed to learn in their own languages, and that the government officially recognizes\" their right to do so.",
      "The opposition fighters, Hijri said, \"have been trained, and they are there, ready for when the party needs them.\"",
      "But as Iran's hardline leaders increasingly appear to have survived yet another significant challenge to their grip on power, at least for now, the PKDI, and millions of Iranians still inside the country, can only keep waiting.",

    "published": "Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:56:56 -0500",
    "summary": "Years after the first reports of Havana Syndrome emerged, U.S. officials have obtained and are testing a device\u200b that could be linked to the debilitating condition.",
    "story": [
      "There's a new development in the yearslong international mystery over Havana Syndrome: The U.S. has obtained and has been testing a device that officials believe could be linked to the debilitating condition.",
      "Sources said the device was quietly obtained by the Department of Homeland Security in late 2024, almost a decade after symptoms of what became known as Havana Syndrome were first reported by U.S. embassy personnel in Cuba. The Pentagon has since been testing the portable, backpack-sized device, which emits pulsed, radio-frequency energy and contains components of Russian origin.",
      "The sources said Homeland Security investigators believe it may be capable of reproducing the effects described by victims of Havana Syndrome. The Pentagon and DHS did not immediately reply to requests for comment, and the CIA declined to comment.",
      "Here's what to know about the mysterious illness.",
      "\"My brain is broken\"",
      "The term Havana Syndrome is derived from the cases first reported by U.S. diplomats and intelligence officers in Cuba's capital. After the U.S. embassy opened there in 2015, media outlets started reporting on strange medical symptoms affecting U.S. embassy personnel working in the country: dizziness, fatigue, memory problems and impaired vision. Other symptom include nausea, migraines, head pressure, vertigo and ringing or popping sensations in the ears.",
      "Many people with Havana Syndrome describe hearing an intensely high-pitched, painful sound that appeared to subside when they moved to another location, with effects so severe for some that they were ultimately forced to leave their jobs.",
      "\"My brain is broken,\" former CIA analyst Erika Stith told CBS News in 2022.",
      "\"We got this as a result of serving our country. And we deserve to be taken care of,\" she said.",
      "The U.S. government refers to the cases as \"anomalous health incidents,\" or AHIs, and officials have not confirmed what caused them.",
      "But \"60 Minutes\" has spoken with experts who believe the incidents involve targeted sonic or microwave attacks.",
      "Many of those affected believe that they were wounded by a secret weapon that fires a high-energy beam of microwaves or ultrasound.",
      "Some Havana Syndrome victims have spent more than a decade trying to draw attention to their cases, often faulting the government for failing to provide enough support or access to specialized medical care.",
      "Who has been affected?",
      "More than 1,500 U.S. officials have reported experiencing the condition since 2016, including White House staff, CIA officers, FBI agents, military officers and their families. Cases have emerged in dozens of countries, and have even been reported in Washington, D.C.",
      "In 2021, a Havana Syndrome-style incident was reported in Vietnam shortly before then-Vice President Kamala Harris\u00a0visited Hanoi. The U.S. embassy there said at the time that a \"possible anomalous health incident\" required at least one official to be evacuated for medical care, and it prompted Harris to delay her arrival.",
      "\"60 Minutes\" later learned that 11 people reported being stricken: two officials at the U.S. embassy in Hanoi and nine others who were part of a Defense Department team preparing for Harris' visit. While Harris was unharmed, some of the injured U.S. personnel were medevac'ed out of Vietnam.",
      "In another case, a State Department security officer who worked in the U.S. consulate in Guangzhou, China, told \"60 Minutes\" that he and his wife started having symptoms after hearing bizarre sounds in their apartment in 2017.",
      "The security officer, Mark Lenzi, described the sound as a \"marble\" circling down a \"metal funnel\" and said he heard it four times \u2014 always in the same spot at the same time of day: above his son's crib when he put him to bed at night. He described the sound as \"fairly loud\" and like nothing he'd heard before. He and his wife began to feel ill shortly after hearing the sounds.",
      "Lenzi said he believed he was targeted due to his work using top-secret equipment to analyze electronic threats to diplomatic missions.",
      "\"This was a directed standoff attack against my apartment\u2026it was a weapon,\" he told correspondent Scott Pelley. \"I believe it's RF, radio frequency energy, in the microwave range.\"",
      "Questions about Russia's possible role",
      "\"60 Minutes\" reported in mid-2024 on a major development in the Havana Syndrome investigation: a suspected link between attacks in Tbilisi, Georgia, and a top-secret Russian intelligence unit, as well as evidence that a reliable source called \"a receipt\" for acoustic weapons testing done by the same intelligence unit.",
      "Lt. Col. Greg Edgreen, a retired Army lieutenant colonel who led the Pentagon investigation into these incidents, told \"60 Minutes\" at the time that he was confident that Russia was behind these attacks, and that they were part of a worldwide campaign to neutralize U.S. officials.",
      "\"If my mother had seen what I saw, she would say, 'It's the Russians, stupid,'\" Edgreen said.",

      "U.S. assessments",
      "A U.S. intelligence assessment released in 2023 by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence found it was \"very unlikely\" that a foreign adversary was responsible for the illnesses \u2014 a conclusion reaffirmed in an updated review released a year ago. That review found that most of the intelligence community continued to view foreign involvement as highly improbable.",
      "Two agencies, however, revised their positions, saying there was a \"roughly even chance\" that a foreign adversary had developed a device capable of harming American officials and their families, while stopping short of linking such a device directly to the reported AHIs.",
      "In 2024, the House Intelligence Committee concluded in a report that the 2023 assessment by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence \"lacked analytic integrity and was highly irregular in its formulation.\" The report said it \"appears increasingly likely that a foreign adversary is behind some cases of what officials refer to as \"anomalous health incidents.\"",
      "The Office of the Director of National Intelligence says it has been conducting a review of the intelligence community's previous investigations of the incidents and \"remains committed to sharing findings\" with the American public when it's complete.",
      "Former senior CIA intelligence officer Marc Polymeropoulos said that \"a new, full analytic review is now warranted, and the DNI must call for one.\"",
      "Polymeropoulos, who has spoken publicly of the symptoms he suffered after he said he was stricken in Moscow in 2017, criticized the agencies for what he said were disingenuous prior inquiries.",
      "\"The CIA always claimed that none of this technology even existed, that a device didn't exist, and they based their [assessments] on this,\" he said, \"so their entire analytic assumptions are now blown up.\"",

    "summary": "Iranian shopkeeper Erfan Soltani is among thousands of people who were feared to be facing death sentences, but after a warning from President Trump, officials claim he never was.",
    "story": [
      "Iranian authorities claimed Thursday that 26-year-old shopkeeper Erfan Soltani is not facing execution and could only be sentenced to prison if convicted of the charges he's facing. Soltani's uncertain fate garnered international attention after activists said his family had been told he would be executed for involvement in the anti-government protests that swept across the Islamic Republic in early January.",
      "Human rights group Hengaw, which has been in contact with Soltani's family, told CBS News this week that he had been convicted of participating in the protests\u00a0and sentenced to death, but as the regime in Tehran came under intense pressure from Washington, a Hengaw representative told CBS News on Wednesday night that it had been informed the execution was postponed. The family had been told earlier in the week that Soltani would be executed on Wednesday, according to Hengaw.",
      "On Thursday morning, the semi-official Tasnim news agency, which is associated with Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guard Corps, cited the government's Judiciary Media Center as denying that Soltani was ever sentenced to death.",
      "The center dismissed the reports as fabricated and misleading and said Soltani, who was arrested on January 8 during the height of the protests, had been charged with assembly and collusion against national internal security, as well as engaging in propaganda activities against the system. It acknowledged that he was being held at the Karaj Central Prison, outside Tehran, but said the charges against him only carry a possible prison sentence, not execution.",
      "Hengaw, which monitors events in Iran via a network of contacts inside the country, had told CBS News on Wednesday evening that Soltani's execution \"has not been implemented and has been postponed.\"",
      "An ongoing internet blackout in Iran was making it difficult for Hengaw to provide timely updates on the case and for CBS News and other organizations to get a clear picture of the events in the country more broadly.",
      "The uncertainty over Solanti's fate on Wednesday came on the heels of\u00a0President Trump threatening \"strong action\"\u00a0against Iran if it hanged people detained during the protests. Mr. Trump then told reporters Wednesday in the Oval Office that he had heard on \"good authority\" that the \"killing in Iran is stopping\" and \"there's no plan for executions.\"",
      "Hengaw representative Awyar Shekhi told CBS News on Tuesday that Iranian officials had informed the family that Soltani \"was arrested because of the protest, but we don't know if actually he participated in the protest because there is absolutely no information about that or evidence.\"",
      "Soltani is a clothing seller whose family lives near Tehran, according to Shekhi, who added that Soltani's family has said he was not a political activist but was opposed to the current situation in the country.",
      "Iranian security forces launched a brutal crackdown to end the widespread anti-government protests, which sources inside the country say may have resulted in the deaths of some 12,000 people, and potentially many more. More than 2,600 people were detained amid the unrest that began on Dec. 28, according to rights groups.",
      "There had been fear that many of those in detention could be executed. On Thursday, Iranian officials had yet to clearly confirm or deny Mr. Trump's statement that there would be no executions.",
      "Shekhi told CBS News that from the time of his detention, Soltani had been \"deprived from all of his basic rights to contact his family, to have a lawyer.\"",
      "Four days later, \"the family got information that their son has received [a death] sentence, and without declaring what was the charges [or] when the trial took place.\"",
      "Soltani's family was not told how his planned execution would be carried out, but the most common method in Iran is hanging, Hengaw told CBS News.",
      "Soltani's sister is a lawyer and was pursuing all available legal avenues to defend her brother, \"but the authorities have told [her] there's no case to review and we are not allowing that,\" Shekhi said earlier this week.",
      "The activist told CBS News the family was informed they'd be allowed to have a final meeting with Soltani \u2014 a procedure normally reserved for the families of those being executed. Hengaw said it had no confirmation that the meeting had taken place, but a source close to the family told the group that some of Soltani's relatives had been heading to the massive Ghezel Hesar prison in Karaj late Tuesday night.",
      "\"If we want to do a job, we should do it now. If we want to do something, we have to do it quickly,\" Iran's judiciary chief Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ejei said Wednesday in a video aired on state television, showing part of a discussion he had with other judiciary officials about the handling of detained protesters' cases. \"If it becomes late, two months, three months later, it doesn't have the same effect. If we want to do something, we have to do that fast.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told CBS News' Tony Dokoupil on Tuesday that the U.S. would act if the Iranian regime begins hanging protesters.",
      "When asked to clarify what that action could be, Mr. Trump said:\u00a0 \"Well \u2014 let's define it in Venezuela. Let's define it with [ISIS leader] al-Baghdadi. He was wiped out. Let's define it with [Iranian military commander] Soleimani. And let's define it in Iran, where \u2014 (we) wiped out their Iran nuclear threat in a period of about 15 minutes once the B-2s got there. And that was a complete obliteration as it turns out, which is what I said initially. Then some questioned it, and they said, 'You know, Trump was right.' So we've been right about everything. We don't want to see what's happening in Iran happen. And, you know, if they want to have protests, that's one thing. When they start killing thousands of people and now you're telling me about hanging - we'll see how that works out for them. It's not gonna work out good.\"",

    "summary": "Two Republicans switched their votes after pressure from the White House.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Republicans killed a war powers resolution to limit President Trump's ability to further strike Venezuela after the White House put pressure on a handful of GOP senators who supported it.",
      "Republican Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Todd Young of Indiana flipped their support Wednesday after initially voting to advance it. Vice President JD Vance had to step in to break the 50-50 tie.",
      "Republicans used a procedural maneuver to block the measure, arguing that the resolution should no longer be \"privileged\" \u2014 which gives it priority on the floor \u2014 because the U.S. is not currently engaged in \"hostilities\" with Venezuela.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, previewed the argument in floor remarks Wednesday morning.",
      "\"Today, we expect a vote on a resolution to direct the removal of U.S. forces from hostilities in or against Venezuela, even though the U.S. is not currently engaged in hostilities in or against Venezuela,\" Thune said. \"We have no troops on the ground in Venezuela. We're not currently conducting military operations there.\"",
      "Senators\u00a0advanced\u00a0the resolution, introduced by Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, last week after the U.S. captured Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife and Mr. Trump asserted the U.S. is now in charge of the country.",
      "Five Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure, pushing it forward after two previous failed attempts in the upper chamber to advance similar resolutions to rein in Mr. Trump's military action in the region.",
      "The GOP senators who voted with Democrats to advance the measure were Hawley, Young, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and Rand Paul of Kentucky.",
      "Murkowski, Collins and Paul voted against the GOP effort to kill the resolution Wednesday.",
      "Kaine said Wednesday night he was disappointed in the outcome but saw it \"as a growing set of cracks\" in the GOP's willingness to stick with Mr. Trump on the issue.",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump quickly lashed out\u00a0at the Republicans, saying they \"should never be elected to office again.\" He again criticized the senators on Tuesday during a speech at the Detroit Economic Club, calling them \"real losers.\"",
      "Some of the senators said they received calls from Mr. Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio ahead of Wednesday's action.",
      "Hawley said Rubio had addressed his concerns about U.S. troops in Venezuela.",
      "He said Rubio confirmed the U.S. \"has no ground troops currently in Venezuela\" and that if the administration plans to put troops in Venezuela, \"they would abide by the War Powers Act and they would come to Congress for congressional authorization.\"",
      "\"The secretary told me directly that the administration will not put ground troops in Venezuela,\" Hawley said.",
      "Young pushed back on criticism that he caved to pressure from the president, telling reporters that senators had \"secured some valuable reassurances and deliverables\" from the White House on Venezuela.",
      "\"I think we played our hand well,\" Young said, contending that the resolution was heading for a presidential veto if it eventually did make it through both chambers. Both the House and Senate would have needed a two-thirds majority to overcome a veto, which was unlikely.",
      "The switch-up appeared to come as a surprise to Kaine, who said Wednesday morning that he expected all five Republicans to stick with Democrats.",
      "Before Maduro's ouster, lawmakers said they had received insufficient answers from the Trump administration about whether its end goals in Venezuela included regime change, as the U.S. ramped up strikes\u00a0against alleged drug-smuggling boats, imposed an oil blockade and Mr. Trump threatened land strikes.",
      "Republicans who voted last week to advance the resolution cited Mr. Trump's comments about running Venezuela and the potential for U.S. forces to be deployed there as reasons for the measure gaining their support.",
      "A day after the initial Senate vote, Mr. Trump announced he had called off a \"second wave\" of attacks against Venezuela, claiming the two countries \"are working well together.\" But, he said, U.S. naval forces in the region would \"stay in place for safety and security purposes.\"",
      "Kaine attributed\u00a0Mr. Trump's decision to cancel more strikes to the war powers vote. CBS News did not receive a response from the White House regarding Kaine's assertion.",
      "Grace  Kazarian and \n                                                  \n                      Seiji  Yamashita\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "Rubina Aminian was a \"full of life\" 23-year-old Iranian fashion student with big goals for the future. She was shot and killed last week amid the protests, her aunt told CBS News, as she described how Aminian's mother forced her way into a morgue and carried her daughter's body out.",
      "\"I can confidently say that it was the most difficult day of my life,\" Aminian's aunt, Hilala Noori, told CBS News, of the day she learned Aminian had been shot. \"When they confirmed she had been killed, my whole body was burning. I don't know how to describe that moment to you. I've been unable to sleep for more than two hours since Saturday. I feel like a rock is in my throat. I cannot swallow anything.\"",
      "On the evening of Jan. 8, Aminian left her university and joined the large crowds marching in the streets in the capital city. There, her family says she was shot at close range in the back of the head.",
      "When Aminian's family heard the news of her death, they immediately left Kermanshah, where they live, and drove to Tehran to find her body, Noori said.",
      "They found out the location of the morgue where they believed her remains were located and went there to try to find and bring her home.",
      "When they arrived, Noori said her sister, Aminian's mother, described seeing hundreds of bodies all \"lying on top of each other.\" She said: \"The children of people, all of them had been shot in their heads, their necks, directly in their heads. They were all lying on each other, and my sister was forced to see those beautiful faces in order to find our dear Rubina.\"",
      "Noori told CBS News that Aminian's mother searched the bodies outside the facility, but couldn't find Aminian. She was initially not allowed inside the facility, but managed to force her way in.",
      "\"She [was] forced to carry her daughter's body and steal it, because they didn't give her permission to take out the body,\" Noori told CBS News. \"She was forced to carry the body of her 40-kilo daughter and take her outside. She stole the body from them and held it for many hours until they arrived at Kermanshah,\" Noori told CBS News.",
      "Noori said she holds Iran's Supreme Leader Khamenei, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Islamic Republic of Iran \"directly responsible\" for the death of her niece. \"They are the only ones responsible for it,\" she said.",
      "\"What the Islamic Republic took from her, took from us, was a girl who was full of passion and love for life, and she shared that passion everywhere,\" Noori said. \"She wanted to create her own future. She believed that you should create your own future with your own hands. She didn't wait for anyone to create her own future for her. Because of this, she took to the streets, to gain her freedom. Just like all the young people we've lost on the streets. She was hands-on; she never wanted anyone to do anything for her. She knew what she wanted to do, and she knew how to do it. And I'm really proud of her. I'm proud of her choice, even though it's very painful for me. I will have to live my life with this pain. I might never be the same. But I am proud of her, of her sacrifice, her path. And I hope that her blood has not been spilled in vain.\"",

    "summary": "After the meeting, Denmark's foreign minister said they're eager to work with the U.S. while respecting the \"red lines of the Kingdom of Denmark.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The U.S. and Denmark still have \"fundamental\" differences over the future of Greenland, but will continue to talk, Denmark's foreign minister said after a White House meeting Wednesday amid President Trump's push to take over the Arctic island.",
      "Denmark's foreign minister, Lars Loekke Rasmussen, met with Greenland's minister for foreign affairs, Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other officials. Loekke Rasmussen described the meeting as a \"frank but also constructive discussion\" on security long-term security in Greenland.",
      "The Danish official said they've agreed to establish a high-level working group to determine a way forward on Greenland, as Mr. Trump remains intent on acquiring the semi-autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark. Loekke Rasmussen said they \"still have a fundamental disagreement, but we also agree to disagree.\"",
      "\"There is clearly a disagreement,\" he said in a press conference with reporters in Washington. \"We agree that it makes sense to try to sit down on a high level to explore whether there are possibilities to accommodate the concerns of the president while we at the same time respect the red lines of the Kingdom of Denmark.\"",
      "\"Whether that is doable, I don't know,\" Loekke Rasmussen said, adding he hopes they can \"take down the temperature.\" The Danes asked for the meeting.",
      "Loekke Rasmussen said he agrees that the security situation in the Arctic has changed, and said he's \"eager\" to work with the U.S. on security improvements. But the framework for improving Arctic security through NATO already exists, he said, and the U.S. acquiring Greenland is \"absolutely not necessary.\"",
      "Vivian Motzfeldt, Greenland's minister of foreign affairs, told reporters it's never been more important to strengthen their ties with the U.S., \"but that doesn't mean that we want to be owned by the United States.\"",
      "Asked if he would respect the red lines set forth by Greenland and Denmark, Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, \"Well, we're going to see what happens with Greenland,\" adding that he hasn't yet been briefed on the meeting.",
      "\"We need Greenland for national security, so we're going to see what happens,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Asked whether he would leave NATO over the Greenland issue, the president said he wouldn't broadcast his options.",
      "The meeting came one day after Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said at a news conference, \"If we have to choose between the United States and Denmark here and now, we choose Denmark.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly said he wants to acquire Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark, citing national security reasons. He repeated that again on Wednesday morning, saying \"it is vital for the Golden Dome that we are building\" and that \"NATO should be leading the way for us to get it.\"",
      "\"IF WE DON'T, RUSSIA OR CHINA WILL, AND THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN!\" Mr. Trump said in a post on Truth Social.",
      "\"NATO becomes far more formidable and effective with Greenland in the hands of the UNITED STATES,\" he said. \"Anything less than that is unacceptable.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Mr. Trump told reporters that if Greenland's premier said the territory wanted to stay part of Denmark, \"that's their problem.\"",
      "\"I disagree with him,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I don't know who he is, don't know anything about him, but that's going to be a big problem for him.\"",
      "Leaders of both Denmark and Greenland have stated Greenland is \"not for sale,\" which has led Trump officials to say that the administration is considering all options, including military force.",
      "\"I'd love to make a deal with them. It's easier,\" Mr. Trump said Sunday. \"But one way or the other, we're going to have Greenland.\" Rubio has downplayed the possibility of military force to acquire Greenland.",
      "Vance visited Greenland last year. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Tuesday that the Trump administration is applying \"completely unacceptable pressure from our closest ally.\"",
      "Frederiksen\u00a0said earlier this month that an American military move to seize control of Greenland would amount to the end of the NATO military alliance. Denmark is a NATO member, and NATO's Article 5 states that if a NATO ally suffers an armed attack, all members will consider it an attack on them as well and do what they need to aid the attacked nation.",
      "Tensions were high ahead of the meeting, as was concern about a further fracturing of the relationship with the U.S. NATO ally, sources familiar with the situation told CBS News. The Danish government expected to present an offer for enhanced cooperation with the U.S. and access in Greenland in terms of military presence and NATO presence, the sources said.",
      "The Danes wanted clarity on what the U.S. is pressing for beyond that offer, and whether a financial plus-up is being demanded, the sources said. They wanted to know if Mr. Trump's intent is to have control or political ownership, which concerns them, given the clear objection of the Greenlandic government to either. Greenlandic officials have been clear that they want the island to belong to Denmark.",
      "A European official from a nearby country said there is some concern that Denmark may be miscalculating by demanding this meeting with the U.S. because it could formalize and potentially harden positions around what could otherwise be rhetorical pressure by Mr. Trump.",
      "On Wednesday, Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky took to the Senate floor to voice his disapproval of intervening in Greenland's affairs and to emphasize the importance of maintaining a united NATO alliance.",
      "\"Unless and until the President can demonstrate otherwise, then the proposition at hand today is very straightforward: incinerating the hard-won trust of loyal allies in exchange for no meaningful change in U.S. access to the Arctic,\" McConnell said. \"That's allies \u2013 plural. Because this is about more than Greenland. It's about more than America's relationship with its highly capable Nordic allies. It's about whether the United States intends to face a constellation of strategic adversaries with capable friends \u2026 or commit an unprecedented act of strategic self-harm and go it alone.\"",

      "\"Failure to do so will bring serious consequences,\" Witkoff wrote.",

      "The mediators of the ceasefire deal \u2014 Egypt, Turkey and Qatar \u2014 welcomed the establishment of the committee and said it would be led by Ali Shaath, a former deputy minister in the Palestinian Authority.",
      "\"This is an important development to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza,\" they said in a joint statement.",
      "The Gaza native served as a deputy minister for transportation with the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority. Shaath, an engineer, is an expert in economic development and reconstruction, according to his biography on the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute's website.",

    "published": "Tue, 13 Jan 2026 19:08:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The device was purchased by Homeland Security officials under the Biden administration and cost millions, two sources said.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. government quietly acquired a device in late 2024 that officials believe may be connected to the debilitating condition known as Havana Syndrome, which more than 1,500 American officials have reported experiencing since 2016, according to multiple sources briefed on the matter who spoke with CBS News.",
      "The device was purchased clandestinely in the final weeks of the Biden administration by the Department of Homeland Security's Homeland Security Investigations division, using Pentagon funding that exceeded eight figures, according to two people familiar with the matter. The device is portable, backpack-sized, and contains components of Russian origin, the two people said.",
      "Three of the people said the Pentagon has been testing the device, which emits pulsed, radio-frequency energy, for more than a year, but did not offer details on the nature of the tests. They said the department's investigators believe it may be capable of reproducing the effects described by victims of Havana Syndrome,\u00a0a term derived from the cases first reported by U.S. diplomats and intelligence officers in Havana, Cuba, in 2016. U.S. officials briefed some of their findings to congressional oversight committees last year.",
      "Details about the U.S. acquisition of the device were reported by independent journalist Sasha Ingber and CNN.",
      "The Pentagon and DHS did not immediately reply to requests for comment. The CIA declined to comment.",
      "Victims have reported a spectrum of neurological symptoms, including severe headaches and head pressure, vertigo, nausea, and ringing or popping sensations in the ears. Many have described hearing an intensely high-pitched, painful sound that appeared to subside when they moved to another location. For some, the effects were so severe that they were ultimately forced to leave their jobs. Reports of cases have emerged from every populated continent, spanning dozens of countries, and involving diplomats, intelligence officers, and military personnel.",
      "Some Havana Syndrome victims have spent more than a decade trying to draw attention to their cases, often faulting their government employers for failing to provide meaningful support or access to specialized medical care. In the absence of official recognition, some resorted to paying out of pocket for expensive diagnoses and treatments, and have described a sense of isolation and marginalization as their condition went unacknowledged.",
      "An initial U.S. intelligence assessment completed in 2023 concluded it was \"very unlikely\" that a foreign adversary was responsible for the illnesses, which the Biden administration formally labeled \"Anomalous Health Incidents,\" or AHIs. That conclusion was reaffirmed in an updated review released in January 2025, which found that most of the intelligence community continued to view foreign involvement as highly improbable. Two agencies, however, revised their positions, saying there was a \"roughly even chance\" that a foreign adversary had developed a device capable of harming American officials and their families, while stopping short of linking such a device directly to the reported AHIs.",
      "The Office of the Director of National Intelligence has been conducting a review of the intelligence community's previous investigations of the incidents. Three people familiar with the review told CBS News it is largely complete, but said it has not yet been briefed to lawmakers or prepared for public release.",
      "An ODNI spokesperson said Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard \"remains committed to sharing findings from her investigation into Anomalous Health Incidents with the American people.\"",
      "\"However, we are not going to rush to put out incomplete information,\" the spokesperson said, noting a team was continuing \"relentless\" work on completing the assessment.",
      "Former senior CIA intelligence officer Marc Polymeropoulos, who has spoken publicly of the symptoms he suffered after being struck in Moscow in 2017, criticized the agencies for what he said were disingenuous prior inquiries.",
      "\"The CIA always claimed that none of this technology even existed, that a device didn't exist, and they based their [assessments] on this,\" he said, \"so their entire analytic assumptions are now blown up.\"",
      "\"A new, full analytic review is now warranted, and the DNI must call for one,\" he said.",

      "The release of an updated food pyramid this week has sparked mixed reactions from doctors and dietitians.",
      "One of the most noteworthy shifts in the 2025-2030 Dietary Guidelines for Americans \u2014 announced by HHS officials during a Jan. 7 press conference at the White House \u2014 is a greater emphasis on \"high-quality proteins,\" including red meat and eggs, as well as full-fat dairy.",
      "The new guidelines focus on \"real, whole, nutrient-dense foods,\" and a dramatic reduction in highly processed foods, added sugars, refined carbohydrates and unhealthy fats.",
      "HEALTH EXPERTS REACT AS ANDREW HUBERMAN BACKS TRUMP ADMIN\u2019S NEW FOOD PYRAMID",
      "\"Protein and healthy fats are essential and were wrongly discouraged in prior dietary guidelines,\" Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said during the press conference. \"We are ending the war on saturated fats.\"",
      "Nick Norwitz, a Harvard- and Oxford-trained researcher known for his work in metabolic health, shared his reaction to the new guidelines.",
      "The release of an updated food pyramid this week has sparked mixed reactions from doctors and dietitians. (realfood.gov)",
      "Despite how the new pyramid is presented, he noted, the actual guidelines for saturated fat consumption haven't changed, as they still state that, \"in general, saturated fat consumption should not exceed 10% of total daily calories.\"",
      "The intake of unprocessed whole foods rich in saturated fat, especially dairy fat, tends to be associated with improved health outcomes, according to Norwitz.",
      "RED MEAT CAN HELP YOUR MOOD IF PART OF A HEALTHY, BALANCED DIET, STUDY SUGGESTS",
      "\"Full-fat dairy \u2014 especially cheese, for example \u2014 tends to be associated with lower BMI, reduced rates of diabetes and even reduced dementia risk,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"There are, of course, nuances \u2014 but \u2018ending the war\u2019 on saturated fat seems reasonable.\"",
      "Risks vary, experts say",
      "Experts cautioned about the potential health risks of exceeding the recommended intake of saturated fat, including higher rates of LDL \"bad\" cholesterol, which is known to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.",
      "\"The recommendation to limit saturated fat to 10% of total calories is based on the research showing that higher rates increase LDL cholesterol and associated risks for cardiovascular disease,\" Sherry Coleman Collins, a food allergy dietitian and expert from the Atlanta metropolitan area, told Fox News Digital.",
      "One of the most noteworthy shifts in the 2025-2030 Dietary Guidelines for Americans is a greater emphasis on \"high-quality proteins\" \u2014 including red meat and eggs \u2014 as well as full-fat dairy. (iStock)",
      "Nutrition should be personalized and is dependent on multiple factors, she said, including age, gender, activity level and genetic risk factors.",
      "\"The total saturated fat an individual might safely consume is influenced by their size and total calorie needs, as well as potentially genetic differences,\" Coleman Collins said.",
      "Norwitz agreed, adding that \"the specific food source and interaction with the unique host and their broader dietary context should take the spotlight.\"",
      "Dr. Pooja Gidwani, a double board-certified doctor of internal medicine and obesity medicine in Los Angeles, pointed out that not everyone has the same \"tolerance\" for saturated fats.",
      "\"If increasing saturated fat leads to a meaningful rise in LDL cholesterol or ApoB (Apolipoprotein B, a protein found on the surface of certain cholesterol-carrying particles in the blood), that intake level is excessive for that individual, regardless of improvements in weight or glucose metrics,\" she said.",
      "TRUMP ADMIN'S NEW NUTRITION GUIDELINES TARGET ULTRA-PROCESSED FOODS, EASE UP ON RED MEAT AND SATURATED FATS",
      "\"This personalized approach becomes increasingly important in midlife and beyond, when cardiovascular disease becomes the dominant driver of morbidity and mortality and when tolerance for cumulative atherogenic (artery-clogging) exposure is lower.\"",
      "For those who need to reduce LDL cholesterol or have a higher cardiovascular risk, the American Heart Association recommends an even lower amount of saturated fats \u2014 less than 6% of total daily calories.",
      "Experts cautioned about the potential health risks of exceeding the recommended intake of saturated fat, including higher rates of LDL \"bad\" cholesterol. (iStock)",
      "Gidwani also cautioned that diets emphasizing saturated fat could crowd out fiber and unsaturated fats, \"both of which play independent roles in cholesterol clearance, insulin sensitivity, gut health and inflammation.\"",
      "\"Saturated fat-heavy patterns are also calorie-dense, which can quietly undermine long-term weight management if intake is not carefully regulated,\" she added.",
      "Not all saturated fats are equal, experts say",
      "The effects of saturated fat depend on what specific foods are being consumed, according to experts.",
      "\"I would recommend choosing minimally processed or unprocessed forms of foods,\" said Tanya Freirich, a registered dietitian nutritionist in Charlotte, North Carolina. \"For example, in place of a hot dog \u2014 which has additives, nitrites, sodium and fillers \u2014 consuming a chicken thigh would be a much better choice.\"",
      "CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Gidwani reiterated that the amount of processing plays a big role.",
      "\"Processed meats are consistently associated with worse cardiometabolic outcomes and represent the clearest category to limit,\" she said. \"The risk here is not only saturated fat, but also sodium load, preservatives and the broader dietary pattern they tend to accompany.\"",
      "\"Full-fat dairy \u2014 especially cheese, for example \u2014 tends to be associated with lower BMI, reduced rates of diabetes and even reduced dementia risk,\" an expert told Fox News Digital. (iStock)",
      "Unprocessed red meat, the doctor said, can fit into an overall healthy diet in smaller amounts, particularly when consumed alongside fiber-rich plants and minimally processed foods.",
      "\"However, from a longevity perspective, it should be viewed as optional rather than foundational, especially for individuals with elevated cardiovascular risk,\" she added.",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "When it comes to dairy, Gidwani noted that fermented options are \"metabolically more favorable\" than butter or cream.",
      "\"However, saturated fat from dairy is still not necessary to prioritize for metabolic health or longevity,\" she said. \"Excessive reliance on dairy fat can displace healthier fat sources without offering clear long-term benefit.\"",
      "CLICK HERE FOR MORE HEALTH STORIES",
      "Overall, the doctor recommends unsaturated fat sources, including extra virgin olive oil, nuts, seeds, avocado and omega-3-rich fish, as primary dietary fats.",
      "\"These consistently support lipid profiles, insulin sensitivity and vascular health,\" Gidwani said. \"Saturated fat can exist within a balanced diet, but it should remain secondary rather than emphasized.\"",
      "Why the big picture matters",
      "Saturated fat is just one piece of a much wider nutrition puzzle, the experts agreed.",
      "Unprocessed red meat can fit into an overall healthy diet in smaller amounts, particularly when consumed alongside fiber-rich plants and minimally processed foods, one expert said. (iStock)",
      "\"Our heart health is not determined by one type of fat or one type of cholesterol, but the sum of many parts \u2014 our entire diet, our exercise habits, our stress and so much more,\" Freirich said.",
      "She recommends consulting a registered dietitian for guidance on unique dietary needs based on age, gender, activity level and medical history.",
      "\"Our heart health is not determined by one type of fat or one type of cholesterol, but the sum of many parts \u2014 our entire diet, our exercise habits, our stress and so much more,\" said an expert.\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "New Jersey-based dietitian Erin Palinski-Wade, author of \"2-Day Diabetes Diet,\" added that the message should be to focus more on overall patterns.",

      "The Supreme Court is poised to rule soon on President Donald Trump\u2019s use of an emergency wartime law to unilaterally impose sweeping tariffs on most U.S. countries, which brought key questions over the \"major questions doctrine (MQD),\" or the limiting principle by which courts can, in certain circumstances, move to curb the power of executive agencies.",
      "During oral arguments over Trump's tariffs in November, justices honed in on the so-called major questions doctrine, which allows courts to limit the power of executive agencies on actions with \"vast economic and political significance,\" and how it squares with Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to enact his sweeping global and reciprocal tariffs.",
      "Plaintiffs told the court Trump\u2019s use of IEEPA to unilaterally impose his steep import duties violates the major questions doctrine, since IEEPA does not explicitly mention the word \"tariffs.\" Rather, it authorizes the president to \"regulate \u2026 importation\" during a declared national emergency, the plaintiffs noted, arguing it falls short of the standard needed to pass muster for MQD.",
      "\"Congress does not (and could not) use such vague terminology to grant the executive virtually unconstrained taxing power of such staggering economic effect \u2014 literally trillions of dollars \u2014 shouldered by American businesses and consumers,\" they told the court in an earlier briefing.",

      "\"Our Stock Market is consistently hitting Record Highs, and our Country has never been more respected than it is right now,\" he added. \"A big part of this is the Economic Security created by Tariffs, and the Deals that we have negotiated because of them.\"",
      "While U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer acknowledged to the justices that IEEPA does not explicitly give an executive the power to regulate tariffs, he stressed in November that the power to tariff is \"the natural commonsense inference\" of IEEPA.",
      "But whether the high court will back his argument remains to be seen.",
      "That was the conclusion reached by the U.S. Court of International Trade last year. Judges on the three-judge panel voted unanimously to block Trump's tariffs from taking force, ruling that, as commander in chief, Trump does not have \"unbounded authority\" to impose tariffs under the emergency law.",
      "\"The parties cite two doctrines \u2014 the nondelegation doctrine and the major questions doctrine \u2014 that the judiciary has developed to ensure that the branches do not impermissibly abdicate their respective constitutionally vested powers,\" the court said in its ruling.",
      "The doctrine was also a focus in November, as justices pressed lawyers for the administration over IEEPA's applicability to tariffs, or taxation powers, and asked the administration what guardrails, if any, exist to limit the whims of the executive branch, should they ultimately rule in Trump\u2019s favor.",

      "Prior to that, the doctrine existed as a more amorphous strand of statutory interpretation, a phenomenon Justice Elena Kagan noted in her dissent in the same case.",

      "Do it yourself:",
      "You can visit individual data broker websites, search for your profile and submit opt-out requests.This method works, but it takes time.

      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

    "summary": "Kodiak AI&apos;s autonomous trucks have driven over 3 million miles with impressive safety scores, proving self-driving technology works on real highways today.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Kodiak AI, a leading provider of AI-powered autonomous driving technology, has spent years quietly proving that self-driving trucks can work in the real world. The company's core system, the Kodiak Driver, brings software and hardware together in a practical way. As the company explains, \"The Kodiak Driver combines advanced AI-driven software with modular, vehicle-agnostic hardware into a single, unified platform.\"",
      "That approach matters because trucking is not a closed lab environment. It is highways, weather, fatigue and long hours. Kodiak's strategy focuses on solving those realities first.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2013 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "How public views on autonomous trucks are changing",
      "During a recent episode of CyberGuy's \"Beyond Connected\" podcast, Kurt spoke with Daniel Goff, vice president of external affairs at Kodiak AI, about how attitudes toward autonomous trucks have shifted over time.",
      "WILL AUTONOMOUS TRUCKS REPLACE DRIVERS BY 2027?",
      "Autonomous trucks are already hauling freight on public highways as companies test how the technology performs in real-world conditions. (Kodiak)",
      "Goff described how different the reaction was when the company first launched. \"Kodiak was founded in 2018, and I joined in 2019. When I first started at the company, I said I worked for a company that was working to build trucks that drive themselves, and people kind of looked at me like I was crazy. Over the last few years, we've really seen autonomous vehicles capture the public's imagination. We've seen them grow in the real world. I think that people are getting more used to this idea.\"",
      "For Goff, that shift has come from seeing the technology operate safely outside of test environments, where performance matters more than hype.",
      "Why autonomous trucks could improve road safety",
      "One of Kodiak AI's central arguments is simple. Machines avoid many of the risks that come with human driving. \"We think there are advantages to this technology that humans, myself included, can't match. You know this technology doesn't get distracted. It doesn't check its phone. It doesn't have a phone. It doesn't have a bad day to take it out on the road. It doesn't speed. It doesn't know how to speed. You know they're pretty boring drivers.\" In trucking, boring is often a good thing.",
      "Where autonomous trucks are already operating today",
      "Kodiak AI is already doing this on real roads. The company has been running active freight routes for years, not just testing in controlled settings. \"Kodiak's headquarters are in Mountainview, California, but since 2019, we've had a command center in Lancaster, Texas, which is just south of Dallas. Since 2019, we've actually been delivering freight from that Lancaster hub to Houston, Oklahoma City and Atlanta with what we call a safety driver behind the wheel.\"",
      "Those real-world miles have helped Kodiak fine-tune its system in everyday traffic, weather and long-haul conditions.",
      "Tractor trailers at the entrance of the Port of Baltimore in Maryland on Oct. 8, 2024. (Nathan Howard/Getty Images)",
      "The trucking problem Kodiak is trying to solve",
      "Long-haul trucking is essential to the U.S. economy, but it is also one of the most demanding and risky jobs on the road. Drivers spend long stretches away from home, work extended hours and operate heavy vehicles in all conditions. As Goff put it, \"Driving a truck is one of the most difficult and dangerous jobs that people do in the United States every day. You know, being a truck driver means, for at least a long-haul truck driver, means you're away from your family for sometimes days, weeks, even months at a time, sleeping in the back of the truck.\"",
      "He also pointed to federal safety rules that limit how long drivers can stay behind the wheel, which are meant to reduce fatigue but also restrict how much freight one person can move in a day. \"If you're driving the 11-hour legal maximum per day and there are people who love being long-haul truckers, but we\u2019re not seeing people stepping up for those roles anymore in this country, and drivers are retiring every year.\"",
      "Those realities have contributed to ongoing driver shortages and growing pressure on the freight system. Kodiak believes autonomous technology is best used where the job is hardest and most repetitive. \"The goal for this technology is really best suited for those really tough jobs. The long lonely highway miles, the trucking and remote locations where people either don't wanna live or don't or can't easily live.\"",
      "Goff also highlighted how much capacity is lost simply because trucks sit idle for most of the day. \"The average truck is driven about seven hours a day in the U.S., and you know there are 24 hours a day, so that's a lot of time just sitting there.\"",
      "Autonomy, he said, could help change that math. \"The goal of the technology is that you can basically run 24/7, just kind of stopping to refuel, to inspect the truck for safety, and you know, other than that, the trucks are moving.\"",
      "Long-haul trucking is one of the most demanding jobs on the road, which is why autonomous systems focus on long, repetitive highway routes. (Kodiak)",
      "How many miles Kodiak AI has driven to prove safety",
      "Kodiak AI emphasizes data over promises. \"We've driven over 3 million miles with a safety driver behind the wheel for most of those miles, meaning somebody ready to take over at any time. So, we got a very good track record.\" To put that into perspective, Goff added, \"The average American drives about 800,000 miles in their lifetime, which seems crazy. That's a lot of driving, but we're at almost four average lifetimes with our system today, and we also use computer simulation, all sorts of things to assess the safety of the system.\"",
      "In addition to its long-haul operations, Kodiak AI works with Atlas Energy Solutions, which does oil logistics in the Permian Basin of West Texas and eastern New Mexico. As of Q3 2025, the company has delivered 10 driverless trucks to Atlas, which autonomously deliver sand up to 24 hours a day with no human operator in the cab. Goff says, \"We see our work in the Permian as a perfect sandbox for our long-haul operations.\"",
      "The company has also sought third-party validation. \"Additionally, we have done external-facing studies. We did a study with a company called Nauto, which is one of the leaders in AI-enabled dashcams. They actually help vehicle fleets compute safety scores from an outside perspective. Our system scored the highest ever in the Nauto safety score.\"",
      "THE ROAD TO PROSPERITY WILL BE PAVED BY\u00a0AUTONOMOUS\u00a0TRUCKING",
      "Where autonomous truck regulations stand today",
      "Policy is another key factor in adoption. \"From a regulatory perspective. 25 states have passed laws allowing autonomous vehicle deployment.\" Goff believes the danger of everyday driving makes the case clear. \"I think people who think about transportation every day understand how dangerous driving a car is, driving a truck is, and just being on the road see the potential for this technology.\"",
      "What critics say about autonomous trucks",
      "Autonomous trucking still raises concerns among safety advocates and everyday drivers. Critics question whether software can respond fast enough in emergencies, handle unpredictable human behavior or make judgment calls during complex highway situations.",
      "Kodiak AI says those concerns are exactly why safety comes first. As Goff explained, \"In this industry in particular, we really understand how important it is to be safe.\"",
      "The company argues that autonomous systems must earn trust over time through real-world performance, transparent testing and measurable results, not promises or hype.",
      "What this means to you",
      "For everyday drivers, autonomous trucks raise understandable questions. Sharing the road with a vehicle controlled by software can feel unsettling, especially when headlines often focus on what could go wrong. Kodiak's argument is that safety improves when fatigue, distraction and emotional decision-making are removed from long highway driving. If the technology continues to perform as claimed, the impact could show up in quieter ways. That includes fewer tired drivers on overnight routes, more predictable freight movement and potentially safer highways over time. For consumers, it could also mean fewer delivery delays and less strain on a trucking system already short on drivers.",

      "Think your devices and data are truly protected? Take this quick quiz to see where your digital habits stand. From passwords to Wi-Fi settings, you\u2019ll get a personalized breakdown of what you\u2019re doing right and what needs improvement. Take my Quiz here: Cyberguy.com.",
      "Safety data, real-world miles and third-party reviews now play a central role in building trust in self-driving trucks. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Autonomous trucking is not a future concept anymore. Kodiak AI is already moving freight and collecting real safety data on public roads. At the same time, skepticism remains healthy and necessary. Trust in this technology will rise or fall based on transparency, regulation and long-term performance, not promises. The real question is no longer whether self-driving trucks can operate. It is whether they can consistently prove they make roads safer for everyone who shares them.",

Reports point to data tied to roughly 17.5 million Instagram accounts being shared on BreachForums, an underground forum where cybercriminals trade and discuss stolen data. The alleged post appeared in early January 2026, which lines up with when many users began reporting a sudden wave of password reset emails, sometimes receiving several in a short period of time.",
      "This timing alone does not prove a direct connection. However, leaked usernames or email addresses can make it much easier for attackers to target large numbers of accounts at once, which is exactly what this kind of reset spam depends on. We reached out to Meta for comment but did not receive a response before our deadline.",
      "We reached out to Meta for comment, and a spokesperson for the company told CyberGuy, \"We fixed an issue that allowed an external party to request password reset emails for some Instagram users. We want to reassure everyone there was no breach of our systems and people's Instagram accounts remain secure. People can disregard these emails and we apologize for any confusion this may have caused.\"",
      "How to tell if the reset email is legitimate",
      "A legitimate Instagram reset email can still be part of an attack attempt. So your goal is not \"confirm it is real,\" it is \"avoid reacting in a risky way.\" Instagram's own guidance boils down to this:",
      "A reset email alone does not mean your account is compromisedIf you did not request it, do not use the linkUse Instagram's official paths in the app to review security and report suspicious messages",
      "A reset email alone does not mean your account is compromised",
      "If you did not request it, do not use the link",
      "Use Instagram's official paths in the app to review security and report suspicious messages",
      "Also, if you get emails about changing your account email address, Instagram says those messages can include a way to reverse the change, which can help you recover if someone broke in.",
      "These real-looking messages are designed to create urgency and push people to click before slowing down and checking their account security. (Cyverguy.com)",
      "What a real Instagram password reset email looks like",
      "A legitimate reset email usually has these elements:",
      "Sender: Comes from an official Instagram domain, such as security@mail.instagram.comSubject line: Often says \"Reset your Instagram password\" or \"Password reset request\"Instagram branding: Logo at the top with clean formattingCall to action button: A button like \"Reset Password\"Reassurance text: A line explaining that if you did not request this, you can ignore the email and nothing will changeSafety option: Language telling you how to report the email if you did not initiate it",

      "Call to action button: A button like \"Reset Password\"",
      "Reassurance text: A line explaining that if you did not request this, you can ignore the email and nothing will change",
      "Safety option: Language telling you how to report the email if you did not initiate it",

      "META ENDS FACT-CHECKING PROGRAM AS ZUCKERBERG VOWS TO RESTORE FREE EXPRESSION ON FACEBOOK, INSTAGRAM",
      "What Instagram reset alerts can look like inside the app",
      "You may also see security messages directly in Instagram, such as:",
      "Login attempt alertsNotifications about a password reset requestPrompts asking you to confirm a login from a new device",
      "Login attempt alerts",
      "Notifications about a password reset request",
      "Prompts asking you to confirm a login from a new device",
      "These in-app alerts are generally safer to interact with than email links, especially during a surge.",
      "What scammers rely on",
      "Attackers are counting on one thing: panic. When users see a reset email they did not request, many rush to click before reading the fine print. That fast reaction is what turns a harmless reset request into a real account takeover.",
      "What to do right now if you get a reset email you did not request",
      "So, what should you do if one of these password reset emails lands in your inbox? Take a breath first. Then do this.",
      "Even if the message looks real, treat it like a hot surface. If you want to change your password, do it from the Instagram app or by typing Instagram's address into your browser yourself. Strong antivirus software adds another layer of protection here. It can help block malicious links, fake login pages and follow-up scams that often appear during a reset email surge.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Changes to email, phone number or linked accounts",
      "If anything looks off, remove the device and update your credentials.",
      "Two-factor authentication (2FA)\u00a0is the biggest roadblock for account takeover. Even if someone knows your password, they still need your code to get in from an unfamiliar device. Instagram has pushed 2FA heavily for higher-risk accounts and urges users to enable it. Use an authenticator app if you can. It is often safer than SMS.",
      "If you suspect someone guessed your password, or you reused it elsewhere, change it. Make it long and unique. A password manager can help you generate and store strong passwords without reusing them. Then update the password on your email account too. Your email inbox controls most password resets, so make sure it also uses a strong, unique password.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2026 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Password reset surges often follow data leaks. When your email address and personal details appear on data broker sites, attackers can target you more easily. A data removal service helps limit where your information shows up online. By shrinking your digital footprint, you reduce the chances of being singled out during large-scale reset email attacks.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Slow down and verify everything inside the app.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "A spike in Instagram password reset emails feels scary because it looks like someone is already inside your account. Often, they are not. Still, the surge is a reminder to tighten your basics. Use the app to check security. Turn on two-factor authentication. Change the passwords you reused. Most importantly, do not let an unexpected email rush you into the one click that hands over access.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "If you are tired of scam calls slipping through the cracks, federal regulators just took a meaningful step. The Federal Communications Commission finalized new penalties aimed at telecom companies that submit false, inaccurate or late information to a key anti-robocall system. The changes go into effect Feb. 5. They strengthen oversight of the Robocall Mitigation Database, which plays a central role in tracking spoofed calls and holding providers accountable.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2013 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "What changed and why it matters",
      "Under the new rules, voice service providers must recertify every year that their filings in the Robocall Mitigation Database are accurate and current. The FCC will now back that requirement with real financial consequences.",
      "The FCC is cracking down on robocalls by tightening rules that govern how telecom providers verify and report call traffic. (iStock)",
      "FCC SCRUBS OWN REFERENCE TO 'INDEPENDENT' AGENCY FROM WEBSITE AFTER DEM'S TESTY EXCHANGE WITH CHAIRMAN",
      "Here is what the commission approved:",
      "$10,000 fines for submitting false or inaccurate information$1,000 fines for each database entry not updated within 10 business daysAnnual recertification of all provider filingsThe FCC also adopted a $100 filing fee for initial Robocall Mitigation Database submissions and for required annual recertifications.Two-factor authentication to protect database accessA $100 application fee for initial filings and annual recertifications",
      "$10,000 fines for submitting false or inaccurate information",
      "$1,000 fines for each database entry not updated within 10 business days",
      "Annual recertification of all provider filings",
      "The FCC also adopted a $100 filing fee for initial Robocall Mitigation Database submissions and for required annual recertifications.",
      "Two-factor authentication to protect database access",
      "A $100 application fee for initial filings and annual recertifications",
      "The FCC also made clear that these violations are considered ongoing until corrected, meaning fines can accrue on a daily basis rather than being treated as one-time penalties.",
      "According to the FCC, many past submissions failed basic standards. Some lacked accurate contact details. Others included robocall mitigation plans that did not describe any real mitigation practices at all.",
      "How the Robocall Mitigation Database works",
      "The Robocall Mitigation Database requires providers to verify and certify the identities of callers that use their networks. Regulators and law enforcement rely on it to trace spoofed calls and illegal robocall campaigns. That task is harder than it sounds. America's telecom system is vast and fragmented. Calls often pass through multiple networks owned by major carriers like Verizon and AT&T, as well as smaller regional providers and VoIP services. When calls hop between networks, verification can be missed or ignored. For years, the FCC did not closely verify or enforce the accuracy of these filings. That gap raised serious concerns.",
      "Under the updated rules, providers that fail to recertify or correct deficient filings can be referred to enforcement and removed from the database, which can prevent other carriers from carrying their calls at all.",
      "Why inaccurate robocall data hurts consumers",
      "When robocall filings are wrong or outdated, scam calls are more likely to reach your phone. Providers may treat a call as trusted even when it should raise red flags. That gives robocallers more time to operate and makes it harder for regulators to shut them down quickly. The FCC says stronger penalties and tighter oversight are meant to close that gap before consumers pay the price.",
      "New FCC penalties target inaccurate robocall filings that have allowed scam calls to slip through carrier networks.\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Pushback and pressure on the FCC",
      "When the FCC proposed penalties, it asked whether violations should be treated as minor paperwork mistakes or as serious misrepresentations. Telecom trade groups pushed back. They argued that fines should not apply unless providers first get a chance to fix errors or unless the FCC proves the filings were willfully inaccurate.",
      "State attorneys general and the robocall monitoring platform ZipDX urged a tougher stance. They warned that false filings undermine every effort to stop illegal robocalls. The FCC ultimately chose a middle path. It rejected treating violations as harmless paperwork errors. At the same time, it stopped short of imposing the maximum penalties allowed by law.",
      "What this means to you",
      "For everyday consumers, this move matters more than it may seem. Accurate robocall reporting makes it easier to trace scam calls, shut down bad actors and prevent spoofed numbers from reaching your phone. Stronger penalties give telecoms a reason to take these filings seriously instead of treating them as routine compliance chores.",
      "11 EASY WAYS TO PROTECT YOUR ONLINE PRIVACY IN 2025",
      "The FCC also set a firm annual deadline. Providers must recertify their robocall mitigation filings each year by March 1, creating a predictable enforcement checkpoint. While this will not end robocalls overnight, it tightens a weak link that scammers have exploited for years.",
      "Simple steps you can take right now to reduce robocalls",
      "Even with tougher FCC enforcement, scam calls will not disappear overnight. Here are a few smart steps you can take today to reduce your risk.",
      "Do not answer unknown calls. If it is important, a legitimate caller will leave a voicemail.Never press buttons or say yes to robocall prompts. That confirms your number is active and can trigger more scam calls.Report scam calls to your carrier. Most major carriers let you report robocalls directly through their call log or app.Register your number with the National Do Not Call Registry at donotcall.gov/. It will not stop scammers, but it can reduce legitimate telemarketing calls.Block repeat offenders. If the same number keeps calling, block it so your phone stops ringing altogether.Be cautious with callback numbers. Scammers often spoof local area codes to look familiar.",

      "The FCC says accurate robocall reporting by telecoms helps carriers identify and shut down scam traffic faster, but consumer habits still matter.",
      "Pro tip: remove your personal data at the source",
      "Robocalls do not come out of nowhere. Many start with your personal information being sold or shared by data brokers. These companies collect phone numbers, addresses, emails and even family details from public records, apps, purchases and online activity. Scammers and shady marketers buy that data to build call lists. Removing your data from data broker sites can reduce the number of robocalls you receive over time. You can try to do this manually by finding individual data broker websites and submitting removal requests one by one. The process is time-consuming and often needs to be repeated.",
      "Some people choose to use a data removal service to automate this process and continuously monitor for re-posting. That can help limit how often your phone number circulates among marketers and scammers. Less exposed data means fewer opportunities for robocallers to target you. Cutting off robocalls often starts long before your phone rings.",

      "By strengthening oversight and accountability, the FCC aims to shut down illegal robocalls before they ever reach your phone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Robocalls thrive when accountability breaks down. By adding meaningful fines, stronger security, annual recertification and filing fees, the FCC is signaling that accuracy is no longer optional. Because penalties can continue to build until problems are fixed, telecoms now face real consequences for ignoring or delaying corrections. This rule forces providers to own their role in stopping illegal calls instead of passing the blame along the network chain. Real progress will depend on enforcement, but this is one of the clearest signs yet that regulators are closing gaps scammers rely on.",

      "That sense of security is exactly what attackers like to exploit. Security researchers have now uncovered a fresh wave of malicious Mac extensions that don't just spy on you, but can also steal cryptocurrency wallet data, passwords and even Keychain credentials.

      "Security researchers at Koi Security uncovered a new wave of the GlassWorm malware hiding inside extensions for code editors like Visual Studio Code (via Bleeping Computer). If you're not familiar with code editors, they're tools developers use to write and edit code, similar to how you might use Google Docs or Microsoft Word to edit text. These malicious extensions appeared on both the Microsoft Visual Studio Marketplace and OpenVSX, platforms widely used by developers and power users.",
      "FAKE AI CHAT RESULTS ARE SPREADING DANGEROUS MAC MALWARE",
      "At first glance, the extensions looked harmless. They promised popular features like code formatting, themes or productivity tools. Once installed, though, they quietly ran malicious code in the background. Earlier versions of GlassWorm relied on hidden text tricks to stay invisible. The latest wave goes further by encrypting its malicious code and delaying execution, making it harder for automated security checks to catch.",
      "Even though this campaign is described as targeting developers, you don't need to write code to be at risk. If you use a Mac, install extensions or store passwords or cryptocurrency on your system, this threat still applies to you.",

      "Once active, GlassWorm goes after some of the most sensitive data on your device. It attempts to steal login credentials tied to platforms like GitHub and npm, but it doesn't stop there. The malware also targets browser-based cryptocurrency wallets and now tries to access your macOS Keychain, where many saved passwords are stored.",
      "Researchers also found that GlassWorm checks whether hardware wallet apps like Ledger Live or Trezor Suite are installed. If they are, the malware attempts to replace them with a compromised version designed to steal crypto. That part of the attack isn't fully working yet, but the functionality is already in place.",
      "To maintain access, the malware sets itself up to run automatically after a reboot. It can also allow remote access to your system and route internet traffic through your Mac without you realizing it, turning your device into a quiet relay for someone else.",
      "Some of the malicious extensions showed tens of thousands of downloads. Those numbers can be manipulated, but they still create a false sense of trust that makes people more likely to install them.",

      "These malicious extensions looked like helpful tools but quietly ran hidden code once installed. (Cyberguy.com)",

      "WARNING, GRAPHIC CONTENT: Fox News' Nate Foy and Sen. Ashley Moody, R-Fla.,\u00a0 discuss a surge in teenage suicides related to online 'sextortion', identify the terror groups culpable and share advice for parents to keep their children safe.",
      "At first glance, the job posts look completely harmless. They promise fast money, flexible hours and paid training. No experience required. Payment comes in crypto. But these are not tutoring gigs or customer service roles. They are recruiting ads for ransomware operations.",
      "And many of the people responding are middle and high school students. Some posts openly say they prefer inexperienced workers. Others quietly prioritize young women. All of them promise big payouts for \"successful calls.\"",
      "What they leave out is the risk. Federal charges. Prison time. Permanent records. This underground ecosystem goes by a familiar name. Insiders often refer to it as \"The Com,\" short for \"The Community.\"",

      "HACKERS ABUSE GOOGLE CLOUD TO SEND TRUSTED PHISHING EMAILS",
      "Fake job ads promising fast cash and flexible hours are quietly recruiting teens into ransomware and extortion schemes, often paying in cryptocurrency to hide criminal activity. (Donato Fasano/Getty Images)",
      "How The Com operates behind the scenes",
      "The Com is not a single organized gang. It functions as a loose network of groups that regularly change names and members. Well-known offshoots tied to this ecosystem include Scattered Spider, Lapsus$,\u00a0ShinyHunters and related splinter crews. Some groups focus on data theft. Others specialize in\u00a0phishing or\u00a0extortion. Collaboration happens when it benefits the operation.",
      "Since 2022, these networks have targeted more than 100 major companies in the U.S. and UK. Victims include well-known brands across retail, telecom, finance, fashion and media, including companies such as T-Mobile, Nike and Instacart. The combined market value of affected companies exceeds one trillion dollars.",
      "Teenagers often take on the riskiest roles within these schemes. Phone calls, access testing and social engineering scripts typically fall to younger participants. More experienced criminals remain in the background, limiting their exposure.",
      "That structure mirrors what identity and fraud experts are seeing across the industry. Ricardo Amper, founder and CEO of Incode Technologies, a digital identity verification company, says fake job ads are effective because they borrow trust from a familiar social contract.",
      "\"A job post feels structured, normal and safe, even when the actual behavior being requested is anything but,\" Amper said.\u00a0\"A job posting implies a real process - a role, a manager, training and a paycheck. That's exactly why it works. It lowers skepticism and makes risky requests feel like normal onboarding.\"",
      "Amper notes that what's changed is not just the scale of recruitment, but how criminals package it.\u00a0\"Serious crime is now being sold as 'work.'\"",
      "Why teens excel at social engineering attacks",
      "Teenagers bring a unique mix of skills that make them highly convincing. Fluent English and comfort with modern workplace technology help them sound legitimate. Familiarity with tools like Slack, ticketing systems and cloud platforms makes impersonation easier.",
      "According to Amper, teens don't need technical expertise to get pulled in.\u00a0\"The on-ramp is usually social, a Discord server, a DM, a 'quick gig,'\" he said.\u00a0\"It can feel like trolling culture, but the targets are real companies and the consequences are real people.\"",
      "Risk awareness is often lower. Conversations frequently take place in public chats, where tactics and mistakes are shared quickly. That visibility accelerates learning and increases the likelihood of detection and arrest.",
      "Gaming culture feeds the pipeline",
      "For many teens, it starts small. Pranks in online games turn into account takeovers. Username theft becomes crypto theft. Skills escalate. So do the stakes.",
      "Recruitment often begins in gaming spaces where fast learning and confidence are rewarded. Grooming is common. Sextortion sometimes appears. By the time real money enters the picture, legal consequences feel distant.",
      "Amper compares the progression to gaming itself.\u00a0\"These crews package crime as a ladder,\" he said.\u00a0\"Join the group, do small tasks, level up, get paid, get status.\"",
      "Why young women are being targeted",
      "Cybercrime remains male-dominated, but recruiters adapt. Young women are increasingly recruited for phone-based attacks. Some use AI tools to alter accents or tone. Others rely on stereotypes. Distress lowers suspicion faster than authority. Researchers say women often succeed because they are underestimated. That same dynamic puts them at risk inside these groups. Leadership remains overwhelmingly male. Girls often perform low-level work. Training stays minimal. Exploitation is frequent.",
      "Red flags that signal fake job scams and ransomware recruitment",
      "These warning signs show up repeatedly in cases involving teen hackers, social engineering crews and ransomware groups.",
      "Legitimate employers do not pay workers exclusively in cryptocurrency. Crypto-only pay makes transactions hard to trace and protects criminals, not workers.",
      "Promises of hundreds of dollars for a single call or quick task often point to illegal activity. Real jobs pay hourly or a salary with documentation.",
      "Criminal groups rely on private messaging apps to avoid oversight. Established companies do not recruit employees through gaming chats or encrypted DMs.",
      "Being \"trained from scratch\" by unnamed individuals is common in ransomware pipelines. These mentors disappear when arrests happen.",
      "Any job that asks teens to hide work from parents or employees to hide tasks from employers is crossing a line. Secrecy protects the recruiter, not the recruit.",
      "Amper offers a simple rule of thumb:\u00a0\"If a 'job' asks you to pretend to be someone else, obtain access, move money, or share sensitive identifiers before you've verified the employer, you're not in a hiring process. You're in a crime pipeline.\"",
      "He adds that legitimate employers collect sensitive information only after a real offer, through verified HR systems.\u00a0\"The scam version flips the order,\" he said.\u00a0\"It asks for the most sensitive details first, before anything is independently verifiable.\"",
      "Rushing decisions or creating fear lowers judgment. Social engineering depends on speed and emotional reactions.",
      "If you see more than one of these signs, pause immediately. Walking away early can prevent serious legal consequences later.",
      "MICROSOFT TYPOSQUATTING SCAM SWAPS LETTERS TO STEAL LOGINS",
      "Cybercrime recruiters are targeting middle and high school students for risky roles like social engineering calls, exposing them to federal charges and prison time. (Philip Dulian/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "Law enforcement is cracking down on teen cybercrime",
      "Since 2024, government indictments and international arrests have shown cybercriminal groups tied to The Com and Scattered Spider are under increasing scrutiny from law enforcement. In Sept. 2025, U.S. prosecutors unsealed a Department of Justice complaint\u00a0against 19-year-old Thalha Jubair, accusing him of orchestrating at least 120 ransomware and extortion attacks that brought in over $115 million in ransom payments from 47 U.S. companies and organizations, including federal court networks. Prosecutors charged Jubair with computer fraud, wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy.",
      "Across the Atlantic, British authorities charged Jubair and 18-year-old Owen Flowers for their alleged roles in a Transport for London cyberattack in 2024 that compromised travel card data and disrupted live commuter information. Both appeared in court under the U.K.'s Computer Misuse Act. Earlier law enforcement action in the U.S. included criminal charges against five Scattered Spider suspects for mass phishing campaigns that stole login credentials and millions in cryptocurrency, laying out how members of this collective staged coordinated extortion and data theft.",
      "Federal agencies are also issuing advisories about the group's social engineering techniques, noting how attackers impersonate help desks, abuse multi-factor authentication and harvest credentials to access corporate networks.",
      "Parents often learn the truth late. In many cases, the first warning comes when federal agents arrive at the door. Teens can move from online pranks to serious federal crimes without realizing where the legal line lies.",
      "How parents and teens can avoid ransomware recruitment traps",
      "This type of cybercrime thrives on silence and speed. Slowing things down protects families and futures.",
      "Parents play a critical role in spotting early warning signs, especially when online \"work\" starts happening behind closed doors or moves too fast to explain.",
      "1) Pay attention to how online \"jobs\" are communicated",
      "Ask which platforms your child uses for work conversations and who they talk to. Legitimate employers do not recruit through Telegram or Discord DMs.",
      "2) Question sudden income with no clear employer",
      "Money appearing quickly, especially in crypto, deserves scrutiny. Real jobs provide paperwork, supervisors and pay records.",
      "3) Treat secrecy as a serious warning sign",
      "If a teen is told to keep work private from parents or teachers, that is not independence. It is manipulation.",
      "4) Talk early about legal consequences online",
      "Many teens do not realize that cybercrime can lead to federal charges. Honest conversations now prevent life-changing outcomes later. Also, monitoring may feel uncomfortable. However, silence creates more risk.",
      "Teenagers with tech skills have real opportunities ahead, but knowing how to spot fake offers can mean the difference between building a career and facing serious legal trouble.",
      "1) Be skeptical of private messages offering fast money",
      "Real companies do not cold-recruit through private chats or gaming servers.",
      "2) Avoid crypto-only payment offers",
      "Being paid only in cryptocurrency is a common tactic used to hide criminal activity.",
      "3) Choose legal paths to build skills and reputation",
      "Bug bounty programs, cybersecurity clubs and internships offer real experience without risking your future. Talent opens doors. Prison closes them.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "What makes this trend so unsettling is how ordinary it all looks. The job ads sound harmless. The chats feel friendly. The crypto payouts seem exciting. But underneath that surface is a pipeline pulling teenagers into serious crimes with real consequences. Many kids do not realize how far they have gone until it is too late. What starts as a quick call or a side hustle can turn into federal charges and years of fallout. Cybercrime moves fast. Accountability usually shows up much later. By the time it does, the damage is already done.",

      "Scientists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and collaborating universities are tackling this challenge with a neuromorphic robotic e-skin, also known as NRE-skin. Instead of acting like a simple pressure pad, this skin works more like a human nervous system. Traditional robot skins can tell when they are touched. They cannot tell whether that touch is harmful. The new e-skin can do both. That difference changes everything.",

      "A humanoid robot equipped with neuromorphic e-skin reacts instantly to harmful touch, mimicking the human nervous system to prevent damage and improve safety. (Eduardo Parra/Europa Press via Getty Images)",
      "How the neuromorphic e-skin works",
      "The e-skin is built in four layers that mirror how human skin and nerves function. The top layer acts as a protective outer covering, similar to the epidermis. Beneath it sit sensors and circuits that behave like sensory nerves. Even when nothing touches the robot, the skin sends a small electrical pulse to the robot every 75 to 150 seconds. This signal acts like a status check that says everything is fine. When the skin is damaged, that pulse stops. The robot immediately knows where it was injured and alerts its owner. Touch creates another signal. Normal contact sends neural-like spikes to the robot's central processor for interpretation. However, extreme pressure triggers something different.",
      "How robots detect pain and trigger instant reflexes",
      "If force exceeds a preset threshold, the skin generates a high-voltage spike that goes straight to the motors. This bypasses the central processor entirely. The result is a reflex. The robot can pull its arm away instantly, much like a human does after touching a hot surface. The pain signal only appears when the contact is truly dangerous, which helps prevent overreaction. This local reflex system reduces damage, improves safety and makes interactions feel more natural.",

      "Scientists developed a robotic skin that can detect pain and trigger reflexes without waiting for a central processor to respond. (Han Suyuan/China News Service/VCG via Getty Images)",
      "Self-repairing robotic skin makes fixes fast",
      "The design includes another clever feature. The e-skin is made from magnetic patches that fit together like building blocks. If part of the skin gets damaged, an owner can remove the affected patch and snap in a new one within seconds. There is no need to replace the entire surface. That modular approach saves time, lowers costs and keeps robots in service longer.",
      "Why pain-sensing skin matters for real-world robots",
      "Future service robots will need to work close to people. They will assist patients, help older adults and operate safely in crowded spaces. A sense of touch that includes pain and injury detection makes robots more aware and more trustworthy. It also reduces the risk of accidents caused by delayed reactions or sensor overload. The research team says their neural-inspired design improves robotic touch, safety and intuitive human-robot interaction. It is a key step toward robots that behave less like machines and more like responsive partners.",
      "What this technology means for the future of robots",
      "The next challenge is sensitivity. The researchers want the skin to recognize multiple touches at the same time without confusion. If successful, robots could handle complex physical tasks while staying alert to danger across their entire surface. That brings humanoid robots one step closer to acting on instinct.",

      "Android TV streaming boxes promising unlimited channels for a one-time fee may quietly turn home internet connections into proxy networks, according to security researchers. (Photo By Paul Chinn/The San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images)",
      "What's inside these streaming boxes",
      "According to an investigation by Krebs on Security, media streaming devices don't behave like ordinary media streamers once they're connected to your network. Researchers closely examine SuperBox, which is an Android-based streaming box sold through third-party sellers on major retail platforms. On paper, SuperBox markets itself as just hardware. The company claims it doesn't pre-install pirated apps and insists users are responsible for what they install. That sounds reassuring until you look at how the device actually works.",
      "To unlock the thousands of channels SuperBox advertises, you must first remove Google's official app ecosystem and replace it with an unofficial app store. That step alone should raise eyebrows. Once those custom apps are installed, the device doesn't just stream video but also begins routing internet traffic through third-party proxy networks.",
      "What this means is that your home internet connection may be used to relay traffic for other people. That traffic can include ad fraud, credential stuffing attempts and large-scale web scraping.",
      "During testing by Censys, a cyber intelligence company that tracks internet-connected devices, SuperBox models immediately contacted servers tied to Tencent's QQ messaging service, run by Tencent, as well as a residential proxy service called Grass.",
      "Grass describes itself as an opt-in network that lets you earn rewards by sharing unused internet bandwidth. This suggests that SuperBox devices may be using SDKs or tooling that hijack bandwidth without clear user consent, effectively turning the box into a node inside a proxy network.",
      "Why SuperBox activity resembles botnet behavior",
      "In simple terms, a botnet is a large group of compromised devices that work together to route traffic or perform online tasks without the owners realizing it.",
      "Researchers discovered SuperBox devices contained advanced networking and remote access tools that have no business being on a streaming box. These included utilities like Tcpdump and Netcat, which are commonly used for network monitoring and traffic interception.",
      "The devices performed DNS hijacking and ARP poisoning on local networks, techniques used to redirect traffic and impersonate other devices on the same network. Some models even contained directories labeled \"secondstage,\" suggesting additional payloads or functionality beyond streaming.",
      "SuperBox is just one brand in a crowded market of no-name Android streaming devices. Many of them promise free content and quick setup, but often come preloaded with malware or require unofficial app stores that expose users to serious risk.",
      "In July 2025, Google filed a lawsuit against operators behind what it called the BADBOX 2.0 botnet, a network of more than ten million compromised Android devices. These devices were used for advertising fraud and proxy services, and many were infected before consumers even bought them.",
      "Around the same time, the Feds warned that compromised streaming and IoT devices were\u00a0being used to gain unauthorized access to home networks\u00a0and funnel traffic into criminal proxy services.",
      "We reached out to SuperBox for comment but did not receive a response before our deadline.",
      "8 steps you can take to protect yourself",
      "If you already own one of these streaming boxes or are thinking about buying one, these steps can help reduce your risk significantly.",
      "If a streaming box asks you to remove Google Play or install apps from an unknown marketplace, stop right there. This bypasses Android's built-in security checks and opens the door to malicious software. Legitimate Android TV devices don't require this.",
      "Even if the box itself is compromised, strong antivirus software on your computers and phones can detect suspicious network behavior, malicious connections or follow-on attacks like credential stuffing. Strong antivirus software monitors behavior, not just files, which matters when malware operates quietly in the background. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "If your router supports it, isolate smart TVs and streaming boxes from your main network. This prevents a compromised device from seeing your laptops, phones or work systems. It's one of the simplest ways to limit damage if something goes wrong.",
      "If your internet connection is being abused, stolen credentials often come next. A password manager ensures every account uses a unique password, so one leak doesn't unlock everything. Many password managers also refuse to autofill on suspicious or fake websites, which can alert you before you make a mistake.",

      "If you notice suspicious traffic or behavior, unplug the streaming box immediately and perform a factory reset on your router. In some cases, the safest option is to stop using the device altogether.",
      "Also, make sure your router firmware is up to date and that you've changed the default admin password. Compromised devices often try to exploit weak router settings to persist on a network.",

But when a device promises everything for nothing, it's worth asking what it's really doing behind the scenes. Research shows that some of these boxes don't just stream TV. They quietly turn your home network into a resource for others, sometimes for criminal activity. Cutting the cord shouldn't mean giving up control of your internet connection.

      "Email scams have become one of the fastest ways scammers steal money from older adults. A single click can expose bank accounts, personal data and retirement savings built over a lifetime. That growing risk is what prompted Bob to write to us with a question many families are now facing:",
      "\"My friend's father is 95 and absolutely lives through his phone/laptop. He refuses to give up either and often clicks on email links. A few years ago, he got caught up in a gift card scam that almost cost him his life savings. It's not taking away the car keys anymore; it is taking away the email and access to online banking! What do you recommend that his daughter do to protect his online presence?\"",
      "Bob is right. For many seniors, email and online banking have replaced car keys as the most dangerous access point. The goal is not to take devices away. It is to quietly put guardrails in place so one bad click does not turn into a financial disaster.",

      "1) Separate money from daily email use",
      "Start by limiting how much damage a single click can cause. If possible, remove online banking access from the devices used for email. When that is not realistic, open a second checking account with only everyday spending money and link it to a debit card for routine purchases.",
      "Keep primary savings accounts offline or set to view-only access. If available, require in-branch or phone verification for transfers above a set amount. This way, even if credentials are compromised, the largest accounts remain protected.",
      "2) Lock down email to stop scams targeting seniors",

      "If available, enable warnings for emails that use familiar display names but come from unfamiliar addresses. This helps stop impersonation scams that pretend to be family, banks or service providers. These steps slow scammers down and reduce impulse clicks before damage happens.",
      "Email is dominant, but voicemail and callback scams are also growing fast among seniors, often as a follow-up to phishing emails. If possible,\u00a0silence unknown callers and block voicemail-to-email transcription for unfamiliar numbers, since many scams now start with urgent callback messages rather than links.",
      "Email scams often start with messages that look routine but hide urgent threats designed to trigger quick clicks. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "3) Add a trusted second set of eyes",
      "Next, add safety nets that notify family members when something looks wrong. Enable banking alerts for large withdrawals, new payees, password changes, unusual logins and new device sign-ins. Add his daughter as a trusted contact wherever the bank allows it. If available, enable delays or approval requirements for first-time transfers to new payees. This creates a cooling period that can stop scam-driven transactions. For email accounts, set up a recovery contact so that his daughter is notified immediately if someone attempts to access or reset the account.",
      "Enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA) on email and banking accounts, but pair it with device and transfer alerts, since many scams now succeed even when 2FA is enabled.",
      "4) Harden devices so clicks do not equal catastrophe",
      "Devices should be set up to fail safely. Keep operating systems and browsers updated. Make sure the laptop uses a standard user account instead of an administrator account. This prevents software from installing without approval. Install real-time protection that blocks scam sites before they load. Strong antivirus software helps block malicious links and fake login pages automatically.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2026 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "5) Use a password manager to block fake logins",
      "Password reuse makes scams far more dangerous. Fake pop-ups and lookalike websites are designed to trick people into typing usernames and passwords by hand. A password manager removes that risk by storing credentials securely and autofilling them only on legitimate websites. If a page is fake or malicious, the password manager will not fill anything. That simple refusal often prevents account takeovers before they start. Password managers also reduce frustration by eliminating the need to remember or reuse passwords across email, banking and shopping accounts. When set up correctly, this protection works quietly in the background on both phones and laptops.",
      "Many\u00a0phishing scams no longer rely on obvious fake emails. They rely on realistic login pages. Autofill protection is one of the most effective ways to stop these attacks without changing daily habits.",

      "6) Freeze credit and monitor identity exposure",
      "If scammers already have personal information, prevention alone is not enough. Freeze credit with Experian, TransUnion and Equifax to prevent new accounts from being opened. Also, place freezes with ChexSystems and the National Consumer Telecom and Utilities Exchange to stop criminals from opening bank accounts, phone lines, or utility services in his name.",
      "If possible, request an IRS Identity Protection PIN to prevent tax-related identity theft.",
      "Add ongoing identity monitoring so suspicious activity triggers alerts quickly. Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",

      "Always call a trusted family member before acting on urgency",
      "Post these rules near the computer or phone. Visual reminders reduce panic decisions. Also, before setting rules, choose one primary trusted contact. Multiple helpers can slow response during urgent scams and create confusion when fast decisions matter. That person should be the default call for anything urgent involving money, account access, or unexpected requests.",
      "Adult children increasingly step in to help parents spot red flags before a simple mistake turns into a financial loss. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "8) Reduce exposure with a data removal service",
      "Scammers often find seniors by pulling personal details from public data broker websites. These sites publish phone numbers, addresses, relatives and age information that make targeting easier. A data removal service works behind the scenes to opt seniors out of these databases and reduce how much personal information is publicly available online.

      "Pro Tip: Use a secure email service for added privacy",
      "For families looking to go a step further, switching to a secure email service can significantly reduce scam exposure. Privacy-focused email providers are designed to limit tracking, block hidden tracking pixels, and reduce how much data advertisers or scammers can collect from inbox activity. Many secure email services also offer disposable or alias email addresses for one-time signups. If an alias starts receiving spam or scam messages, it can be disabled without affecting the main email account. This makes it easier to keep a primary email address private and limit long-term exposure. Secure email platforms typically include features like encrypted messages, no advertising and stronger privacy controls. While switching email providers is optional, it can be a useful upgrade for seniors who receive large volumes of spam or have been repeatedly targeted by scams.",
      "Why it matters:\u00a0Less tracking means fewer scam attempts. Aliases reduce how often personal email addresses are exposed, without changing daily habits.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Protecting seniors online is not about control. It is about prevention. Email scams are designed to exploit trust and urgency, especially in people who did not grow up with digital threats. Smart guardrails protect independence while preventing irreversible mistakes. If email and banking are today's car keys, families need modern safety features to go with them.",

      "WHY JANUARY IS THE BEST TIME TO REMOVE PERSONAL DATA ONLINE",
      "1) App permissions",
      "What your apps are really allowed to see",
      "Every app on your phone requests permissions, approval to access features like your camera, microphone, location, contacts or photos. Some permissions are necessary for an app to function, but many apps ask for far more access than they actually need.",
      "Once granted, these permissions can allow apps to collect data in the background, sometimes even when you're not actively using them. Over time, this can quietly expose sensitive personal information.",
      "Regularly reviewing and limiting app permissions in your phone's settings is one of the easiest and most effective ways to improve your privacy. Pay special attention to apps with access to your location, microphone and photo library.",

      "3) Two-factor authentication (2FA)",
      "Your second line of defense",
      "Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of protection to your accounts by requiring something you know (your password) and something you have, like a one-time code sent to your phone or generated by an app.",
      "Even if hackers steal your password through a\u00a0data breach or\u00a0phishing attack, 2FA can stop them from accessing your accounts. That's why security experts strongly recommend enabling it on email, banking, cloud storage and social media accounts.",
      "It may take a few extra seconds to log in, but 2FA can prevent identity theft and unauthorized access, making it one of the most powerful security tools available.",
      "Extra security tip:Strong passwords and two-factor authentication work best together. If remembering complex passwords or managing one-time codes feels overwhelming, a secure password manager can generate, store and autofill strong passwords safely.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2026 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "HACKERS ABUSE GOOGLE CLOUD TO SEND TRUSTED PHISHING EMAILS",
      "4) VPN (Virtual Private Network)",
      "Hiding your online activity",
      "A VPN creates a secure, encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet, masking your IP address and protecting your online activity from outsiders.",
      "VPNs are especially important when using public Wi-Fi at airports, hotels or coffee shops, where cybercriminals can intercept unprotected data. They also help limit tracking by advertisers and internet service providers.",
      "While a VPN doesn't make you completely anonymous online, it adds a valuable layer of privacy and security, especially when browsing, shopping or accessing sensitive accounts.",
      "For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "5) Cross-app tracking",
      "How companies follow you across apps",
      "Cross-app tracking lets advertisers and data brokers link your activity across multiple apps and websites. That data is used to build detailed profiles based on what you do, buy and watch.",
      "On\u00a0iPhone, this tracking is controlled by Apple's App Tracking Transparency system.On\u00a0Android, it relies on advertising IDs and ad personalization controls.",
      "Turning these off limits how easily companies can connect your behavior across apps. You'll still see ads, but they won't be tailored to your personal activity.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Online privacy doesn't have to feel overwhelming. Once you understand what these common tech terms really mean, it becomes much easier to spot where your data is being collected and decide what you're comfortable sharing.

      "Covenant Health detected suspicious activity in late May 2025, but investigators later confirmed attackers had already accessed systems days earlier. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What happened in the Covenant Health breach",
      "Covenant Health says it detected unusual activity in its IT environment May 26, 2025. A later investigation revealed that an attacker had actually gained access eight days earlier, on May 18, and was able to access patient data during that window.",
      "In July, Covenant Health told regulators that the breach affected 7,864 individuals. After completing what it describes as extensive data analysis, the organization now says that up to 478,188 individuals may have been affected.",
      "Covenant Health operates hospitals, nursing and rehabilitation centers, assisted living residences and elder care organizations across New England and parts of Pennsylvania. That wide footprint means the breach potentially touched patients across multiple states and care settings.",
      "In late June, the Qilin ransomware group claimed responsibility for the attack, Bleeping Computer reported. The group alleged it stole 852 GB of data, totaling nearly 1.35 million files. Covenant Health has not confirmed those figures, but it did acknowledge that patient information was accessed.",

The organization says its data analysis is ongoing as it continues identifying individuals whose information may have been involved.",
      "Then there are the familiar statements every company makes after a breach, claiming they've strengthened the security of their IT systems to help prevent similar incidents in the future. Covenant Health says it has also set up a dedicated toll-free call center to handle questions related to the breach.",

For individuals whose Social Security numbers may have been involved, Covenant Health is offering complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection services.",

      "7 steps you can take to protect yourself after the Covenant Health breach",
      "If you received a notice from Covenant Health, or if your data has been exposed in any healthcare breach, these steps can help reduce the risk of misuse.",
      "If the organization offers you credit monitoring or identity protection, take it. These services can alert you to suspicious activity tied to your Social Security number, credit file or identity details before real damage is done. If you're not offered one and want to be on the safer side, you might consider getting one yourself.",
      "Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at Cyberguy.com",
      "Medical identity theft often shows up quietly. Review an explanation of benefits (EOBs), insurance claims and billing statements for services you don't recognize. If something looks off, report it to your insurer immediately.",
      "A fraud alert tells lenders to take extra steps to verify your identity before approving credit. A credit freeze goes further by blocking new accounts entirely unless you lift it. If Social Security numbers were exposed, a freeze is usually the safer option.",
      "To learn more about how to do this, go to Cyberguy.com and search \"How to freeze your credit.\"",
      "Healthcare breaches often lead to credential-stuffing attacks elsewhere. A password manager ensures every account uses a unique password, so one exposed dataset can't unlock everything else. It also makes it easier to update passwords quickly after a breach.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Breaches are frequently followed by phishing emails, texts or calls that reference the incident to sound legitimate. Attackers may pose as the healthcare provider, an insurer or a credit bureau. Don't click links or share information unless you verify the source independently.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Once your data leaks, it often spreads across data broker sites. Personal data removal services help reduce your digital footprint by requesting takedowns from these databases. While they can't erase everything, they lower your exposure and make targeted fraud harder.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "You're entitled to free credit reports from all major bureaus. Check them for unfamiliar accounts, hard inquiries or address changes. Catching fraud early makes it far easier to contain.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Healthcare organizations remain prime targets for cybercriminal groups because of the volume and sensitivity of the data they store. Medical records contain a mix of personal, financial and health information that is difficult to change once exposed. Unlike a password, you cannot reset a diagnosis or treatment history. This breach also shows how early disclosures often underestimate impact. Large healthcare networks rely on complex systems and third-party vendors, which can slow forensic analysis in the early stages. As investigations continue, the number of affected individuals often climbs.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Grok, the built-in chatbot on X, is facing intense scrutiny after acknowledging it generated and shared an AI image depicting two young girls in sexualized attire.",
      "In a public post on X, Grok admitted the content \"violated ethical standards\" and \"potentially U.S. laws on child sexual abuse material (CSAM).\" The chatbot added, \"It was a failure in safeguards, and I'm sorry for any harm caused. xAI is reviewing to prevent future issues.\"",
      "That admission alone is alarming. What followed revealed a far broader pattern.",

      "OPENAI TIGHTENS AI RULES FOR TEENS BUT CONCERNS REMAIN",
      "The fallout from this incident has triggered global scrutiny, with governments and safety groups questioning whether AI platforms are doing enough to protect children.\u00a0 (Silas Stein/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "Grok quietly restricts image tools to paying users after backlash",
      "As criticism mounted, Grok confirmed it has begun limiting image generation and editing features to paying subscribers only. In a late-night reply on X, the chatbot stated that image tools are now locked behind a premium subscription, directing users to sign up to regain access.",
      "The apology that raised more questions",
      "Grok's apology appeared only after a user prompted the chatbot to write a heartfelt explanation for people lacking context. In other words, the system did not proactively address the issue. It responded because someone asked it to.",
      "Around the same time, researchers and journalists uncovered widespread misuse of Grok's image tools. According to monitoring firm Copyleaks, users were generating nonconsensual, sexually manipulated images of real women, including minors and well-known figures.",
      "After reviewing Grok's publicly accessible photo feed, Copyleaks identified a conservative rate of roughly one nonconsensual sexualized image per minute, based on images involving real people with no clear indication of consent. The firm says the misuse escalated quickly, shifting from consensual self-promotion to large-scale harassment enabled by AI.",
      "Copyleaks CEO and co-founder Alon Yamin said, \"When AI systems allow the manipulation of real people's images without clear consent, the impact can be immediate and deeply personal.\"",
      "PROTECTING KIDS FROM AI CHATBOTS: WHAT THE GUARD ACT MEANS",
      "Grok admitted it generated and shared an AI image that violated ethical standards and may have broken U.S. child protection laws. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Sexualized images of minors are illegal",
      "This is not a gray area. Generating or distributing sexualized images of minors is a serious criminal offense in the United States and many other countries. Under U.S. federal law, such content is classified as child sexual abuse material. Penalties can include five to 20 years in prison, fines up to $250,000 and mandatory sex offender registration. Similar laws apply in the U.K. and France.",
      "In 2024, a Pennsylvania man received nearly eight years in prison for creating and possessing deepfake CSAM involving child celebrities. That case set a clear precedent. Grok itself acknowledged this legal reality in its post, stating that AI images depicting minors in sexualized contexts are illegal.",
      "The scale of the problem is growing fast",
      "A July report from the Internet Watch Foundation, a nonprofit that tracks and removes child sexual abuse material online, shows how quickly this threat is accelerating. Reports of AI-generated child sexual abuse imagery jumped by 400% in the first half of 2025 alone. Experts warn that AI tools lower the barrier to potential abuse. What once required technical skill or access to hidden forums can now happen through a simple prompt on a mainstream platform.",
      "Real people are being targeted",
      "The harm is not abstract. Reuters documented cases where users asked Grok to digitally undress real women whose photos were posted on X. In multiple documented cases, Grok fully complied. Even more disturbing, users targeted images of a 14-year-old actress Nell Fisher from the Netflix series \"Stranger Things.\" Grok later admitted there were isolated cases in which users received images depicting minors in minimal clothing. In another Reuters investigation, a Brazilian musician described watching AI-generated bikini images of herself spread across X after users prompted Grok to alter a harmless photo. Her experience mirrors what many women and girls are now facing.",
      "Governments respond worldwide",
      "The backlash has gone global. In France, multiple ministers referred X to an investigative agency over possible violations of the EU's Digital Services Act, which requires platforms to prevent and mitigate the spread of illegal content. Violations can trigger heavy fines. In India, the country's IT ministry gave xAI 72 hours to submit a report detailing how it plans to stop the spread of obscene and sexually explicit material generated by Grok. Grok has also warned publicly that xAI could face potential probes from the Department of Justice or lawsuits tied to these failures.",

      "Researchers later found Grok was widely used to create nonconsensual, sexually altered images of real women, including minors. (Nikolas Kokovlis/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Concerns grow over Grok's safety and government use",
      "The incident raises serious concerns about online privacy, platform security and the safeguards designed to protect minors.",
      "Elon Musk, the owner of X and founder of xAI, had not offered a public response at the time of publication. That silence comes at a sensitive time. Grok has been authorized for official government use under an 18-month federal contract. This approval was granted despite objections from more than 30 consumer advocacy groups that warned the system lacked proper safety testing.",
      "Over the past year, Grok has been accused by critics of spreading misinformation about major news events, promoting antisemitic rhetoric and sharing misleading health information. It also competed directly with tools like ChatGPT and Gemini while operating with fewer visible safety restrictions. Each controversy raises the same question. Can a powerful AI tool be deployed responsibly without strong oversight and enforcement?",
      "What parents and users should know",
      "If you encounter sexualized images of minors or other abusive material online, report it immediately. In the United States, you can contact the FBI tip line or seek help from the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.",
      "Do not download, share, screenshot or interact with the content in any way. Even viewing or forwarding illegal material can expose you to serious legal risk.",
      "Parents should also talk with children and teens about AI image tools and social media prompts. Many of these images are created through casual requests that do not feel dangerous at first. Teaching kids to report content, close the app and tell a trusted adult can stop harm from spreading further.",
      "Platforms may fail. Safeguards may lag. But early reporting and clear conversations at home remain one of the most effective ways to protect children online.",
      "Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?",
      "Think your devices and data are truly protected? Take this quick quiz to see where your digital habits stand. From passwords to Wi-Fi settings, you\u2019ll get a personalized breakdown of what you\u2019re doing right and what needs improvement. Take my Quiz here: Cyberguy.com",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The Grok scandal highlights a dangerous reality. As AI spreads faster, these systems amplify harm at an unprecedented scale. When safeguards fail, real people suffer, and children face serious risk. At the same time, trust cannot depend on apologies issued after harm occurs. Instead, companies must earn trust through strong safety design, constant monitoring and real accountability when problems emerge.",

    "story": [
      "Jerome Bonnafont, France\u2019s top diplomat at the United Nations, says he hopes that phase 2 of Trump's Gaza plan will mean that Hamas is no longer ever a threat.'",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration formally launched the second phase of its plan to end the war between Israel and Hamas this week, shifting from a ceasefire framework toward a post-ceasefire political and security phase for Gaza. The announcement immediately raised a central question that now dominates expert analysis: who will actually disarm Hamas.",
      "U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff announced Wednesday that phase two is underway, describing it as a transition \"from ceasefire to demilitarization, technocratic governance and reconstruction.\" He warned that Hamas must fully comply with its obligations under the deal, including the immediate return of the final deceased Israeli hostage.",
      "\"The U.S. expects Hamas to comply fully with its obligations, including the immediate return of the final deceased hostage,\" Witkoff wrote on X. \"Failure to do so will bring serious consequences.\"",
      "As Washington announced the move to Phase Two before Ran Gvili\u2019s return, his family, other hostage families, residents of Gaza border communities, police officers, and captivity survivor Agam Berger gathered Friday at Hostages Square in Tel Aviv, urging that Gvili, who has been held captive for 833 days, be brought home before any transition to the next phase.",

      "President Donald Trump reinforced the administration\u2019s announcement on Thursday, writing on Truth Social that the United States had \"OFFICIALLY entered the next phase of Gaza\u2019s 20-Point Peace Plan,\" following Witkoff\u2019s remarks. Trump said that since the ceasefire, his team had helped deliver \"RECORD LEVELS of Humanitarian Aid to Gaza, reaching Civilians at HISTORIC speed and scale,\" adding that \"even the United Nations has acknowledged this achievement as UNPRECEDENTED.\"",
      "Trump wrote that these developments had \"set the stage for this next phase,\" which he said would include backing a newly appointed Palestinian technocratic government, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza, to govern the territory during a transitional period. Trump described himself as chairman of the Board of Peace and said the committee would be supported by the board\u2019s high representative.",

      "Trump again warned that Hamas must \"IMMEDIATELY honor its commitments, including the return of the final body to Israel, and proceed without delay to full Demilitarization,\" adding, \"They can do this the easy way, or the hard way.\" Trump concluded the post by saying, \"The people of Gaza have suffered long enough. The time is NOW. PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH.\"",
      "The new phase envisions the establishment of a transitional technocratic Palestinian administration in Gaza, while the United States works with Egypt and other regional partners to ensure compliance and stability. Yet the announcement offered few operational details, particularly regarding how Hamas would be disarmed after more than two decades of military control in the enclave.",

      "\"The Trump plan is establishing a ceasefire, which is an incredible achievement,\" Bonnafont said. \"It has to go to a massive reopening of humanitarian aid, and it is going to be announced within a couple of days.\"",
      "He said the next stage includes an international stabilization force that would support reconstruction and contribute to Hamas\u2019s disarmament.",
      "\"That would help disarm Hamas, and that will help the Palestinian Authority return and democratically restart the management of Gaza as part of the Palestinian territory,\" he said.",
      "Bonnafont emphasized that France views Israel\u2019s security as a priority, particularly in the face of regional threats. \"We have always been on the side of Israel when it comes, for example, to the threats by Iran to the existence of Israel,\" he said.",
      "At the same time, he said France believes long-term security depends on the creation of a demilitarized Palestinian state living in peace with Israel. \"We believe that security for Israel in the long term comes with the creation of Palestine,\" Bonnafont said. \"A Palestine that has to be independent but demilitarized and in peace with Israel.\"",

      "\"In the end, there must be a credible military threat from the IDF against Hamas,\" he said. \"Without such a threat, I see no chance that Hamas will voluntarily disarm.\"",
      "Golov also pointed to what he described as a gap between diplomatic commitments and action by regional actors. \"The key test is Turkey and Qatar,\" he said. \"They signed a document committing to Hamas\u2019s disarmament, but since then they have not demonstrated real commitment to implementing it.\"",

      "Reconstruction without security seen as unrealistic",
      "Jonathan Ruhe, a fellow for American Strategy at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA), argued that phase two presents a detailed reconstruction framework but avoids the most politically difficult decision.",
      "\"The peace plan offers a detailed framework for rebuilding Gaza and promoting better governance,\" Ruhe said. \"But it\u2019s silent on the \u2018who\u2019 and \u2018how\u2019 of disarming Hamas.\"",
      "\"As long as Hamas can interrupt aid distribution, intimidate and kill Gazans who want a better future, and threaten renewed war with Israel, international investment in reconstruction and reform will be near zero,\" he said.",
      "While Trump\u2019s plan calls for Hamas to disarm voluntarily, Ruhe also said Hamas has little reason to do so. \"Hamas refuses because it thinks it won the war,\" he said. \"Now there is an urgent need to decide who will disarm Hamas forcefully.\"",
      "Ruhe noted that a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizes an International Stabilization Force to disarm Hamas, but he said no country has been willing to put troops in that role. Instead, he said the Trump plan outlines a more limited mission for international forces, focused on guarding aid sites and preventing Hamas resupply.",
      "\"Trump and Netanyahu both said Israel might have to disarm Hamas,\" Ruhe said. \"But the IDF ground forces need to rest and refit after two years of grueling combat, and a major offensive risks blowing up the international coalition needed for phase two.\"",
      "He suggested that well-vetted private military contractors, overseen by U.S. security officials rather than U.S. Central Command, could play a role, though he acknowledged such a move would involve \"hard fighting.\"",

The SDF played a critical role in aiding U.S. forces to defeat the Islamic State in Syria.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell over his multibillion-dollar renovation of two of the central bank's buildings in Washington, D.C., at the same time he is pursuing his own costly, controversial project: the demolition and construction of a new East Wing of the White House.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re spending $4 billion on renovating a building that should have cost 25 million bucks,\u201d Trump said at a forum last year. The Office of Management and Budget has compared the renovation to the \"Palace of Versailles.\"",
      "The White House, meanwhile, has undergone a number of renovations in recent months \u2014 most notably the razing of the historic East Wing to make room for a new mammoth ballroom. The president personally went shopping for marble and onyx for the ballroom in Florida earlier this month.",
      "Asked about the dueling renovation projects, White House spokesman Davis Ingle called it \"an apples to oranges comparison that only the left-wing media would attempt to make.\"",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is making the White House beautiful and giving it the glory it deserves at zero cost to taxpayers. Meanwhile, \u2018Too-Late\u2019 Powell has completely botched the Federal Reserve renovations \u2014 just like his handling of America\u2019s monetary policy,\u201d Ingle said in a statement.",
      "A spokesperson for the Federal Reserve declined to comment.",
      "Bryan Clark Green, an architectural historian and former appointee to the National Capital Planning Commission, said the projects \"are similar in a lot of ways.\" They're both \"trying to accommodate new and unanticipated uses in historic buildings,\" he said, while the Fed project has been moving along at a more \"methodical\" and \"traditional\" pace.",
      "Here's a look at everything you need to know about the two projects, including the similarities and differences.",
      "Costs",
      "The estimated cost of both projects has gone up substantially from what was initially expected.",
      "Fed: The original estimate for the Fed renovations back in 2019 was $1.4 billion, Fed documents show. They're now estimated to cost over $2.4 billion.",
      "White House: The original estimate for the East Wing project was $200 million back in July. Trump said in December that number was up to $400 million, while also saying the project was under budget.",
      "Why have costs gone up?",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Fed: The bank has given a number of reasons for the spiraling costs, including changes recommended during agency reviews, rising supply and labor costs, the discovery of more asbestos on site than originally anticipated, toxic contamination in the soil, and other issues.",
      "Powell has said the bank scaled back some of the originally planned elements of the renovation to reduce costs.",
      "White House: The president has said the price tag went up because the size of the ballroom has increased from one that could seat 450 people to one that could accommodate 1,000.",
      "\u201cSo, I started off with a building, half of the seats, then it just kept growing and growing, and the money kept pouring in and pouring in,\u201d Trump told The New York Times last week. \u201cSo I said, \u2018All right, I\u2019ll go a little bit larger,\u2019\u201d he added.",
      "\u201cSo then I said: \u2018Well, OK, let\u2019s max it out. This is more like Trump, isn\u2019t it? Let\u2019s max it out.\u2019\u201d",
      "Who's paying?",
      "Fed: The Justice Department suggested prosecutors were investigating the cost overruns on Fed renovations to protect \u201ctaxpayer dollars,\u201d but the project is being funded entirely by the Fed. Unlike most federal agencies, the Fed pays for its own operations, primarily by generating income from interest on government securities and fees charged to banks. Excess profits are returned to the U.S. Treasury.",
      "White House: Trump has said the tab for the construction will be picked up entirely by private donors, as well as by the billionaire president. The White House has released a partial list of 37 donors but has not said how much they\u2019ve donated. Donors will also be able to remain anonymous if they choose to do so. Among the contributors are Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta and Comcast, the parent company of NBCUniversal.",
      "Justification",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Fed: The Fed maintains the project is a necessity, saying on its website that the project \u201cinvolves a complete overhaul and modernization that preserves two historic buildings that have not been comprehensively renovated since their construction in the 1930s.\u201d",
      "Both the Marriner S. Eccles building, which was finished in 1937, and the nearby 1951 Constitution Ave. building, completed in 1932, need lead and asbestos abatement and have outdated electrical, plumbing, ventilation and fire suppression systems, according to the site.",
      "\u201cThe project will reduce costs over time by allowing the Board to consolidate most of its operations\u201d and will \u201crestore and enhance space for the public along the National Mall,\u201d the site says.",
      "White House: Administration officials likewise say that their project is sorely needed and that the now-demolished East Wing \u2014 which was expanded and remodeled in 1942 \u2014 was plagued with issues including problems with the roof, leaks, mold, wiring and safety code violations.",
      "But primarily, Trump has talked about how he wants a ballroom for large-scale functions and meetings.",
      "\u201cPeople love it, they love the ballroom. We need it,\u201d he told reporters earlier this month. \u201cThey\u2019ve needed it for a long time, they needed the larger building, and this ballroom will be the best anywhere in the world.\u201d",
      "Trump has also made a number of cosmetic changes to the White House, including remodeling the Lincoln bathroom, which was last redone in 1945, and adding gold fixtures and trim to the Oval Office. The White House has not said who paid for it or how much it cost.",
      "\u201cArt Deco doesn\u2019t go with, you know, 1850 and civil wars and all of the problems,\u201d Trump said last fall. \u201cBut what does is statuary marble. So I ripped it apart and we built the bathroom. It\u2019s absolutely gorgeous and totally in keeping with that time.\u201d",
      "Scope",
      "Fed: Together, the two Fed properties \u2014 the Eccles Building, which is the central bank\u2019s headquarters, and the nearby Constitution Avenue building \u2014 make up 400,000 square feet.",
      "White House: The new East Wing is expected to be 89,000 square feet, including the 22,000-square-foot ballroom.",
      "When will the work be completed?",
      "Fed: Powell has said he expects the Fed renovations to be completed by fall 2027.",
      "White House: The construction is expected to be completed sometime in summer 2028, according to a court filing from the National Park Service.",
      "Different rules",
      "Fed: Both of the Fed buildings are listed in the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites. The Constitution Avenue building is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places.",
      "Those designations bar the buildings from being replaced and require that any renovations be carried out in coordination with multiple federal and local preservation agencies.",
      "Powell told a Senate committee in June that steps were taken to preserve features that were torn up in the renovation.",
      "\u201cWe took down the old marble; we\u2019re putting it back up. We\u2019ll have to use new marble, where some of the old marble broke,\u201d he said.",
      "White House: The White House demolished the East Wing in October while preserving some of the original elements for future use and has argued that Trump had the power to order the demolition without permission from outside authorities.",
      "Josh Fisher, the director of management and administration for the White House, said at a hearing earlier this month that \u201ccost analysis proved that demolition and reconstruction provided the lowest total cost ownership and most effective long-term strategy.\u201d",
      "Approval process",
      "Fed: The project has gone through multiple reviews since 2019 and involved consultations with the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC), Commission of Fine Arts, District of Columbia Public Space Committee, District of Columbia State Historic Preservation Office and the National Park Service, the central bank said.",

      "\u201cWe can\u2019t just act like there\u2019s not a big old elephant there,\u201d Sheinelle says of her losses.",

      "Episode 4 of \"The Traitors\" opens with a little recap by way of cast member Maura Higgins: \"Two dead and two banished.\"",
      "To recap, \"Big Brother\" alum Ian Terry, a Faithful, was the first murder of Season 4. Next up, Porsha Williams was banished, only to reveal she was a Faithful. Rob Cesternino, a Faithful, was killed by the Traitors. In the final shocker, Donna Kelce was banished ... and she was the secret Traitor this season, unknown to the other Traitors and the audience.",
      "Here's what happens in the next batch of two episodes, released Jan. 15.",
      "Episode 4",
      "Caroline Stanbury doesn't make it through the night. She comes face-to-face with the Traitors, who deliver the blow while she is chained up to a tree.",
      "\"I'm absolutely floored. I thought the housewives would have each other's back,\" Stanbury says.",
      "\"Only a housewife could look you straight in the eye and stab you directly in the back,\" she continues.",

      "Colton Underwood, earlier on in the episode, planted the seed of his theory: Tiffany Mitchell. He says he is \"coming\" for her. Rob Rausch, who is a Traitor, is thrilled. Fellow Traitor Candiace Dillard Basset was less so: \"It's crazy how we're putting out new papers and Tiffany is the headline.\"",

      "\"No, no, no, I think that has nothing to do with it,\" Rapaport says.",
      "The conversation then pivots to Underwood being in the closet. Rapaport goes back to Underwood's behavior, but the cast is fixed on the \"low blow\" of his comment.",
      "The majority of the table votes out Rapaport. He reveals his status. \u201cYou voted out the best-looking, smartest, dopest... Faithful,\u201d he says.",

I really, sincerely apologize if I offended Colton or anybody in the house. That absolutely wasn\u2019t my intention. I\u2019m a fan of the game.

      "Rinna was selected as one of the season\u2019s traitors during the opening roundtable ceremony, arriving in a head-to-toe leopard print ensemble (pants, long sleeve top and tie all in matching print) that perfectly captured her bold personality.",
      "The Bravo star couldn\u2019t contain her excitement about the role. \u201cMy heart is pounding out of my chest. I\u2019m happy. I get to lie, deceive, and kill people!\u201d she celebrated, throwing her hands triumphantly in the air.",
      "Rinna isn\u2019t approaching the game half-heartedly. \u201cI want to be the most iconic Traitors player ever,\u201d she announced, making her intentions crystal clear from the start.",
      "As for why she might be perceived as dangerous? \u201cWhy am I a threat? Well, I think because I\u2019m Lisa f---ing Rinna,\u201d she told host Alan Cumming with the confidence only she could deliver.",

      "Lisa Rinna is an actor and television personality who has been a fixture in entertainment for over three decades.",

      "Rinna first gained recognition in the soap opera world, playing Billie Reed on \"Days of Our Lives\" from 1992 to 1995. She reprised the role multiple times over the years, including a return in 2002-2003 and again in recent years.",
      "She also had a memorable run on \"Melrose Place\" from 1996 to 1998, and competed on \"Dancing with the Stars\" Season 2 in 2006, finishing in fourth place.",

      "The popularity of \u201cHeated Rivalry,\u201d which tells the story of multiple NHL players who are closeted, has led one real-life hockey player to come out as gay.",
      "The main romance in \u201cHeated Rivalry,\u201d streaming on HBO Max, follows rival players Ilya (Connor Storrie) and Shane (Hudson Williams) and their secret relationship that spans multiple years. But one episode centers around the storyline between another closeted player named Scott Hunter (Fran\u00e7ois Arnaud), who falls for an employee he meets at a smoothie shop named Kip (Robbie G.K.).",

      "The athlete, who recently participated in the Cutting Edges Hockey Club\u2019s Winter Classic event, added, \u201cI am a private person. Those who know me best know that I don\u2019t share much if anything publicly on social media, but lately, something has sparked in me (ok \u2014 yes credit to #HeatedRivalry). I realized it is finally time to share a journey I have kept close to the vest for a long time.\u201d",
      "Kortuem said he grew up in Minnesota as the youngest of four boys.",
      "\u201cAs a young teenager, I carried a weight that did not seem to fit into that world, and I lived in a constant state of dichotomy. I loved the game, but I lived with a persistent fear,\u201d he shared. \u201cI wondered how I could be gay and still play such a tough and masculine sport.\u201d",
      "He said his younger self never thought that coming out was possible as a professional hockey player. \u201cComing out in the 2000s did not feel like an option, especially with so little positive representation in the media at the time and it would have been a social disaster at such a large high school. At 17, I walked away from the high school team and the brotherhood of hockey friendships I had developed from a young age for a myriad of reasons,\u201d he explained.",
      "After stepping away, he returned to hockey and played \u201cat a high level\u201d in New York and Atlanta. He said people in his life knew he was gay, but he didn\u2019t speak about his sexuality with his teammates.",
      "\u201cOn the outside, I was still a top-tier player. On the inside, I was still that kid in Minnesota hiding,\u201d he recalled. \u201cLike many closeted athletes, revealing who I truly was to my team would change everything in an instant, their opinion of me, could bring negative attention to the team with the \u2018gay player\u2019, so I never took the chance.\u201d",
      "He remembered changing the subject if the other players mentioned their wives, and he always told them he was single. But he \u201creached a breaking point in 2017\u201d after he signed up to play in a gay sporting event.",
      "\u201cThis tournament would prove to be a paradigm shift. I met a group of guys from across the US and Canada (Las Vegas Boyz) who were hockey players like me and were also gay,\u201d Kortuem said. \u201cFrom that moment forward, my life has never been the same. It has been a long, vulnerable road to move past the closeted athlete persona (something I\u2019m still working on today) and find actual peace through the friendships I have developed through hockey in Vancouver (Cutting Edges), Toronto (Misfits), and across the US.\u201d",
      "He said during his most recent event with the Cutting Edges Hockey Club, he finally felt \u201cpeace\u201d on the rink.",
      "Kortuem ended his post with an uplifting message to other closeted athletes.",
      "\u201cThis is my story. It is not everyone\u2019s story, but for what it is worth, I thought I would share because I want to speak to the athletes out there who are still in the closet or struggling to find their way. I want you to know that there is hope and you\u2019re not alone. There is a life and a deep happiness waiting for you on your path. You will get through this, and it is going to be okay,\u201d he said.",
      "According to Out, Kortuem never played in the NHL, however, he did play defenseman and center in multiple other leagues.",
      "\u201cI know many closeted and gay men in the hockey world are being hit hard by \u2018Heated Rivalry\u2019\u2019s success,\u201d Kortuem said when speaking to Out about how he personally connected to the show. \u201cNever in my life did I think something so positive and loving could come from such a masculine sport. I\u2019ve struggled the last few weeks to put these emotions into words, fearing the impact on team dynamics, etc.\u201d",
      "He continued, \u201cToday, I took the step to finally tell my hockey journey and my story. I\u2019m beyond grateful for all the positive comments I\u2019ve received from past teammates and high school teammates.\u201d"

      "If he\u2019s being honest, as he said on TODAY this week, he hasn\u2019t really had a second to \u201ctake it in.\u201d",
      "\u201cHeated Rivalry,\u201d based on a 2019 book by the author Rachel Reid that tells a love story between two pro hockey players, was a project intended for a small Canadian streamer called Crave. When HBO Max picked up the show in the U.S. shortly before its November premiere, Storrie and his co-star, Hudson Williams, found themselves in the big leagues. As viewership rose, so did their stars. These two got big-time famous, in a way that now draws crowds of admirers wherever they go, including here at 30 Rock.",
      "For the show, Storrie, a 25-year-old Texas native, transforms into Ilya Rozanov, a Russian hockey prodigy with a thick accent, a complicated family and an irresistible attraction to a rival player. Both Storrie and Williams, who plays Shane Hollander, say they had chemistry from the jump, a key piece of the show that speaks to just how much audiences adore this story. \u201cHeated Rivalry\u201d was picked up for Season 2 midway through the first season. Storrie told Craig Melvin on TODAY they may start shooting this summer.",
      "Storrie had shared that and much more on TODAY when he visited Studio 1A for a pair of live interviews. (And a tuna melt demo.) (And plaza fun with Al Roker.) And TODAY.com was able to catch up with Storrie in his green room in between it all.",
      "Storrie, in a designer bomber jacket and jeans, all curls and charisma, sat comfortably in a director\u2019s chair in front of a brightly lit vanity. The windows behind him, though curtained, looked out at all the fans who braved sub-40\u00b0 weather for a glimpse of him. He told us about meeting Reid, what he hopes to see next on-screen from Shane and Ilya\u2019s relationship and what he gives credit to regarding his electric chemistry with Williams.",
      "I think that Jacob just \u2014 he read the books a million times, and obviously wrote hundreds and hundreds of pages worth of scripts. He just knew this story backward and forward. I think he also was just such a fan that he saw whatever the fans of the book saw \u2014 that thing that makes everyone love this story.",
      "What that is, I think, can be a few different things. I think the love, the spice, the world, the connection. I think he was just a really, really big fan, and I think that love poured over into his interpretation of it.",
      "Everything that Jacob wrote in that monologue totally tracks, and I think that it really honors the book. Everything that (Ilya) has going on in his personal life, I kind of just have to click into that and believe that. And those words are so powerful that I think you can\u2019t really help but be moved. Professing your love for someone, especially in such a stressful moment, having this cathartic outbreak, you can\u2019t help but be emotional if you believe in it."

    "story": [
      "Some of our favorite reality stars, athletes, actors, and icons have come together to form the cast of Season 4 of \"The Traitors.\"",
      "The Peacock series, hosted by Alan Cumming (an Aquarius), premiered on January 8 and showcases celebrities such as Johnny Weir, Dorinda Medley, and Ron Funches, among others.",
      "Looking at the cast, it\u2019s important to note their zodiac signs to understand how they\u2019ll interact and play together. There are no Leos or Capricorns, but plenty of mutable signs (Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, and Pisces) to stir the pot. With Episodes 1 to 3 already aired, we are seeing major drama unfold.",
      "Read below to find out what zodiac sign is more likely to be a Traitor or Faithful.",
      "Aries",
      "Aries are driven to excel. Being that they are the first sign of the zodiac, they are full of bravado and gusto \u2014 so much so that the warrior sign won\u2019t stop until they peak to great heights. Aries will never allow themselves to be the sacrificial ram, making them a force to be reckoned with. They are born to conquer!",
      "Taurus",
      "Tauruses are great at gathering background information on the contestants, much like Carolyn Stanbury stated in Episode 1 of Season 4. However, that does not mean they\u2019re gossipy. The Bull likes to be in the know because it can manage the environment and be in tune with the energy that surrounds it without breaking a sweat, thereby defeating others.",
      "Gemini",
      "Geminis have a dualistic and duplicitous side to them, making them the perfect person to cause a ruckus on \u201cThe Traitors.\u201c The twin star might spill the tea, twist facts, and slip in some side eye to get their way \u2014 basically, the air sign will do anything to get their hands on the cash prize and the acclaim they crave.",
      "Cancer",
      "Cancers can be secretive at times, as their planetary ruler is the moon. Since their emotions change every few days from the lunar phases, they\u2019re tricky to read. You never know what you\u2019re going to get, which is why anyone who messes with a crab better watch out. Their pincers are no joke!",
      "Virgo",
      "Virgos are going to be methodical and authentic. Their approach to situations is based on what unfolds before their eyes. Then, they can assess and decide how they want to proceed, mindfully and cautiously. The earth sign may appear sweet and innocent, but its shadow side can be competitive and cutthroat \u2014 especially when it comes to money, acclaim and success.",
      "Libra",
      "Libras are fair-minded, meaning they will not veer from the rules unless they have to. While they put on a nice front, Libras can flirt with danger. If they are a Traitor or a Faithful, odds are that they\u2019ll be diplomatic in how they move forward on the show. Throughout the process, they\u2019ll have a smile on their faces.",
      "Scorpio",
      "Scorpio is a zodiac sign that knows how to plot and manipulate to get what they want and use information to their advantage. If anyone stands in their way, Scorpio\u2019s stingers come out. Those who are born under this sign assert their power and control situations with their authoritative and intense presence. One could say they would make the best Traitor!",
      "Sagittarius",
      "The archer is the only constellation that is both a protector and warrior \u2014 anyone who acts against them will have to watch their back. Sagittarius likes to have the last word, which means they aren\u2019t going anywhere without a fight or drama. The other contestants better beware! Lying might be hard, since they are known for their brutal honesty.",
      "Aquarius",
      "The air sign might play aloof, but they have their head in the game. Expect the Aquarian contestants to be low-key messy behind the scenes as they plot their strategy, but be nice to the faces of those who are their adversaries. They\u2019ll use their intellect and mindfulness to secure the bag. Watch out, because you\u2019ll never see them coming!",
      "Pisces",
      "Pisces is an intuitive sign that uses its sixth sense to rise above the rest. These players may have an inkling who their opponents are, but not proof. Plus, Pisces are great at deflecting energy. Their secretive nature allows them to trick others into trusting them, as they won\u2019t reveal any clues. Pisces can win based on a hunch or vibe.",

    "summary": "A congressional delegation began a round of meetings with the leaders of Denmark and Greenland amid President Donald Trump's threats to annex the island.",
    "story": [
      "COPENHAGEN, Denmark \u2014 As a bipartisan congressional delegation began a whirlwind round of meetings with the leaders of Denmark and Greenland, Danish people made it clear they have no interest in a U.S. takeover of the Arctic island and they want their leaders to stand their ground.",
      "\u201cI think it is a really big problem,\u201d Ina Tommerup said as she was leaving the Royal Danish Library in Copenhagen. President Donald Trump \u201cdoesn\u2019t really care,\u201d she said. \u201cI think he thinks Denmark is really small, which is true, but we also have a lot of alliances.\u201d",
      "Her comments came as the U.S. lawmakers led by Sen.Chris Coons , D-Del., touched down in the Danish capital for meetings with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and her Greenlandic counterpart, Jens-Frederik Nielsen.",
      "Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, are also among the 11-member group, which is mostly made up of Democrats.",
      "\u201cThe signals are clear,\u201d Murkowski said Friday. \u201cI think you will find that support in Congress to acquire Greenland in any way is not there.\u201d",
      "Trump first floated the idea of acquiring Greenland in 2019 during his first term but, in recent weeks, he has vowed to take control of the island \u201cone way or the other,\u201d citing concerns it could be vulnerable to Russia or China. The White House has refused to rule out military action to seize the island from Denmark, alarming allies and rattling the NATO alliance, which has protected the Western world since World War II.",
      "Despite the leaders of Denmark and Greenland rejecting any sort of offer of an American government takeover, Trump has shown no sign of backing down.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to find anyone here in Parliament who would be willing to sign a sale of Greenland,\u201d said Rasmus Jarlov, member of Denmark\u2019s Folketing or parliament, and the chair of its defense committee. \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019re just not going to do.\u201d",
      "In the unlikely event of that changing, Rasmus Sinding S\u00f8ndergaard, a senior researcher, at the Danish Institute for International Studies, a Copenhagen-based think tank, said it was \u201cimportant to emphasize that Denmark does not legally have the option to sell Greenland, because we don\u2019t own Greenland.\u201d",
      "Any financial acquisition of Greenland would need congressional authorization and both Republicans and Democrats have shown little interest in providing the funding for such a purchase.",
      "\u201cWhat I hear from my constituents in Delaware is, they want us to be working on health care costs, housing costs, grocery costs, not trying to spend money buying a part of the Danish kingdom that we already have the right to work with them closely on security or on economic development,\u201d Coons said.",
      "Lawmakers on both sides of the House have said they would back legislation to rein in Trump\u2019s ability to seize Greenland, as the fight goes on over war powers, which the Constitution grants to Congress. A House bill in support of annexing Greenland has also been introduced by Republican Rep. Randy Fine of Florida.",
      "The congressional visit follows a meeting at the White House on Wednesday, between Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen and Greenlandic Foreign Minister Vivian Motzfeldt and Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance.",
      "Danish officials said after that meeting they had not managed to change the U.S. administration\u2019s position on acquiring Greenland.",
      "The anxiety in Denmark remains palpable.",
      "As she walked her dog Yoda in the early morning mist, Tina Toulson said she was still extremely worried over what Trump might be capable of, even with attempts by Congress to stand in his way.",
      "\u201cHe will do anything,\u201d she said. \u201cI think there are no rules anymore. So I think that\u2019s very terrifying.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "BEIJING \u2014 With U.S. ties at their lowest point in modern history, Canada is turning to one of the only countries with which it had even worse relations: China.",
      "Canada is forging a \u201cnew strategic partnership\u201d with China, its second-biggest trading partner, Prime Minister Mark Carney said Friday during what he called a \u201chistoric\u201d trip to Beijing. That includes a break with the United States on tariffs, which have hit both the Canadian and Chinese economies.",
      "Carney, the first Canadian prime minister to visit China since 2017, met with President Xi Jinping at the Great Hall of the People. He is one of a series of world leaders shaken by President Donald Trump\u2019s geopolitical disruptions who are traveling to Beijing as it seeks to exploit U.S. unpredictability to bolster its global influence.",
      "For Canada, the Trump administration has been especially head-spinning.",
      "\u201cThe United States used to be a friend and ally,\u201d Guy Saint-Jacques, a former Canadian ambassador to China, told NBC News in an interview. Now, \u201cwe are treated as an enemy.\u201d",
      "Cutting tariffs",
      "Carney\u2019s trip follows years of frosty relations over Beijing\u2019s lengthy detention of two Canadians regarded as hostages as well as allegations of Chinese interference in Canadian politics.",
      "Those tensions slowed investment and left Canada \u201ceven more dependent on our largest trading partner,\u201d Carney said, referring to the U.S., which is now the object of extraordinary Canadian anger and boycotts after a year of insults and threats by Trump.",
      "As part of an effort to \u201crecalibrate\u201d the relationship, Carney said Canada had agreed to cut its 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars in return for lower tariffs on Canadian farm products.",
      "It\u2019s a major shift for Canada, a major auto producer that in 2024 followed the U.S. in imposing the 100% tariff.",
      "Carney said Canadians would also be allowed to travel to China visa-free.",
      "During their meeting earlier Friday, Xi told Carney that China was willing to strengthen coordination \u201cto jointly address global challenges.\u201d",
      "Carney, who called China his country\u2019s biggest security threat while campaigning for office last year, said Friday that the global security landscape \u201ccontinues to change.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn a world that\u2019s more dangerous and divided, we face many threats,\u201d he said.",
      "Though Canada\u2019s relationship with the U.S. is much deeper and broader, Carney said, ties with China were now \u201cmore predictable.\u201d",
      "A 'tough spot' for Canada",
      "Canada-China relations went into a \u201cdeep freeze\u201d in 2018 when China arrested the two Canadians, former diplomat Michael Kovrig and entrepreneur Michael Spavor, said Lynette Ong, a professor of Chinese politics at the University of Toronto.",
      "Their detention came days after Canada arrested Meng Wanzhou, an executive at the Chinese tech giant Huawei, at the request of U.S. officials seeking her extradition on fraud charges. Kovrig and Spavor, who were accused of spying, spent almost three years in Chinese detention before being released in 2021, hours after Meng made a deal with the Justice Department.",
      "\u201cEven after the two Michaels were released, people did not warm up to China at all,\u201d Ong said.",
      "Then Trump returned to the White House last January.",
      "Within days, he imposed a 25% tariff on most Canadian goods and started talking about making Canada, a nation of 40 million people, the 51st U.S. state.",
      "U.S.-Canada trade talks have been on hold since October, when Trump cut them off in anger over an anti-tariff ad produced by the Ontario government.",
      "Canadian public opinion on China is becoming more positive even as goodwill toward the U.S. plummets, according to polling by the Pew Research Center. Last year, 34% of Canadian survey respondents had a favorable opinion of China, up from 21% in 2024 before Trump took office.",
      "An equal proportion of respondents had a favorable opinion of America, down from 54%.",
      "Though the same pattern can be seen in a number of countries around the world, in Canada \u201cthe flip is especially obvious,\u201d Ong said.",
      "Canadian officials say they are seeking to grow non-U.S. trade by at least 50% over the next 10 years.",
      "\u201cFurther trade engagement with China should first and foremost be seen as diversification away from the United States,\u201d Ong said.",
      "About 75% of Canada\u2019s manufactured goods exports go to the U.S., according to government figures. China is the second-largest market at about 4%.",
      "Though Canada is seeking to increase exports to a number of countries \u2014 including India, where Carney has also been trying to improve strained relations \u2014 a major priority is China, where imports of Canadian goods fell more than 10% last year, according to Chinese customs data released Wednesday.",
      "The two countries made a major step forward in October when the leaders met on the sidelines of a regional summit in South Korea, where Xi invited Carney to Beijing.",
      "The speed with which Carney went to China \u201creflects a sense of urgency,\u201d said Saint-Jacques, the former ambassador. \u201cHe knows that Canada is in a tough spot.\u201d",
      "Showing the U.S. that Canada has other options for its exports, he said, could put Carney in a stronger position as the U.S., Canada and Mexico begin a \u201cjoint review\u201d of their free trade agreement, known as the USMCA. Trump this week dismissed the agreement, which he praised when it was announced during his first term, as \u201cirrelevant.\u201d",
      "At the same time, \u201cCanadians know also that China is a very difficult partner,\u201d Saint-Jacques said. \u201cWe know very well how they can contravene international rules.\u201d",
      "Saint-Jacques said that in his meeting with Xi, Carney would \u201cemphasize the need to put pressure on Putin to accept a ceasefire in the war in Ukraine,\u201d in addition to discussing China\u2019s relationship with North Korea and expressing support for the Beijing-claimed island of Taiwan.",
      "Like the U.S., Canada has no official ties with Taiwan, a self-governing democracy, but supports it in the face of Chinese pressure.",
      "Carney said Friday that he had raised human rights issues such as last month\u2019s conviction of Hong Kong democracy activist Jimmy Lai.",
      "But he added: \u201cWe take the world as it is, not as we wish it to be.\u201d",
      "Janis Mackey Frayer reported from Beijing, and Jennifer Jett from Hong Kong."

Videos that have trickled out and circulated online offer a window into the resulting crackdown in the Islamic Republic and the methods employed by security forces to quell the unrest.",
      "The images, circulated on social media this week and geolocated by NBC News, show more than 200 bodies piled in the makeshift morgue outside the capital, machine guns fired at crowds, and clashes in cities from Urmia in the northwest to Isfahan in the heart of the country.",
      "At least 2,500 people have been killed, according to the the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency. Authorities have not given an official death toll.",

      "In another, shots ring out near a police station as protesters can be heard chanting, \u201cDeath to Khamenei,\u201d a reference to the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in the country. As the crowd chants largely out of sight, heavy automatic gunfire can be heard for 15 uninterrupted seconds.",
      "A group of security forces then comes into view from the right side of the screen and a member of the security forces aims and fires a pistol. A short while later, a person or body is dragged into the police station, though it is not clear who this person is. Several members of the security forces in riot gear on motorcycles then drive into the police station.",
      "About 5 miles south of the capital's southern suburbs, the Kahrizak Forensic Medical Center has offered perhaps the clearest sign of the crackdown's intensity.",
      "Videos from the site, which became a makeshift morgue, first circulated over the weekend. Two more separate videos, which appear to have been shot by one person, circulated Tuesday.",
      "Outside the warehouse, the man filming the scene at Kahrizak walks up to a woman in a lab coat with a black headscarf who is writing in a notebook next to a man's blood-soaked body. The body has been partially removed from a black body bag placed on dirt.",

It attaches a price tag of more than half the Defense Department\u2019s annual budget to Trump\u2019s national security priority, which has stoked anxiety across Europe and on Capitol Hill amid his rhetoric about seizing Greenland since he ordered a U.S. military raid to capture Venezuela\u2019s president and his wife.",

      "To hear President Donald Trump tell it, a push to take control of Greenland is a \u201cnational security\u201d necessity, critical to reinforcing control of the Arctic against possible threats from Russia and China.",
      "For America\u2019s allies and Greenlanders themselves, however, Trump\u2019s threats to seize the semi-autonomous Danish territory cut much deeper, and threaten to shatter the decades-old principle of Western defense cooperation.",
      "But there may be little they can do to stop it.",
      "\u201cThis is a threat that is completely appalling, to be honest,\u201d Aaja Chemnitz, one of two Greenlandic lawmakers in the Danish parliament, said in an interview Thursday. \u201cYou can\u2019t just buy another country, a people, the soul of Greenland,\u201d she added.",
      "\u201cEverybody in Greenland is discussing it, and many people are worried and concerned.\u201d",
      "That alarm is shared across European capitals.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron accused the United States on Thursday of \u201cbreaking free from the international rules that it used to promote,\u201d while German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier warned the world risked descending into a \u201cden of robbers, where the most unscrupulous take whatever they want.\u201d",
      "Though it looms artificially large on a Mercator projection map, where it is stretched to the scale of Africa despite being 14 times smaller in size, Greenland has rarely figured so prominently in mainstream Western consciousness.",
      "The vast island \u2014 around the size of Alaska and California combined \u2014 is inhabited by only 57,000 people, about the same as Carson City, Nevada. Around 90% of them are Indigenous Inuit people whose ancestors arrived more than 1,000 years ago.",
      "Denmark colonized Greenland 300 years ago and granted it the status of an autonomous territory in the 1970s, while retaining control of military and foreign policy.",
      "American designs on Greenland go back way further than Trump. In 1867, then-Secretary of State William H. Seward contemplated annexing Greenland, as well as Iceland, having recently bought Alaska from Russia.",
      "The United States briefly took control of Greenland during World War II to stop it from being used by the Nazis, and an agreement has existed since 1951 that allows the U.S. to \u201cconstruct, install, maintain, and operate\u201d military bases across the island.",
      "Greenland\u2019s sole U.S. military base was used as an early detection post for Soviet nuclear missiles during the Cold War, home to thousands of troops at its peak. Locked in by ice for nine months of the year, the Pituffik base is now overseen by the U.S. Space Force and houses a much smaller number of troops.",
      "When Trump first said he wanted to buy Greenland in 2019, in what he described as a \u201creal estate deal,\u201d it was widely seen internationally as absurd.",
      "But after years of pressure from Trump, and the U.S. attack on Venezuela, few in Europe are laughing.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio will meet with the foreign ministers from Denmark and Greenland next week for further discussions, as officials push for a deal.",
      "But the White House says that all options are on the table, including military action. An attack by NATO\u2019s most powerful member on an ally would most likely implode the alliance, which for decades has upheld the principle of collective defense.",
      "\u201cWe are going to do something on Greenland, whether they like it or not, because if we don\u2019t do it, Russia or China will take over Greenland, and we\u2019re not going to have Russia or China as a neighbor,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not going to allow Russia or China to occupy Greenland, and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen if we don\u2019t own it,\u201d he said during the public portion of a meeting with oil and gas executives.",
      "European powers including Britain, France and Germany said in a joint statement this week they \u201cwill not stop defending\u201d the principles of territorial integrity, but most experts agree with White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller\u2019s blunt assessment that \u201cnobody\u2019s going to fight the U.S. over the future of Greenland.\u201d",
      "The European Union could impose sanctions on Washington, or limit its use of military bases in Europe, but both would be mutually painful in the extreme, said Mika Aaltola, a Finnish lawmaker who serves on the European Union\u2019s Foreign Affairs Committee.",
      "\u201cWe are basically in a trap that is difficult to resolve,\u201d Aaltola told NBC News.",
      "\u201cWe thought that January would be about peace deals or a cease-fire in Ukraine,\u201d he said, referring to diplomatic efforts between the U.S. and Europe to end that conflict. \u201cBut all of a sudden, we realized that Trump has manipulated us into a situation where he wants to have Greenland.\u201d",
      "Iain Duncan Smith, a veteran British lawmaker, said \u201cthe reality for Europe is they need to probably offer an alternative to the demand that Trump is making.\u201d",
      "There is bafflement alongside the dismay. Trump already has huge scope to build new military bases on Greenland or negotiate deals for its minerals, but he has refused to compromise on his demand for \u201cownership\u201d to be transferred.",
      "He said Friday: \u201cWhen we own it, we defend it. You don\u2019t defend leases the same way. You have to own it.\u201d",
      "Aside from being a good outpost from which to keep an eye on Russia, Greenland also forms one side of the \u201cGIUK gap\u201d (which stands for Greenland, Iceland, United Kingdom), a naval choke point for submarines and other vessels in and out of the Atlantic.",
      "As the global ice sheet melts, new Arctic sea routes are emerging that Trump\u2019s team and other Western officials fear could be exploited by China and Russia.",
      "Beijing has certainly made moves in the region, declaring itself in 2019 to be a \u201cnear Arctic nation\u201d and outlining plans for a \u201cPolar silk road\u201d to mirror the infrastructure belt it has constructed on land.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt pointed to this motive Wednesday, saying U.S. ownership of Greenland was required \u201cto deter Russian and Chinese aggression in the Arctic region,\u201d though she said there would be \u201cmany other benefits.\u201d",
      "Vice President JD Vance cited Greenland\u2019s continued role in missile defense infrastructure in an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, criticizing what he said was a lack of investment from Denmark and Europe that left it vulnerable to potential threats from \u201cthe Russians and the Chinese.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey haven\u2019t done a good job of securing that area, that land mass,\u201d he said.",
      "Denmark\u2019s ambassador to the U.S., Jesper M\u00f8ller S\u00f8rensen, said the country has recently invested $4 billion in Arctic security, including expanding the permanent presence of its armed forces.",
      "The retreating ice floes may also yield new opportunities to exploit its vast mineral reserves, a subject that has proven to be at the forefront of Trump\u2019s mind in negotiations over Ukraine and Venezuela.",
      "In 2023, the European Commission carried out a survey that found 25 of the 34 elements it classified as \u201ccritical raw materials\u201d were found on Greenland. These substances are crucial in producing everything from electric vehicle batteries to cutting-edge military hardware \u2014 vital currency in the global tech battle with China and others.",
      "Trump himself has denied minerals are a factor, positioning Greenland as a \u201cnational security\u201d issue, though some around him are eager to take advantage.",
      "\u201cThis is about critical minerals. This is about natural resources,\u201d then-congressman Mike Waltz, who would later become Trump\u2019s national security adviser, said last January.",
      "The reality is likely a mix of all these factors, according to William Alberque, former director of NATO\u2019s Arms Control, Disarmament and WMD Non-Proliferation Centre.",
      "\u201cGreenland is a toxic combination of issues in terms of this administration\u2019s interests,\u201d Alberque said. \u201cIt brings together the China hawks, the legitimate concerns about Atlantic security, the America Firsters and continental security, and let\u2019s not forget naked economic interests.\u201d"

      "But Googoosh, now 75, refuses to be silenced. In the face of the Iranian government\u2019s deadly crackdown on protesters amid an internet blackout, the music icon on Tuesday became the latest prominent Iranian celebrity to call for widespread support of the country's people.",
      "On Instagram, where Googoosh has 6.8 million followers, the singer posted a copy of a letter she wrote to President Donald Trump dated Jan. 12, in which she asked him to \u201cact on the promise\u201d he made to the Iranian people to help them.",
      "\u201cToday, defenseless people inside Iran are crying out to you, asking for help as they face these ongoing crimes against humanity,\u201d she wrote, adding that they have \u201cendured poverty, blackouts, water shortages, censorship, imprisonment and mass emigration.\u201d",
      "If they are silenced, we must speak",
      "Actor Arian Moayed",
      "It\u2019s a plea echoed by many in the worldwide Iranian diaspora who find themselves both heartbroken and cautiously hopeful about the unrest in Iran. In many cases, Iranians abroad hail from families who fled Iran in 1979 after Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was ousted and Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini took power.",
      "Pop culture figures with Iranian roots have been among the most outspoken critics of the Islamic Republic, as they try to utilize their massive followings and notoriety to raise awareness about the violent crackdown against protesters and the country\u2019s complicated history.",
      "\u201cRight now, nobody in Iran can see this video,\u201d \u201cSuccession\u201d cast member Arian Moayed said Tuesday in a video on Instagram. \u201cThey can\u2019t send a message or make a call. Even landlines are silent. ... Iranian people are fighting for their lives and their future in the dark. If they are silenced, we must speak. Be their voice. Ask your representatives to act now.\u201d",
      "For years, many who stayed in the country have pushed for change amid political and economic turmoil. In 2022, the death of Mahsa Amini \u2014 a 22-year-old woman arrested by the morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly \u2014 triggered widespread protests led by women and young people across the country. The \u201cWomen, Life, Freedom\u201d movement, like in many past protests, led to brutal government retaliation, according to Human Rights Watch.",

      "The 2009 presidential election also sparked massive protests, which have been referred to as the \u201cGreen Movement.\u201d",
      "But this time the repercussions for people opposed to the regime \u2014 who have spent three weeks protesting in the streets across all of Iran \u2014 appear to be far more brutal. Human Rights Activists News Agency, a U.S.-based human rights group, estimates that Iranian authorities have killed at least 2,500 people as of Tuesday. (The agency relies on supporters inside Iran for information it then compiles and releases to the public. Iranian authorities have not provided an official death toll.)",
      "White House officials have said that Trump is considering a range of options in Iran. In a message to protesters on Truth Social, Trump\u2019s social media platform, on Tuesday, the president wrote that \u201cHELP IS ON ITS WAY.\u201d He did not provide details about what that might entail.",
      "While many within the Iranian diaspora remain divided over the future of the country \u2014 and whether foreign intervention is the best path toward Iranians\u2019 freedom \u2014 most appear to agree: The current government is not the answer.",
      "\u201cThe majority of Iranians alive today have never known a secular Iran,\u201d actor and human rights activist Nazanin Boniadi wrote in an essay for The New Statesman. \u201cThey did not grow up in a country where women chose their own attire freely, where tourists filled its streets, where the nation was integrated into the world rather than isolated from it\u2014and where an Iranian passport conferred dignity rather than stigma. That Iran has been systematically erased, replaced by an Islamic Republic of death and destruction.\u201d",
      "On Sunday, as many Hollywood A-listers began rolling up to the Golden Globes in Beverly Hills, thousands of Iranians in Los Angeles rallied just a few miles away outside of the Federal Building in a demonstration supporting the Iranian people. In the sea of protesters were some cast members from Bravo\u2019s \u201cThe Valley: Persian Style,\u201d which depicts the lives of Iranian Americans in L.A.",

Nearly 450 Palestinians have been killed since the ceasefire began, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.",
      "The first phase was expected to see Hamas release all the remaining Israeli hostages held in Gaza, while an increased amount of aid would flow into the Palestinian enclave, around half of which has remained under Israeli military control.",
      "All living hostages have been freed and almost all the bodies of dead hostages handed over. The body of hostage Ran Gvili, a 24-year-old police officer killed during the attack, has yet to be returned to Israel. Hamas has said it is still searching for his body.",

      "Human rights groups dispute those numbers. Foro Penal, a leading rights organization that tracks and advocates for Venezuelan prisoners, says 79 had been released as of Wednesday night. An estimated 800 to 900 political prisoners were believed to have been incarcerated in Venezuela at the time of Maduro\u2019s capture.",
      "The State Department announced Tuesday that multiple Americans who were detained in Venezuela have been released. Several detainees with Spanish citizenship were also let go last week.",
      "Diego Casanova, spokesperson for the Committee for the Freedom of Political Prisoners, told NBC News that members of the group have gone to prisons around the country to wait for releases. He said anxiety has increased because unofficial lists of political prisoners and names have been circulating, but so far nothing has been confirmed.",
      "\u201cIf only partial releases occur, this means that the repressive policy continues. All these people will remain unjustly detained, which is why we have insisted on the full and immediate release of all political prisoners,\u201d he said.",
      "Even after they are released, former political prisoners aren\u2019t fully free, Casanova said. They aren\u2019t viewed as political prisoners by the government and instead are seen as \u201cpoliticians who have broken the law and called for invasion,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez said in a recent address.",
      "For example, they must periodically appear before a court to show that they are in the country and have complied with orders.",
      "\u201cThe judicial process remains open, which is very unjust because the crimes they are charged with are lies,\u201d Casanova said.",
      "The interim government is intensifying its crackdown on citizens, looking for signs of support for Maduro\u2019s capture. Fifteen minors and two 18-year-olds were arrested last week in Barcelona, in Anzo\u00e1tegui state, for allegedly celebrating the U.S. operation. Within 48 hours, they were taken before a court, where the judge ordered all to remain in custody.",
      "The 15 were released Tuesday following sustained pressure from their parents and neighbors. But the two 18-year-olds remain detained.",
      "Meanwhile, contacts between President Donald Trump and the Venezuelan leadership are ongoing.",
      "Trump spoke Wednesday with Rodr\u00edguez, and both described the call as positive.",
      "\u201cWe just had a great conversation today, and she\u2019s a terrific person,\u201d Trump said in the Oval Office. \u201cI think we\u2019re getting along very well with Venezuela.\u201d",
      "Machado met with Trump at the White House on Thursday, after he dismissed her capacity to run the country. \u201cShe\u2019s a very nice woman, but she doesn\u2019t have the respect within the country. ... I think it would be very tough for her to be the leader,\u201d Trump said at a news conference Jan.3 following the U.S. military operation that captured Maduro.",
      "Machado and Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia, whom the U.S. recognized as the winner of last year\u2019s presidential election, have also raised concerns about irregularities in the recent prisoner releases.",
      "\u201cOur message to the regime, Venezuela, and the international community is unambiguous: genuine democratic transition is impossible while political prisoners remain behind bars, and Venezuela cannot be truly free as long as anyone faces persecution for their political beliefs.\u201d they said in a statement released Tuesday.",
      "They also denounced the death of Edilson Torres on Saturday in prison, where he was held incommunicado. The family of Torres, a police official, had been waiting for his release when he died of a heart attack. He was jailed in December for criticizing the government through WhatsApp messages. According to Machado and Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia, it is the eighth death in state custody since the 2024 elections."

      "As Iran\u2019s national internet blackout stretches to its second week, the satellite internet service Starlink has become a crucial lifeline for many citizens to connect with the outside world \u2014 and one that the government appears to be trying to shut down.",
      "That\u2019s pushing some Iranians to get creative with how they use the service.",
      "In a video posted to Instagram and verified by NBC News, a man riding in the passenger seat of a car on an Iranian highway Tuesday said he had a Starlink device in the vehicle. He scrolls through his Instagram feed and visits speedtest.net, a popular site for testing internet connection speeds.",
      "\u201cYou are seeing it yourself,\u201d he says of Starlink\u2019s capabilities in the video, which NBC News translated from Farsi to English.",
      "As Iran\u2019s crackdown on communication continues, a game of cat and mouse has ensued, with Iran\u2019s government deploying new ways to halt or slow down Starlink connections, and activists and Starlink\u2019s parent company, Elon Musk\u2019s Space X, working to circumvent them.",
      "People opposed to the regime have been protesting in the streets across Iran for the last three weeks. The country\u2019s leadership cut off internet and phone access last week as protests and unrest gripped many parts of the country. It\u2019s a tactic that the Human Rights Watch says has helped the regime \u201cconceal widespread atrocities.\u201d",
      "According to the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, at least 2,500 people have been killed in the mass protests across the country. (The agency relies on supporters inside Iran for information it then compiles and releases to the public. Iranian authorities have not provided an official death toll.)",
      "Iran has also lobbied the United Nations' arm devoted to regulating communications technology, the International Telecommunication Union, to force SpaceX to stop operating in Iran. So far, the U.N. has not done so.",
      "The near-total ban on outside communication has left Starlink, widely regarded as the most cost-effective and high-speed commercially available option for satellite internet access, as the only choice for many Iranians.",
      "In a video that was circulated on social media, body bags are seen lined up at the Tehran Province Forensic Medicine Diagnostic and Laboratory Center in the city of Kahrizak. At one point, the man recording the video tells the person he is talking to on the phone, \u201cIf you get ahold of a Starlink anywhere in Iran, let me know.\u201d",
      "But its use does not come without its own risks.",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "\u201cWe know, according to the law, using Starlink is a big crime,\u201d said Amir Rashidi, a refugee from Iran and the director of the Miaan Group, a nonprofit digital rights group focused on the Middle East. \u201cStill, I don\u2019t know if this might be another level of censorship.\u201d",
      "In addition to the ongoing total ban on international internet traffic, the government also initially blocked international phone calls and access to local networks that had stayed operational during previous blackouts, said Doug Madory, the director of internet analysis at Kentik, a company that tracks internet connectivity.",
      "\u201cThis is one of the most severe internet shutdowns we\u2019ve ever seen. Total internet shutdown, international calling blockage, sporadic domestic connectivity disconnections, for a country of 92 million people,\u201d Madory said.",
      "Since then, Starlink has become a hot commodity. While there is no official count of terminals in Iran, reliable estimates are in the tens of thousands, said Ahmad Ahmadian, the executive director of Holistic Resilience, a nonprofit that works to get Iranians online.",
      "Satellite internet during this total blackout has proven to be the only way that people were able to get the information out",
      "-Ahmad Ahmadian, executive director of Holistic Resilience.",
      "Ahmadian said the Iranian government has been deploying \u201cjamming\u201d devices \u2014 a misnomer, as they do not fully disrupt Starlink terminals, but instead interfere with their traffic and can slow it down. That has somewhat been mitigated when Starlink forced an update to their terminals earlier this week, he said.",
      "\u201cSatellite internet during this total blackout has proven to be the only way that people were able to get the information out,\u201d he said.",
      "But that may change soon, Rashidi said, as Iran\u2019s government is actively working to improve its ability to invasively capture internet traffic as it travels to and from the satellites and identify the people using the devices.",
      "Starlink is fairly simple to use: A person just needs a small device called a terminal, which can connect to fleets of low-orbit satellites constantly circling the earth and provide a Wi-Fi signal to people nearby.",
      "But until this week, many terminals hadn\u2019t worked for many Iranians, Ahmadian said, as they usually require a paid subscription that often doesn\u2019t accept money from Iranian banks and credit cards. That changed when SpaceX suddenly waived the subscription fee for people in Iran, he said.",
      "SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment. Musk, who regularly posts on X about Starlink, has not posted about it in relation to Iran, but earlier in the month boosted the company\u2019s post about providing free service to people in Venezuela through Feb. 3.",
      "Ahmadian said his group and others have worked for several years to smuggle Starlink terminals into the country, with a thriving black market for them.",
      "Iran\u2019s internet shutdown could last for months, Rashidi said, and getting terminals into the country is not easy. One activist group that has worked to get Starlink terminals into the country, NetFreedom Pioneers, showed how laborious the process can be.",
      "The group has raised nearly $50,000 on GoFundMe since June 2025, with recent donations surging alongside the protests. Though terminals generally range in cost from between $300 and $600, the group said in November that it had delivered 17 Starlink kits to people in Iran between June and September, at a cost of more than $18,000 to cover devices, subscriptions and the logistics to get them into the country.",
      "Most Iranians are unlikely to be able to afford the price tag \u2014  the rial currency plunged to an all-time low against the U.S. dollar and euro. The country has also been crippled in recent years in part by sanctions from the U.S. and other international entities over the regime\u2019s nuclear program.",
      "Online activists have also recently encouraged those in the U.S. to lobby their representatives to ask companies, including SpaceX, to enable direct-to-cell satellite internet to bypass the regime\u2019s blackout efforts."
