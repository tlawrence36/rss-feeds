      "Pop superstar Beyonc\u00e9 and her expansive cultural legacy will be the subject of a new course next year at Yale University",
      "With a record 99 Grammy nominations and acclaim as one of the most influential artists in music history, pop superstar Beyonc\u00e9 and her expansive cultural legacy will be the subject of a new course at Yale University next year.",
      "Titled \u201cBeyonc\u00e9 Makes History: Black Radical Tradition, Culture, Theory & Politics Through Music,\u201d the one-credit class will focus on the period from her 2013 self-titled album through this year's genre-defying \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d and how the world-famous singer, songwriter and entrepreneur has generated awareness and engagement in social and political ideologies.",
      "Yale University's African American Studies Professor Daphne Brooks intends to use the performer's wide-ranging repertoire, including footage of her live performances, as a \u201cportal\u201d for students to learn about Black intellectuals, from Frederick Douglass to Toni Morrison.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to be taking seriously the ways in which the critical work, the intellectual work of some of our greatest thinkers in American culture resonates with Beyonc\u00e9's music and thinking about the ways in which we can apply their philosophies to her work\" and how it has sometimes been at odds with the \u201cBlack radical intellectual tradition,\u201d Brooks said.",
      "Beyonc\u00e9, whose full name is Beyonc\u00e9 Giselle Knowles-Carter, is not the first performer to be the subject of a college-level course. There have been courses on singer and songwriter Bob Dylan over the years and several colleges and universities have recently offered classes on singer Taylor Swift and her lyrics and pop culture legacy. That includes law professors who hope to engage a new generation of lawyers by using a famous celebrity like Swift to bring context to complicated, real-world concepts.",
      "Professors at other colleges and universities have also incorporated Beyonc\u00e9 into their courses or offered classes on the superstar.",
      "Brooks sees Beyonc\u00e9 in a league of her own, crediting the singer with using her platform to \u201cspectacularly elevate awareness of and engagement with grassroots, social, political ideologies and movements\u201d in her music, including the Black Lives Matter movement and Black feminist commentary.",
      "\u201cCan you think of any other pop musician who\u2019s invited an array of grassroots activists to participate in these longform multimedia album projects that she\u2019s given us since 2013,\" asked Brooks. She noted how Beyonc\u00e9 has also tried to tell a story through her music about \u201crace and gender and sexuality in the context of the 400-year-plus history of African-American subjugation.\"",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s a fascinating artist because historical memory, as I often refer to it, and also the kind of impulse to be an archive of that historical memory, it's just all over her work,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cAnd you just don\u2019t see that with any other artist.\u201d",
      "Brooks previously taught a well-received class on Black women in popular music culture at Princeton University and discovered her students were most excited about the portion dedicated to Beyonc\u00e9. She expects her class at Yale will be especially popular, but she's trying to keep the size of the group relatively small.",
      "For those who manage to snag a seat next semester, they shouldn't get their hopes up about seeing Queen Bey in person.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s too bad because if she were on tour, I would definitely try to take the class to see her,\" Brooks said."

      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 \u201cOutlander\u201d is returning with the concluding episodes of its seventh season this month, but its stars have already wrapped official production on the show\u2019s eighth and final season.",
      "Caitr\u00edona Balfe and Sam Heughan, who have played time traveler Claire and 18th century Highlander Jamie since the show began, recently teased their bittersweet goodbye. Speaking less than a fortnight after their official wrap day, with only a few pick-up shots left to shoot, the stars described filming their final scene for the upcoming season.",
      "\u201cIt was very emotional. I was very emotional,\u201d Balfe said.",
      "\u201cI was, too,\u201d Heughan agreed. \u201cWe ended on a scene, well, I think \u2014 it was quite tough to do because it was a real Jamie-Claire moment, so it felt quite fitting. And I think they scheduled it like that. But it was also quite intense because a lot of the crew came to sort of celebrate or watch the final take of the final scene.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd there was a lot of words,\u201d added Balfe. \u201cIt was really hard to get through it because it also felt like everything had sort of this double meaning, you know, it\u2019s a lot of talk about goodbyes and things.\u201d",
      "Based on the books by Diana Gabaldon and mostly filmed in Scotland, the long-running show has leapt across time periods, including the Jacobite Rising, 1740s Versailles, 1960s Boston, the Revolutionary War \u2014 and more.",
      "\u201cI played Jamie when he was 23 and now he\u2019s sort of around 60. So it\u2019s quite a journey,\u201d said Heughan. \u201cThe show is always changing, always moving, it\u2019s a real journey that they\u2019ve been on from Scotland to America. And I think it\u2019s very rewarding. I\u2019m glad we weren\u2019t in a sort of procedural where we had to sort of be in the same location all the time.\u201d",
      "The concluding half of Season 7, premiering Nov. 22 on Starz, begins with the couple returning to Jamie\u2019s homeland of Scotland, before America \u2014 and the rebel cause in the Revolutionary War \u2014 calls again, testing their marriage like never before.",
      "\u201cReturning home obviously is going to be so rewarding for Jamie, but also for the fans,\u201d Heughan said, \u201cbecause I think the fans, they get to see a lot of, their favorite characters and their favorite locations.\u201d",
      "The latest episodes weave in storylines involving Claire and Jamie\u2019s time-traveling daughter Brianna and her husband Roger (Sophie Skelton and Richard Rankin) and Jamie\u2019s nephew Ian (John Bell), as well as Jamie\u2019s secret son William (Charles Vandervaart) and the British lord who is raising him.",
      "Season 7 also features one of Heughan's favorite co-stars \u2014 one he confirms fans won\u2019t be seeing in Season 8.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s actually the last time you see Sleepy,\u201d Heughan says. \u201cHe was my horse throughout first seasons. And he\u2019s a black Friesian with a white spot on him. And actually, if you look closely, he somehow transports himself to America as well because he doubles up as a horse in America. But yeah, I mean, we say goodbye to a lot of locations, a lot of characters in Season 7B.\u201d",
      "With the last season still to come, and the \u201cOutlander\u201d universe expanding with the upcoming prequel \u201cOutlander: Blood of My Blood,\u201d the story will continue for fans \u2014 although Balfe and Heughan will be getting used to their \u201cDroughtlander,\u201d the term fans coined for periods without the show.",
      "\u201cIt has been our lives for the last 11 years. We\u2019ve built families and homes in Scotland,\u201d said Heughan. \u201cSo, yes, it\u2019s quite a change that we\u2019re about to face.\u201d"

      "NEW YORK -- Apologetic rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine was sentenced Tuesday to 45 days in prison by a federal judge who said repeated violations of his probation after his cooperation against a violent gang won him leniency in a criminal case show that he doesn't have sufficient respect for judicial system rules.",
      "Judge Paul A. Engelmayer ordered the additional time be spent behind bars five years after giving the performer whose real name is Daniel Hernandez a two-year prison sentence that likely would have been decades behind bars if he had not testified at trial against the violent gang known as the Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods.",
      "The Manhattan judge said that five violations of probation rules including failing to show up for drug tests, traveling to Las Vegas from his Florida home without permission and lying to his probation officer \u201csay to me loud and clear that you don't believe the rules apply to you.\u201d",
      "He questioned whether Tekashi 6ix9ine, 28, thought he was above the law \u201cmaybe because you\u2019re a famous and wealthy rapper.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut the same rules do apply to you,\u201d Englemayer said.",
      "Before the judge announced the jail time, Tekashi 6ix9ine asked for mercy, saying he was disappointed in himself for having to face him again just a half year before his probation would have expired.",
      "\u201cI'm very sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm not minimizing my actions. I fully take responsibility. I let myself down. I let my family down. Give me an opportunity to clean things up.\u201d",
      "He said he didn't want the judge to \u201cthink of me as ill mannered or I'm a bad person,\" and he insisted that \u201cI don't go out of my way to break the law.\u201d",
      "After his jail stint is finished, Tekashi 6ix9ine will be subject to a month of home incarceration, a month of home detention and a month of curfews as apart of an extension of his probation period by one year. He also will not be allowed to travel internationally and will face electronic monitoring.",
      "In April 2020, Tekashi 6ix9ine was granted compassionate release from prison several months before his sentence was finished because asthma made him susceptible to the coronavirus, which was spreading through the nation\u2019s jails and prisons.",
      "He was arrested on Oct. 29 and has spent the past two weeks in solitary confinement, a particularly harsh detainment that the judge described as a reason why he didn't impose a three-month jail term.",
      "In 2018, Tekashi 6ix9ine was arrested on charges accusing him of joining Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods before trying to get others to commit violence against his perceived enemies.",
      "Engelmayer said the singer's parole violations weren't \u201cgravely serious,\u201d but they were \u201cprofound\u201d breaches of the court's trust.",
      "He also said Tekashi 6ix9ine has \u201crepeatedly flown very close to the flame\u201d as he cited two instances in which he was arrested in the Dominican Republic and a speeding violation for allegedly going 136 mph in a 65 mph zone.",
      "\u201cYour repeated brushes with the law underscore the need to get this message across to you,\u201d the judge said."

      "All have been pulled from the shelves of some Florida schools, according to the latest list compiled by the Florida Department of Education tallying books removed by local school districts.",
      "Recent changes to state law have empowered parents and residents to challenge school library books and required districts to submit an annual report to the state detailing which books have been restricted in their schools. Florida continues to lead the country in pulling books from school libraries, according to analyses by the American Library Association and the advocacy group PEN America.",
      "\u201cA restriction of access is a restriction on one\u2019s freedom to read,\u201d said Kasey Meehan of PEN America. \u201cStudents lose the ability to access books that mirror their own lived experiences, to access books that help them learn and empathize with people who \u2026 have different life experiences.\u201d",
      "The list released for the 2023-2024 school year includes titles by American literary icons like Maya Angelou, Flannery O\u2019Connor and Richard Wright, as well as books that have become top targets for censorship across the country because they feature LGBTQ+ characters, discussions of gender and sexuality, and descriptions of sexual encounters, such as \u201cAll Boys Aren\u2019t Blue\u201d by George Johnson and \u201cGender Queer\u201d by Maia Kobabe. Conservative advocates have labeled such content \u201cpornographic.\u201d",

      "In a statement to The Associated Press, a spokesperson for the Florida Department of Education maintained there are no books being banned in Florida and defended the state\u2019s push to remove \u201csexually explicit materials\u201d from schools.",
      "\u201cOnce again, far left activists are pushing the book ban hoax on Floridians. The better question is why do these activists continue to fight to expose children to sexually explicit materials,\u201d spokesperson Sydney Booker said.",
      "The list shows that book removals vary widely across the state, with some districts not reporting any restrictions and others tallying hundreds of titles pulled from the shelves. Farrell of the Florida Freedom to Read Project said that based on the group\u2019s analysis of public records, the department\u2019s report is an undercount because it doesn\u2019t include books removed following an internal staff review, just those pulled following a complaint from a parent or resident.",
      "Farrell believes most Florida parents want their kids to have broad access to literature.",
      "\u201cWe live in a state where parental rights are supposed to be acknowledged, heard and responded to,\u201d Farrell said. \u201cWe are asking for accountability and an accurate record of how these laws are impacting our children and impacting what\u2019s available to them.\u201d",
      "Schools have restricted access to dozens of books by Stephen King, a master of the horror genre known for bestsellers like \u201cIt\u201d and \u201cPet Sematary.\u201d Officials in Clay County also decided that his book \u201cOn Writing: A Memoir of the Craft\u201d was inappropriate for students.",

      "In September, the Nassau County school district settled a lawsuit brought by the authors of \u201cAnd Tango Makes Three,\u201d a picture book based on the true story of two male penguins who raised a chick together at New York\u2019s Central Park Zoo.

      "Veteran broadcaster Chris Wallace is leaving CNN after three years but, at age 77, he's not interested in retiring",
      "Chris Wallace says he's leaving CNN after three years and, at age 77, is eager to see what a transformed media environment has to offer.",
      "\u201cWhen I look at the media landscape right now, the people who are going independent, whether it's podcasting or streaming, that seems to be where the action is,\u201d he said Tuesday.",
      "It's hard to find a clearer sign of how the business is changing. Wallace is the quintessential broadcast newscaster, son of the CBS News legend Mike Wallace, worked at both ABC and NBC News and was host of \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d for 18 years before exiting for CNN in 2021.",
      "He was hired to be a leading personality for the CNN+ streaming service, which the company abandoned a month after its launch in 2022. That forced him to cobble together a role at CNN, with a Saturday morning political show and a broader interview program on Max, and appearances on the network as a commentator.",
      "Wallace called the exit amicable. CNN CEO Mark Thompson called him \u201cone of the most respected political journalists in the news business\u201d and said that he wishes him the best.",
      "Thompson likely faces some hard decisions in the future, with CNN's television ratings cratering and an increased emphasis on digital looming.",
      "Wallace said having control over what he does is more appealing to him at this stage of his career. Don't expect big changes in his brand \u2014 he'll likely stick with interviews and political analysis, and not favor one political side over another \u2014 and he said he's already heard some expressions of interest.",
      "Retirement's not in the blood. His father worked well into his late 80s at \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d Besides, Chris Wallace said, \u201cnobody in my family wants me to retire.\u201d",

      "Thirty-eight people have been placed under investigation, including six in Spain, France and Belgium. Italian authorities say the network could have done 200 million euros ($212 million) in economic damage by flooding the art market with fake works.",
      "Italy\u2019s culture ministry said Monday the seizures in Italy, France, Spain and Belgium netted 2,100 fake works attributed to more than 30 famed artists, including Andy Warhol, Amedeo Modigliani, Banksy, Pablo Picasso, Joan Mir\u00f2, Francis Bacon, Wassily Kandinsky, Henry Moore and Gustav Klimt.",
      "The operation uncovered a network of forgers in Spain, France and Belgium who produced the works, said Eurojust, the European Union agency for judicial cooperation. Fake Warhols and Banksys were the most commonly forged and the fakes were exhibited at shows in Mestre and Cortona, Italy, with a catalogue published, the authorities said.",
      "Eurojust said the network was able to use complicit auction houses in Italy that issued forged certificates and stamps of authenticity, some 500 of which were also seized.",
      "The investigation began in March 2023 when Italian authorities discovered 200 fakes during the search of the home of a Pisa businessman that prompted them to monitor e-commerce sites of auction houses to see if others were involved in the network.",

      "The last three years have been tough for Fanta Charlotte Dabone, a mother of three from the conflict-battered West African country of Burkina Faso",
      "OUGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso -- The last three years have been tough for Fanta Charlotte Dabone, a mother of three from the conflict-battered West African country of Burkina Faso.",
      "She fled her village after it was attacked by extremists, leaving her husband and her farm behind. Since then, she has been moving from place to place, struggling to pay rent and to buy enough food for her children, including a 2-year-old toddler.",
      "But last month, she got to be a queen.",
      "Every day for a week, together with dozens of other Burkinabe men and women who have been displaced by extremist violence, she swirled, danced and chanted for almost two hours in front of captivated audiences at Recreatrales, an international theater festival held in Ouagadougou, the country's capital.",
      "\u201cI was so happy about it,\" she said. \"I don't even know how to explain how it felt.\u201d",
      "Burkina Faso, a landlocked nation of 23 million in Sahel, an arid strip of land south of the Sahara, used to be known for its bustling arts scene, including renowned film and theater festivals, and its sophisticated craftsmanship.",
      "But in recent years, the country has become the symbol of the security crisis in the region. It has been shaken by violence from extremist groups and the government forces fighting them, much of it spilling over the border with Mali, and by two ensuing military coups.",
      "The military junta, which took power by force in 2022, failed to provide the stability it promised. Instead, the situation deteriorated: According to conservative estimates, more than 60% of the country is now outside of government control, more than 2 million people have lost their homes and almost 6.5 million need humanitarian aid to survive.",
      "The country's leader, Capt. Ibrahim Traore, installed a system of de-facto censorship, where those critical of the regime disappear or get forcefully drafted into the army, and where even friends are afraid to discuss politics with each other.",
      "But against all odds, last month the Bougsemtenga district in the capital turned into a festival grounds to host Recreatrales for the 13th time.",
      "Bougsemtenga derives its name from \u201cbougtenga,\u201d which means \u201chappiness district\u201d in Moore, one of the local languages. True to its origins, this year its streets were transformed into a dreamy universe, resembling a crossover between a traditional village festival and \u201cAlice in Wonderland.\" More than 150 African and European artists performed and over 4,500 theater lovers were able to escape the country's grim reality, if just for a little while.",
      "Improvised theater stages were constructed inside people\u2019s courtyards. The streets were decorated with colorful lights and abstract sculptures made by locals from plastic bottles and scraps of wax-printed fabrics. Residents put up hand decorated stands, selling beer and meat sticks to multinational crowds of theatergoers, ranging from Western diplomats to local mechanics. The ticket booth was a giant frog, its mouth wide open.",
      "Aristide Tarnagda, the festival\u2019s artistic director, said he was convinced that regardless of the insecurity engulfing the country, the festival had to take place as planned.",
      "Theater is an affirmation of \u201cthe primacy of life over death,\u201d Tarnagda said. He added that getting together to perform and watch theatrical productions is a form of resistance against adversity and violence. This is why this year's theme was \"Turning the face to the sun.\u201d",
      "\u201cHumans are capable of love and freedom, but sometimes they forget it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe role of the theater is to remind them about it.\u201d",
      "Held every two years, the festival is the culmination of the yearlong work that the organizers do with residents of the Bougsemtenga district, which was home to two theaters and a theater association even before the first Recreatrales in 2002.",
      "They run art workshops, including in writing, theater, dance and scenography, for young people from the district and from all of Africa, and organize mentoring sessions and business skills classes for local women. The goal is to get as many people as possible involved, said Odile Sankara, the festival's director.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a working class district,\" Sankara said. \u201dWe want to encourage people to take an interest in art, to get a taste of it.\"",
      "She added: \u201cArt is a powerful weapon to fight for more light, more humanity and more love,\u201d especially while her country and the whole Sahel region were going through a security and humanitarian crisis.",
      "Claude Ilboudo, a 30-year-old from Bougsemtenga, has performed in the opening ceremonies of Recreatrales as a dancer since its first edition. He used to work as a glazier, and dancing was just his past time. But Ilboudo's life took a turn when five years ago he severely injured his right hand at work and could no longer do his job.",
      "It was then that Ilboudo discovered a passion for theater and started working for the Recreatrales association. \u201cTheater saved me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt made me discover what I could do.\u201d",
      "This year, Ilboudo was part of the team that prepared the opening play with the internally displaced actors from scratch, including the concept, scenario and choreography. It was also the first time he personally interacted with people who had to flee their homes because of extremist violence.",
      "For internally displaced people, theater is not just a tool for therapy, helping them to process trauma, said Sankara, the artistic director. It's a way for a group that has been marginalized and isolated in Burkinabe society to be seen by others.",
      "During the play, Dabone, the displaced mother of three, stood at center stage with her toddler tied to her back and spit out a long, white paper strip. It symbolized all the haunting thoughts leaving her body, she said. But the question remains \u2014 for how long.",
      "\u201cLife is very difficult,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when I am on the stage, I feel joy. It\u2019s when I have to go back home that all these thoughts are coming back to my head.\"",

      "\u201cBelieve: The Untold Story Behind \u2018Ted Lasso,\u2019 the Show that Kicked Its Way Into Our Hearts\u201d tells the story of the unlikely success of the hit Apple TV+ series",
      "It's hard to believe that a TV show based on a series of commercials with the same punchline \u2014 an American football coach confused by the rules of soccer \u2014 could have lasted beyond an episode or two. It's even harder to believe that it became an Emmy-winning hit with a cast invited to the White House to talk about mental health.",
      "There's a lot to learn from the unlikely success of \u201cTed Lasso,\u201d the hit Apple TV+ show featuring Jason Sudekis as its mustachioed, wholesome namesake. Jeremy Egner's \u201cBelieve: The Untold Story Behind Ted Lasso, the Show that Kicked Its Way Into Our Hearts\u201d is the best place to learn it.",
      "As television editor for The New York Times, Egner had a front-row seat to the show and the cultural phenomenon it became. That background offers readers an enlightening and entertaining guide, though it's definitely geared toward fans of the show.",
      "Written half as an oral history and half as a guide to key episodes, \u201cBelieve\u201d offers plenty of interesting tidbits about the making of the show and provides inspiration for fans to give \u201cTed Lasso\u201d another viewing.",
      "Egner leaves no detail uncovered, including the taste of Ted's famous biscuits (dry, at least in the first season) and arguments over what the \u201cBelieve\u201d sign hanging in the locker room should look like.",
      "The book avoids becoming too laudatory of the show and notes the criticism it faced, especially during the third \u2014 and final? \u2014 season.",
      "Egner adeptly explains how all the right factors, including an audience overwhelmed by negative news and divisive times, worked together to ensure the show's success. It's an audience that was hungry for a show that, as he puts it, is about personal transformation.",
      "The book may not necessarily transform anyone into a new fan of \u201cTed Lasso,\u201d but it may at least give those who like the show a reason to give it another watch.",

      "Ethan Slater, best known for his Tony-nominated starring role in Broadway's \u201cSpongeBob SquarePants\u201d brings his talent to the big screen in the musical adaptation of \u201cWicked,\" out Nov. 22",
      "You could say that Ethan Slater's yellow brick road to getting cast in the big screen adaptation of \u201cWicked\u201d had an element of magic to it.",
      "On the day he was asked to submit a tape of himself for the role of Boq, Slater was playing the part of actor Christopher Fitzgerald's identical twin in a table read for a potential musical. Fitzgerald originated the role of Boq in \u201cWicked\u201d on Broadway. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell him about it \u2018cause I didn\u2019t want to explain when I didn\u2019t get it,'\u201d admitted Slater. Instead, he marked the occasion by asking Fitzgerald to take a selfie with him for seemingly no reason, which he still has.",
      "After getting the job, Slater was determined to master the delicate dance of keeping the essence of Fitzgerald in a role that was now his.",
      "\u201cI look up to him so much,\u201d Slater said of Fitzgerald. \u201cI wanted to honor the Boq he created who\u2019s just, like, a burst of energy. But I also wanted to make him my own because I could never be Chris Fitzgerald. He's too singular and too amazing. It would be a fool\u2019s errand to try to be him.\u201d",
      "In turn, Fitzgerald, who has seen the film, gave Slater's performance a glowing review. Slater says he plans to print and frame a text message that Fitzgerald sent him afterward.",
      "\u201cEthan has this perfect balance of soulfulness and funny bones as an actor,\u201d Fitzgerald said in an email to the AP. \u201cHis Boq is earnest, daffy, and generous of heart. It was such a pleasure and a gift to watch a pal use the spirit of something that\u2019s come before and spin it into something new and wholly original. He is Boq.\u201d",
      "\u201cWicked\u201d is a prequel to the events of \u201cWizard of Oz.\u201d It stars Ariana Grande as Glinda and Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba. Jonathan Bailey plays a prince, Fiyero, who encounters Glinda and Elphaba at school.",
      "The story was conceived by Gregory Macguire for a novel called \u201cWicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West.\u201d",
      "Slater says filming the big-budget movie directed by Jon M. Chu (\"Crazy Rich Asians\" and \u201cIn the Heights\u201d) actually felt much smaller. At its heart, the cast is just a bunch of theater kids who love to perform.",
      "\u201cI keep quoting Johnny Bailey who said while we were shooting, \u2018it just feels like a student film until suddenly it doesn\u2019t,'\" said Slater.",
      "Erivo, Grande, Bailey and Slater all come from a musical theater background. In 2018, he was nominated for a Tony Award for his leading performance in \u201cSpongeBob SquarePants\" on Broadway. He was also in the revival of \u201cSpamalot\" in 2023.",
      "\u201cWe all cared so much. We cared in the way that theater kids care and want to protect this show and want the opportunity to do it. It was really, really joyful and familial,\" said Slater.",
      "Because the experience was so magical, Slater said the actors find themselves reminiscing even when they're not promoting it.",
      "\u201cGoing to dinner last night, we were all still talking about \u2018Wicked,\u2019 and it\u2019s like another theater kid thing, you know, hyper-fixating on this thing that we love so much,\" he said.",
      "The actors sang live on set which Slater said makes for a better performance.",
      "\u201cYou are using your voice in the same way from scene into song, into scene. And there\u2019s no break at all. You\u2019re not thinking about syncing. You\u2019re not thinking about dubbing later. You\u2019re just performing it,\" he said.",
      "\u201cWicked,\u201d premiering Nov. 22, will be released in two parts. The second film is scheduled for a November 2025 debut.",
      "Slater recognizes that breaking up the film is a \u201ccontroversial decision.\u201d",
      "\"I empathize with that, but when you see this movie, I think it\u2019s a really full movie with a beginning, middle and end. You get to know these characters and love these characters. I think the first thing you\u2019re going to want to do is watch the movie a second time. I\u2019m on pins and needles waiting for the second one.\"",
      "On screen, Boq has an unrequited crush on Glinda. Off screen, Slater and Grande are a couple in real life.",
      "\u201cHer fans are going to be blown away,\" he said. \"Anybody who\u2019s a fan of Ariana knows how talented she is. They know that she has, you know, one of the best voices, of our generation \u2014 or ever \u2014 and can do anything with it. I think that her acting is like above and beyond. It\u2019s incredible. Her comedy is ridiculous.\"",
      "Slater also stars in the film \u201cLost on a Mountain in Maine,\" now in theaters. And he's developing \u201ca really beautiful play about humanity\u201d where he would star as French mime Marcel Marceau.",
      "\u201cThe thing in theater is you can\u2019t really celebrate it until opening night and then you really shouldn\u2019t until it closes either. But we\u2019re really excited about its future, and hopefully there will be more news about it soon.\u201d"

      "LONDON -- British writer Samantha Harvey won the Booker Prize for fiction on Tuesday with \u201cOrbital,\u201d a short, wonder-filled novel set aboard the International Space Station that ponders the beauty and fragility of Earth.",
      "Harvey was awarded the 50,000-pound ($64,000) prize for what she has called a \u201cspace pastoral\u201d about six orbiting astronauts, which she began writing during COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns. The confined characters loop through 16 sunrises and 16 sunsets over the course of a day, trapped in one another\u2019s company and transfixed by the globe\u2019s ever-changing vistas.",
      "\u201cTo look at the Earth from space is like a child looking into a mirror and realizing for the first time that the person in the mirror is herself,\" said Harvey, who researched her novel by reading books by astronauts and watching the space station's live camera. \"What we do to the Earth we do to ourselves.\u201d",
      "She said the novel \u201cis not exactly about climate change, but implied in the view of the Earth is the fact of human-made climate change.\"",
      "She dedicated the prize to everyone who speaks \"for and not against the Earth, for and not against the dignity of other humans, other life.\"",
      "\u201cAll the people who speak for and call for and work for peace \u2014 this is for you,\u201d she said.",
      "Writer and artist Edmund de Waal, who chaired the five-member judging panel, called \u201cOrbital\u201d a \u201cmiraculous novel\u201d that \u201cmakes our world strange and new for us.\u201d",
      "Gaby Wood, chief executive of the Booker Prize Foundation, noted that \u201cin a year of geopolitical crisis, likely to be the warmest year in recorded history,\u201d the winning book was \u201chopeful, timely and timeless.\u201d",
      "Harvey, who has written four previous novels and a memoir about insomnia, is the first British writer since 2020 to win the Booker. The prize is open to English-language writers of any nationality and has a reputation for transforming writers\u2019 careers. Previous winners include Ian McEwan, Margaret Atwood, Salman Rushdie and Hilary Mantel.",
      "De Waal praised the \u201ccrystalline\u201d writing and \u201ccapaciousness\u201d of Harvey\u2019s succinct novel \u2014 at 136 pages in its U.K. paperback edition, one of the shortest-ever Booker winners.",
      "\u201cThis is a book that repays slow reading,\u201d he said.",
      "He said the judges spent a full day picking their winner and came to a unanimous conclusion. Harvey beat five other finalists from Canada, the United States, Australia and the Netherlands, chosen from among 156 novels submitted by publishers.",
      "American writer Percival Everett had been the bookies\u2019 favorite to win with \u201cJames,\u201d which reimagines Mark Twain\u2019s \u201cHuckleberry Finn\u201d from the point of view of its main Black character, the enslaved man Jim.",
      "The other finalists were American writer Rachel Kushner\u2019s spy story \u201cCreation Lake\u201d; Canadian Anne Michaels\u2019 poetic novel \u201cHeld\u201d; Charlotte Wood\u2019s Australian saga \u201cStone Yard Devotional\u201d; and \u201cThe Safekeep\u201d by Yael van der Wouden, the first Dutch author to be shortlisted for the Booker.",
      "Harvey is the first female Booker winner since 2019, though one of five women on this year\u2019s shortlist, the largest number in the prize\u2019s 55-year history. De Waal said issues such as the gender or nationality of the authors were \u201cbackground noise\u201d that did not influence the judges.",
      "\u201cThere was absolutely no question of box ticking or of agendas or of anything else. It was simply about the novel,\u201d he said before the awards ceremony at Old Billingsgate, a grand former Victorian fish market in central London.",
      "Founded in 1969, the Booker Prize is open to novels originally written in English published in the U.K. or Ireland. Last year\u2019s winner was Irish writer Paul Lynch for post-democratic dystopia \u201cProphet Song.\u201d",
      "Lynch handed Harvey her Booker trophy at the ceremony, warning her that her life was about to change dramatically because of the Booker publicity boost.",
      "Harvey said she was \u201coverwhelmed,\" but remained down-to-earth about spending her prize money.",
      "She said she'd disburse \u201csome of it on tax. I want to buy a new bike. And then the rest \u2014 I want to go to Japan.\u201d"

      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 Lashana Lynch was running away from spies.",
      "After playing Nomi in 2021\u2019s \u201cNo Time To Die,\u201d she was actively avoiding any role that involved working for the secret service. What part could beat a Bond girl who took James Bond\u2019s 007 code name from him?",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018No, I\u2019m not doing it again. That\u2019s a legacy role. That\u2019s something that absolutely should be untouched forever,\u2019\u201d recalls Lynch.",
      "But then she read the character of Bianca Pullman for a TV series based on Frederick Forsyth\u2019s classic thriller \u201cThe Day of the Jackal.\u201d Bianca was also an employee of Britain's foreign intelligence agency, but the differences between the two MI6 workers appealed: While Nomi was slick, Bianca was a mess Lynch could dive into.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d pushed against this world for a long time and it felt like it came right at me full throttle,\u201d she says.",
      "No one is happier that she jumped on board than Eddie Redmayne, who plays the Jackal, the myth-like murderer for hire. Her \u201cversatility is insane,\u201d he says, adding that Lynch even suggested the perfect song for the theme, Celeste's \u201cThis Is Who I Am.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Day of the Jackal\u201d updates Fred Zinnemann\u2019s 1973 movie, starring Edward Fox as the cravat-wearing killer hired to kill the French president.",
      "Redmayne\u2019s version inherits the gentlemanly style of Fox, living a life of jet-setting quiet luxury, funded by getting away with murder through ingenious devices, clever disguises and flawless planning. Bianca is the intelligence officer and arms expert who will stop at nothing to find him, much to the discomfort of her co-workers and family.",
      "Lynch and Redmayne are also producers on the show, which is airing on Sky in the U.K. and debuts Thursday on Peacock. They didn\u2019t spend much time together on set, but saw each other in makeup, at the gym and are reunited for this interview with The Associated Press.",
      "This conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "REDMAYNE: It was so strange to do a job in which you\u2019re so intimately connected to another character, and yet you don\u2019t get to spend any time with the actor. But those moments we did have on set were pretty precious.",
      "LYNCH: We won\u2019t tell you what they were.",
      "REDMAYNE: What\u2019s weird about prosthetics is it\u2019s such a long process \u2014 it\u2019s not like you sort of blink an eyelid and you\u2019ve changed. So you see it layered on and there are interesting moments along that process. But it was always at the end of the day when I would take my clothes off and I would sort of have this old German caretaker face and then my sort of scrawny sort of 40-year-old body underneath. That was very disjointed and odd.",
      "LYNCH: That\u2019s one thing that this show does really well and what Ronan (Bennett), our writer, did really well in that, that running in parallel happened so seamlessly that you don\u2019t really see it coming. And every single episode you feel like you want to root for someone like Bianca but the Jackal just makes sense. Even though he\u2019s just done something completely heinous. You almost want to be him, which is, I think, the point.",
      "LYNCH: No, although we crossed over with the spy training. Spy training, which was us just walking around Covent Garden, looking through shop windows, using our phones and car mirrors to find people, to track people and record them without them seeing. This is not just regular people on the street. This is someone that we\u2019ve specifically said!",
      "REDMAYNE: Did they? Oh no! They\u2019ve stolen our thunder.",
      "REDMAYNE: We didn\u2019t do it on the same day. I would have to ask Paul, our spy expert, about that, but I imagine Lashana was better.",
      "LYNCH: No, no.",
      "REDMAYNE: You\u2019re sort of more deft around a corner, certainly with the guns you are. Because I spent most of my gun training working on sniper rifles. So when it came to bits when I had to do that thing and move like that (mimes holding a gun) around the corner, I was a bit crap."

      "President-elect Donald Trump has stunned the Pentagon and the broader defense world by nominating Fox News host Pete Hegseth to serve as his defense secretary, tapping someone largely inexperienced and untested on the global stage to take over the worl...",
      "WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump stunned the Pentagon and the broader defense world by nominating Fox News host Pete Hegseth to serve as his defense secretary, tapping someone largely inexperienced and untested on the global stage to take over the world's largest and most powerful military.",
      "The news was met with bewilderment and wide-eyed worry among many in Washington, as Trump passed on a number of established national security heavy-hitters and chose an Army National Guard captain who is well-known in conservative circles as a co-host of Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cFox & Friends Weekend.\u201d",
      "While some Republican lawmakers had a muted response to the announcement, others called his combat experience an asset or said he was \u201ctremendously capable.\u201d",
      "Hegseth's choice could bring sweeping changes to the military, as he has made it clear on his show and in interviews that, like Trump, he is stridently opposed to \u201cwoke\u201d programs that promote equity and inclusion. He's also questioned the role of women in combat and advocated pardoning service members charged with war crimes.",
      "In June, at a rally in Las Vegas, Trump encouraged his supporters to buy Hegseth\u2019s book after vowing that if he won: \u201cThe woke stuff will be gone within a period of 24 hours. I can tell you.\u201d",
      "A staunch conservative who embraces Trump's \u201cAmerica First\u201d policies, the 44-year-old Hegseth has pushed for making the military more lethal. During an interview on \u201cThe Shawn Ryan Show\u201d podcast, he said allowing women to serve in combat hurts that effort.",
      "\u201cEverything about men and women serving together makes the situation more complicated, and complication in combat, that means casualties are worse,\u201d Hegseth said.",
      "And while he said diversity in the military is a strength, he said it was because minority and white men \u201ccan perform similarly\u201d but the same isn't true for women.",
      "While Trump lauded Hegseth as \u201ctough, smart and a true believer in America First,\u201d others were quick to point to the TV personality's lack of experience, with some suggesting he could be Pentagon chief in name only as the Trump White House runs the department.",
      "A number of other names floated as possible defense choices had included Rep. Mike Rogers of Alabama, the GOP chairman of the House Armed Services Committee; retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg; Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa; and Robert Wilkie, a former Pentagon official who was head of Veterans Affairs in Trump's first term.",
      "\u201cThere is reason for concern that this is not a person who is a serious enough policymaker, serious enough policy implementer, to do a successful job,\u201d said Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee.",
      "Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Hegseth's lack of senior national security experience makes it more difficult to get Senate confirmation.",
      "\u201cI think Trump was tired of fighting with his secretaries of defense and picked one who would be loyal to him,\u201d Cancian said.",
      "Military officials said the choice came out of the blue. A senior military officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media, said Hegseth's selection is raising concerns about whether he has the practical experience to manage a large department with an enormous budget.",
      "The Defense Department has a budget exceeding $800 billion, with about 1.3 million active-duty troops and another 1.4 million in the National Guard, Reserves and civilian employees based worldwide.",
      "If confirmed, Hegseth would face a daunting array of global crises, from the wars in the Middle East and Ukraine and the expanding alliance between Russia and North Korea to the growing competition with China. There is also the need to upgrade the complex U.S. missile and nuclear defense apparatus and ensure the defense industry can keep up with America's need for weapons systems.",
      "Smith said that while Hegseth's combat experience is a plus, running the Pentagon requires a lot of other skill sets, and his nomination will need some time for consideration.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s your plan? What are you going to do? ... How can you assure us that that lack of experience, you know, isn\u2019t going to make it impossible for you to do the job?\u201d Smith said. \u201cI think those are questions that need to be answered over the next couple of months.\u201d",
      "Even some Republicans in the Senate \u2014 who would vote on his nomination \u2014 had a subdued response.",
      "North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis called the choice \u201cinteresting,\u201d and Indiana Sen. Todd Young, who served in the Marine Corps, said, \u201cI don\u2019t know much about his background or his vision, so I look forward to learning more.\u201d",
      "North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven said he\u2019s not surprised that Trump chose Hegseth because Trump is \u201cclose to him and likes him and trusts him.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe guy\u2019s obviously tremendously capable, a great communicator,\" Hoeven said. \"I look forward to getting to know him better.\u201d",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson said Hegseth brings a lot to the table and will be \"reform-minded in the areas that need reform.\u201d",
      "Hegseth has been a contributor since 2014 for Fox News, developing a friendship with Trump, who made regular appearances on his show. He is the author of \u201cThe War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free.\u201d",
      "\u201cWith Pete at the helm, America\u2019s enemies are on notice \u2014 Our Military will be Great Again, and America will Never Back Down,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cNobody fights harder for the Troops, and Pete will be a courageous and patriotic champion of our \u2018Peace through Strength\u2019 policy.\u201d",

      "CHANGCHUN, China -- Crouch through the small metal door and walk down the dark tunnel, and even before you step into the abandoned air raid shelter, the air reverberates with pounding techno beats. Young Chinese holding booze and cigarettes shake and sway in a red-lit passageway, below a big screen rolling through quotations from Chairman Mao.",
      "This is an underground rave in China, part of a subculture growing in hidden corners of the nation\u2019s cities, even as its political and cultural mainstream grow increasingly controlled, staid and predictable.",
      "For Chinese ravers, these gatherings \u2014 often called \u201cye di,\u201d or \u201cwild dances\u201d \u2014 not only offer a rare space for unfettered fun, but signal resistance to the narrowly prescribed future a rigid society expects for them.",
      "By day, Xing Long works in the office of a state-owned company in Changchun, an industrial city in China's northeastern rust belt region.",
      "By night, he\u2019s a DJ and underground rave organizer, a side gig that offers an escape from the humdrum of reviewing corporate contracts.",
      "\u201cMy job cannot make me feel I fulfilled my values,\u201d he said. \u201cGoing to work is like executing a prewritten program.\u201d",
      "Chinese young people face intense pressure and high expectations from the society around them. In recent years, facing bleak economic prospects, Chinese youth culture has been swept by a series of viral slang terms to describe frustration and hopelessness: \u201c 996 \u201d \u2014 the brutal 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week work schedule many companies ask of employees. \u201cInvolution\u201d \u2014 an endless treadmill of pointless competition that fresh graduates face. \u201c Lying flat \u201d \u2014 the growing trend among young people of giving up all ambition and aiming to do as little as possible.",
      "Techno dance parties are an escape from all that for people like Xing. Every time he walks into a rave, the 31-year-old said, his brain \u201cjolts awake like a bang.\u201d",
      "Xing first learned about techno music from a documentary made by the American media company Vice.",
      "\u201cMy eyes brightened up when I heard it,\" he said. \"I should\u2019ve listened to this kind of music earlier.\u201d",
      "Xing began going to raves in Shenzhen, a southern city with a population of 17 million, but when he moved home in 2021 he realized no one else was organizing them.",
      "\u201cI want this city to have an underground techno music scene,\" he said. \"I want to listen to it myself, so I want to make it happen.\u201d",
      "Xing said that the underground techno scene fascinated him because it's \u201creal\u201d even if not perfect, bad, not in the right order, or broken.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a beautiful thing that was deliberately produced into a mold to present to the mainstream.\u201d",
      "In recent years, space for culture and creativity has been shrinking in China as the authorities have ramped up censorship of concerts, shows, and other cultural events. Comedians have been silenced after joking about topics considered politically sensitive. A growing number of independent bookstores and creative spaces have shut down under pressure, while state-sanctioned media promotes uplifting, often saccharine narratives.",
      "Yet underground raves are free from all those limitations because they sprout in gray zones. Hidden from public view, they skirt formal approval processes, neither supported nor suppressed by the state.",
      "Feng Zhe, 27, a rave organizer in Shenyang, a northeastern city about 400 miles from Beijing, said raves are about \u201crefusing to be disciplined by society.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is probably not how the world functions nowadays,\u201d he said, adding that societies want to make people follow their rules and be useful but \"underground culture is useless.\u201d",
      "\u201cMost people are going to be repressed,\" Feng said.",
      "But for most rave organizers, the real meaning of underground rave culture is simply having fun. Loong Wu, a 26-year-old art student, started organizing raves in 2021 during COVID-19 lockdowns out of boredom.",
      "\u201cMy original intention was just to break through the boredom,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you are truly enjoying it, you don\u2019t think about meanings.\u201d",
      "On one recent Saturday night, civil servants, students, an ex-firefighter, girls with dyed hair, and a man with a full face mask and goggles filed into a bar tucked behind a flower shop in downtown Changchun to attend one of Xing\u2019s raves.",
      "They danced to fast-paced industrial techno spun by Du Jizhe, a local part-time DJ who works in HR by day.",
      "He said it\u2019s the natural soundtrack of auto manufacturing cities like Changchun and Detroit, which prides itself on being the birthplace of techno. For Du, techno evokes childhood memories of the auto factory where his father worked.",
      "\u201cTechno is basically industrial noise like hammering and mechanical sounds,\u201d Du said \u201cThese noises exert a subtle influence on people\u2019s ears in industrial cities.\u201d",
      "Chen Xiangyu, a fashion student in an oversized black t-shirt with hair dyed blond, a black leather choker, a lip piercing, and smoky eye makeup, said raves are a pure release.",
      "\u201cThe first time I came, I thought to myself, I don\u2019t know anyone, no one knows me, so nobody\u2019s paying any attention to how I dance, so long as I\u2019m happy, it\u2019s all good,\" she said. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t care too much about what others think.\u201d",
      "Even at raves, illegal drugs are rarely seen in China, but promoters still face risks from authorities who have little patience for unapproved social gatherings.",
      "Advertisements promoting raves are often cryptic, with only a date, a DJ line-up, and the cost of admission. Sometimes, the location won\u2019t be revealed until an hour ahead of the party. Some organizers require guests to cover their phone\u2019s camera with a sticker.",
      "Loong Wu said her requirements for a rave spot were no CCTV cameras, no security, and no nearby residents. Even those aren't a guarantee \u2014 local police once busted one of her raves in an industrial port.",
      "\u201cIt was pathetic how few such places exist in the city,\u201d she said.",
      "Frustrated with how hard to find a good rave spot, she once organized a public party where she put her DJ equipment on a cart and pushed it through city streets as revelers danced alongside.",
      "\u201cRestrictions exist for sure, but that\u2019s exactly why we need to create our own scene,\u201d she said. \u201cWe always need \u2018wild dances.\u2019 We always need to dance outside of set rules.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 23andMe is laying off 40% of its workforce, or more than 200 employees, and discontinuing its therapeutics division as the struggling genetic testing company attempts to slash costs.",
      "The latest restructuring efforts were announced by 23andMe on Monday. The company said it plans to wind down ongoing clinical trials \u201cas quickly as practical\u201d \u2014 and that it was currently evaluating \u201cstrategic alternatives\u201d for assets related to its drug development and research programs, which include studies on potential cancer treatments.",
      "In a prepared statement, 23andMe CEO and co-founder Anne Wojcicki said the company was \"taking these difficult but necessary actions\u201d as it focuses on \u201cthe long-term success of our core consumer business and research partnerships.\u201d",
      "The restructuring arrives during a period of turmoil at California-based 23andMe, which has recently included a high-profile data breach, several rounds of previous layoffs and piling losses that plunged the company's stock over recent years.",
      "Back in September, all of 23andMe\u2019s independent directors also resigned from its board \u2014 in a rare move that followed drawn-out negotiations with Wojcicki, who has been trying to take the company private. The seven resigning directors said they had yet to receive an adequate transaction proposal from the chief executive and cited a \u201cclear\u201d difference of opinion on 23andMe\u2019s future.",
      "At the time, Wojcicki said she was \u201csurprised and disappointed\u201d by the resignations but maintained that taking 23andMe private and \u201coutside of the short-term pressures of the public markets\u201d would be best for the company long term.",
      "After more than a month with Wojcicki left as the sole member of the board, 23andMe announced that it had appointed three new independent directors in late October.",
      "23andMe went public in 2021 and has struggled to find a profitable business model since \u2014 particularly with most buyers of its saliva-based testing kits only needing to purchase once. The company reported a net loss of $667 million for its last fiscal year, more than double the loss of $312 million for the year prior.",
      "23andMe posted another loss in quarterly earnings released Tuesday, although with less of a dent than in previous quarters. The company reported a net loss of $59.1 million for the 2025 fiscal year's second quarter, compared to a loss of $75.3 million for the same year prior.",
      "Revenue, however, totaled at $44.1 million for the second quarter \u2014 down from $50 million from the year prior. The company cited lower testing kit sales and telehealth orders, as well as a decrease in research revenue, but said that was partially offset by a growth in membership services.",
      "23andMe anticipates the job cuts and other restructuring efforts announced Monday to reduce its operating expenses and save the company more than $35 million annually. 23andMe also expects to incur up to $12 million in costs, primarily related to one-time severance and other termination-related expenses.",
      "23andMe ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $127 million, compared with $216 million as of March 31, 2024.",
      "Last month, 23andMe completed a 1-for-20 reverse stock split. Shares were down nearly 4% by midday Tuesday, sitting at around $4.43."

      "Seven-year-old Halima Abou Yassine was brought to Lebanon from Gaza for treatment after an Israeli strike left her near death with a gaping wound in her skull",
      "BEIRUT -- When Zarifa Nawfal\u2019s family arrived in Beirut for her wounded daughter\u2019s surgery, one of the first things she wanted to do was go to the sea. The Mediterranean had been a constant companion at their home in Gaza before the war.",
      "\u201cThe moment I smelled the sea, I felt at peace inside \u2014 as if I were in Gaza,\u201d she said.",
      "But soon their place of refuge reminded her of home in far more distressing ways.",
      "Nawfal\u2019s 7-year-old daughter, Halima Abou Yassine, is one of a dozen severely wounded Palestinian children brought to Lebanon this year for treatment through a program launched by a British-Palestinian surgeon, Dr. Ghassan Abu Sitta.",
      "But months after their arrival, Lebanon is itself embroiled in a war some fear will end in Gaza-like destruction.",
      "In February, Nawfal was staying with her five children and her mother in an apartment in central Gaza. They had been displaced from their home in the north and Nawfal\u2019s husband was missing, likely dead.",
      "The children were filling water containers outside when two missiles struck, Nawfal said. She rushed outside and found Halima, the youngest, lying in the street, her skull cracked open, her brain exposed.",
      "Through her shock, Nawfal said, \u201cI was relieved that her body was in one piece.\u201d In Gaza, blasts often ripped people apart, leaving their loved ones without even a body to bury.",
      "Halima\u2019s brother was unconscious next to her. He was quickly revived at the hospital. But staff at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital confirmed Nawfal\u2019s fears, she said: Halima was dead. Her small body was placed in the morgue.",
      "But as the family was preparing to bury her, the little girl\u2019s uncle noticed faint signs of life, the family said.",
      "Officials at Al-Aqsa hospital could not be reached to confirm the account. But Abu Sitta, who has worked in several Gaza hospitals during the war, said in the chaotic situation it was not uncommon for patients to be misidentified as dead because normal protocols for emergency room examinations were often abandoned.",
      "\u201cBecause of the sheer number of cases that would come in with each air raid ... the ambulance staff would take to the morgue immediately those who they thought were dead,\" he said.",
      "In the days after her daughter was determined to be alive, Nawfal stayed with her, manually pumping oxygen into her lungs. After a week, the little girl began to breathe on her own. Finally, she woke up.",
      "\u201cSome of the doctors cried and said this is a miracle,\u201d Nawfal said.",
      "But they were unable to do more than keep the little girl alive. Her skull was still gaping open, a shard of bone missing. Her brain was beset by infection.",
      "The family was evacuated to Egypt in May. In July, they boarded a plane for Lebanon.",
      "The first of the wounded Palestinian children arrived in Lebanon in May. Five-year-old Adam Afana had nearly lost his left arm in a blast that killed his father and sister. His arm was paralyzed and he needed a complex surgery to correct the nerve damage.",
      "At the time, Lebanon was already embroiled in a low-simmering conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.",
      "The Lebanese militant group began firing rockets across the border into Israel in support of its ally, Hamas, on Oct. 8, 2023, a day after Palestinian militants staged the deadly surprise incursion into southern Israel that sparked the ongoing war in Gaza. Israel responded with shelling and airstrikes.",
      "For months, the conflict in Lebanon was mainly confined to the border area, far from Beirut.",
      "Abu Sitta said he chose Lebanon for the wounded children's treatment because the Mediterranean country has specialists with wide experience treating war injuries.",
      "Lebanon has been through its share of conflicts, including a 15-year civil war that ended in 1990 and a brutal monthlong war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006, as well as spillover effects from other regional conflicts.",
      "\u201cEven after the end of the wars (in Lebanon), the wounded from Iraq and Syria would come here for that kind of complex and multistage treatment,\u201d Abu Sitta said.",
      "In July, Halima underwent successful surgery to repair her skull at the American University of Beirut Medical Center.",
      "Nawfal said her daughter has lingering memory problems but is improving with therapy. A chipper, happy-go-lucky child, Halima thrived in Beirut. She swam in the hotel pool, loved to color and played with the other children from Gaza. She walked with her siblings to pick out fruit at the neighborhood produce stand, a straw hat covering the scar on the back of her head.",
      "In mid-September, Israel launched an offensive against Hezbollah. It pummeled wide swathes of Lebanon with airstrikes, including Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs and some sites within the city center.",
      "The children quickly snapped back into wartime habits. They cracked open the balcony's sliding glass doors to prevent the glass shattering from the pressure of a blast and began sleeping in the central sitting room in the family\u2019s hotel suite, away from windows.",
      "Nawfal said some organizations offered to evacuate the family from Lebanon to continue treatment elsewhere, but she \u201ccompletely refused.\u201d",
      "\u201cLebanon isn\u2019t just another Arab country or a country we came to for treatment \u2014 Lebanon is a sister to Gaza,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are like two souls in one body. ... We live or die together.\u201d",
      "Adam Afana's uncle, Eid Afana, said the escalation in Lebanon \u201creminds us of the beginning of the war in Gaza.\u201d Afana said the sound of airstrikes frightened Adam, who felt the war was pursuing them.",
      "\u201cWhat we hope for Lebanon is that what happened in Gaza won\u2019t happen here \u2014 that the beginning and the ending won\u2019t both be the same,\u201d Afana said.",
      "The Ghassan Abu Sitta Fund halted bringing wounded Palestinian children to Lebanon but continues to treat the existing patients \u2014 with some challenges.",
      "Since arriving in Beirut, Adam has undergone a procedure to clear infection from his bones, a neurosurgery and regular physiotherapy sessions. With effort, he can now slightly clench his hand.",
      "But the final operation \u2014 a muscle transfer and surgery to repair the damaged nerves to his arm \u2014 is on hold.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just a handful of people who specialize in this globally, and we were expecting one of them to come to Lebanon,\u201d Abu Sitta said. The trip has been delayed by the escalation in Lebanon.",
      "When he first launched the program, Abu Sitta hoped to treat 50 Palestinian children from Gaza at any given time. Unable to bring more patients in, the team is turning its resources to treating Lebanese children.",
      "The numbers of wounded Lebanese children are still far lower than in Gaza. As of last week, Lebanon\u2019s Ministry of Public Health said 192 children had been killed and at least 1,255 wounded since October 2023. In Gaza, more than 13,000 children have been killed and thousands more have been wounded, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.",
      "Abu Sitta said the wounds of children in Lebanon are \u201cidentical to the injuries of Palestinian children from Gaza.\u201d Most were wounded while at home. They suffered \u201ccrush injuries to the limbs, blast injuries to the face\u201d and often \u201cmultiple members of the family killed at the same time,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cAs in Gaza, this war takes its toll on children,\u201d he said. \u201cAll wars are waged on children.\u201d"

      "BOISE, Idaho -- Four women suing over Idaho's strict abortion bans told a judge Tuesday how excitement over their pregnancies turned to grief and fear after they learned their fetuses were not likely to survive to birth \u2014 and how they had to leave the state to get abortions amid fears that pregnancy complications would put their own health in danger.",
      "\u201cWe felt like we were being made refugees, medical refugees,\u201d said Jennifer Adkins, one of the plaintiffs in the case.",
      "The women, represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights, aren't asking for the state's abortion ban to be overturned. Instead, they want the judge to clarify and expand the exceptions to the strict ban so that people facing serious pregnancy complications can receive abortions before they are at death's door.",
      "Currently, the state's near-total ban makes performing an abortion a felony at any stage of pregnancy unless it is \u201cnecessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.\u201d",
      "Adkins' fetus had a severe medical condition that meant it would not survive the pregnancy. The illness also put Adkins at risk of developing \u201cmirror syndrome,\u201d a dangerous syndrome that can cause fatally high blood pressure and other issues, she said.",
      "Adkins and her husband decided to seek an abortion, and learned they would have to go out of state to get one after another ultrasound showed the fetus still had a heartbeat.",
      "\u201cNo parent wants to wish that when they look at an ultrasound they don't see their baby's heartbeat, yet here I was hoping that I wouldn't,\u201d Adkins said. \u201cI wanted the decision to be made for us, and I wanted to end her suffering, so it was really hard to see that and know that we had the challenges ahead of us that we did.\u201d",
      "Kayla Smith cried as she told the judge how she found out she was pregnant for a second time on Mother's Day of 2022, and how she and her husband chose the name \u201cBrooks\u201d for their son. She was around 18 or 20 weeks along in her pregnancy when the sonographer grew quiet during a routine anatomy scan, Smith said.",
      "Brooks' heart had fatal anomalies, and the young family could not find a pediatric cardiologist willing to attempt an operation. The veins supplying Brooks' lungs were also abnormal, Smith said, and he would not survive birth.",
      "Smith had developed dangerously high blood pressure during a previous pregnancy, and she was at risk of developing the condition called preeclampsia again.",
      "\u201cIf I were to continue pregnancy not only would I risk my life with preeclampsia, I was not willing to watch my son suffer and potentially gasp for air,\u201d Smith said, crying.",
      "Idaho's abortion ban went into effect two days before Brooks' diagnosis, she said, making it impossible for her to get an abortion in her home state.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to meet our son \u2014 that was really important to us \u2014 so we needed to do it in a hospital,\u201d she said. They took out a loan to cover the estimated $16,000 to $20,000 out-of-network cost and drove more than eight hours to a hospital where doctors induced labor.",
      "\u201cAll four of these women were overjoyed to be pregnant with their second child and all four of them received the worst news a mother can imagine,\u201d attorney Gail Deady, with the Center for Reproductive Rights, told 4th District Judge Jason D. Scott during opening arguments. All of them sought abortions \u201cto protect their health, to spare their babies from pain and suffering, and to remain alive and healthy to protect their young children.\u201d",
      "James Craig, a division chief with the Idaho Attorney General\u2019s office, said the women and their attorneys are relying on hypotheticals rather than concrete facts to make their case. Under their proposal, a pregnant woman could receive her abortion for something as minor as stepping on a rusty nail \u2014 even though the risk of infection in that scenario could be easily treated by receiving a tetanus booster shot, Craig said.",
      "\u201cUnborn children have a fundamental right to life, and protecting the lives of children is a legitimate and fundamental government interest,\u201d Craig said.",
      "The state also has the same interest in protecting the lives of women, Craig said \u2014 and the abortion ban laws do both, he contended.",
      "In the \u201crare circumstances where abortion is necessary\u201d to prevent the death of the mother, Idaho law allows that to occur, Craig said. The women suing are trying to \u201cusurp the role of the Legislature\u201d by asking the judge to rewrite the law, he said, and that is not the proper role of the court.",
      "Dr. Emily Corrigan, an ob-gyn who works in emergency medicine at Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center who is also a plaintiff in the case, told the judge how Idaho\u2019s multiple abortion bans have created confusion for physicians and made it difficult to treat pregnant patients who need emergency care.",
      "Doctors have had to \u201cbasically guess which pregnancy conditions would fall under the state medical exception,\u201d Corrigan said.",
      "\u201cI have had other hospital staff refuse to participate in the care of my patients because of the lack of understanding of the laws, and this has caused patient care delays,\u201d she said. \u201cI have personally cared for several patients who have been denied stabilizing abortion care at other hospitals in Idaho. By the time they arrive at my institution, their conditions have deteriorated and have lead to increased complications that I need to manage.\u201d",
      "Several conditions can put the health of pregnant people at risk, she said. Some are caused by pregnancy like preeclampsia, and others \u2014 including some chronic illnesses and cancers \u2014 can be made worse by pregnancy, she said. In those cases, delaying an abortion might not cause immediate death but can cause a shortened life span or have dramatic effects on a person's health, Corrigan said.",
      "\u201cWe are not trained to wait until things become urgent or emergent. We are trained to prevent harm to our patients,\u201d she said."

      "There's some good news about sexually-transmitted diseases in newly released U.S. health data",
      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. syphilis epidemic slowed dramatically last year, gonorrhea cases fell and chlamydia cases remained below prepandemic levels, according to federal data released Tuesday.",
      "The numbers represented some good news about sexually transmitted diseases, which experienced some alarming increases in past years due to declining condom use, inadequate sex education, and reduced testing and treatment when the COVID-19 pandemic hit.",
      "Last year, cases of the most infectious stages of syphilis fell 10% from the year before \u2014 the first substantial decline in more than two decades. Gonorrhea cases dropped 7%, marking a second straight year of decline and bringing the number below what it was in 2019.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m encouraged, and it\u2019s been a long time since I felt that way\u201d about the nation\u2019s epidemic of sexually transmitted infections, said the CDC\u2019s Dr. Jonathan Mermin. \u201cSomething is working.\"",
      "More than 2.4 million cases of syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia were diagnosed and reported last year \u2014 1.6 million cases of chlamydia, 600,000 of gonorrhea, and more than 209,000 of syphilis.",
      "Syphilis is a particular concern. For centuries, it was a common but feared infection that could deform the body and end in death. New cases plummeted in the U.S. starting in the 1940s when infection-fighting antibiotics became widely available, and they trended down for a half century after that. By 2002, however, cases began rising again, with men who have sex with other men being disproportionately affected.",
      "The new report found cases of syphilis in their early, most infectious stages dropped 13% among gay and bisexual men. It was the first such drop since the agency began reporting data for that group in the mid-2000s.",
      "However, there was a 12% increase in the rate of cases of unknown- or later-stage syphilis \u2014 a reflection of people infected years ago.",
      "Cases of syphilis in newborns, passed on from infected mothers, also rose. There were nearly 4,000 cases, including 279 stillbirths and infant deaths.",
      "\u201cThis means pregnant women are not being tested often enough,\u201d said Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, a professor of medicine at the University of Southern California.",
      "What caused some of the STD trends to improve? Several experts say one contributor is the growing use of an antibiotic as a \u201cmorning-after pill.\u201d Studies have shown that taking doxycycline within 72 hours of unprotected sex cuts the risk of developing syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia.",
      "In June, the CDC started recommending doxycycline as a morning-after pill, specifically for gay and bisexual men and transgender women who recently had an STD diagnosis. But health departments and organizations in some cities had been giving the pills to people for a couple years.",
      "Some experts believe that the 2022 mpox outbreak \u2014 which mainly hit gay and bisexual men \u2014 may have had a lingering effect on sexual behavior in 2023, or at least on people's willingness to get tested when strange sores appeared.",
      "Another factor may have been an increase in the number of health workers testing people for infections, doing contact tracing and connecting people to treatment. Congress gave $1.2 billion to expand the workforce over five years, including $600 million to states, cities and territories that get STD prevention funding from CDC.",
      "Last year had the \"most activity with that funding throughout the U.S.,\u201d said David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors.",
      "However, Congress ended the funds early as a part of last year\u2019s debt ceiling deal, cutting off $400 million. Some people already have lost their jobs, said a spokeswoman for Harvey's organization.",
      "Still, Harvey said he had reasons for optimism, including the growing use of doxycycline and a push for at-home STD test kits.",
      "Also, there are reasons to think the next presidential administration could get behind STD prevention. In 2019, then-President Donald Trump announced a campaign to \u201celiminate\u201d the U.S. HIV epidemic by 2030. (Federal health officials later clarified that the actual goal was a huge reduction in new infections \u2014 fewer than 3,000 a year.)",
      "There were nearly 32,000 new HIV infections in 2022, the CDC estimates. But a boost in public health funding for HIV could also also help bring down other sexually transmitted infections, experts said.",
      "\u201cWhen the government puts in resources, puts in money, we see declines in STDs,\u201d Klausner said.",

      "The Justice Department is suing to block UnitedHealth Group\u2019s $3.3 billion purchase of Amedisys",
      "NEW YORK -- The Justice Department is suing to block UnitedHealth Group's $3.3 billion purchase of Amedisys, citing concerns the combination would hinder access to home health and hospice services in the U.S.",
      "The antitrust complaint, filed in Maryland by the Justice Department and four states' attorneys general Tuesday, argues that a potential merger is illegal because the two companies are \"such large competitors\" already \u2014 and the deal would give UnitedHealth too much control in many local markets.",
      "That would mean less choice for patients looking for affordable care, the suit alleges, as well as fewer employment options for nurses seeking competitive pay and benefits.",
      "\u201cAmerican healthcare is unwell,\" Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter of the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division, said in a prepared statement. \u201cUnless this $3.3 billion transaction is stopped, UnitedHealth Group will further extend its grip to home health and hospice care, threatening seniors, their families and nurses.\u201d",
      "Tuesday's lawsuit follows UnitedHealth's acquisition of LHC Group Inc., another home health and hospice provider. Since that transaction's completion last year, the Justice Department said, UnitedHealth and Amedisys have emerged as two of the largest providers of home health and hospice care in the country.",
      "The complaint alleges that UnitedHealth's plan to acquire Amedisys is the result of \"an intentional, sustained strategy of acquiring, rather than beating, competition.\u201d After completing the LHC acquisition, the suit says UnitedHealth prevented Amedisys' 2023 plans to merge with infusion provider OptionCare by paying a \u201cbreakup fee\u201d \u2014 and then separately made its own acquisition offer, which Amedisys eventually accepted.",
      "UnitedHealth is seeking to add Amedisys to Optum, its subsidiary that provides care as well as pharmacy and technology services. In a response Tuesday to the antitrust suit, Optum said the transaction \u201cwould be pro-competitive and further innovation.\u201d It said it plans to \u201cvigorously defend (itself) against the DOJ\u2019s overreaching interpretation of the antitrust laws.\u201d",
      "Amedisys added that it also remains committed to the deal, which it believes \u201cwill create more opportunities to deliver quality, compassionate and value-based care to patients and their families.\u201d",
      "In details about the deal published on Optum's website, the company maintained Optum and Amedisys \u201cwould operate just a fraction\" of all home health and hospice care markets nationwide when combined. Optum also noted plans to divest some of its care centers to home health provider VitalCaring upon the deal's completion. It said the divestments would aid competition but the Justice Department said that the proposal is inadequate.",
      "Beyond its Optum unit, UnitedHealth Group also runs one of the nation\u2019s largest health insurers, UnitedHealthcare. The Minnesota-based healthcare giant reported third-quarter net income of $6.06 billion on revenue of $100.82 billion.",
      "Louisiana-based Amedisys reported third-quarter earnings of $16.9 million and a revenue of $587.7 million for the period.",
      "Tuesday's lawsuit arrives in the final months of the Biden administration, which has been particularly aggressive in antitrust enforcement. In recent years, the Justice Department has also targeted companies accused of engaging in illegal monopolies and driving up prices across industries like entertainment, travel and tech.",
      "The four states\u2019 attorneys general joining Tuesday's suit against UnitedHealth and Amedisys are from Maryland, Illinois, New Jersey and New York."

      "Food and beverage manufacturer Kraft Heinz says it's no longer serving the Lunchables meals it created for U.S. schools",
      "Food and beverage manufacturer Kraft Heinz said Tuesday that it no longer is serving the Lunchables meals it created for U.S. schools.",
      "The company introduced the two packaged meals \u2014 one starring pizza and the other a turkey, cheddar cheese and cracker plate \u2014 at the beginning of the 2023-2024 academic year. At the time, Kraft Heinz said the offerings were protein-enriched and contained reduced levels of saturated fat and sodium to meet the requirements of the national free and reduced-price school lunch program.",
      "Nutritionists and advocacy groups were not thrilled by the launch. The Center for Science in the Public Interest called having Lunchables in cafeterias \u201ca highly questionable move for school nutrition\u201d that might confuse families into thinking the versions sold at supermarkets were a healthy option.",
      "The drumbeat quickened in April, when Consumer Reports said its tests showed the school-approved Lunchables contained more sodium than the store varieties. The organization also reported that commercially available Lunchables had more lead compared to ready-made meals made several other companies.",
      "Consumer Reports petitioned the U.S. Department of Agriculture to ban Lunchables and similar processed meal kits from schools.",
      "In a statement, Pittsburgh-based Kraft Heinz attributed the decision to pull out of the market served by the National School Lunch Program to a lack of demand. The company described the business impact as \u201cnegligible,\u201d saying sales of the school-designed meals \u201cwere far less than 1% of overall Lunchables sales\u201d during the last academic year.",
      "\u201cLast year, we brought two NSLP compliant Lunchables options to schools that had increased protein. While many school administrators were excited to have these options, the demand did not meet our targets,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThis happens occasionally across our broad portfolio, especially as we explore new sales channels. Lunchables products are not available in schools this year and we hope to revisit at a future date.\u201d",
      "The Kraft Heinz Co. produces a wide range of familiar products, including Capri Sun juice pouches, Oscar Meyer hot dogs, Grey Poupon mustard, Kool-Aid and Philadelphia Cream Cheese."

    "story": [
      "A pregnant woman has filed a lawsuit seeking the right to an abortion in Kentucky",
      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- A pregnant woman filed a lawsuit Tuesday seeking to restore the right to an abortion in Kentucky in the latest challenge to the state's near-total ban on the procedure.",
      "The suit, filed in state court in Louisville, claims that Kentucky laws blocking abortions violate the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights to privacy and self-determination. It asks that both state laws be struck down by a judge in Jefferson County Circuit Court.",
      "The woman, a state resident identified by the pseudonym Mary Poe to protect her privacy, is about seven weeks pregnant, the suit said. She wants to terminate her pregnancy but cannot legally do so in Kentucky, it said.",
      "The decision about whether to become or remain pregnant is among the \u201cmost personal and consequential decisions a person will make in their lifetime,\u201d the suit said. Her legal team includes attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union.",
      "\u201cWithout the ability to decide whether to continue a pregnancy, Kentuckians have lost the right to make critical decisions about their health, bodies, lives and futures,\u201d the suit said.",
      "The plaintiff said in a statement that ending her pregnancy is the best decision for her and her family.",
      "\u201cI feel overwhelmed and frustrated that I cannot access abortion care here in my own state, and I have started the difficult process of arranging to get care in another state where it\u2019s legal,\u201d she said in the statement issued by the ACLU of Kentucky. \u201cThis involves trying to take time off work and securing child care, all of which place an enormous burden on me.\u201d",
      "Defendants in the latest suit include Russell Coleman, Kentucky\u2019s Republican attorney general.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the attorney general\u2019s responsibility to defend the laws passed by the General Assembly, and we will zealously work to uphold these laws in court,\u201d Coleman said in a statement.",
      "The suit was quickly denounced as meritless by David Walls, executive director of The Family Foundation, a conservative group staunchly opposed to abortion.",
      "\u201cThe ACLU\u2019s suggestion that the Kentucky Constitution somehow secretly contains a hidden right to terminate the life and stop the beating heart of an unborn human being, despite Kentucky\u2019s clear 150-year pro-life history, is absolutely absurd,\u201d Walls said in a statement.",
      "The suit is seeking class-action status to include others who are or will become pregnant and want the right to have an abortion. It is challenging Kentucky\u2019s near-total trigger law ban and a separate six-week ban, both of which were passed by Republican legislative majorities.",
      "The trigger law took effect when Roe v. Wade was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 and bans abortions except to save the life of the patient or to prevent disabling injury. It does not include exceptions for cases of rape or incest.",
      "The lawsuit is similar to legal action taken nearly a year ago, also by a pregnant woman who sought the right to an abortion in Kentucky. That challenge was dropped after the woman learned her embryo no longer had cardiac activity, but abortion rights groups said the legal fight was far from over.",
      "In 2022, Kentucky voters rejected a ballot measure that would have denied any constitutional protections for abortion, but abortion rights supporters have made no inroads in the Republican-controlled Legislature at chipping away at the laws.",
      "Kentucky's Supreme Court refused last year to halt the near-total ban, resulting in abortion access remaining virtually shut off in the. Abortion rights groups have searched for plaintiffs to challenge the ban.",
      "Brigitte Amiri, deputy director of the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, said Tuesday that bans in Kentucky and elsewhere have \u201cwreaked havoc on people\u2019s lives.\u201d",
      "\u201cThose who can scrape together the resources may be able to travel out of state to get care, but others will be forced to carry their pregnancies to term against their will, often at great cost to their health or lives,\u201d Amiri said in a statement.",
      "The plaintiff in the new lawsuit said the decision whether to end her pregnancy should be hers.",
      "\"I am bringing this case to ensure that other Kentuckians will not have to go through what I am going through, and instead will be able to get the health care they need in our community,\u201d she said."

      "The family of a security guard who was fatally shot at a hospital in Portland, Oregon, has sued the facility for $35 million",
      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- The family of a security guard who was shot and killed at a hospital in Portland, Oregon, sued the facility for $35 million on Tuesday, accusing it of negligence and failing to respond to the dangers that the gunman posed to hospital staff over multiple days.",
      "In a wrongful death complaint filed Tuesday, the estate of Bobby Smallwood argued that Legacy Good Samaritan Medical Center failed to enforce its policies against violence and weapons in the workplace by not barring the shooter from the facility, despite staff reporting threats and aggression toward them in the days before the shooting.",
      "\u201cThe repeated failures of Legacy Good Samaritan to follow their own safety protocols directly led to the tragically preventable death of Bobby Smallwood,\u201d Tom D\u2019Amore, the attorney representing the family, said in a statement. \u201cDespite documented threats and abusive behavior that required immediate removal under hospital policy, Legacy allowed a dangerous individual to remain on the premises for three days until those threats escalated to violence.\u201d",
      "In an email, Legacy Health said it was unable to comment on pending litigation.",
      "The shooting at Legacy Good Samaritan Medical Center in Portland was part of a wave of gun violence sweeping through U.S. hospitals and medical centers, which have struggled to adapt to the growing threats. Such attacks have helped make health care one of the nation\u2019s most violent fields. Health care workers racked up 73% of all nonfatal workplace violence injuries in 2018, the most recent year for which figures are available, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "The gunman at the Portland hospital, PoniaX Calles, first visited the facility on July 19, 2023, as his partner was about to give birth. On July 20 and July 21, nursing staff and security guards filed multiple incident reports describing outbursts, violent behavior and threats, but they weren't accessible or provided to workers who were interacting with him, according to the complaint.",
      "On July 22, nurse supervisors decided to remove Calles from his partner's room, and Smallwood accompanied him to the waiting room area outside the maternity ward. Other security guards searching the room found two loaded firearms in a duffel bag, and his partner told them he likely had a third gun on his person, the complaint said.",
      "According to the complaint, over 40 minutes passed between the discovery of the duffel bag and Smallwood's death. Two minutes before he was shot, a security guard used hand gestures through glass doors to notify him that Calles was armed. Smallwood then told Calles he would pat him down, but Calles said he would leave instead. Smallwood began escorting him out of the hospital, and as other staff members approached them, Calles shot Smallwood in the neck.",
      "The hospital did not call a \u201ccode silver,\u201d the emergency code for an active shooter, until after Smallwood had been shot, the complaint said.",
      "Smallwood's family said his death has profoundly impacted them.",
      "\u201cEvery day we grieve the loss of our son and all the years ahead that should have been his to live,\u201d his parents, Walter \u201cBob\u201d and Tammy Smallwood, said in the statement released by their attorney. \u201cNothing can bring Bobby back, but we will not stop fighting until Legacy is held fully responsible for what they took from our family.\u201d",
      "After the shooting, Legacy said it planned to install additional metal detectors; require bag searches at every hospital; equip more security officers with stun guns; and apply bullet-slowing film to some interior glass and at main entrances.",
      "Around 40 states have passed laws creating or increasing penalties for violence against health care workers, according to the American Nurses Association. Hospitals have armed security officers with batons, stun guns or handguns, while some states allow hospitals to create their own police forces."

      "LONDON -- Cases of mpox in the region of Congo where a new and more infectious variant was first detected appear to be \u201cplateauing,\u201d the World Health Organization said on Monday, even as the virus continues to increase in other areas of the country, as well as in Burundi and Uganda.",
      "A report by the U.N. health agency said the number of mpox infections \u201cshows a general rising trend,\u201d but that they may have plateaued in South Kivu, where the more infectious form of mpox was first identified to be spreading earlier this year among sex workers and miners in the gold mining town of Kamituga.",
      "WHO acknowledged that testing is still not widespread, making it difficult to understand how exactly the virus is spreading.",
      "According to data from last week, Congo reported fewer than 100 laboratory-confirmed mpox cases, down from nearly 400 in July. In recent weeks, experts say that infections appear to be stabilizing, offering a chance for health authorities to definitively stamp out the outbreak.",
      "So far, about 50,000 people in Congo have been immunized against mpox. The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 3 million vaccines are needed to stop the outbreak.",
      "Last week, Africa CDC's director Dr. Jean Kaseya said the continent was \u201cstill in the acute phase\u201d of the mpox epidemic, with 19 countries affected. He warned that without more resources, the virus could become a global threat.",
      "WHO said the Burundi outbreak is also being driven by the newer variant, which causes less severe symptoms \u2014 meaning people who are infectious may not realize they are spreading it. In the last two weeks, Burundi has reported more than 200 new mpox cases every week, mostly in children and young adults.",
      "In Uganda, which reported 100 new cases last week, WHO said the virus is spreading mostly through sex, with the vast majority of cases in adults.",
      "Mpox -- previously known as monkeypox because it was first seen in research monkeys \u2014 is spread primarily through close skin-to-skin contact with infected people or their soiled clothes or bedsheets. It often causes visible skin lesions that could make people less likely to be in close contact with others.",
      "In August, WHO declared the rapid spread of mpox in Congo and elsewhere in Africa to be a global health emergency. To date, Africa has reported more than 46,000 suspected cases, including 1,081 deaths.",
      "WHO said it would convene an expert meeting on Nov. 22 to determine if mpox still constitutes an international emergency.",
      "Last week, Britain announced the first instance of the more infectious kind of mpox spreading beyond Africa. It identified mpox in a person who had recently traveled to Africa and in three of their household contacts. All the individuals are currently being treated in two London hospitals.",

      "Four-year-old Hussein Mikdad survived an Israeli airstrike on his home in a Beirut suburb last month",
      "BEIRUT -- Curled up in his father \u2019s lap, clinging to his chest, Hussein Mikdad cried his heart out. The 4-year-old kicked his doctor with his intact foot and pushed him away with the arm that was not in a cast. \u201cMy Dad! My Dad!\" Hussein said. \"Make him leave me alone!\u201d With eyes tearing up in relief and pain, the father reassured his son and pulled him closer.",
      "Hussein and his father, Hassan, are the only survivors of their family after an Israeli airstrike last month on their Beirut neighborhood. The strike killed 18 people, including his mother, three siblings and six relatives.",
      "\u201cCan he now shower?\u201d the father asked the doctor.",
      "Ten days after surgery, doctors examining Hussein's wounds said the boy is healing properly. He has rods in his fractured right thigh and stitches that assembled his torn tendons back in place on the right arm. The pain has subsided, and Hussein should be able to walk again in two months \u2014 albeit with a lingering limp.",
      "A prognosis for Hussein's invisible wounds is much harder to give. He is back in diapers and has begun wetting his bed. He hardly speaks and has not said a word about his mother, two sisters and brother.",
      "\u201cThe trauma is not just on the muscular skeletal aspect. But he is also mentally hurt,\u201d Imad Nahle, one of Hussein\u2019s orthopedic surgeons, said.",
      "Israel said, without elaborating, that the strike on the Mikdad neighborhood struck a Hezbollah target. In the war that has escalated since September, Israeli airstrikes have increasingly hit residential areas around Lebanon. Israel accuses the Lebanese militant group of hiding its capabilities and fighters among civilians. It vows to cripple Hezbollah, which began firing into northern Israel after Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack triggered the war in Gaza.",
      "But children have been caught in the midst.",
      "With more strikes on homes and in residential areas, doctors are seeing more children affected by the violence. More than 100 children have been killed in Lebanon in the past six weeks and hundreds injured. And of the 14,000 wounded since last year, around 10% are children. Many have been left with severed limbs, burned bodies, and broken families \u2014 scars that could last for a lifetime.",
      "Ghassan Abu Sittah, a renowned British-Palestinian surgeon who is also treating Hussein, sees that long road ahead. This is his worry: \u201cIt leaves us with a generation of physically wounded children, children who are psychologically and emotionally wounded.\"",
      "At the American University of Beirut Medical Center, which is receiving limited cases of war casualties, Nahle said he operated on five children in the past five weeks \u2014 up from no cases before. Most were referred from south and eastern Lebanon.",
      "A few miles away, at the Lebanese Hospital Geitaoui, one of the country\u2019s largest burns centers increased its capacity by nearly 180% since September so it could accommodate more war wounded, its medical director Naji Abirached said. About a fifth of the newly admitted patients are children.",
      "In one of the burn center\u2019s ICU units lies Ivana Skakye. She turned 2 in the hospital ward last week. Ivana has been healing from burns she sustained following an Israeli airstrike outside their home in southern Lebanon on Sept. 23. Israel said it struck ammunition depots and launchers in southern Lebanon that day when its warplanes launched hundreds of airstrikes in different parts of Lebanon, making it the deadliest day of the war so far. More than 500 people were killed.",
      "Six weeks later, the tiny Ivana remains wrapped in white gauze from head to toe except her torso. She sustained third-degree burns over 40 percent of her body. Her hair and head, her left side all the way to her legs, both her arms and her chest were burned. Her family home was damaged, its ceiling set afire. The family\u2019s valuables, packed in their car as they prepared to leave, were also torched. Ivana\u2019s older sister, Rahaf, 7, has recovered faster from burns to her face and hands.",
      "Fatima Zayoun, their mother, was in the kitchen when the explosion hit. Zayoun jumped up to grab the girls, who were playing on the terrace.",
      "It was, Zayoun said, \"as if something lifted me up so that I can grab my kids. I have no idea how I managed to pull them in and throw them out of the window. She spoke from the ICU burns unit. \u201cThey were not on fire, but they were burned. Black ash covered them. ... (Ivana) was without any hair. I told myself, `That is not her.'\u201d",
      "Now, Ivana's wound dressings are changed every two days. Her doctor, Ziad Sleiman, said she could be discharged in a few days. She\u2019s back again to saying \u201cMama\u201d and \u201cBye \u2014 shorthand for wanting to go out.",
      "Like Hussein, though, Ivana has no home to return to. Her parents fear collective shelters could cause an infection to return.",
      "After seeing her kids \u201csizzling on the floor,\u201d Zayoun, 35, said that even if their home is repaired, she wouldn\u2019t want to return. \u201cI saw death with my own eyes,\u201d she said.",
      "Zayoun was 17 last time Israel and Hezbollah were at war, in 2006. Displaced with her family then, she said she almost enjoyed the experience, riding out of their village in a truck full of their belongings, mixing with new people, learning new things. They returned home when the war was over.",
      "\u201cBut this war is hard. They are hitting everywhere,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat do they want from us? Do they want to hurt our children? We are not what they are looking for.\"",
      "Abu Sittah, the reconstructive surgeon, said most of the children's injuries are from blasts or collapsing rubble. That attack on a space they expect to be inviolable can have lingering effects.",
      "\u201cChildren feel safe at home,\" he said. \"The injury makes them for the first time lose that sense of security \u2014 that their parents are keeping them safe, that their homes are invincible, and suddenly their homes become not so.\u201d",
      "One recent morning, children were playing in the courtyard of a vocational school-turned-shelter in Dekwaneh, north of Beirut, where nearly 3,000 people displaced from the south are now living. The parents were busy with an overflowing bathroom that serves one floor in a building that houses nearly 700 people.",
      "Only playtime brings the children, from different villages in the south, together. They were divided in two teams, ages ranging between 6 and 12, competing to get the handkerchief first. A tiny girl hugged and held hands with strangers visiting the shelter. \u201cI am from Lebanon. Don't tell anyone,\u201d she whispered in their ears.",
      "The game turned rowdy when two girls in their early teens got into a fist fight. Pushing and shoving began. Tears and tantrums followed. The tiny girl walked away in a daze.",
      "Maria Elizabeth Haddad, manager of the psychosocial support programs in Beirut and neighboring areas for the U.S.-based International Medical Corps, said parents in shelters reported signs of increased anxiety, hostility and aggression among kids. They talk back to parents and ignore rules. Some have developed speech impediments and clinginess. One is showing early signs of psychosis.",
      "\u201cThere are going to be residual symptoms when they grow up, especially related to attachment ties, to feeling of security,\u201d Haddad said. \u201cIt is a generational trauma. We have experienced it before with our parents. ... They don\u2019t have stability or search for (extra) stability. This is not going to be easy to overcome.\u201d",
      "Children represent more than a third of over 1 million people displaced by the war in Lebanon and following Israeli evacuation notices, according to U.N. and government estimates (more than 60,000 people have been displaced from northern Israel). That leaves hundreds of thousands in Lebanon without schooling, either because their schools were inaccessible or have been turned into shelters.",
      "Hussein's father says he and his son must start together from scratch. With help from relatives, the two have found a temporary shelter in a home \u2014 and, for the father, a brief sense of relief. \u201cI thank God he is not asking for or about his mother and his siblings,\u201d said Hassan Mikdad, the 40-year-old father.",
      "He has no explanation for his son, who watched their family die in their home. His two sisters \u2014 Celine, 10, and Cila, 14 \u2014 were pulled out of the rubble the following day. His mother, Mona, was pulled out three days later. She was locked in an embrace with her 6-year-old son, Ali.",
      "The strike on Oct. 21 also caused damage across the street, to one of Beirut\u2019s main public hospitals, breaking solar panels and windows in the pharmacy and the dialysis unit. The father survived because he had stepped out for coffee. He watched his building crumble in the late-night airstrike. He also lost his shop, his motorcycles and car \u2014 all the evidence of his 16 years of family life.",
      "His friend, Hussein Hammoud, arrived on the scene to help sift through rubble. Hammoud spotted young Hussein Mikdad\u2019s fingers in the darkness in an alley behind their home. At first, he thought they were severed limbs \u2014 until he heard the boy\u2019s screams. He dug out Hussein with glass lodged in his leg and a metal bar in his shoulder. Hammoud said he didn\u2019t recognize the boy. He held the child's almost-severed wrist in place.",
      "In the hospital now, Hussein Mikdad sipped a juice as he listened to his father and his friend. His father turned to him, asking if he wanted a Spider-Man toy \u2014 an effort to forestall a new outburst of tears. He said he buys Hussein a toy each day.",
      "\u201cWhat I am living through seems like a big lie. ...The mind can\u2019t comprehend,\u201d he said. \u201cI thank God for the blessing that is Hussein.\u201d",

      "ISLAMABAD -- The U.N. children\u2019s agency on Monday warned that the health of 11 million children in Pakistan\u2019s eastern Punjab province is in danger because of air pollution that experts say has become a fifth season in recent years.",
      "Toxic smog has shrouded Pakistan's cultural capital of Lahore and 17 other districts in Punjab since last month. Health officials say more than 40,000 people have been treated for respiratory ailments.",
      "UNICEF's representative in Pakistan, Abdullah Fadil, in a statement urged the government to make urgent and greater efforts to reduce air pollution for the 11 million affected children under the age of 5 and others.",
      "\u201cPrior to these record-breaking levels of air pollution, about 12% of deaths in children under 5 in Pakistan were due to air pollution,\" Fadil said. \"The impact of this year\u2019s extraordinary smog will take time to assess, but we know that doubling and tripling the amount of pollution in the air will have devastating effects, particularly on children and pregnant women.\u201d",
      "Pakistan has shut schools until Nov. 17 in parts of Punjab as part of measures aimed at protecting children\u2019s health. Authorities on Friday ordered the closure of all parks and museums for 10 days, and they have been urging people to avoid unnecessary travel.",
      "According to the Environmental Protection Department in Punjab, Multan remained the most polluted city on Monday, with air quality index readings of about 800. Anything over 300 is considered hazardous to health.",
      "Though the government has ordered the mandatory wearing of face masks, that has been widely disregarded. The government has also said it was looking into methods to induce artificial rainfall to combat the pollution.",

      "An attorney representing a conservate prosecutor is struggling to convince Wisconsin's liberal-leaning Supreme Court to reactivate the state's 175-year-old abortion ban",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- A conservative prosecutor's attorney struggled Monday to persuade the Wisconsin Supreme Court to reactivate the state's 175-year-old abortion ban, drawing a tongue-lashing from two of the court's liberal justices during oral arguments.",
      "Sheboygan County\u2019s Republican district attorney, Joel Urmanski, has asked the high court to overturn a Dane County judge\u2019s ruling last year that invalidated the ban. A ruling isn't expected for weeks but abortion advocates almost certainly will win the case given that liberal justices control the court. One of them, Janet Protasiewicz, remarked on the campaign trail that she supports abortion rights.",
      "Monday's two-hour session amounted to little more than political theater. Liberal Justice Rebecca Dallet told Urmanski's attorney, Matthew Thome, that the ban was passed in 1849 by white men who held all the power and that he was ignoring everything that has happened since. Jill Karofsky, another liberal justice, pointed out that the ban provides no exceptions for rape or incest and that reactivation could result in doctors withholding medical care. She told Thome that he was essentially asking the court to sign a \u201cdeath warrant\u201d for women and children in Wisconsin.",
      "\u201cThis is the world gone mad,\u201d Karofsky said.",
      "The ban stood until 1973, when the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion nationwide nullified it. Legislators never repealed the ban, however, and conservatives have argued the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe two years ago reactivated it.",
      "Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul filed a lawsuit challenging the law in 2022. He argued that a 1985 Wisconsin law that prohibits abortion after a fetus reaches the point where it can survive outside the womb supersedes the ban. Some babies can survive with medical help after 21 weeks of gestation.",
      "Urmanski contends that the ban was never repealed and that it can co-exist with the 1985 law because that law didn\u2019t legalize abortion at any point. Other modern-day abortion restrictions also don\u2019t legalize the practice, he argues.",
      "Dane County Circuit Judge Diane Schlipper ruled last year that the ban outlaws feticide \u2014 which she defined as the killing of a fetus without the mother\u2019s consent \u2014 but not consensual abortions. The ruling emboldened Planned Parenthood to resume offering abortions in Wisconsin after halting procedures after Roe was overturned.",
      "Urmanski asked the state Supreme Court in February to overturn Schlipper\u2019s ruling without waiting for a lower appellate decision.",
      "Thome told the justices on Monday that he wasn't arguing about the implications of reactivating the ban. He maintained that the legal theory that new laws implicitly repeal old ones is shaky. He also contended that the ban and the newer abortion restrictions can overlap just like laws establishing different penalties for the same crime. A ruling that the 1985 law effectively repealed the ban would be \u201canti-democratic,\u201d Thome added.",
      "\u201cIt's a statute this Legislature has not repealed and you're saying, no, you actually repealed it,\u201d he said.",
      "Dallet shot back that disregarding laws passed over the last 40 years to go back to 1849 would be undemocratic.",
      "Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin filed a separate lawsuit in February asking the state Supreme Court to rule directly on whether a constitutional right to abortion exists in the state. The justices have agreed to take the case but haven't scheduled oral arguments yet.",

      "Health officials say it's important to get flu and COVID-19 vaccines ahead of the holidays when respiratory bugs tend to spread",
      "WASHINGTON -- If you missed the early fall push for flu and COVID-19 vaccines, it's not too late.",
      "Health officials say it's important to get vaccinated ahead of the holidays, when respiratory bugs tend to spread with travel and indoor celebrations.",
      "Those viruses haven't caused much trouble so far this fall. But COVID-19 tends to jump in the winter months, a rise that usually starts around Thanksgiving and peaks in January.",
      "And that coincides with flu season, which tends to start in November or December and peak in January or February.",
      "It takes the body about two weeks to build up immunity after either shot \u2014 meaning vaccination is needed before these viruses start spreading. A lot of older adults also need protection against another risky winter virus, RSV.",
      "Yes, you can get your flu and COVID-19 shots at the same time. Don't call them boosters \u2014 they're not just another dose of last year\u2019s protection. The coronavirus and influenza are escape artists that constantly mutate to evade your body\u2019s immune defenses, so both vaccines are reformulated annually to target newer strains.",
      "While they\u2019re not perfect, vaccinations offer strong protection against a bad case of flu or COVID-19 \u2014 or dying from it.",
      "\u201cIt may not prevent every infection but those infections are going to be less severe,\u201d said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cI would rather have my grandmother or my great-grandmother have a sniffle than have to go to the emergency room on Thanksgiving.\u201d",
      "Last year, just 45% of adults got a flu vaccination and even fewer, 23%, got a COVID-19 shot.",
      "\u201cOur best defense to protect ourselves, our loved ones and all those around us is a simple shot,\u201d Dr. Bruce A. Scott, president of the American Medical Association, said in a recent statement.",
      "While it may have faded from the headlines, the coronavirus still killed more Americans than flu last year.",
      "\u201cMaybe we believe that it\u2019s not going to be me but let\u2019s not take a chance,\u201d said Dr. Michael Knight of George Washington University. \u201cWhy not get a vaccine that\u2019s going to help you reduce that risk?\u201d",
      "The CDC urges both an updated COVID-19 shot and yearly flu vaccine for everyone ages 6 months and older. If you recently had COVID-19, you can wait two or three months but still should get an updated vaccination because of the expected winter surge.",
      "Both viruses can be especially dangerous to certain groups including older people and those with weak immune systems and lung or heart disease. Young children also are more vulnerable. The CDC counted 199 child deaths from flu last year.",
      "Pregnancy also increases the chances of serious COVID-19 or flu \u2013 and vaccination guards mom plus ensures the newborn has some protection, too.",
      "In addition, the CDC is recommending that people 65 and older get a second COVID-19 shot six months after their fall dose to boost their year-round protection, since the coronavirus isn't just a winter threat. People with weakened immune systems are eligible for extra doses, too.",
      "Last fall\u2019s shots targeted a coronavirus strain that\u2019s no longer spreading while this year\u2019s are tailored to a new section of the coronavirus family tree. The Pfizer and Moderna shots are formulated against a virus subtype called KP.2 while the Novavax vaccine targets its parent strain, JN.1. Daskalakis said all should offer good cross protection to other subtypes now spreading.",
      "The Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines can be used by adults and children as young as 6 months. The Novavax shot is a more traditional protein vaccine combined with an immune booster, and open to anyone 12 and older.",
      "High-dose shots and one with a special immune booster are designed for people 65 and older, but if they can't find one easily they can choose a regular all-ages flu shot.",
      "For the shot-averse, the nasal spray FluMist is available for ages 2 to 49 at pharmacies and clinics \u2014 although next year it's set to be available for use at home.",
      "All flu vaccinations this year will guard against two Type A flu strains and one Type B strain. Another once-common form of Type B flu quit spreading a few years ago and was removed from the vaccine.",
      "RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, is a coldlike nuisance for most people but it, too, packs hospitals every winter and can be deadly for children under 5, the elderly and people with certain high-risk health problems.",
      "The CDC recommends an RSV vaccination for everyone 75 and older, and for people 60 to 74 who are at increased risk. This is a one-time shot, not a yearly vaccination \u2013 but only 24% of seniors got it last year. It's also recommended late in pregnancy to protect babies born during the fall and winter.",
      "And while \u201cyour arm may hurt and you may feel crummy for a day,\u201d it's also fine to get the RSV, flu and COVID-19 vaccines at the same time, Daskalakis said.",
      "The vaccines are supposed to be free under Medicare, Medicaid and most private insurance plans if people use an in-network provider.",
      "About 1.5 million uninsured adults got free COVID-19 vaccinations through a federal program last year but that has ended. Instead, the CDC is providing $62 million to health departments to help improve access. Call your local health department to ask about options.",

      "Democratic U.S. Rep. Gerry Connolly of Virginia said Thursday that he is battling esophageal cancer",
      "RICHMOND, Va. -- U.S. Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Democrat representing Virginia's most populous county in Congress, said Thursday that he is battling esophageal cancer.",
      "The announcement comes after Connolly, 74, handily won his ninth House term on Tuesday by defeating Republican Mike Van Meter, a Navy veteran and former FBI agent, in Virginia's 11th District.",
      "\u201cI will attack this the only way I know how \u2013 with Irish fight and humor,\u201d Connolly said in a statement.",
      "As he enters his new term representing Fairfax County and the wealthy suburbs outside Washington, the congressman will be undergoing chemotherapy and immunotherapy, he said. In his statement, Connolly said he had no symptoms besides occasional abdominal aches.",
      "\u201cMy wonderful staff and I look forward to serving you all in this new term and in the future,\u201d he said.",
      "The congressman has been a fixture in northern Virginia politics for roughly 30 years after he was first elected as a Fairfax County supervisor in 1995. In Congress, he has played a leading role in oversight investigations.",
      "His tenure as a congressman has not been without hardship. Last year, a man with a history of mental illness went to Connolly's Fairfax, Virginia, district office looking to kill him with a baseball bat. Connolly wasn\u2019t there, so the man, who a judge had since found not guilty by reason of insanity, attacked two staffers.",

    "story": [
      "A ship suspected of carrying a large amount of hazardous waste has been allowed to dock at Albania\u2019s main port, where its cargo was being unloaded for inspection",
      "TIRANA, Albania -- A ship suspected of carrying a large amount of hazardous waste was allowed to dock on Friday at Albania\u2019s main port, where its cargo was being unloaded for inspection on the orders of the prosecutor, officials said.",
      "Albania had prevented the Turkish-flagged Moliva XA443A from docking early last week at the port of Durres, 33 kilometers (20 miles) west of the capital, Tirana, after a watchdog alerted authorities that it was carrying hazardous waste.",
      "Instead, the ship was kept at an anchorage place away from the port.",
      "The prosecutors then ordered the containers to be seized and stored \u201cat an environmentally\" safe place. Once unloaded, the containers are expected to be sent to an agency in Porto Romano, 6 kilometers (4 miles) away, for inspection.",
      "The prosecutor\u2019s office has asked different institutions to conduct lab tests of the cargo.",
      "The Seattle-based non-government organization Basel Action Network, or BAN, which focuses on environmental issues, flagged the ship to authorities in August after receiving information from a whistleblower that the containers on board are suspected to be carrying an estimated 2,100 tons of toxic dust from pollution control filters from the steel industry.",
      "The dust is suspected to have originated at an Albanian company and that it was also illegally smuggled to Albania from neighboring Kosovo and Germany.",
      "BAN said the containers left Durres on July 4 on two Maersk-chartered ships with the intended destination of Thailand. The group said it alerted several transit countries and collaborated with EARTH, a Thai environmental organization, and together raised the alarm about the shipment.",
      "Thailand refused to accept the shipment, asking authorities in Singapore to stop it. The ships then docked at a Turkish port and the containers were loaded on the Turkish-flagged ship, which briefly stopped at the Italian port of Gioia Tauro before going to Albania, BAN said.",
      "The customs documentation stated the containers contained iron oxide, according to local reports.",
      "\u201cThe case is under investigation from the Durres prosecutor's office and the Ministry of Tourism and Environment is cooperating for anything that the justice institution asks for,\u201d ministry spokesperson Erjon Uka told The Associated Press on Friday.",
      "Albania's opposition accused the government in August of taking part in illegally trafficking hazardous material.",
      "Prime Minister Edi Rama said in Parliament in September that the shipment\u2019s documents were verified and that iron oxide is \u201cnot considered as toxic waste in the European catalogs on which the environmental and customs procedure of our country is based.\u201d",
      "Speaking to a parliamentary commission on Friday, Environment Minister Mirela Kumbaro said the case should not be politically exploited to spread panic.",
      "She urged for calm to allow the investigation to proceed.",
      "The ship, she said, is suspected of carrying hazardous waste but \u201chazardous waste does not mean toxic\u201d waste, adding that transport companies had declared the cargo consisted of \u201cnormal goods\u201d \u2014 and that it was only now being described as hazardous waste.",
      "The Seattle-based NGO has called on Albanian authorities to have a public opening and sampling of the containers to ensure transparency of the investigation.",
      "BAN has also said that while Albania is looking to join the European Union and the government has been eager to align its hazardous waste policy with that of the 27-nation bloc, it should ban \u201cthe export of hazardous wastes, household wastes, electronic wastes and plastic wastes to developing countries.\u201d",

    "summary": "Federal health officials are calling for more testing and treatment of workers on farms with bird flu",
    "story": [
      "Federal health officials are calling for more testing and treatment of workers on farms with bird flu",
      "Federal health officials on Thursday called for more testing of employees on farms with bird flu after a new study showed that some dairy workers had signs of infection, even when they didn't report feeling sick.",
      "Farmworkers in close contact with infected animals should be tested and offered treatment even if they show no symptoms, said Dr. Nirav Shah, principal director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The new guidance comes after blood tests for 115 farmworkers in Michigan and Colorado showed that eight workers \u2014 or 7% \u2014 had antibodies that indicated previous infection with the virus known as Type A H5N1 influenza.",
      "\u201cThe purpose of these actions is to keep workers safe, to limit the transmission of H5 to humans and to reduce the possibility of the virus changing,\u201d Shah told reporters.",
      "The CDC study provides the largest window to date into how the bird virus first detected in March in dairy cows may be spreading to people. It suggests that the virus has infected more humans than the 46 farmworkers identified in the U.S. as of Thursday. Nearly all were in contact with infected dairy cows or infected poultry.",
      "Outside experts said it\u2019s notable that the study prompted the CDC to take new action. Previous recommendations called for testing and treating workers only when they had symptoms.",
      "\u201cThis is a significant move towards the assessment that these H5N1 viruses are a greater risk than the CDC estimated before,\u201d said Dr. Gregory Gray, an infectious disease researcher at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.",
      "Every additional infection in animals or humans gives the virus the chance to change in potentially dangerous ways, said Angela Rasmussen, a virus expert at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada.",
      "\u201cIt shows yet again that we are not responding effectively to the H5N1 cattle outbreak in humans or animals and if we continue to let this virus spread and jump from species to species, our luck will eventually run out,\u201d Rasmussen said in an email.",
      "The CDC study included 45 workers in Michigan and 70 in Colorado tested between June and August. Of the eight workers with positive blood tests, four reported no symptoms. All eight cleaned milking parlors and none used respiratory protection such as face masks. Three said they used eye protection.",
      "High levels of the virus have been found in the milk of infected cows, increasing the risk of exposure and infection, researchers said.",
      "Researchers said that efforts to monitor dairy workers for illness have been hindered by several barriers including the reluctance of farm owners and farmworkers to allow testing.",
      "Rasmussen and others have criticized the federal response to the outbreak as too slow and \u201clackluster.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese studies should have been performed months ago and should have been prioritized,\u201d she said.",
      "The virus has been confirmed in at least 446 cattle herds in 15 states. Last week, the Agriculture Department said a pig at an Oregon farm was confirmed to have bird flu, the first time the virus was detected in U.S. swine.",

      "ALEXANDRIA, Va. -- A former health care worker who illegally accessed the health records of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg before she died was sentenced Thursday to two years in prison.",
      "Trent Russell, 34, of Bellevue, Nebraska, who worked at the time as a transplant coordinator for the Washington Regional Transplant Community and had access to hospital records all over the region, was convicted earlier this year of illegally accessing health care records and destroying or altering records at a jury trial.",
      "He was also charged with publishing that information on the internet in 2019, at a time when public speculation about Ginsburg's health and her ability to serve as a justice was a matter of public debate. Prosecutors said he posted the information along with a false claim that Ginsburg had already died. But the jury acquitted Russell on that count.",
      "Ginsburg served on the court until her death in 2020.",
      "Prosecutors said Russell disclosed the health records on forums that trafficked in antisemitic conspiracy theories, including conspiracy theories that Ginsburg was dead, but Russell's motivations for his actions were unclear. Indeed, Russell himself never admitted that he accessed the records, at one point suggesting that perhaps his cat walked across the keyboard in a way that mistakenly called up Ginsburg's data.",
      "Russell's excuses and refusal to accept responsibility prompted blistering critiques from prosecutors, who sought a 30-month sentence.",
      "\u201cHe offered completely implausible excuses with a straight face,\u201d prosecutor Zoe Bedell said.",
      "Russell's lawyer, Charles Burnham, sought a sentence of probation or home detention. He cited Russell's work saving lives as a transplant coordinator and his military record which included a deployment to Afghanistan as mitigating factors.",
      "\u201cMr. Russell has lived a quietly heroic life,\u201d Burnham wrote in court papers. He chalked up the criminal conduct to \u201cbeing stupid.\u201d",
      "U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff's 24-month sentence , calling his crime \u201ctruly despicable conduct.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou have made it extremely difficult to understand what motivated you,\u201d Nachmanoff said. He said Russell made matters worse by lying to investigators and on the witness stand.",
      "\u201cYou chose to blame your cat,\u201d Nachmanoff said.",
      "The court records in the case are carefully redacted to remove any reference to Ginsburg, but during the trial and at Thursday's sentencing hearing, all sides openly acknowledged that Ginsburg was the victim of the privacy breach.",
      "Her status as a public figure, in fact, prompted a debate about the severity of Russell's crime. Prosecutors said her high public profile, in addition to her age and illness, made her a particularly vulnerable victim.",
      "\u201cHe went with the Supreme Court justice who was old, who was sick, and whose sickness was a public concern,\u201d Bedell argued.",
      "Russell's lawyer, on the other hand, argued that Ginsburg's high office and the power that comes with it is the opposite of vulnerability.",
      "Nachmanoff, in issuing his sentence, said he took into account the fact that Russell has a sick step parent who might need care. The judge noted \u201cwith some irony\u201d that the details of the stepparent's health problems are under seal.",
      "\u201cWhy? Because it is sensitive health information \u2014 a benefit you did not provide to Justice Ginsburg,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "Anti-abortion advocates say they will quickly dismantle some of President Joe Biden's abortion policies once President-elect Donald Trump makes his return to the White House next year",
      "WASHINGTON -- Anti-abortion advocates say there is still work to be done to further restrict access to abortion when Republican Donald Trump returns to the White House next year.",
      "They point to the federal guidance that the administration of Democratic President Joe Biden released around emergency abortions, requiring that hospitals provide them for women whose health or life is at risk, and its easing of prescribing restrictions for abortion pills that have allowed women to order the medication online with the click of a button.",
      "\u201cNow the work begins to dismantle the pro-abortion policies of the Biden-Harris administration,\" the Susan B. Anthony List, the powerful anti-abortion lobby, said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s first-term pro-life accomplishments are the baseline for his second term.\u201d",
      "The group declined to release details about what, specifically, they will seek to undo. But abortion rights advocates are bracing for further abortion restrictions once Trump takes office. And some women are, too, with online abortion pill orders spiking in the days after Election Day.",
      "Trump has said abortion is an issue for the states, not the federal government. Yet, during the campaign, he pointedly noted that he appointed justices to the Supreme Court who were in the majority when striking down the national right to abortion. And there are things his administration can do, from picking judges to issuing regulations, to further an anti-abortion agenda.",
      "The Trump administration is expected to pull back Biden's controversial directive that requires emergency rooms to provide abortions when necessary to stabilize a woman's health or life. The Biden administration had argued that the decades-old federal law, which requires hospitals to provide stabilizing treatment for patients in exchange for Medicare funding, also applies in cases where an abortion might be needed.",
      "Reports of women being sent home or left untreated by hospitals in dangerous scenarios have proliferated across the United States since the Supreme Court overturned the national right to an abortion in 2022. In some cases, hospitals said state abortion bans had stopped them from terminating a pregnancy.",
      "\u201cWe're seeing the lives of pregnant people be put in jeopardy,\" Fatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women\u2019s Law Center, said Wednesday. \"We're seeing women who have become infertile, who have been subject to sepsis and we're now hearing reports with death.\"",
      "Even if a Trump administration abandons the guidance of the law, Goss Graves said advocacy groups like hers will continue a legal fight for the Biden administration's interpretation of the law.",
      "Some doctors and hospitals also have said the federal guidance offered a protection for them to perform emergency abortions in states like Idaho and Texas, where threat of prosecution for performing an abortion hangs over their decision-making.",
      "Trump has said he supports exceptions for rape and incest cases, as well as when a woman's life is at risk. But he has not gone as far as saying he supports exemptions when a woman's health is on the line.",
      "Abortions might be necessary to prevent organ loss, significant hemorrhage or dangerous infections for pregnant women in rare but serious scenarios. In cases like ectopic pregnancy, premature rupture of membranes and placental abruptions, a fetus might still be alive but continuing the pregnancy can be detrimental. Doctors have argued that the legal gray area has put them in a bind.",
      "In Idaho, for example, one hospital resorted to airlifting women out of the state after a strict abortion ban, which only allowed for abortions to prevent a woman's death, was enacted.",
      "The Biden administration sued Idaho, arguing its state law conflicted with federal law requiring hospitals to provide stabilizing treatment, which might include abortions, for patients. The state amended its law to allow abortions for ectopic pregnancies, but other dangerous scenarios still remain unaccounted for. The Supreme Court declined to address the issue earlier this year, issuing a limited order that cleared the way for hospitals to provide emergency abortions while the case worked its way through lower courts.",
      "Enforcement of the federal law, however, is on hold in Texas, which challenged the Biden administration's guidance on emergency abortions.",
      "A patchwork of state laws governing abortion will remain in place under the Trump administration. Voters in Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota on Tuesday defeated constitutional amendments, leaving bans in place.",
      "In Missouri, however, voters approved a ballot measure on Tuesday to undo one of the nation's strictest bans. Abortion rights amendments also passed in Arizona, Colorado, Maryland and Montana. Nevada voters also approved an amendment, but they\u2019ll need to pass it again in 2026 for it to take effect.",
      "The ease with which women have been able to get abortion pills could also be up for reconsideration under Trump.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Food and Drug Administration made it easier to obtain abortion pills, including mifepristone, allowing women to access the medication over telehealth. The agency has approved the drug's safety through 10 weeks of pregnancy, saying that adverse effects happen for .32% of patients.",
      "Anti-abortion advocates have challenged that, arguing the medications are not safe and at the very least not fit for eased access without in-person supervision by a doctor.",
      "Although the Supreme Court preserved access to the drug earlier this year, anti-abortion advocates and conservative states have renewed their challenge in lower courts.",
      "Some women are worried. Telehealth company Wisp saw an immediate spike in abortion pill orders between Election Day and the following day, with a 600% increase. In states like Florida and Texas, where the medication cannot be legally shipped, the company saw a nearly 1000% percent increase in orders of so-called \u201cmorning after\u201d pills, also known as emergency contraception.",
      "The company fills about tens of thousands of orders monthly for reproductive products including birth control pills and abortion pills, CEO Monica Cepak told the Associated Press.",
      "Right now women typically take a two-step regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol to complete a medication abortion. Cepak said the company will keep a \u201cclose eye\u201d on mifepristone under a Trump administration and is prepared to shift to a misoprostol-only regimen should restriction to mifepristone be implemented.",
      "But Trump could be a wild card on the issue, said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis who is an expert on reproductive health issues. In the final months of the campaign, he backed away from a more rigid stance on abortion \u2014 even saying he would not sign a national abortion ban if it came across his desk.",
      "Although he has enjoyed firm backing from anti-abortion groups, he is willing to break with allies when he wants.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think we have a clear sense from him about what he would do,\u201d Ziegler said.",

      "The story of \u201cKing,\u201d who doesn't disclose his real name, is similar to that of many vulnerable Brazilians in recent years",
      "SAO PAULO -- SAO PAULO (AP) \u2014 \u201cKing\u201d doesn\u2019t disclose his real name. Even clients of his Sao Paulo newsstand have to call him by his moniker. The Brazilian online sports gambling addict lowered his profile after a loan shark threatened to put bullets in his head if he didn\u2019t pay up.",
      "Broke and embarrassed, King sought treatment and support earlier this year.",
      "\u201cI was once addicted to slot machines, but then sports betting was so easy that I changed. I got carried away all the time,\" he told The Associated Press.",
      "King\u2019s story is that of many vulnerable Brazilians in recent years. The country has become the third-biggest market in the world for sports betting, following the U.S. and the U.K., a report by data analysis company Comscore said last year. But unlike those countries, rampant advertising and sponsorship have been coupled with an unregulated market. The government is now \u2014 belatedly, some say \u2014 striving to get a handle on the epidemic.",
      "On a recent evening, King's Gamblers Anonymous meeting took place in an improvised classroom inside a church, with coffee and cookies to keep everyone awake, and supportive messages scrawled onto the blackboard. One that's become ubiquitous in Brazil and beyond: \u201cOnly for today I will avoid the first bet.\u201d",
      "King and other attendees, all Christian, started a prayer and the meeting began.",
      "King said his financial problems arose from his addiction to online sports betting, chiefly on soccer.",
      "\u201cI miss the adrenaline rush when I don\u2019t bet,\" he said before the gathering. \"I have managed to stop for a couple of months, but I know that if I do it once again, even a small bet, it will all come back.\u201d",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic was a key driver for Brazilians embracing sports betting. King said he transformed almost every sale during that time into a bet. His hook was the non-stop advertising on TV, radio, social media as well as sponsorship of local soccer teams' jerseys. He asked for bank loans to pay his gambling debts and then, to cover those, went to the moneylender. His total debt now amounts to 85,000 reais ($15,000) \u2014 impossible to pay off with his monthly income of 8,000 reais.",
      "Digging oneself out of debt in Brazil is especially daunting with its sky-high interest rates. Loans from Brazilian banks could add interest of almost 8% per month to the borrowed sum, and from loan sharks could be even more.",
      "Four Gamblers Anonymous meetings attended by the AP in October featured discussions about difficulties paying down debts, forcing working-class members to postpone housing payments and cancel family vacations.",
      "Some members of impoverished Brazilian families have used welfare money for betting instead of paying for groceries and housing, official data suggests. In August, beneficiaries of Brazil\u2019s flagship program Bolsa Familia spent 3 billion reais ($530 million) on sports betting, according to a report from the central bank. That was more than 20% of the program\u2019s total outlay in the month.",
      "Sports betting was made legal in 2018 in a bill signed by former President Michel Temer. The subsequent turmoil has recently been setting off alarm bells, with addicts venting on social media and media reports of people losing huge sums.",
      "On Oct. 1, the economy ministry prevented more than 2,000 betting companies from operating in Brazil for having failed to provide all the required documents. Soccer-loving President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva said in an interview on Oct. 17 that he will shut down the entire market in Brazil if his administration\u2019s new regulations \u2014 presented at the end of July\u2014 fail to work. And Brazil\u2019s Senate on Oct. 25 opened an investigation into betting companies, focusing on crime and addiction.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s tax evasion, money laundering of organized crime, the use of influencers to trick people into betting. These companies need to be audited,\u201d Sen. Soraya Thronicke, who proposed the inquiry, told journalists in Brasilia.",
      "S\u00e9rgio Peixoto, a ride-sharing app driver in Rio, is one of many lower-middle-income Brazilians who have reduced their spending due to sports betting debt. Peixoto\u2019s debt currently amounts to 25,000 reais ($4,400). His monthly income is four times less than that.",
      "\u201cIt stopped being a game, it wasn\u2019t fun. I just wanted to get the money back, so I lost even more,\u201d said Peixoto, 26. \u201cI could have invested that money. It would surely have given me more benefits.",
      "Pressure on people to gamble is everywhere. Current and former soccer players, including Vinicius J\u00fanior, Ronaldo Naz\u00e1rio and Roberto Rivellino, are among the poster boys for local and foreign brands. All but one of the top-tier soccer clubs have betting companies among their main sponsors, with their name and logo emblazoned on their kits. There have been cases of kids and teenagers setting up accounts using their parents' personal information and money, multiple local media outlets have reported.",
      "Brazil's economy ministry estimates that Brazil's sports betting market had $21 billion in transactions last year, a 71% increase compared with the first year of the pandemic, 2020.",

      "De Sousa expressed hope that the new regulations for advertising, responsible gambling and qualification of sports betting companies will transform the country's deregulated arena into a more serious one that doesn't exploit the vulnerable.",

      "The nominee for the European Union's next top diplomat says the bloc must commit to Ukraine for the long-haul even as the war's costs mount",
      "BRUSSELS -- The European Union must back Ukraine against Russia for as a long as it takes and persuade the United States that its strategic interests in China are tied up in the outcome of the war, the woman nominated as the bloc\u2019s top diplomat for the next five years said Tuesday.",
      "Questions have been raised about whether the 27-nation EU\u2019s commitment to Ukraine would remain firm with Russia appearing to have an edge in the war, which began on Feb. 24, 2022, and following the reelection of Donald Trump, who has vowed to end the conflict as U.S. president.",
      "\u201cUkraine\u2019s victory is a priority for us all. The situation on the battlefield is very difficult,\u201d Estonia ex-Prime Minister Kaja Kallas told EU lawmakers during a hearing she must pass to be appointed as foreign policy chief.",
      "\u201cThat is why we must keep on working every day. Today, tomorrow and for as long as it takes and with as much military, financial and humanitarian aid as needed,\u201d she said, and added that \u201cthis must be underpinned by a clear path for Ukraine to join the European Union.\u201d",

      "\u201cWithout China\u2019s support to Russia, Russia would not be able to continue its war with the same force. China needs to also feel the higher cost,\u201d she said, suggesting that sanctions should be considered.",

      "But Kallas noted: \u201cIf (the) U.S is worried about China, or other actors, then they should also be worried about how we respond in Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine, because we see how Iran, North Korea, China, more covertly, and Russia are working together.\u201d",

      "Danish police are closing the investigation into the devastating fire that destroyed more than half of Copenhagen\u2019s Old Stock Exchange",
      "COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Danish police said Tuesday that they were closing the investigation into the devastating fire that destroyed more than half of Copenhagen\u2019s Old Stock Exchange, saying nothing points at the blaze being the result of a criminal act.",
      "Despite extensive forensic investigations, review of surveillance and the questioning of a large number of witnesses, \u201cit is not possible to determine the cause of the fire in the historic stock exchange building,\" said Brian Belling, the Copenhagen police officer in charge of the investigation.",
      "\u201cOur assessment is that we have explored all relevant investigative possibilities in the case,\u201d Belling told a press conference, adding that no one has been charged in the case.",
      "Belling said the video material included hours of footage from inside the Stock Exchange that had not been damaged by the fire. He added that no inflammable liquid has been found.",
      "In the early morning of April 16, a violent fire tore through the 400-year-old building, a major tourist attraction. The blaze toppled its green copper roof and iconic dragon-tail spire. Two days later, a large section of the building\u2019s outer wall collapsed inwards.",
      "As the fire raged, many, including ordinary people, ventured in to rescue artworks and around 90% of the cultural objects were rescued from the building.",
      "One of the hypotheses was that the fire started in connection with the renovation, Belling said.",
      "He said that the fire is believed to have started under the roof, which had been wrapped in scaffolding because of ongoing renovation work to be completed for its anniversary in 2024.",
      "\u201cThere is guidance regarding listed buildings when renovating them. It is our opinion that they have been followed to the letter,\u201d Tim Ole Simonsen, a senior member of the Greater Copenhagen Fire Department, told the same news conference. \u201cThen you can discuss whether they are good enough.\u201d",
      "On Sept. 24, King Frederik X of Denmark laid the \u201cfoundation stone\u201d within part of a red brick wall that survived the mid-April blaze, marking the commencing of a yearslong reconstruction plan.",
      "The owner of the downtown exchange, the Denmark\u2019s Chamber of Commerce, has said that they will rebuild the landmark, which is considered a leading example of Dutch Renaissance style in Denmark. Construction started in 1615 and it first opened in 1624.",
      "The fire was reminiscent of the April 2019 blaze at the 800-year-old Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris."

      "Russia had completed the ratification of the treaty last week after it was signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June. It is considered both countries\u2019 biggest defense deal since the end of the Cold War.",
      "The Comprehensive Strategic Partnership treaty will take effect when both sides exchange documents on the ratification, the state-run Korean Central News Agency said.",
      "North Korea ratified the treaty through a decree signed Monday by the country's president of state affairs, KCNA said, using one of Kim's titles.",
      "North Korea\u2019s rubber-stamp parliament, the Supreme People\u2019s Assembly, has the right to ratify treaties but Kim can unilaterally ratify major ones, according to South Korea\u2019s Unification Ministry.",
      "The treaty requires both countries to use all available means to provide immediate military assistance if either is attacked. It also calls for the two countries to actively cooperate in efforts to establish a \u201cjust and multipolar new world order\u201d and strengthen cooperation on various sectors including peaceful atomic energy, space, food supply, trade and economy.",
      "Some observers speculate the treaty\u2019s ratification in both countries could signal North Korea could formally enter the Russia-Ukraine war soon.",
      "According to U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian intelligence assessments, up to 12,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia likely as part of the June treaty. Last week, Ukrainian officials said Ukraine and North Korean troops engaged in small-scale fighting while Ukraine\u2019s army fired artillery at North Korean soldiers in Russia\u2019s Kursk border region.",
      "North Korea\u2019s troop dispatch threatens to escalate the almost three-year war. South Korea, the U.S. and their partners also worry about what Russia could give North Korea in return. Possible Russian transfer of sensitive technology to enhance North Korea\u2019s already-advancing nuclear and missile programs would be an alarming development for the U.S. and its allies.",
      "North Korea and Russia have been significantly strengthening their military and other cooperation. South Korea\u2019s spy agency said last month that North Korea had sent more than 13,000 containers of artillery, missiles and other conventional arms to Russia since August 2023 to replenish its dwindling weapons stockpiles.",

      "When the baby developed dark curls that made her look different from herself, Karen Rafteseth Dokken assumed she just took after her husband's mother.",
      "It took nearly six decades to discover the true reason: Rafteseth Dokken's biological daughter had been mistakenly switched at birth in the maternity ward of the hospital in central Norway.",
      "The girl she ended up raising, Mona, was not the baby she gave birth to.",
      "The babies \u2014 one born on Feb. 14 and the other on Feb. 15, 1965 \u2014 are now 59-year-old women who together with Rafteseth Dokken are suing the state and the municipality.",
      "In their case, which opened in the Oslo District Court on Monday, they argue that their human rights were violated when authorities discovered the error when the girls were teenagers and covered it up. They claim Norwegian authorities had undermined their right to a family life, a principle enshrined in the European human rights convention, and demand an apology and compensation.",
      "Rafteseth Dokken, now 78, was in tears as she described learning so many years later that she got the wrong baby, according to Norwegian broadcaster NRK.",
      "\u201cIt was never my thought that Mona was not my daughter,\" she said in court on Tuesday. \u201cShe was named Mona after my mother.\u201d",
      "Mona described a sense of never belonging as she grew up. That sense of uncertainty pushed her in 2021 to do a DNA test, which showed that she was not the biological daughter of those who raised her.",
      "But the woman who raised the other baby knew long before.",
      "A routine blood test in 1981 revealed that the girl she was raising, Linda Karin Risvik Gotaas, was not biologically related. The woman raising her, however, did not pursue a maternity case. Norwegian health authorities were informed of the mix-up in 1985, but refrained from telling the others involved.",
      "Both women who were swapped at birth have said in interviews that it was a shock to learn about the mix-up, but the knowledge made pieces of their lives fall into place, explaining differences both in terms of appearance and demeanor.",
      "Kristine Aarre Haanes, representing Mona, said the state \u201cviolated her right to her own identity for all these years. They kept it secret.\u201d",
      "Mona could have learned the truth when she was a young adult, but instead \"she did not find out the truth until she was 57.\u201d",
      "\u201cHer biological father has died. She has no contact with her biological mother,\u201d added Aarre Haanes.",
      "Circumstances surrounding the 1965 swap at Eggesboenes hospital are unclear, but media reports by NRK suggest there were several cases during the 1950s and 1960s where children were accidentally swapped at the same institution. At the time babies were kept together while their mothers rested in separate rooms.",
      "In other cases the errors were spotted before the children were permanently placed with the wrong families, according to the reports.",
      "An official from the Norwegian Ministry of Heath and Care Services said the state was unaware of similar cases and that there were no plans for a public inquiry.",
      "Asgeir Nygaard, representing the Norwegian state, is fighting the case on the grounds that the 1965 switch took place in a private institution and that the health directorate in the 1980s did not have the legal authority to inform the other families when they discovered the error.",
      "\u201cDocumentation from that time indicates that government officials found the assessments difficult, inter alia because it was legally unclear what they could do,\u201d he wrote in a statement to The Associated Press ahead of the trial's opening. \u201cTherefore, in court, we will argue that there is no basis for compensation and that the claims being made are in any case statute-barred.\u201d",

      "It was the first time in over a month that people in Beit Hanoun received any food assistance.",
      "The 11 other trucks didn\u2019t make it because of delays in receiving authorization and crowds along the route, Dujarric said.

      "QUITO, Ecuador -- A fight among inmates in Ecuador\u2019s largest and most dangerous prison left 15 dead and 14 wounded, authorities said Tuesday, in the bloodiest prison episode faced by President Daniel Noboa\u2019s government.",
      "Authorities attributed the outbreak to internal tensions among inmates, but offered no further details. The Litoral Penitentiary has a history of violent disturbances, most notably the 2021 massacre that claimed 119 lives.",
      "The latest violence underscores the ongoing challenges faced by the Noboa administration in addressing the country\u2019s severe prison crisis. In January, a series of coordinated riots across multiple prisons led to the hostage-taking of 150 prison guards, culminating in the tragic death of one official.",
      "Local media reported helicopters flew over the prison as ambulances and relatives of inmates, some of them shouting in desperation for loved ones, rushed to the gates.",

      "Ecuador's prisons have become among the deadliest in Latin America as overcrowding, corruption and weak state control have allowed gangs connected to drug traffickers in Colombia and Mexico to proliferate. Many are heavily armed with weapons smuggled in from the outside and continue to organize criminal activity from behind bars.",
      "The Litoral Penitentiary currently houses about 10,000 inmates \u2014 or double its capacity.",
      "Ecuador's Attorney General's office said that it is preparing to charge nine inmates with murder stemming from the violence.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Yemen's Houthi rebels targeted two U.S. Navy warships with multiple drones and missiles as they were traveling through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, but the attacks were not successful, the Defense Department said Tuesday.",
      "Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary, said the Iranian-backed Houthis launched at least eight drones, five anti-ship ballistic missiles and three anti-ship cruise missiles at the USS Stockdale and the USS Spruance, both Navy destroyers, on Monday. He said there was no damage and no one was injured.",
      "The incoming fires \u201cwere successfully engaged,\u201d Ryder said.",
      "The strait is a narrow waterway between the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, which typically sees $1 trillion in goods pass through it a year. The rebels have been targeting shipping through the strait for months over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and Israel's ground offensive in Lebanon.",
      "In response, U.S. and partnered forces have launched multiple rounds of coordinated airstrikes against Houthi launch sites and weapons storage sites, and the U.S. organized an international coalition to help provide protection to commercial vessels as they transited \u2014 but it has not stopped the Houthi attacks.",
      "The Houthis have insisted that the attacks will continue as long as the wars go on, and the assaults already have halved shipping through the region. Meanwhile, a U.N. panel of experts now alleges that the Houthis may be shaking down some shippers for about $180 million a month for safe passage through the area.",

      "No one was wounded on board in the blasts, and the ship was continuing on its journey, the UKMTO added.",
      "It wasn't immediately clear if the UKMTO report was directly linked to the attacks on the U.S. destroyers, but similar incidents of rebel fire coming near other ships have happened before.",
      "The Houthis have targeted more than 90 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October 2023. They seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign, which also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels as well.",
      "The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. to force an end to Israel\u2019s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran.",
      "The Houthis have shot down multiple American MQ-9 Reaper drones as well.",
      "The last Houthi maritime attack came Oct. 28 and targeted the Liberian-flagged bulk tanker Motaro. Before that, an Oct. 10 attack targeted the Liberian-flagged chemical tanker Olympic Spirit.",
      "It's unclear why the Houthis' attacks have dropped, though they have launched multiple missiles toward Israel as well. On Oct. 17, the U.S. military unleashed B-2 stealth bombers to target underground bunkers used by the rebels. U.S. airstrikes also have been targeting Houthi positions in recent days as well.",
      "Meanwhile, a report by U.N. experts from October says \u201cthe Houthis allegedly collected illegal fees from a few shipping agencies to allow their ships to sail through the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden without being attacked.\u201d It put the money generated a month at around $180 million, though it stressed it hadn't been able to corroborate the information provided by sources to the panel.",

      "\u201cBehind his always serious gaze, he concealed many facets: from boldness and dynamism in business competition to countless charitable initiatives, many of which he preferred to keep anonymous.\u201d",
      "In 1990, Vardinoyannis survived an assassination attempt by the November 17 far-left militant group, when a car containing explosives, smoke bombs and anti-tank rocket launchers was used to target his moving armored car. The group\u2019s members were eventually rounded up and convicted 13 years later for multiple and deadly attacks against politicians, U.S. officials, and local business leaders.",
      "Vardinoyannis\u2019 financial and political influence grew after he forged a partnership with Saudi Arabian oil giant Aramco in the mid-1990s, as Greece gained prosperity as a member of the European Union after decades of hardship and political instability.",
      "He maintained close ties with the Kennedy family, hosting the wedding in Greece of Rory Kennedy \u2013 daughter of Robert F. Kennedy \u2013 to the writer and documentary filmmaker Mark Bailey in 1999.",
      "Later in life, Vardinoyannis became closely involved in charity projects with his wife, who was a UNESCO goodwill ambassador and head of a children's cancer charity.",
      "They are survived by their five children. The funeral arrangements were not immediately known."

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has dusted off his golf clubs in an attempt to forge a bond with President-elect Donald Trump, an avid lover of the game.",
      "The presidential office said Tuesday that Yoon began practicing the game for the first time in eight years in preparation for a possible round of golf with Trump.",
      "Since his election, Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d approach has raised concerns it could negatively affect the U.S. defense commitment to South Korea and hurt the trade interests of the Northeast Asian country in various ways, including increased tariffs.",
      "Some experts say it\u2019s important to build a close personal friendship with Trump during the transition period before he formally takes office in January.",
      "\u201cMuch could depend on whether Yoon is able to strike up positive chemistry with Trump immediately during the transition and foster a close personal friendship to convince him to want to support and advance Seoul\u2019s interests,\u201d said Duyeon Kim, a senior analyst at the Center for a New American Security in Washington.",
      "Yoon and Trump discussed strengthening bilateral cooperation and agreed to hold an in-person meeting soon during a phone call on Thursday.

      "A senior presidential official, speaking on condition of anonymity in a background briefing, said that while he didn\u2019t know how hard Yoon practiced golf, training was necessary as \u201cour president also has to hit a ball properly to get conversations going on\u201d with Trump, who has \u201coutstanding\u201d golf skills.",

      "By day, Xing Long works in an office for a state-owned company in Changchun, an industrial city in the northeastern rust belt of China",
      "CHANGCHUN, China -- Crouch through the small metal door and walk down the dark tunnel, and even before you step into the abandoned air raid shelter, the air reverberates with pounding techno beats. Young Chinese holding booze and cigarettes shake and sway in a red-lit passageway, below a big screen rolling through quotations from Chairman Mao.",
      "This is an underground rave in China, part of a subculture growing in hidden corners of the nation\u2019s cities, even as its political and cultural mainstream grow increasingly controlled, staid and predictable.",
      "For Chinese ravers, these gatherings \u2014 often called \u201cye di,\u201d or \u201cwild dances\u201d \u2014 not only offer a rare space for unfettered fun, but signal resistance to the narrowly prescribed future a rigid society expects for them.",
      "By day, Xing Long works in the office of a state-owned company in Changchun, an industrial city in China's northeastern rust belt region.",
      "By night, he\u2019s a DJ and underground rave organizer, a side gig that offers an escape from the humdrum of reviewing corporate contracts.",
      "\u201cMy job cannot make me feel I fulfilled my values,\u201d he said. \u201cGoing to work is like executing a prewritten program.\u201d",
      "Chinese young people face intense pressure and high expectations from the society around them. In recent years, facing bleak economic prospects, Chinese youth culture has been swept by a series of viral slang terms to describe frustration and hopelessness: \u201c 996 \u201d \u2014 the brutal 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week work schedule many companies ask of employees. \u201cInvolution\u201d \u2014 an endless treadmill of pointless competition that fresh graduates face. \u201c Lying flat \u201d \u2014 the growing trend among young people of giving up all ambition and aiming to do as little as possible.",
      "Techno dance parties are an escape from all that for people like Xing. Every time he walks into a rave, the 31-year-old said, his brain \u201cjolts awake like a bang.\u201d",
      "Xing first learned about techno music from a documentary made by the American media company Vice.",
      "\u201cMy eyes brightened up when I heard it,\" he said. \"I should\u2019ve listened to this kind of music earlier.\u201d",
      "Xing began going to raves in Shenzhen, a southern city with a population of 17 million, but when he moved home in 2021 he realized no one else was organizing them.",
      "\u201cI want this city to have an underground techno music scene,\" he said. \"I want to listen to it myself, so I want to make it happen.\u201d",
      "Xing said that the underground techno scene fascinated him because it's \u201creal\u201d even if not perfect, bad, not in the right order, or broken.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a beautiful thing that was deliberately produced into a mold to present to the mainstream.\u201d",
      "In recent years, space for culture and creativity has been shrinking in China as the authorities have ramped up censorship of concerts, shows, and other cultural events. Comedians have been silenced after joking about topics considered politically sensitive. A growing number of independent bookstores and creative spaces have shut down under pressure, while state-sanctioned media promotes uplifting, often saccharine narratives.",
      "Yet underground raves are free from all those limitations because they sprout in gray zones. Hidden from public view, they skirt formal approval processes, neither supported nor suppressed by the state.",
      "Feng Zhe, 27, a rave organizer in Shenyang, a northeastern city about 400 miles from Beijing, said raves are about \u201crefusing to be disciplined by society.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is probably not how the world functions nowadays,\u201d he said, adding that societies want to make people follow their rules and be useful but \"underground culture is useless.\u201d",
      "\u201cMost people are going to be repressed,\" Feng said.",
      "But for most rave organizers, the real meaning of underground rave culture is simply having fun. Loong Wu, a 26-year-old art student, started organizing raves in 2021 during COVID-19 lockdowns out of boredom.",
      "\u201cMy original intention was just to break through the boredom,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you are truly enjoying it, you don\u2019t think about meanings.\u201d",
      "On one recent Saturday night, civil servants, students, an ex-firefighter, girls with dyed hair, and a man with a full face mask and goggles filed into a bar tucked behind a flower shop in downtown Changchun to attend one of Xing\u2019s raves.",
      "They danced to fast-paced industrial techno spun by Du Jizhe, a local part-time DJ who works in HR by day.",
      "He said it\u2019s the natural soundtrack of auto manufacturing cities like Changchun and Detroit, which prides itself on being the birthplace of techno. For Du, techno evokes childhood memories of the auto factory where his father worked.",
      "\u201cTechno is basically industrial noise like hammering and mechanical sounds,\u201d Du said \u201cThese noises exert a subtle influence on people\u2019s ears in industrial cities.\u201d",
      "Chen Xiangyu, a fashion student in an oversized black t-shirt with hair dyed blond, a black leather choker, a lip piercing, and smoky eye makeup, said raves are a pure release.",
      "\u201cThe first time I came, I thought to myself, I don\u2019t know anyone, no one knows me, so nobody\u2019s paying any attention to how I dance, so long as I\u2019m happy, it\u2019s all good,\" she said. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t care too much about what others think.\u201d",
      "Even at raves, illegal drugs are rarely seen in China, but promoters still face risks from authorities who have little patience for unapproved social gatherings.",
      "Advertisements promoting raves are often cryptic, with only a date, a DJ line-up, and the cost of admission. Sometimes, the location won\u2019t be revealed until an hour ahead of the party. Some organizers require guests to cover their phone\u2019s camera with a sticker.",
      "Loong Wu said her requirements for a rave spot were no CCTV cameras, no security, and no nearby residents. Even those aren't a guarantee \u2014 local police once busted one of her raves in an industrial port.",
      "\u201cIt was pathetic how few such places exist in the city,\u201d she said.",
      "Frustrated with how hard to find a good rave spot, she once organized a public party where she put her DJ equipment on a cart and pushed it through city streets as revelers danced alongside.",
      "\u201cRestrictions exist for sure, but that\u2019s exactly why we need to create our own scene,\u201d she said. \u201cWe always need \u2018wild dances.\u2019 We always need to dance outside of set rules.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Biden administration said Tuesday that Israel has made some good but limited progress in increasing the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza and will not limit arms transfers to Israel as it had threatened to a month ago if the situation had not improved. Relief groups say conditions are worse than at any point in the 13-month-old war.",

      "In an Oct. 13 letter, the U.S. gave Israel 30 days, among other things, to allow a minimum of 350 truckloads of goods into Gaza each day; open a fifth crossing; allow people in coastal tent camps to move inland before the winter; and ensure access for aid groups to northern Gaza. It also called on Israel to halt legislation that would hinder operations of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA.",

      "The crash Monday night in Zhuhai killed 35 people and severely injured 43 others, and the driver was detained as he was trying to escape. Authorities said the 62-year-old man with the surname Fan was upset over his divorce settlement.",
      "Members of the public had started bringing flowers in honor of the victims Tuesday night and continued into Wednesday.",
      "There was a light police presence in the morning at the Zhuhai sports complex, which was closed until further notice, but the number of officers increased as the morning passed.",
      "While police allowed people to leave bouquets of flowers in memory of the dead just outside the entrance of the sports complex, volunteers then quickly moved the flowers inside to the sports center.",
      "\u201cMay there be no thugs in heaven,\u201d said the message on one bouquet. \u201cGood deeds will be rewarded and evil deeds will be punished.\u201d",
      "The attack on occurred on the eve of the Zhuhai Airshow, an aviation exhibition sponsored by the People's Liberation Army that is held every two years.",
      "China authorities often make extra efforts to tightly control information around major or sensitive events like the airshow. Censors also take extra care around major catastrophes or violence, often censoring eyewitness accounts. Clear information on the death and injury toll was not available for almost 24 hours after the attack.",
      "Videos were quickly censored inside China, though they circulated outside the Great Firewall. They were posted by Teacher Li, an artist turned dissident who runs a X account with 1.7 million followers that posts crowdsourced videos about news in China.",
      "Articles from Chinese media featuring interviews with survivors were quickly taken down Monday and Tuesday. The news that trended about the attack was largely based on official statements from authorities.",
      "Police said their preliminary investigation found Fan was dissatisfied with the split of financial assets in his divorce. Beyond that description, further information was not available on his divorce or alleged motive.",
      "Chinese leader Xi Jinping called for the \u201cstrict\u201d punishment of the perpetrator according to law, in a statement Tuesday evening.",
      "He also called on all local governments \u201cto strengthen prevention and control of risks at the source, strictly prevent extreme cases from occurring, and to resolve conflicts and disputes in a timely manner,\u201d according to the official Xinhua news agency.",

      "LONDON -- Details of a proposed law to legalize assisted dying in England and Wales have been published, rekindling debate on the controversial topic ahead of a vote in Parliament later this month.",
      "The draft bill, published Monday, proposes allowing terminally ill adults expected to have less than six months to live to ask for and be provided with help to end their own life, subject to safeguards and protections.",
      "Opponents have voiced concerns that the bill would mean people could become pressured to end their lives.",
      "But Labour lawmaker Kim Leadbeater, who proposed the bill, said the law has robust safeguards built into it and contains \u201cthree layers of scrutiny\" \u2014 two doctors and a High Court judge will have to sign off on any decision.",
      "A debate and first vote on the bill is expected to take place on Nov. 29.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Tuesday he will study the details of the bill and \u201cwill not be putting pressure on any MP (Member of Parliament) to vote one way or the other.\u201d",
      "Here's a look at what's in the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill and the next steps:",
      "Under the draft legislation, only those over 18-years-old in England and Wales and who are expected to die within six months can request assisted dying.",
      "They must have the mental capacity to make a choice about the end of their life and will be required to make two separate declarations about their wish to die. Two independent doctors have to be satisfied the person is eligible and a High Court judge will need to approve the decision.",
      "Anyone found guilty of pressuring, coercing or dishonestly getting someone to make a declaration that they wish to die will face up to 14 years in prison.",
      "Assisted suicide is currently banned in most parts of the U.K. It is not a specific criminal offense in Scotland, but assisting the death of someone can result in a criminal charge.",
      "The patient must self-administer the life-ending medication themselves. No doctor or anyone else can give the medication.",
      "No health professional is under any obligation to provide assistance to the patient.",
      "Doctors who do take part would have to be satisfied the person making their declaration to die has made it voluntarily. They also must ensure the person is making an informed choice.",
      "The bill will be debated in Parliament and lawmakers will be able to vote on it according to their conscience, rather than along party lines.",
      "Opinion among lawmakers appears to be divided, though some senior ministers including Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said he intended to vote against the bill. Starmer has previously supported assisted dying, but the government says it will remain neutral on the issue.",
      "If the bill passes the first stage in the House of Commons, it will face further scrutiny and votes in both Houses of Parliament. Leadbeater suggested that any new law is unlikely to come into effect within the next two to three years.",
      "One argument supporting the bill is that wealthy individuals can travel to Switzerland, which allows foreigners to go there to legally end their lives, while others have to face possible prosecution for helping their loves ones to die.",
      "Other countries that have legalized assisted suicide include Australia, Belgium, Canada and parts of the United States, with regulations on who is eligible varying by jurisdiction.",
      "Assisted suicide is different to euthanasia, allowed in the Netherlands and Canada, which involves healthcare practitioners killing patients with a lethal injection at their request and in specific circumstances."

      "TALLINN, Estonia -- A doctor accused of criticizing the war in Ukraine in front of a patient was convicted Tuesday of spreading false information about the Russian military and sentenced to 5 1/2 years in prison, part of an unrelenting Kremlin crackdown on dissent.",
      "Dr. Nadezhda Buyanova, 68, was arrested in February after Anastasia Akinshina, the mother of one of her patients, reported the pediatrician to authorities. Akinshina alleged that Buyanova told her and her son that his father, a Russian soldier who apparently was killed in Ukraine, was a legitimate target for Kyiv\u2019s troops and had blamed Moscow for the war.",
      "A video of the outraged Akinshina complaining about Buyanova was widely publicized, and chief of Russia\u2019s Investigative Committee Alexander Bastrykin personally demanded a criminal case be brought against the doctor.",
      "Buyanova, who was born in western Ukraine, denied the accusation, insisting she never said what she was accused of saying. In a tearful closing statement to the court last week, she had urged it to acquit her.",
      "Her defense argued the prosecution failed to present evidence that the purported conversation took place, including any recordings of it, and alleged that her accuser fabricated the story out of animosity toward Ukrainians, according to the independent news site Mediazona, which reported all of the hearings in the trial.",
      "In her closing statement to the court, Buyanova said it was \u201cpainful\u201d to read the accusations in the indictment, and broke down.",
      "\u201cA doctor, especially a pediatrician, is not capable of wishing harm to a child, his mother, or traumatizing the child\u2019s psyche. Only a monster is capable of this -- and of the words that I allegedly said to them,\u201d Mediazona quoted her as saying.",

    "story": [
      "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has survived a runoff vote against the opposition but will face turmoil ahead amid anger over the ruling party\u2019s financial scandals",
      "TOKYO -- Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, battered in parliamentary elections last month, has survived a rare runoff vote against the opposition to remain the country's leader but he still faces turmoil ahead.",
      "One of his top priorities is dealing with the aftermath of a major corruption scandal in the long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party, in which dozens of lawmakers from the party are alleged to have pocketed profits from event ticket sales as kickbacks.",
      "Ishiba also now has a much-emboldened opposition eager to push through policies long stymied by the LDP. Support ratings for his Cabinet have fallen to about 30%.",
      "Here is a look at what's happening in Japan's tumultuous politics, and what it might mean for Ishiba and his government as they prepare to navigate a second term of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "A parliamentary vote for a new leader is mandatory within 30 days of a general election. In the past that was mostly ignored as the head of the LDP usually enjoyed a majority in the Lower House, the more powerful of Japan\u2019s two-chamber parliament.",
      "This time, though, because Ishiba's LDP and its junior coalition partner lost its majority in the recent election, the runoff on Monday couldn't be avoided \u2014 the first in 30 years.",
      "Opposition's top leader, Yoshihiko Noda, has noted that nearly half of all lower house steering committees are now headed by the opposition. That\u2019s a huge change from the pre-election domination of the LDP, which controlled all but three of the 27 committees.",
      "\u201cWe are going to have a new landscape in Japanese politics,\u201d Noda said.",
      "Twelve of the committees in key areas, including budget, political reforms, national security and legal affairs, will be headed by Noda\u2019s Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan and two other main opposition groups.",
      "What's certain is that the era of LDP\u2019s one-sided rule is over, for now, and the opposition has a chance to achieve policies long opposed by the ruling conservatives, including on issues like gender equality and diversity.",
      "Noda said last Friday that a legal committee now headed by his party\u2019s gender equality chief, Chinami Nishimura, is aiming to achieve a civil code revision to allow married couples the option of keeping separate surnames. That change has been stalled by LDP conservatives for 30 years, despite widespread support by the public and a United Nations panel on discrimination against women.",
      "Yuichiro Tamaki is head of the conservative Democratic Party for the People, which quadrupled its seats to 28 in the election. The vote elevated his party from a fringe group to a major player.",
      "He is now being cast as a potential key to Ishiba\u2019s survival.",
      "A Harvard-educated former Finance Ministry bureaucrat, the 55-year-old Tamaki has seen success by pushing for the raising of a basic tax-free income allowance and an increase of take-home wages. His messages on social media have appealed to younger voters, who have long been ignored by LDP policies catering to conservative elderly.",
      "Ishiba apparently seems to find Tamaki\u2019s 28-member DPP an attractive partner to secure a majority. The two parties, which have common ground in some areas \u2014 including support for greater nuclear energy use and a stronger military \u2014 have started policy talks.",
      "Ishiba met with both Tamaki and Noda on Monday but Tamaki may be cautious about moving too close to a scandal-plagued LDP ahead of another election next year. Noda is struggling to form a unified opposition to force a change of government, which he says is his next goal.",
      "For Ishiba, the \u201chung parliament\u201d requires him to win over opposition forces so he can push his policies. While considered unstable, it might also provide a chance for a more consensus-based policy making process, experts say.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m taking the current situation positively as a chance to get our opposition voice heard more carefully,\u201d Tamaki said.",
      "Ishiba also faces challenges of restoring unity in his own party. A number of senior LDP lawmakers are waiting to overthrow Ishiba, though their priority is to resolidify their footholds, not infighting \u2014 and nobody is eager to do damage control at this difficult time anyway.",
      "\u201cThe (Ishiba) administration is quite unstable. ... He will have to get opposition parties' cooperation every time he wants to get a bill approved, which could stall policies,\u201d said University of Tokyo political science professor Yu Uchiyama.",
      "And even if Ishiba survives politically in the coming months, there could be a call for his replacement ahead of next elections.",
      "\u201cJapan is likely to return to a period of short-lived government,\u201d Uchiyama said.",
      "Ishiba congratulated Trump hours after his victory and in a brief telephone conversation, they agreed to closely work together to further elevate their alliance.",
      "While experts say Trump understands the importance of U.S.-Japan relations, he may \u2014 as he did in his first administration \u2014 pressure Japan to pay more for the cost of 50,000 U.S. troops in Japan or to buy more expensive American weapons.",
      "Trump's possible tariff proposals could also hurt Japanese exporters.",
      "Ishiba on Saturday renewed his pledge to pursue an ongoing military buildup plan under a strategy that calls for a counter-strike capability with long-range cruise-missiles. He has long advocated a more equal Japan-U.S. security alliance but could face difficulty pursuing those plans.",
      "\u201dIt will be a fantastic experiment to see if a national unity government can get Japan through until the next election,\u201d said Michael Cucek, an expert in Japanese politics at Temple University in Japan.",

      "Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, head of the Church of England and spiritual leader of the global Anglican Communion, resigned Tuesday after an investigation found he failed to tell police about serial physical and sexual abuse by a volunteer at ...",
      "LONDON -- Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, head of the Church of England and spiritual leader of the global Anglican Communion, resigned Tuesday after an investigation found that he failed to tell police about serial physical and sexual abuse by a volunteer at Christian summer camps as soon as he became aware of it.",
      "Pressure on Welby had been building since Thursday, when the archbishop\u2019s refusal to accept responsibility for his failure to report the abuse in England and in Africa in 2013 kindled anger about a lack of accountability at the highest reaches of the church. By Tuesday afternoon, Welby acknowledged that mistake.",
      "\u201cIt is very clear that I must take personal and institutional responsibility for the long and retraumatizing period between 2013 and 2024,\u201d Welby said in the statement announcing his resignation. \u201cI believe that stepping aside is in the best interests of the Church of England, which I dearly love and which I have been honored to serve.\u201d",
      "Welby\u2019s resignation will send ripples around the world. The Archbishop of Canterbury is the symbolic head of the Anglican Communion, which has more than 85 million members in 165 countries, including the Episcopal Church in the United States. While each national church has its own leaders, the Archbishop of Canterbury is considered first among equals.",
      "Welby, a former oil executive who left the industry in 1989 to study for the priesthood, was a controversial figure even before the scandal. A skilled mediator who has worked to resolve conflicts in Nigeria and elsewhere in Africa, he struggled to unite the Anglican Communion, which has been riven by sharply divergent views on issues such as gay rights and the place of women in the church.",
      "The Church of England on Thursday released the results of an independent investigation into the late John Smyth, a prominent attorney who the report said sexually, psychologically and physically abused about 30 boys and young men in the United Kingdom and 85 in Africa from the 1970s until his death in 2018.",
      "The 251-page report of the Makin Review concluded that Welby failed to report Smyth to authorities when he was informed of the abuse in August 2013, soon after he became Archbishop of Canterbury. Had he done so, Smyth could have been stopped sooner and many victims could have been spared the abuse, the inquiry found.",
      "Welby said he didn\u2019t inform law enforcement agencies about the abuse because he was wrongly told that police were already investigating. Even so, he took responsibility for not ensuring that the allegations were pursued as \u201cenergetically\u201d as they should have been.",
      "As late as Monday, Welby\u2019s office said he had decided not to resign, even as he expressed his \u201chorror at the scale of John Smyth\u2019s egregious abuse.\u201d",
      "Helen-Ann Hartley, the bishop of Newcastle, said Welby\u2019s position had become \u201cuntenable\u201d after some members of the General Synod, the Church of England\u2019s national assembly, started a petition calling on him to step down because he had \u201clost the confidence of his clergy.\u201d",
      "But the strongest outcry came from Smyth\u2019s victims. Andrew Morse, who was repeatedly beaten by Smyth over five years, said resigning was a chance for Welby to start repairing the damage caused by the church\u2019s broader handling of historical abuse cases.",
      "\u201cI believe that now is an opportunity for him to resign,\u2019\u2019 Morse told the BBC before Welby stepped down.",
      "Welby\u2019s resignation comes against the backdrop of widespread historical sexual abuse in the Church of England. A 2022 report by the Independent Inquiry Child Sexual Abuse found that deference to the authority of priests, taboos surrounding the discussion of sexuality and a culture that gave more support to alleged perpetrators than their victims helped make the Church of England \u201ca place where abusers could hide.\u201d",
      "Welby\u2019s supporters had argued that he should remain on the job because of his role in changing the culture of the church.",
      "Church officials were first made aware of Smyth\u2019s abuse in 1982, when they received the results of an internal investigation into complaints about his behavior at Christian summer camps in England. The recipients of that report \u201cparticipated in an active cover-up\u201d to prevent its findings from coming to light, the Makin Review found.",
      "Smyth moved to Zimbabwe in 1984 and later relocated to South Africa. He abused boys and young men in Zimbabwe, and there is evidence that the abuse continued in South Africa until he died in August 2018, the investigation found.",
      "Smyth\u2019s actions weren't made public until a 2017 investigation by Britain\u2019s Channel 4 television station, which led police in Hampshire to start an investigation. Police were planning to question Smyth at the time of his death and had been preparing to extradite him.",
      "Stephen Cherry, dean of the chapel at King\u2019s College Cambridge, said Welby could no longer represent the people.",
      "\u201cThere are circumstances in which something happens whereby a person in a position of prominent leadership essentially loses the trust and the confidence and the capacity to do that really wonderful thing that someone like an archbishop does, which is represent everyone at a certain moment publicly,\u2019\u2019 Cherry told the BBC before Welby resigned.",
      "\u201cAnd the pain in the victim community and the history of not listening to people and not responding to people who are profoundly hurt by those in positions of power means that this is no longer a person who can carry the representative role of that office.\u201d",

      "BERLIN -- German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is expected to ask for a vote of confidence in his government on Dec. 16, paving the way for a new parliamentary election as early as February, German media reported Tuesday.",
      "The expected vote in the Bundestag would come well ahead of original plans, marking a step to reach compromise between Scholz's party, the Social Democrats, and the main opposition party in parliament, the center-right Christian conservatives.",
      "The move comes after the collapse of Scholz\u2019s three-party coalition last week, at a time when the leaders of Europe's biggest economy have been grappling with ways to revive Germany's anemic economic growth.",
      "Experts predict the economy will shrink or at best stagnate this year, due to external shocks and homegrown problems including red tape and a shortage of skilled labor.",
      "Scholz had previously announced that he would seek a vote of confidence on Jan. 15 that could lead to an election as soon as March. The vote had otherwise been due next September.",
      "On Tuesday, Scholz told public broadcaster ARD that it was \u201cno problem\u201d for him to call for the confidence vote before Christmas, and that he would respect any agreement by his fellow Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats.",
      "A final decision on the exact date for the election \u2014 possibly Feb. 16 or Feb. 23 \u2014 would rest with German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.",
      "Scholz announced that he would lead Germany with a minority government after his move last week to fire Finance Minister Christian Lindner of the pro-business Free Democrats, ending its role in the coalition.",
      "Left with the environmentalist Greens in his coalition, Scholz expressed hope to win support of the Christian Democrats, led by Friedrich Merz, to pass important legislation and plug the billion-euro hole in the 2025 budget.",
      "Merz vehemently rejected Scholz\u2019s initial plan to wait until January to hold the confidence vote. If the government doesn't win the vote of confidence, which has seemed increasingly likely, Steinmeier can dissolve the Bundestag within 21 days and call a new election."

      "Methane is a climate \u201csuper pollutant\u201d that is far more potent in the short term than carbon dioxide and is responsible for about one-third of greenhouse gas emissions. The oil and natural gas sector is the largest industrial source of methane emissions in the United States, and advocates say reduction of methane emissions is a crucial way to slow climate change.",
      "The rule, announced at an international climate conference in Azerbaijan, comes a day after President-elect Donald Trump named former New York congressman Lee Zeldin to head the agency in Trump's second term. If confirmed by the Senate, Zeldin is expected to move to reverse or loosen dozens of environmental regulations approved under President Joe Biden as Trump seeks to establish U.S. \u201cenergy dominance\u2033 worldwide.",
      "Trump is likely to target the methane fee amid a flurry of expected actions he has promised to deregulate the oil and gas industry.",
      "As outlined by the EPA, excess methane produced in 2024 could result in a fee of $900 per ton, with fees rising to $1,200 per ton in 2025 and $1,500 per ton by 2026. Industry groups are likely to challenge the rule, including any effort to impose a retroactive fee.",
      "The rule will not become final until early next year, following publication in the Federal Register.",
      "EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement that the rule will work in tandem with a new EPA rule on methane emissions imposed this year. The rule targets the U.S. oil and natural gas industry for its role in global warming as Biden seeks to secure his legacy on fighting climate change.",
      "The fee, formally known as the Waste Emissions Charge, will encourage early deployment of available technologies to reduce methane emissions and other harmful air pollutants, Regan said. The fee \"is the latest in a series of actions under President Biden\u2019s methane strategy to improve efficiency in the oil and gas sector, support American jobs, protect clean air and reinforce U.S. leadership on the global stage,\u201d he said.",
      "Industry groups and Republican-led states have challenged the earlier methane rule in court, but lost a bid for the Supreme Court to block the rule while the case continues before lower-level judges.",
      "Opponents argue that EPA overstepped its authority and set unattainable standards with the new regulations. The EPA, though, said the rules are squarely within its legal responsibilities and would protect the public.",
      "Many large oil and gas companies already meet or exceed methane-performance levels set by Congress under the climate law, meaning they are unlikely to be forced to pay the new fee, Regan and other officials said.",
      "Even so, EPA estimates that the rule will result in cumulative emissions reductions of 1.2 million metric tons of methane (34 million metric tons of carbon-dioxide equivalent) through 2035. That figure is similar to clean-air gains from taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year, the EPA said. Cumulative climate benefits could total as much $2 billion, the agency said.",
      "Like the earlier methane rule, the new fee faces a near-certain challenge from industry groups. The American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry\u2019s largest lobbying group, said the fee \u201champers our ability to meet the growing energy needs of American families and businesses and fails to advance meaningful emissions reduction.\"",
      "API senior vice president Dustin Meyer said the group looks forward to working with the Trump administration and the new Congress to repeal the fee and \u201cget this right.\"",
      "Environmental groups hailed the new fee, saying oil and gas companies should be held accountable for pollution that contributes to global warming. Oil and gas companies routinely calculate that it\u2019s cheaper to waste methane through flaring and other techniques than to make necessary upgrades to prevent leaks, they said.",
      "\u201cWhile we expect the next administration to recklessly greenlight fossil fuel extraction, it\u2019s heartening to see this effort to make polluters pay for their leakage of the super climate pollutant methane,\u201d said Maggie Coulter, a lawyer at the Center for Biological Diversity, an advocacy group.",
      "\u201cUltimately, we know that curbing the climate emergency requires moving quickly away from fossil fuel extraction,\" Coulter said. \u201cThe oil and gas companies doing so much damage to our climate should have to pay for the methane leaks they\u2019ve so outrageously failed to fix.\u201d"

      "NEW YORK -- Wall Street is already making big bets on what take two for a White House led by Donald Trump will mean for the economy.",
      "Since Election Day, investors have sent prices zooming for stocks of banks, fossil-fuel producers and other companies expected to benefit from Trump\u2019s preference for lower tax rates and lighter regulation. For retailers, meanwhile, the outlook is murkier because of uncertainty about whether they\u2019ll be able to absorb any of the higher costs created by tariffs.",
      "Professional investors are warning about the risk of getting carried away by the momentum. While strong rhetoric on the campaign trail can cause these big swings, not all of the promises turn into actual policy. Plus, the broad U.S. stock market tends to move more on long-term growth in profits than anything else.",
      "\u2014 Stan Choe",
      "Here's a look at where Wall Street is placing its bets at the moment:",
      "Technology stocks soared in Trump\u2019s first term, helped by the administration\u2019s tax policies. But the relationship was tempestuous: Trump\u2019s immigration stance threatened a source of high-skilled immigrants that comprises a significant part of the industry\u2019s work force and his trade wars threatened international sales and supply chains.",
      "This time around, tech could benefit from an anticipated loosening of antitrust regulation that discouraged big deals from getting done and threatened to rein in the power of Google, Apple and Amazon. What\u2019s more, Trump is expected to clear the way for Big Tech to make more inroads in artificial intelligence technology \u2014 an area increasingly seen as a crucial battleground in the duel for global power between the U.S. and China.",
      "Trump\u2019s vow to impose tariffs and other restrictions on trade does pose a potential downside for chip makers, particularly stock market darling Nvidia. A possible rollback of Biden administration efforts to boost U.S. semiconductor production also is a concern.",
      "Still, in a sign of tech\u2019s more conciliatory attitude, Trump\u2019s election was greeted by congratulatory posts from most of the industry\u2019s luminaries, including Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy and Google CEO Sundar Pichai.",
      "\u2014 Michael Liedtke",
      "Trump\u2019s victory brings a big dose of uncertainty for the retail industry.",
      "Trump has proposed extending 2017 tax cuts for individuals and restoring tax breaks for businesses that were being reduced. He also wants to further cut the corporate tax rate. Those would be tailwinds for shoppers and businesses, analysts said.",
      "But the president-elect\u2019s trade proposals could have a huge downside. He\u2019s proposed 60% tariffs on Chinese goods and tariffs of 10% to 20% on other imports. Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, a research firm, said retailers would either take a big hit on profits or be forced to increase prices.",
      "As opposed to Trump\u2019s first term, retailers will have a harder time absorbing tariffs this time because their costs of doing business are already higher, Saunders said.",
      "Many companies, including Nike and eyewear retailer Warby Parker, have been diversifying their sourcing away from China. Shoe brand Steve Madden says it plans to cut imports from China by as much as 45% next year.",
      "The National Retail Federation is forecasting higher prices for U.S. shoppers if Trump\u2019s new tariffs are implemented. For example, an $80 pair of men\u2019s jeans would cost $90 to $96.",
      "\u2014 Anne D'Innocenzio",
      "Trump has said he wants to \u201cdrill, drill, drill\u201d starting on Day 1 of his presidency, so it\u2019s expected that traditional fossil fuel-focused companies will get a boost and renewable energy outfits could be disadvantaged.",
      "Oilfield services companies including Haliburton and Schlumberger would likely benefit from initiatives to expand drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska. Natural gas companies including EQT and CNX Resources could benefit from facilities and pipeline projects. Meanwhile, clean energy companies, such as First Solar and many electric vehicle makers, could have a harder time growing if Trump cuts tax credits and other incentives for the industry.",
      "But remember Trump\u2019s first term, says Austin Pickle, investment strategy analyst at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. The thought back then, like now, was that Trump would boost prices for oil-and-gas stocks. But energy stocks ended up struggling late in his term when the price of oil briefly went below zero during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u2014 Damian Troise",
      "Drugmakers, insurers and other health care companies could benefit from fewer regulatory roadblocks to mergers and a lighter regulatory stance overall.",
      "Insurers, in particular, may see some regulatory relief for Medicare Advantage plans, which are privately run versions of the government\u2019s Medicare program mainly for people ages 65 and older. Under Democratic leadership, some insurers were facing smaller bonus payments tied to their Medicare Advantage plans. Some drugmakers are facing revenue hits on certain drugs covered by Medicare. Those challenges could abate under Republican rule, analysts at Morningstar noted.",
      "A second Trump administration also may challenge health care companies.",
      "The approval of drugs and vaccines could become less predictable, depending on the role anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plays, said Morningstar analyst Karen Andersen.",
      "Health insurers that sell coverage on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s insurance marketplaces or manage state-and-federally funded Medicaid coverage could face challenges if Republicans attempt to dismantle parts of the law, said Julie Utterback of Morningstar.",
      "In particular, extra subsidies that help people buy marketplace coverage are slated to expire at the end of next year, which could lead to enrollment drops.",
      "\u2014 Tom Murphy",
      "The auto industry is another that should welcome less restrictive regulations but dread tariffs.",
      "Trump is likely to roll back or scrap tailpipe emissions limits for 2027 through 2032 imposed by the Biden administration. Companies like General Motors, Ford and Stellantis could more easily sell larger, less-efficient vehicles without paying hefty fines.",
      "Companies would also face less pressure to sell more electric vehicles to offset emissions from big trucks and SUVs, which make big profit margins, said Kevin Tynan, research director for The Presidio Group.",
      "Tariffs are a different story. Trump has threatened tariffs on imported vehicles to force more production in the U.S. The threat of 100% tariffs on vehicles imported from Mexico is a big concern.",
      "Morningstar analyst David Whiston said such tariffs could potentially cost General Motors, Stellantis and Ford billions in profits. About 30% of GM\u2019s North American production comes from Mexico, while it\u2019s 24% for Stellantis and about 15% for Ford.",
      "Whiston notes that tariffs on vehicles built in Mexico would violate the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement negotiated during Trump\u2019s first term. But that can be reworked in July of 2026. Whiston said those tariffs would mean higher prices and many buyers already can\u2019t afford the current average price of over $47,000.",
      "Trump also has threatened to get rid of electric vehicle tax credits that have helped boost sales of EVs.",
      "\u2014 Tom Krisher",
      "Bank stocks could benefit if Trump's policies boost the U.S. economy and more customers apply for loans. In addition, Wells Fargo banking analyst Mike Mayo believes the Trump victory can usher in a \u201cnew era\u201d of lighter financial regulation after 15 years of stricter oversight following the financial crisis of 2008-2009. Under Biden, banks were facing requirements to set aside more capital to reduce risk, but the Trump administration is likely to take a step back.",
      "Dealmaking could see a revival under Trump, which would help banks with large investment banking operations like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. That also increases the odds the pending merger between Capital One Financial and Discover Financial gets federal clearance. Regional banks should benefit if a growing economy prompts the creation of new small businesses or the expansion of existing ones.",
      "\u2014 Paul Harloff",
      "Construction companies are looking at a mixed bag, with lighter regulations a plus but higher materials costs a potential minus.",
      "Construction companies, including homebuilders KB Home and PulteGroup, could benefit from tax incentives and more friendly regulations. A surge in development could help relieve some pressure on a housing market pressured by a lack of supply for new homes. A boost in construction could also help suppliers of raw materials including steel and aggregates used in concrete.",
      "But the potential for overall raw material price increases is a threat. Higher costs could cut into profits for construction companies and homebuilders. Steel tariffs could help shield U.S. producers from competition, but a jump in global prices as a result could negate that benefit, while also squeezing construction companies.",
      "Plans for an immigration crackdown could worsen an existing labor shortage and result in delays for projects.",
      "\u2014 Damian Troise",
      "Trump, once a crypto skeptic, has pledged to make the U.S. \u201cthe crypto capital of the planet\u201d and create a \u201cstrategic reserve\u201d of bitcoin.

      "Crypto industry players welcomed Trump\u2019s victory, in hopes that he would push through legislative and regulatory changes that they\u2019ve long lobbied for. And Trump had promised that, if elected, he would remove the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, who has been leading the U.S. government\u2019s crackdown on the crypto industry and repeatedly called for more oversight.",

      "BANGKOK -- A hacking group that is believed to be Chinese state-sponsored has compromised two websites with ties to the Tibetan community in an attack meant to install malware on users' computers, according to findings released Wednesday by a private cybersecurity firm.",
      "The hack of the Tibet Post and Gyudmed Tantric University websites appears geared toward obtaining access to the computers of people visiting to obtain information on them and their activities, according to the analysis by the Insikt Group, the threat research division of the Massachusetts-based cybersecurity consultancy Recorded Future.",
      "The hackers, known in the report as TAG-112, compromised the websites so that visitors are prompted to download a malicious executable file disguised as a security certificate, Insikt Group said. Once opened, the file loads Cobalt Strike Beacon malware on the user's computer that can be used for key logging, file transferring and other purposes, including deploying additional malware.",
      "\u201cWhile we do not have visibility into the activity that TAG-112 conducted on compromised devices in this campaign, given their likely cyber espionage remit and the targeting of the Tibetan community, it is almost certain that they were engaged in information collection and/or surveillance rather than destructive attacks,\u201d Insikt Group senior director Jon Condra told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cThis behavior aligns with historical targeting of the Tibetan community,\u201d he said.",
      "Chinese authorities have consistently denied any form of state-sponsored hacking, saying China itself is a major target of cyberattacks.",

      "\u201cChina's stance on the issue of cybersecurity is consistent and clear,\u201d the ministry said in a faxed reply to a request for comment without elaborating.",
      "According to the Insikt group research, the sites were first compromised in late May and the attacks bear many overlaps with a previously tracked hacker group known as TAG-102, leading analysts to conclude it is a subgroup of the already known group \u201cworking toward the same or similar intelligence requirements,\u201d Insikt Group said.",
      "Overlaps include reuse of specific tactics, techniques and procedures and going after identical targets, Condra said.",
      "\u201cThese two threat clusters are almost certainly interrelated,\u201d he said.",
      "TAG-102, known by multiple names such as Evasive Panda and StormBamboo, has been in operation since as early as 2012, and is widely thought to be a Chinese-sponsored advanced persistent threat, or APT, group, Insikt Group said.",
      "Among other things, it uses custom malware frameworks used by other Chinese APT groups and its targeting \u201caligns with likely Chinese intelligence requirements,\u201d Condra said.",
      "\u201cThe group has engaged in a wide variety of campaigns over the years, with an emphasis on targeting individuals and organizations in opposition to the Chinese government, such as human rights organizations, religious organizations, ethnic minority groups, academic institutions, and supporters of democracy or independence movements in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and even in mainland China,\u201d Insikt Group said.",
      "The university and the news website, which are both located in India, have been informed by Insikt Group of the hack. As of this week, it appears the Gyudmed Tantric University, which is a place of learning about Tibetan Buddhism, language, history and culture, has remediated the problem while the news website remained compromised, Condra said.",

      "Just as in 2016, the last time that Peru\u2019s capital Lima hosted APEC, Donald Trump\u2019s election victory has pulled the rug out from under a lame-duck Democrat at the high-profile summit attended by over a dozen world leaders.",
      "The renewed prospect of Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d doctrine hampers Biden\u2019s ability to reinforce the United States\u2019 profile on his first presidential trip to South America, experts say, leaving China and its leader, Xi Jinping, to grab the limelight in America\u2019s proverbial backyard.",
      "President Xi\u2019s first order of business in Peru is inaugurating a $1.3 billion megaport that will put China\u2019s regional influence on stark display. Total investment is expected to top $3.5 billion over the next decade.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t the way the U.S. had hoped to participate in the summit,\u201d said Margaret Myers, the director of the China and Latin America program at the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington policy group. \u201cAll eyes are going to be on the port, what Xi says about it and how he articulates relations across the Pacific.\u201d",
      "With the U.S. seemingly headed back toward isolationism under Trump, \u201cChina will be seen as the alternative,\u201d Myers added.",
      "Sitting 60 kilometers (37 miles) northeast of Lima, the Chancay megaport \u2014 once a serene fishing village \u2014 is perhaps the clearest sign of Latin America's reorientation. The Chinese shipping and logistics giant Cosco holds a 60% stake in the project it developed with Peruvian partner, Volcan.",
      "\u201cWith this port, we\u2019re looking at the entire Pacific coast, from the United States and Canada all the way to Chile,\u201d Peruvian Foreign Minister Elmer Schialer told The Associated Press in his office on Monday. \u201cThe shipping business is being transformed.\u201d",

Most of the region's exports came from South America, and were concentrated in five products: soybeans, copper and iron ore, oil and copper cathodes.",
      "At the same time, China\u2019s diplomatic engagement in the region has become more effective, with Xi visiting 11 Latin American countries since becoming president, according to Xinhua, China\u2019s main state news agency. Brazil, host of the G20 summit, and Peru will bestow the rare honor of a full state visit to Xi this month, but not to Biden.",

      "\u201cThe idea that China is somehow a better partner is increasingly being heard around the region and I think Xi wants to solidify that and amplify that,\u201d Farnsworth said.",
      "Roughly a decade after China poured billions of dollars into building power plants, roads, airports and other infrastructure that saddled some developing countries with unserviceable debt, few expect Beijing to direct more massive loans to Latin America through its Belt and Road Initiative. But deeper cooperation on other infrastructure is possible, particularly renewable energy and telecommunications, said the Boston University bulletin.",
      "The U.S. has appealed to Latin American governments to reject telecoms investment, particularly opposing Huawei, the Chinese tech giant that it argues could open the door to Chinese government spying. Similarly, U.S. officials have raised concerns over the Chancay port\u2019s possible dual-use by Beijing\u2019s navy in the Pacific \u2014 a prospect dismissed by Chinese officials.",
      "China \u201cis working to exploit insecurity in our hemisphere,\u201d said U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin at the Southern Command headquarters in Florida this week, adding that the Asian giant is leveraging the need for investment in the Americas to advance its \u201cmalign agenda.\u201d",
      "Despite its objections to Chinese influence, the U.S. hasn\u2019t shown the ability or willingness to build infrastructure like Chancay's megaport, experts note.",

      "A Kamala Harris administration wouldn\u2019t have changed that, but a Democratic victory would have enabled Biden to speak in Lima with authority about U.S. collaboration to come, such as building regional supply chains, Gedan said.",
      "In sharp contrast to Biden\u2019s alliance-building approach, Trump has vowed to protect American interests and promised more of the same unilateralist action the world saw in his first term, when he staked out a combative stance against foreign competitors and deepened the U.S. trade war with China.",
      "In 2022, Biden launched the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework to help integrate economies of the region and enable the U.S. to counterbalance China. But last year, on the campaign trail, Trump said he would kill the trade pact if he were to win the 2024 election and return to the White House \u2014 in the same way he pulled the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership immediately after taking office in 2017.",
      "In the years since, U.S. clout in South America has diminished while China\u2019s has grown, said Farnsworth, recalling how the last time Lima hosted APEC in 2016, the shock of Trump\u2019s victory sucked the energy out of then-President Barack Obama\u2019s delegation.",
      "Peru\u2019s top diplomat insists that the U.S. hasn\u2019t ceded its dominant voice guiding discussions about trade at gatherings such as APEC \u2014 and doubted that it will, even under Trump.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure that Trump will go against these types of multilateral contexts just because he is worried about the American people,\u201d Schialer said. \u201cHe knows that the U.S. is too important for the world. We have to sit down and have a nice dialogue and see how we can face these challenges together.\u201d",
      "Yet, in the wake of Trump\u2019s win and China\u2019s port opening in Peru, analysts expect the hard-nosed competition between the U.S. and China to overshadow APEC this week.",
      "\u201cThe Chinese love the idea of outmaneuvering the U.S. in its near-abroad,\u201d Gedan said. \u201cXi will luxuriate in this dynamic of being able to arrive with a big delegation, (...) to inaugurate this transformational port and suck all the air out of the room when his American counterpart is very weak politically. That is significant to China.\u201d",

    "summary": "After a tumultuous year filled with anxiety and a legal fight about its future in the U.S., TikTok may have just been thrown a lifeline by the man who was once its biggest foe",

      "After a tumultuous year filled with anxiety and a legal fight about its future in the U.S., TikTok may have just been thrown a lifeline by the man who was once its biggest foe",
      "After a tumultuous year filled with anxiety and a legal battle about its future in the U.S., TikTok may have just been thrown a lifeline by the man who was once its biggest foe: Donald Trump.",
      "President-elect Trump, who tried to ban the social media platform the last time he was in the White House, has repeatedly pledged during his most recent campaign to oppose a ban on the short-form video app, which could happen as soon as mid-January if the company loses a court case that\u2019s currently underway in Washington.",
      "For months, TikTok, and its China-based parent company ByteDance, have been embroiled in a legal battle with the U.S. over a federal law that forces them to cut ties for national security reasons or stop operating in one of their biggest markets in the world. The measure, signed by President Joe Biden in April, gives ByteDance nine months to divest its stakes, with a possible three-month extension if a sale was in progress. If that happens, the deadline could be extended into the first 100 days of Trump\u2019s presidency.",
      "The companies have claimed that divestiture is not possible, and the law, if upheld, would force them to shut down by Jan. 19, just a day before Trump\u2019s second inauguration. Attorneys for both sides have asked a federal appeals court reviewing the case to issue a ruling by Dec. 6. The losing side is expected to appeal to the Supreme Court, which has a conservative majority and could decide to take up the case, potentially dragging out the process even longer.",
      "When reached for comment, the Trump transition team did not offer details on how Trump plans to carry out his pledge to \u201csave TikTok,\u201d as he said on a Truth Social post in September while encouraging people who care about the platform to vote for him. But Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for the transition team, indicated in a statement that he plans to see it through.",
      "\ufeff\u201cThe American people re-elected President Trump by a resounding margin giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cHe will deliver.\u201d",
      "During a March interview with CNBC, Trump said he still believed TikTok posed a national security risk but opposed banning it because doing so would help its rival, Facebook, which he has continued to lambast over his 2020 election loss. He also denied changing his mind on the issue because of Republican megadonor Jeff Yass, a ByteDance investor that Trump, at the time, said that he had only met \u201cvery briefly.\u201d He said Yass \u201cnever mentioned TikTok\u201d during their meeting.",
      "Still, ByteDance \u2013 and groups connected to Yass \u2013 have been attempting to exert their influence. Lobbying disclosure reports show that this year, ByteDance paid veteran lobbyist and former Trump campaign aide David Urban $150,000 to lobby lawmakers in Washington in favor of TikTok. The company has also spent more than $8 million on in-house lobbyists and another $1.4 million on other lobbying firms, according to Open Secrets.",
      "Meanwhile, in March, Politico reported Kellyanne Conway, a former senior Trump aide, was being paid by the Yass-funded conservative group Club for Growth to advocate for TikTok in Congress. A spokesperson for the organization said Conway was hired as a consultant to conduct polling. Conway and Urban did not respond to requests for comment. TikTok, which has long denied it\u2019s a national security risk, declined to comment.",
      "If the courts uphold the law, it would fall on Trump\u2019s Justice Department to enforce it and punish any potential violations with fines. The fines would apply to app stores that would be prohibited from offering TikTok, and internet hosting services who would be barred from supporting it. Leah Plunkett, a lecturer at Harvard Law School, said from her reading of the statute, the attorney general has to investigate violations but can decide whether or not to drag such companies to court and force them to comply.",
      "Trump could do other things to prevent TikTok from disappearing.",
      "He could issue an executive order to nullify the ban \u2014 which Plunkett believes would not be lawful \u2014 or urge Congress to repeal the law. That would require support from Congressional Republicans who have aligned themselves with Trump but have also supported the prospects of getting TikTok out of the hands of a Chinese company.",
      "In a statement sent to the AP after the election, Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on China, said Trump\u2019s \u201clong-standing concerns\u201d about TikTok align with the law\u2019s requirement for divestment.",
      "\u201cThe Trump Administration will have a unique opportunity to broker an American takeover of the platform,\u201d he said.",
      "ByteDance, though, has previously said it has no intention to sell the platform despite interest from some investors, including Trump\u2019s former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Analysts say the company is even less likely to sell the proprietary algorithm that fuels what users see on the app. That means even if TikTok is sold to a qualified buyer, it is likely to be a shell of its current self and would need to be rebuilt with new technology.",
      "Sarah Kreps, director of Cornell University\u2019s Tech Policy Institute, said it\u2019s also possible that Trump could take the issue back to the drawing board and direct his administration to negotiate a new deal with TikTok.",
      "TikTok said in 2022, it presented the Biden administration with a draft agreement that would bolster protections for users and provide it more oversight over the company\u2019s U.S. operations. But the administration has argued in court documents in recent months that it would be challenging to enforce the agreement due to the size and the technical complexity of the platform.",
      "Trump hasn\u2019t been privy to new intelligence material on the matter for a few years and it's possible he could change his mind - and abandon his campaign promise - once he does, Kreps said.",
      "Plunkett, the Harvard Law faculty and author of \u201cSharenthood: Why We Should Think before We Talk about Our Kids Online,\u201d said if she were counseling TikTok, she would advise them to come up with a divesture plan that is compliant with the law and as favorable to them as possible.",
      "\u201cThere is too much uncertainty about what a Trump administration is likely to do,\u201d she said."

      "\u201cWithout China\u2019s support to Russia, Russia would not be able to continue its war with the same force. China needs to also feel the higher cost,\u201d she said, suggesting that sanctions should be considered.",
      "Many EU leaders and representatives have long insisted that the bloc must wean itself off its security dependence on the United States, regardless of who is in power in Washington. The belief is that the U.S. is increasingly focused on its growing rivalry with China.",
      "But Kallas noted: \u201cIf (the) U.S is worried about China, or other actors, then they should also be worried about how we respond in Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine, because we see how Iran, North Korea, China, more covertly, and Russia are working together.\u201d",
      "The 47-year-old Estonian politician, who is set to take over the top EU post from Spain\u2019s Josep Borrell, played down concerns about Trump, saying: \u201cwe are not the ones who are electing the president for our partners. So we need to work with all the administrations.\u201d",
      "Kallas said that she has always met with U.S. representatives from both sides and has already been in contact with people close to Trump, notably Vice President-elect JD Vance."

    "summary": "A Dutch appeals court has overturned a landmark ruling that ordered energy company Shell to cut its carbon emissions by net 45% by 2030 compared to 2019 levels",
    "story": [
      "A Dutch appeals court has overturned a landmark ruling that ordered energy company Shell to cut its carbon emissions by net 45% by 2030 compared to 2019 levels",
      "THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- A Dutch appeals court on Tuesday overturned a landmark ruling that ordered energy company Shell to cut its carbon emissions by net 45% by 2030 compared to 2019 levels, while saying that \"protection against dangerous climate change is a human right.\u201d",
      "The decision was a defeat for the Dutch arm of Friends of the Earth and other environmental groups, which had hailed the original 2021 ruling as a victory for the climate. Tuesday's civil ruling can be appealed to the Dutch Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cThis hurts,\u201d Friends of the Earth director in the Netherlands Donald Pols said. \u201cAt the same time, we see that this case has ensured that major polluters are not immune and has further stimulated the debate about their responsibility in combating dangerous climate change. That is why we continue to tackle major polluters, such as Shell.\u201d",
      "Outside court, Pols said the fight against climate change \u201cis a marathon, not a sprint, and the race has just begun.\u201d",
      "The ruling upholding Shell\u2019s appeal came as a 12-day U.N. climate conference was entering its second day in Azerbaijan where countries are discussing how to fund cutting planet-warming emissions and adapt to ever-increasing weather extremes.",
      "It marked a stinging defeat for climate activists after several courtroom victories. A court in The Hague in 2015 ordered the government to cut emissions by at least 25% by the end of 2020 from benchmark 1990 levels. The Dutch Supreme Court upheld the ruling five years ago.",
      "Earlier this year, a U.N. tribunal on maritime law said that countries are legally required to reduce greenhouse gas pollution. The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea found that carbon emissions qualify as marine pollution and said that countries must take steps to mitigate and adapt to their adverse effects.",
      "And in April, Europe\u2019s highest human rights court ruled that countries must better protect their people from the consequences of climate change.",
      "In December the top U.N. legal body, the International Court of Justice, is holding public hearings on climate change after the world body requested a nonbinding advisory opinion on \u201cthe obligations of States in respect of climate change.\u201d Dozens of countries are set to present arguments at two weeks of hearings.",
      "In a written summary of Tuesday's ruling, the court said that Shell has a duty of care to limit its emissions, but it annulled the lower court's decision because it was \u201cunable to establish that the social standard of care entails an obligation for Shell to reduce its CO2 emissions by 45%, or some other percentage.",
      "\"There is currently insufficient consensus in climate science on a specific reduction percentage to which an individual company like Shell should adhere.\u201d",
      "Shell has emitted 36,528 million tons of carbon dioxide, or CO2, since 1854, which is 2.1% of global emissions, according to an April report by the Carbon Majors Database.",
      "Presiding Judge Carla Joustra said that Shell already has targets for climate-warming carbon emissions that are in line with demands of Friends of the Earth \u2014 both for what it directly produces and for emissions produced by energy the company purchase from others.",
      "The court then ruled that \u201cfor Shell to reduce CO2 emissions caused by buyers of Shell products ... by a particular percentage would be ineffective in this case. Shell could meet that obligation by ceasing to trade in the fuels it purchases from third parties. Other companies would then take over that trade.\u201d",
      "Joustra said that, \u201cThe court\u2019s final judgment is that Friends of the Earth's claims cannot be granted. The court therefore annuls the district court\u2019s judgment.\u201d",
      "Climate activists sitting outside on the courthouse steps hugged, and some appeared close to tears after the decision.",
      "\u201cTo be honest I was just really disappointed,\" Neele Boelens said. I was almost crying. I was in there in the court and it was just like... At first it looked really good for us but then it just went down hill.\"",
      "Shell, meanwhile, welcomed the ruling.",
      "\u201cWe are pleased with the court\u2019s decision, which we believe is the right one for the global energy transition, the Netherlands and our company,\u201d Shell plc Chief Executive Officer Wael Sawan said in a written statement. \u201cOur target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 remains at the heart of Shell\u2019s strategy and is transforming our business.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Justice Department is suing to block UnitedHealth Group\u2019s $3.3 billion purchase of Amedisys",
      "NEW YORK -- The Justice Department is suing to block UnitedHealth Group's $3.3 billion purchase of Amedisys, citing concerns the combination would hinder access to home health and hospice services in the U.S.",
      "The antitrust complaint, filed in Maryland by the Justice Department and four states' attorneys general Tuesday, argues that a potential merger is illegal because the two companies are \"such large competitors\" already \u2014 and the deal would give UnitedHealth too much control in many local markets.",
      "That would mean less choice for patients looking for affordable care, the suit alleges, as well as fewer employment options for nurses seeking competitive pay and benefits.",
      "\u201cAmerican healthcare is unwell,\" Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter of the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division, said in a prepared statement. \u201cUnless this $3.3 billion transaction is stopped, UnitedHealth Group will further extend its grip to home health and hospice care, threatening seniors, their families and nurses.\u201d",
      "Tuesday's lawsuit follows UnitedHealth's acquisition of LHC Group Inc., another home health and hospice provider. Since that transaction's completion last year, the Justice Department said, UnitedHealth and Amedisys have emerged as two of the largest providers of home health and hospice care in the country.",
      "The complaint alleges that UnitedHealth's plan to acquire Amedisys is the result of \"an intentional, sustained strategy of acquiring, rather than beating, competition.\u201d After completing the LHC acquisition, the suit says UnitedHealth prevented Amedisys' 2023 plans to merge with infusion provider OptionCare by paying a \u201cbreakup fee\u201d \u2014 and then separately made its own acquisition offer, which Amedisys eventually accepted.",
      "UnitedHealth is seeking to add Amedisys to Optum, its subsidiary that provides care as well as pharmacy and technology services. In a response Tuesday to the antitrust suit, Optum said the transaction \u201cwould be pro-competitive and further innovation.\u201d It said it plans to \u201cvigorously defend (itself) against the DOJ\u2019s overreaching interpretation of the antitrust laws.\u201d",
      "Amedisys added that it also remains committed to the deal, which it believes \u201cwill create more opportunities to deliver quality, compassionate and value-based care to patients and their families.\u201d",
      "In details about the deal published on Optum's website, the company maintained Optum and Amedisys \u201cwould operate just a fraction\" of all home health and hospice care markets nationwide when combined. Optum also noted plans to divest some of its care centers to home health provider VitalCaring upon the deal's completion. It said the divestments would aid competition but the Justice Department said that the proposal is inadequate.",
      "Beyond its Optum unit, UnitedHealth Group also runs one of the nation\u2019s largest health insurers, UnitedHealthcare. The Minnesota-based healthcare giant reported third-quarter net income of $6.06 billion on revenue of $100.82 billion.",
      "Louisiana-based Amedisys reported third-quarter earnings of $16.9 million and a revenue of $587.7 million for the period.",
      "Tuesday's lawsuit arrives in the final months of the Biden administration, which has been particularly aggressive in antitrust enforcement. In recent years, the Justice Department has also targeted companies accused of engaging in illegal monopolies and driving up prices across industries like entertainment, travel and tech.",
      "The four states\u2019 attorneys general joining Tuesday's suit against UnitedHealth and Amedisys are from Maryland, Illinois, New Jersey and New York."

      "Facebook and Instagram users in Europe will get the option to see less personalized ads if they don\u2019t want to pay for an ad-free subscription",
      "LONDON -- Facebook and Instagram users in Europe will get the option to see less personalized ads if they don't want to pay for an ad-free subscription, social media company Meta said Tuesday, bowing to pressure from Brussels over privacy and digital competition concerns.",
      "Meta Platforms has been offering European Union an ad-free subscription option for about a year to comply with the continent's strict data privacy rules, but regulators had accused the company of giving people a false choice.",
      "The company said in a blog post that while people will still be able to choose between the subscription and existing free versions, it would also start giving free users an extra option over the coming weeks to see digital ads that are less personalized.",
      "This means ads will be targeted at users based only on what they see during their current session on Facebook or Instagram going back no more than two hours, plus minimal personal information such as age, location, gender as well as how they engage with ads.",
      "Data from all of a user's previous time spent on Facebook or Instagram, which is typically combined to precisely target an individual with tailored ads, won't be used.",
      "\u201cWhile this new choice is designed to give people an additional control over their data and ad experience, it may result in ads that are less relevant to a person\u2019s interests,\u201d Meta said in a blog post. \u201cThat means people will see ads that they don\u2019t find as interesting. This drop in relevance is inevitable given that drastically reduced data is being used to show these less personalized ads to people.\u201d",
      "People who choose the new option will see ad breaks that can't be skipped for a few seconds, Meta said.",
      "European Union regulators had accused Meta of breaching the 27-nation bloc's digital rules when it gave user the option to pay a monthly fee to avoid being targeted by ads based on their personal data.",
      "The U.S. tech giant had rolled out the option after the European Union\u2019s top court ruled Meta must first get consent before showing ads to users, in a decision that threatened its business model of tailoring ads based on individual users\u2019 online interests and digital activity.",
      "The company also said Tuesday it's slashing monthly subscription prices for the ad-free option. Web users will pay 5.99 euros ($6.36), down from 9.99 euros previously, while iPhone and Android users will be charged 7.99 euros instead of 12.99 euros, which includes commissions charged by the Apple and Google mobile app stores.",
      "Meta's new subscription model could hit the company's lucrative digital ad business in one of its biggest markets. The company said it has already factored the new offering into its most recent business outlook and financial guidance.",
      "The options are available to users 18 and older in the EU\u2019s 27 member countries, plus Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein."

      "His death was announced by Motor Oil Hellas, the petroleum company Vardinoyannis transformed into one of Greece\u2019s largest corporations.",
      "Born on the island of Crete, the fifth of eight children, Vardinoyannis embodied the archetype of the Greek shipping magnate who became a powerbroker at the head of one of the country\u2019s most influential families.",

      "After years as an also-ran, the pastel-colored ponies were enshrined in the National Toy Hall of Fame on Tuesday, along with Transformers action figures and the Phase 10 card game.",
      "The honorees rose to the top in voting by a panel of experts and the public from among 12 finalists. This year's field included: the party game Apples to Apples, balloons, \u201cChoose Your Own Adventure\u201d gamebooks, Hess Toy Trucks, Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game, remote-controlled vehicles, Sequence, the stick horse and trampoline.",
      "\u201cThese are three very deserving toys that showcase the wide range of how people play,\u201d Christopher Bensch, vice president for collections and chief curator, said in a statement. \u201cBut for My Little Pony in particular, this year is extra validating. The beloved toy was a finalist seven times before finally crossing the finish line!\u201d",
      "Hasbro's mini-horses, distinguishable by different \u201ccutie marks\u201d on their haunches, were introduced in the 1980s and reintroduced in 2003, outselling even Barbie for several years.",
      "The collectibles were recognized for encouraging fantasy and storytelling \u2014 the kind of creative play the Hall of Fame demands of inductees \u2014 along with popularity over time.",
      "\u201cThe My Little Pony line has endured for decades because it combines several traditional forms of doll play with children\u2019s fascination with horses,\" said Michelle Parnett-Dwyer, curator of dolls and toys. \u201cThe variety of figures promotes collecting as a pastime, too.\u201d",
      "Phase 10 was introduced by inventor and entrepreneur Ken Johnson in 1982. Today, Mattel sells 2 million decks of the card game annually in 30 countries and more than 20 languages. That makes it one of the bestselling card games in the world, according to the Strong National Museum of Play in Rochester, where the Toy Hall of Fame is housed.",
      "In the style of rummy, the game challenges players to collect groups of cards to complete 10 phases in sequential order before their opponents.",
      "\"Whether played in its original form or in one of its variations, Phase 10 has become an iconic game title that continues to encourage multigenerational social and competitive play,\u201d said Mirek Stolee, the museum's curator of board games and puzzles.",
      "Transformers came along in the 1980s, when Hasbro bought the rights to several existing Japanese toy lines featuring transforming robots. They were first marketed with a cartoon and have since graduated to a series of live-action films. Social media sites allow for debates over which figures are must-haves, as well as demonstrations of the sometimes complex process of manipulating them from robot to vehicle or other alternate form.",
      "Regular new Transformers characters keep collectors coming back, Bensch said, \"but the toys are also popular because they are so suited to the ways kids play. The toy line feeds kids\u2019 imaginations and fantasy play.\u201d",
      "Anyone can nominate a toy for the Hall of Fame. Museum staff narrows the field to 12 finalists each year. Fans can cast votes online for their favorites and their results are counted alongside ballots from a national advisory committee of historians, educators and others with industry expertise."

      "The company introduced the two packaged meals \u2014 one starring pizza and the other a turkey, cheddar cheese and cracker plate \u2014 at the beginning of the 2023-2024 academic year. At the time, Kraft Heinz said the offerings were protein-enriched and contained reduced levels of saturated fat and sodium to meet the requirements of the national free and reduced-price school lunch program.",
      "Nutritionists and advocacy groups were not thrilled by the launch. The Center for Science in the Public Interest called having Lunchables in cafeterias \u201ca highly questionable move for school nutrition\u201d that might confuse families into thinking the versions sold at supermarkets were a healthy option.",
      "The drumbeat quickened in April, when Consumer Reports said its tests showed the school-approved Lunchables contained more sodium than the store varieties. The organization also reported that commercially available Lunchables had more lead compared to ready-made meals made several other companies.",
      "Consumer Reports petitioned the U.S. Department of Agriculture to ban Lunchables and similar processed meal kits from schools.",
      "In a statement, Pittsburgh-based Kraft Heinz attributed the decision to pull out of the market served by the National School Lunch Program to a lack of demand. The company described the business impact as \u201cnegligible,\u201d saying sales of the school-designed meals \u201cwere far less than 1% of overall Lunchables sales\u201d during the last academic year.",
      "\u201cLast year, we brought two NSLP compliant Lunchables options to schools that had increased protein. While many school administrators were excited to have these options, the demand did not meet our targets,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThis happens occasionally across our broad portfolio, especially as we explore new sales channels. Lunchables products are not available in schools this year and we hope to revisit at a future date.\u201d",

      "Port of Montreal\u2019s workers were locked out Sunday and workers in Vancouver on the Pacific Coast have been locked out since Nov. 4.",
      "\u201cThere is a limit to the economic self destruction that Canadians are prepared to accept,\u201d MacKinnon said. \u201cIn the face of economic self destruction there is an obligation to intervene. As minister of labor that responsibility falls to me.\u201d",
      "MacKinnon said $1.3 billion Canadian dollars ($930 million) of goods is affected every day. He said it was impacting supply chains, the economy and Canada's reputation as reliable trading partner.",
      "Business groups had been calling for government intervention to get the flow of goods moving again.",
      "The move to end the stoppages comes after the government stepped in to end halted operations at Canada\u2019s two main railways in August.",
      "MacKinnon says he hopes operations can be restored in a matter of days.",
      "The Maritime Employers Association locked out 1,200 longshore workers at the Port of Montreal on Sunday after workers voted to reject what employers called a final contract offer. The workers were seeking raises of 20% over four years.",
      "The job action came after port workers in British Columbia were locked out amid a labor dispute involving more than 700 longshore supervisors, resulting in a paralysis of container cargo traffic at terminals on the West Coast."

      "Los Angeles Lakers star Anthony Davis says he has recovered from being poked in the left eye by Toronto\u2019s Jakob Poeltl, and his latest eye injury still hasn\u2019t persuaded him to wear protective goggles",
      "EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- Anthony Davis says he has recovered from being poked in the left eye by Toronto's Jakob Poeltl, and his latest eye injury still hasn't persuaded him to wear protective goggles.",
      "The Los Angeles Lakers ' star big man said Tuesday that he will play Wednesday night against Memphis. Davis brushed off the potential impact of the injury, even though his left eye was noticeably discolored and red after practice at the Lakers' training complex.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll go about my day and do what I need to do,\u201d Davis said. \u201cNext up is getting more sleep.\u201d",
      "Davis said he has \u201cno idea\u201d if his latest injury is another corneal abrasion. He had that injury last March after getting poked in a game against Golden State but didn't miss any time.",
      "\u201cA couple of scratches in my eye,\u201d Davis said. \u201cAs far as the medical term and all that, I\u2019m not 100% sure, but I\u2019m cleared to play.\u201d",
      "Each time Davis gets poked in the face by opponents, the nine-time All-Star is asked whether he will consider wearing goggles or protective glasses like similarly dominant big men Kareem Abdul-Jabbar or Amare Stoudemire. Before the usual question was even completed Tuesday, Davis replied: \u201cNo.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to, and the doctor said I didn\u2019t have to,\u201d Davis said. \u201cNow if it gets to a point where doctor orders are to (wear goggles), then of course I will.\u201d",
      "Davis wore goggles for about three years as a blue-chip high school prospect. He tried wearing goggles again briefly during the Lakers' championship run in the Florida pandemic bubble in 2020 but quickly gave up.",
      "Davis got hurt midway through the third quarter against Toronto on Sunday night while making a sensational one-handed block of a dunk attempt by Poeltl, who accidentally clocked Davis in the face with his off hand. Davis didn't return to the game, but the Lakers still surged to a 123-103 victory over the Raptors.",
      "Davis is off to an outstanding start to the regular season, sparking early MVP talk for the 31-year-old. He is second in the NBA with 31.2 points per game, along with 10.4 rebounds, 2.8 assists and 2.0 blocks for the Lakers (6-4).",
      "Davis' backup is Jaxson Hayes, who had a season-high 12 points against Toronto. But the Lakers are thin at center in the continuing absence of Christian Wood, who had a recent setback in his recovery from left knee surgery.",
      "Lakers coach JJ Redick said Wood had soreness in his knee while returning to workouts in recent days. Wood has been sidelined for two months.",
      "\"We\u2019re going to scale him back,\u201d Redick said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have an update in about four weeks.\u201d",

      "The Cleveland Cavaliers have won their first 12 games and are off to the best start in the NBA",
      "Cleveland has won its first 12 games and is off to the best start in the league. There are 10 teams in the Western Conference with winning records. And somehow, only two teams in the Eastern Conference have winning records.",
      "There is a common denominator on both sides of the ledger: Everybody is hurt. At least it seems that way.",
      "Joel Embiid, Paul George and Tyrese Maxey have yet to play together for Philadelphia. Khris Middleton hasn\u2019t debuted this season for Milwaukee. Same goes for Kawhi Leonard with the Los Angeles Clippers. New Orleans \u2014 already without CJ McCollum and Dejounte Murray \u2014 is bracing for weeks without Zion Williamson, and the injury news got even worse Tuesday with the announcement that Jose Alvarado will be out for at least three weeks.",
      "Orlando will be missing Paolo Banchero for probably 10 more games, at minimum. Scottie Barnes is sidelined in Toronto. Phoenix's Kevin Durant, Memphis' Ja Morant and Miami's Jimmy Butler are all likely out for a week or two. And now Oklahoma City is facing months without Chet Holmgren, who missed what would have been his entire first season, then played every game last season, and now is out.",
      "\u201cOn one hand I know how to approach it, I know what to do, what not to do and how beautiful the other side is,\u201d Holmgren wrote on social media after getting hurt Sunday night. \u201cBut on the other hand I\u2019ve felt the frustration of this process, and the wear it puts on your mind.\u201d",
      "By any measure \u2014 also including the absence of San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich for medical reasons \u2014 the first three weeks of this season have not gone well on the NBA health front.",
      "Plenty of teams are depleted going into this week's start of the NBA Cup \u2014 the new name for what was called the In-Season Tournament a year ago when it debuted. Among Tuesday's tournament games on the colorful courts: Dallas at Golden State, in Klay Thompson's return to the Bay Area for the first time in anything other than a Warriors uniform.",
      "\u201cTo me, it's just another regular-season game in November,\u201d Thompson said, downplaying what certainly will be more than that.",
      "It'll mean plenty to the Warriors. \u201cWe've had homecomings before,\u201d Golden State star Stephen Curry said, \u201cbut nothing like this. ... He deserves the celebration and the welcome that he's going to get.\u201d",
      "For some teams \u2014 Philadelphia (2-7) and Milwaukee (2-8) among them \u2014 maybe the NBA Cup can be the springboard to a much-needed jump-start to the season. The 76ers are getting Embiid back, which obviously will help. The Bucks have Giannis Antetokounmpo but will open tournament play Tuesday against Toronto without Damian Lillard, added to the injury list Monday night because he's in concussion protocol.",
      "\u201cI think you\u2019ll see every team, no matter what their record is, I think people will take it way more serious,\u201d Bucks coach Doc Rivers said. \u201cFirst of all, I think they understand it now. I did a lot of interviews and I was with a few guys in Vegas who made it (last year for the tournament's final four) and didn\u2019t understand it. They didn\u2019t even know how they got there. Now, I think everybody kind of understands it.\u201d",
      "Teams are in a group of five, play the other four teams once, and the six group winners along with two wild-cards go to the quarterfinals. Win that, and you go to Las Vegas for the semifinals. Indiana made the final last year and it's more than reasonable to say the Pacers learned something from that experience that helped propel them to the East finals last spring.",
      "\u201cOur guys got a real taste of what the elevated stage is all about,\u201d Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said at the time.",
      "The Pacers entered Monday third in the East, but they lost James Wiseman and Isaiah Jackson to Achilles tendon tears early in the season, and now are without Aaron Nesmith and Andrew Nembhard.",
      "Nobody, it seems, is safe from the injury bug. Not even the Cavs, who have gotten off to their red-hot start with Max Strus out since the preseason with a sprained ankle.",
      "But they have more than endured, and other teams have found ways to get through being short-handed as well. Boston, for example, just played four games without Jaylen Brown; the defending NBA champions, to no one's surprise, are off to a 9-2 start. Other than the Celtics and Cavs, every team in the East starts play Tuesday at .500 or worse.",
      "The Magic haven't been the same without Banchero. It'll be a test for the Thunder to remain near the top of the West without Holmgren. Those coaches \u2014 Orlando's Jamahl Mosley and Oklahoma City's Mark Daigneault \u2014 see the absences of their young stars as opportunities for others to grow into evolved roles.",
      "But nobody wants to dig too deep a hole, either. It's early, but what happens now might be the difference for some teams when it's time to fight for seeding in April.",

      "Embiid hit the court to a rousing ovation from nearly 20,000 fans but failed to stir the Sixers out of their early season slumber that kept them anchored at the bottom of the Eastern Conference.",

      "Embiid, his season marred by injuries and suspension, wasted no time giving the Sixers a tantalizing glimpse of what could be \u2014 a dish to fellow oft-injured All-Star Paul George for a layup to open the game.",

      "The 412-page report released Tuesday by the City of St. Petersburg, which owns the building, found that the basic structure of the domed stadium \u201cdoes not appear to have been adversely affected\u201d by Hurricane Milton's winds, which shredded most of its fabric roof.",
      "\u201cThe primary structure is serviceable and capable of supporting a replacement tension membrane fabric roof,\u201d said the report by Hennessy Construction Services.",
      "Eighteen of the ballpark's 24 fabric panels failed when Milton roared ashore Oct. 9, the report found. There was also damage to interior parts of the Trop, as it's known for short, from rainwater and other storm-related causes. The ballpark opened in 1990 and has been the Rays' home since their inception in 1998.",
      "Tropicana Field is already scheduled to be demolished when a new, $1.3 billion ballpark is finished in time for the 2028 season. With unforeseen costs to the city and Pinellas County from two hurricanes \u2014 vast amounts of debris removal, damage to parks and infrastructure \u2014 two of the main financial sources for the new ballpark could reconsider those plans or decide not to repair the Trop at all.",
      "The St. Petersburg City Council will discuss the report at its Nov. 21 meeting.",
      "\u201cWe have so much need across the city,\u201d said council member Brandi Gabbard at a meeting last week. \u201cI love the Rays. I love Tropicana Field. It\u2019s not about not wanting to do this. It\u2019s about a balance of priorities.\u201d",
      "The council recently approved $6.5 million to clean up the ballpark and protect it from any further damage, including waterproofing areas such as the press box, seating sections and scoreboard.",
      "The city does have an insurance claim for the damage and repairs, but it includes a $22 million deductible and probably would only cover part of the overall costs. That means taxpayer dollars could have to be used.",
      "St. Petersburg Mayor Ken Welch said the city anticipates that insurance and Federal Emergency Management Agency funds will cover the bulk of repair expenses.",
      "\"We believe having our hometown team play in St. Petersburg as soon as possible is important for our community,\u201d Welch said in a statement.",
      "Matt Silverman, co-president of the Rays, said in a statement that the team \u201cwill continue to have discussions with the city about how to move forward.\u201d",
      "Since the ballpark under this damage and repair assessment would not be ready until the 2026 season, the Rays must find another place to play next year.",
      "Major League Baseball wants the Rays to remain in the area near their fanbase if at all possible, with several Tampa Bay-area spring training sites suggested. These include ballparks in Clearwater (Phillies), Tampa (Yankees), Dunedin (Blue Jays), Sarasota (Orioles), Lakeland (Tigers) and the Rays' own spring training home in Port Charlotte. Most of these locations host minor league teams during summer.",
      "The planned new Rays ballpark is part of a $6.5 billion project that will include affordable housing, a Black history museum, retail and office space, restaurants and bars. The project is known as the Historic Gas Plant District, which was once a thriving Black community displaced by construction of the ballpark and an interstate highway.",
      "One option would be to delay the project by a year to accommodate the Tropicana Field repairs.",
      "\u201cThe City plans to meet its obligations to ensure that the Rays can play in St. Pete, and the redevelopment of the Historic Gas Plant District and the construction of a new stadium move forward,\u201d Welch said.",

      "John Robinson has died at 89",
      "LOS ANGELES -- John Robinson, the veteran football coach who enjoyed many years of success at the University of Southern California and with the Los Angeles Rams, has died. He was 89.",
      "The Rams confirmed Robinson's death on Monday. He died in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, of complications from pneumonia, USC said in a release.",
      "Robinson is high on the short list of football coaches who enjoyed significant success in both the college and pro ranks. He went 104-35-4 at USC and 75-68 with the Rams, winning postseason games and contending for championships regularly with both teams. Robinson was particularly successful in bowl games, going 8-1 in the postseason with USC and UNLV.",
      "\u201cCoach Robinson was one of the greatest college coaches ever, and his love for USC and his love for the game of football was second to none,\u201d said Ronnie Lott, an All-American safety under Robinson at USC. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt that while playing for him, he gave us the ability to feel like we were larger than life. And his commitment to making sure that we had more than just football in our lives was so superior.\"",
      "Robinson was a member of the College Football Hall of Fame for his two successful tenures at USC. He also became the winningest coach in Rams history during his nine-year tenure with the NFL club. Sean McVay passed Robinson's career victories total only last month.",
      "Robinson coached at USC from 1976 to 1982 and again from 1993 to 1997. He never had a losing record at the school, and his Trojans won five conference titles and four Rose Bowls. Running backs Charles White (1979) and Marcus Allen (1981) won the Heisman Trophy while playing in Robinson's relentless rushing offenses.",
      "\u201cCoach Robinson was very demanding, but in a human way,\u201d said Paul McDonald, the quarterback of Robinson's superbly talented 1979 team at USC. \u201cHe had great interpersonal skills, and he knew how to connect with people. He made you want to play hard for him and to run through walls. You cared for him because he cared so much for you.\u201d",
      "Robinson moved to the Rams in 1983 and reached the playoffs in six of his first seven seasons, winning four playoff games and advancing to two NFC championship games.",
      "The Rams observed a moment of silence for Robinson at SoFi Stadium on Monday night before they faced the Miami Dolphins.",
      "Robinson spent six seasons coaching UNLV after his second USC tenure, also serving a stint as the Rebels' athletic director. He was most recently a senior consultant at LSU from 2019 to 2021 during the tenure of head coach Ed Orgeron.",
      "Robinson was born July 25, 1935, in Chicago, and he grew up in the Bay Area, attending prep school with close friend John Madden and graduating from high school in 1954. He played tight end on Oregon's 1958 Rose Bowl championship team before beginning his coaching career with the Ducks.",
      "Robinson became John McKay's offensive coordinator at USC in 1972, coaching the unbeaten 1972 consensus national championship team and the 1974 team that went 10-1-1. Robinson left the Trojans for one year to join Madden with the Oakland Raiders, but returned to USC in 1976 when McKay took over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.",
      "Robinson coached USC to seven outstanding seasons, winning the Pac-8 or Pac-10 titles and the Rose Bowl in three of his first four years in charge. His 1978 team was named national champions by the UPI coaches' poll, while Bear Bryant's Alabama won the AP title. He coached a long list of stars during his tenure, from White and Allen to Pro Football Hall of Famers Lott, Anthony Mu\u00f1oz and Bruce Matthews.",
      "Robinson kept winning in 1983 when he moved to the Rams, who played their home games in Anaheim, California. With an offense led by Eric Dickerson, Robinson's teams racked up six playoff appearances and lost to the eventual Super Bowl champions in two conference title games.",
      "Robinson's second tenure at USC included a fourth Rose Bowl victory, but the school dismissed him following the 1997 season.",
      "Robinson then coached UNLV from 1999-2004, taking over a program that had lost 16 games in a row. He got the Rebels to only the third bowl appearance in school history in just his second season, but Robinson stepped away after the 2004 season with a 28-42 record at the school. One of his more notable victories was a 23-5 win at No. 14 Wisconsin in 2003.",
      "\u201cFootball lost a legend today,\u201d UNLV director of athletics Erick Harper said. \u201cCoach Robinson was revered by his players, peers, fans and co-workers. He led a wonderful life on and off the football field at so many places, including here at UNLV as both a coach and administrator. Our thoughts and prayers go out to John\u2019s family as we remember all that he did for the sport nationally and right here in Las Vegas.\u201d",
      "Robinson spent many years between his coaching jobs in broadcasting on television and radio. He returned to football five years ago at LSU as a consultant to Orgeron, the former USC coach.",
      "Robinson is survived by his wife, Beverly, his four children, two stepchildren and 10 grandchildren.",
      "A celebration of Robinson\u2019s life will be held following the college football season, in accordance with his wishes.",

      "Notre Dame said in an email to The Associated Press on Tuesday that the family confirmed Faust's death. No details were immediately provided.",
      "Faust guided the Fighting Irish from 1981 through 1985, compiling a record of 30-26-1. He succeeded Dan Devine as coach of Notre Dame and preceded Lou Holtz.",

I didn\u2019t see any of it, so I don\u2019t know how bad it was,\u201d Shanahan said. \u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019m not too worried about. We\u2019ll fix it, if it hasn\u2019t been fixed already. We\u2019ll fix it on the plane and go back to loving each other (Monday).\u201d",

      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t on the player,\u201d Payton insisted. \u201cThis is on all of us. This is on us as coaches. We\u2019ve got to continue to look at, \u2018Hey, are we big enough stature-wise there for that?\u2019 And understanding how the rush was coming. It\u2019s disappointing, and yet it\u2019s not something that\u2019s new when a big play is made at the end of the game.\u201d",

      "The Broncos blew a big chance to gain a foothold in the AFC playoff race, but they are still in the seventh and final spot trying to fend off the Cincinnati Bengals and Indianapolis Colts, who are both 4-6 and both of whom have games down the stretch against Denver.",
      "\u201cThe sky is not falling,\u201d Payton said.",

      "\u201cHis prognosis is wonderful,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt just means we're not going to have him for the rest of the year.\u201d",
      "The decision comes a little more than a week after Prescott injured the hamstring in a 27-21 loss at Atlanta. He was on the sideline for Dallas\u2019 fourth consecutive loss, 34-6 at home to Philadelphia on Sunday.",
      "The Cowboys (3-6) already knew they would be without last season\u2019s runner-up in NFL MVP voting for at least a month, and were resigned to the outcome that was finalized after Prescott visited one more specialist.",

      "The Cowboys, who play Houston (6-4) at home Monday night, are in danger of missing the playoffs for the first time since 2020. The defending NFC East champions finished 12-5 in each of three consecutive playoff seasons.",
      "Prescott wasn\u2019t having a great year when he got hurt. He had 11 touchdowns and eight interceptions for an offense that was in the middle of the pack in the NFL after being among the league\u2019s best in the playoff years.",
      "Cooper Rush started in Prescott\u2019s place against the Eagles but had just 45 yards passing, the fewest for a Dallas starter in a game since Matt Cassel had 37 in another lost season for the Cowboys in 2015.",
      "Rush and Trey Lance, who briefly replaced Rush in the third quarter and came on for good later, combined for 66 passing yards. It\u2019s the fewest for Dallas since having 34 in a 10-6 loss to Tampa Bay in 2001.",
      "Rush will start again Monday night against the Texans. The Cowboys signed Will Grier to their practice squad Tuesday. Grier was with the Cowboys from 2021-22.",

      "According to the student-run newspaper, the claims include unwanted sexual advances on Instagram, requesting sexual favors and sending photos and videos of his genitalia. The newspaper based its report on a Title IX complaint filed against Golden on Sept. 27.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s personally getting me through this right now?\" Golden said. \"Respecting the situation, my family, my team, my coaching staff. We\u2019re just continuing to attack it like we normally would every day.\u201d",
      "Asked what he would say to female fans, Golden requested patience.",
      "\u201cObviously, in this situation, due process and to continue to support guys, and I just would hope that they would allow the process to take place and see where it ends up,\" he said.",
      "On more than one occasion, the paper said, Golden allegedly took photos of women walking or driving and sent those pictures to the subjects involved. Alleged stalking incidents also included Golden, a married father of two young boys, showing up to locations where he knew the women would be.",
      "\u201cAgain, I know what\u2019s going on. I know the situation,\" Golden said. \"Our staff\u2019s done a great job. Our guys have done a good job. We\u2019ve spent a lot of time together over the last couple days and continue to prepare for what we have in front of us, which was this game tonight and what will be Florida State on Friday.\u201d",
      "The Gators (3-0) responded with their best first half of the season against Grambling State (1-2). Five players scored in double figures, led by Rueben Chinyelu's career-tying 14 points. Golden said their performance was expected.",
      "\u201cI think they know who I am and, again, they\u2019re mature,\" Golden said. \u201cThey\u2019re all really good guys and all super focused. We had really good practices. We had a great shoot-around and I thought they were all really locked in. I felt like we were going to play really well.\"",

      "Waymo on Tuesday opened its robotaxi service to anyone who wants a ride around Los Angeles, marking another milestone in the evolution of self-driving car technology since the company began as a secret project at Google 15 years ago.",
      "The expansion comes eight months after Waymo began offering rides in Los Angeles to a limited group of passengers chosen from a waiting list that had ballooned to more than 300,000 people. Now, anyone with the Waymo One smartphone app will be able to request a ride around an 80-square-mile (129-square-kilometer) territory spanning the second largest U.S. city.",

      "Before deciding to compete against conventional ride-hailing pioneers Uber and Lyft in California, Waymo unleashed its robotaxis in Phoenix in 2020 and has been steadily extending the reach of its service in that Arizona city ever since.",
      "Driverless rides are proving to be more than just a novelty. Waymo says it now transports more than 150,000 weekly trips in its robotaxis, a volume of business numbers that helped the company recently raise $5.6 billion from its corporate parent Alphabet and a list of other investors that included venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and financial management firm T. Rowe Price.",
      "\u201cOur service has matured quickly and our riders are embracing the many benefits of fully autonomous driving,\" Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said in a blog post.",
      "Despite its inroads, Waymo is still believed to be losing money. Although Alphabet doesn't disclose Waymo's financial results, the robotaxi is a major part of an \u201cOther Bets\u201d division that had suffered an operating loss of $3.3 billion through the first nine months of this year, down from a setback of $4.2 billion at the same time last year.",
      "But Waymo has come a long way since Google began working on self-driving cars in 2009 as part of project \u201cChauffeur.\u201d Since its 2016 spinoff from Google, Waymo has established itself as the clear leader in a robotaxi industry that's getting more congested.",

      "Tesla's projected timeline for competing against Waymo has been met with skepticism because Musk has made unfulfilled promises about the company's self-driving car technology for nearly a decade.",
      "Meanwhile, Waymo's robotaxis have driven more than 20 million fully autonomous miles and provided more than 2 million rides to passengers without encountering a serious accident that resulted in its operations being sidelined.",
      "That safety record is a stark contrast to one of its early rivals, Cruise, a robotaxi service owned by General Motors. Cruise's California license was suspended last year after one of its driverless cars in San Francisco dragged a jaywalking pedestrian who had been struck by a different car driven by a human.",
      "Cruise is now trying to rebound by joining forces with Uber to make some of its services available next year in U.S. cities that still haven't been announced. But Waymo also has forged a similar alliance with Uber to dispatch its robotaxi in Atlanta and Austin, Texas next year.",
      "Another robotaxi service, Amazon's Zoox, is hoping to begin offering driverless rides to the general public in Las Vegas at some point next year before also launching in San Francisco."

      "Jones has said that he believes he could remain at the Infowars studios in Austin, Texas, and continue to use its online platforms if supporters win the bidding. But if opponents buy the assets, he said it could be shut down immediately. He said he has set up a new studio, new websites and new social media accounts in case the latter happens.",

He did not elaborate but said he would \u201cjust drive down the road\u201d and broadcast at another studio.",

      "It's not clear if the winning bidder or bidders will be announced Wednesday. The trustee in Jones' bankruptcy case has three business days to disclose that information to a federal court in Texas.",

      "The draft bill, published Monday, proposes allowing terminally ill adults expected to have less than six months to live to ask for and be provided with help to end their own life, subject to safeguards and protections.",
      "Opponents have voiced concerns that the bill would mean people could become pressured to end their lives.",
      "But Labour lawmaker Kim Leadbeater, who proposed the bill, said the law has robust safeguards built into it and contains \u201cthree layers of scrutiny\" \u2014 two doctors and a High Court judge will have to sign off on any decision.",

      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Tuesday he will study the details of the bill and \u201cwill not be putting pressure on any MP (Member of Parliament) to vote one way or the other.\u201d",
      "Here's a look at what's in the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill and the next steps:",
      "Under the draft legislation, only those over 18-years-old in England and Wales and who are expected to die within six months can request assisted dying.",
      "They must have the mental capacity to make a choice about the end of their life and will be required to make two separate declarations about their wish to die. Two independent doctors have to be satisfied the person is eligible and a High Court judge will need to approve the decision.",
      "Anyone found guilty of pressuring, coercing or dishonestly getting someone to make a declaration that they wish to die will face up to 14 years in prison.",
      "Assisted suicide is currently banned in most parts of the U.K. It is not a specific criminal offense in Scotland, but assisting the death of someone can result in a criminal charge.",
      "The patient must self-administer the life-ending medication themselves. No doctor or anyone else can give the medication.",
      "No health professional is under any obligation to provide assistance to the patient.",
      "Doctors who do take part would have to be satisfied the person making their declaration to die has made it voluntarily. They also must ensure the person is making an informed choice.",
      "The bill will be debated in Parliament and lawmakers will be able to vote on it according to their conscience, rather than along party lines.",
      "Opinion among lawmakers appears to be divided, though some senior ministers including Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said he intended to vote against the bill. Starmer has previously supported assisted dying, but the government says it will remain neutral on the issue.",
      "If the bill passes the first stage in the House of Commons, it will face further scrutiny and votes in both Houses of Parliament. Leadbeater suggested that any new law is unlikely to come into effect within the next two to three years.",
      "One argument supporting the bill is that wealthy individuals can travel to Switzerland, which allows foreigners to go there to legally end their lives, while others have to face possible prosecution for helping their loves ones to die.",
      "Other countries that have legalized assisted suicide include Australia, Belgium, Canada and parts of the United States, with regulations on who is eligible varying by jurisdiction.",
      "Assisted suicide is different to euthanasia, allowed in the Netherlands and Canada, which involves healthcare practitioners killing patients with a lethal injection at their request and in specific circumstances."

      "After a tumultuous year filled with anxiety and a legal fight about its future in the U.S., TikTok may have just been thrown a lifeline by the man who was once its biggest foe",
      "After a tumultuous year filled with anxiety and a legal battle about its future in the U.S., TikTok may have just been thrown a lifeline by the man who was once its biggest foe: Donald Trump.",
      "President-elect Trump, who tried to ban the social media platform the last time he was in the White House, has repeatedly pledged during his most recent campaign to oppose a ban on the short-form video app, which could happen as soon as mid-January if the company loses a court case that\u2019s currently underway in Washington.",
      "For months, TikTok, and its China-based parent company ByteDance, have been embroiled in a legal battle with the U.S. over a federal law that forces them to cut ties for national security reasons or stop operating in one of their biggest markets in the world. The measure, signed by President Joe Biden in April, gives ByteDance nine months to divest its stakes, with a possible three-month extension if a sale was in progress. If that happens, the deadline could be extended into the first 100 days of Trump\u2019s presidency.",
      "The companies have claimed that divestiture is not possible, and the law, if upheld, would force them to shut down by Jan. 19, just a day before Trump\u2019s second inauguration. Attorneys for both sides have asked a federal appeals court reviewing the case to issue a ruling by Dec. 6. The losing side is expected to appeal to the Supreme Court, which has a conservative majority and could decide to take up the case, potentially dragging out the process even longer.",
      "When reached for comment, the Trump transition team did not offer details on how Trump plans to carry out his pledge to \u201csave TikTok,\u201d as he said on a Truth Social post in September while encouraging people who care about the platform to vote for him. But Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for the transition team, indicated in a statement that he plans to see it through.",
      "\ufeff\u201cThe American people re-elected President Trump by a resounding margin giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cHe will deliver.\u201d",
      "During a March interview with CNBC, Trump said he still believed TikTok posed a national security risk but opposed banning it because doing so would help its rival, Facebook, which he has continued to lambast over his 2020 election loss. He also denied changing his mind on the issue because of Republican megadonor Jeff Yass, a ByteDance investor that Trump, at the time, said that he had only met \u201cvery briefly.\u201d He said Yass \u201cnever mentioned TikTok\u201d during their meeting.",
      "Still, ByteDance \u2013 and groups connected to Yass \u2013 have been attempting to exert their influence. Lobbying disclosure reports show that this year, ByteDance paid veteran lobbyist and former Trump campaign aide David Urban $150,000 to lobby lawmakers in Washington in favor of TikTok. The company has also spent more than $8 million on in-house lobbyists and another $1.4 million on other lobbying firms, according to Open Secrets.",
      "Meanwhile, in March, Politico reported Kellyanne Conway, a former senior Trump aide, was being paid by the Yass-funded conservative group Club for Growth to advocate for TikTok in Congress. A spokesperson for the organization said Conway was hired as a consultant to conduct polling. Conway and Urban did not respond to requests for comment. TikTok, which has long denied it\u2019s a national security risk, declined to comment.",
      "If the courts uphold the law, it would fall on Trump\u2019s Justice Department to enforce it and punish any potential violations with fines. The fines would apply to app stores that would be prohibited from offering TikTok, and internet hosting services who would be barred from supporting it. Leah Plunkett, a lecturer at Harvard Law School, said from her reading of the statute, the attorney general has to investigate violations but can decide whether or not to drag such companies to court and force them to comply.",
      "Trump could do other things to prevent TikTok from disappearing.",
      "He could issue an executive order to nullify the ban \u2014 which Plunkett believes would not be lawful \u2014 or urge Congress to repeal the law. That would require support from Congressional Republicans who have aligned themselves with Trump but have also supported the prospects of getting TikTok out of the hands of a Chinese company.",
      "In a statement sent to the AP after the election, Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on China, said Trump\u2019s \u201clong-standing concerns\u201d about TikTok align with the law\u2019s requirement for divestment.",
      "\u201cThe Trump Administration will have a unique opportunity to broker an American takeover of the platform,\u201d he said.",
      "ByteDance, though, has previously said it has no intention to sell the platform despite interest from some investors, including Trump\u2019s former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Analysts say the company is even less likely to sell the proprietary algorithm that fuels what users see on the app. That means even if TikTok is sold to a qualified buyer, it is likely to be a shell of its current self and would need to be rebuilt with new technology.",
      "Sarah Kreps, director of Cornell University\u2019s Tech Policy Institute, said it\u2019s also possible that Trump could take the issue back to the drawing board and direct his administration to negotiate a new deal with TikTok.",
      "TikTok said in 2022, it presented the Biden administration with a draft agreement that would bolster protections for users and provide it more oversight over the company\u2019s U.S. operations. But the administration has argued in court documents in recent months that it would be challenging to enforce the agreement due to the size and the technical complexity of the platform.",
      "Trump hasn\u2019t been privy to new intelligence material on the matter for a few years and it's possible he could change his mind - and abandon his campaign promise - once he does, Kreps said.",
      "Plunkett, the Harvard Law faculty and author of \u201cSharenthood: Why We Should Think before We Talk about Our Kids Online,\u201d said if she were counseling TikTok, she would advise them to come up with a divesture plan that is compliant with the law and as favorable to them as possible.",
      "\u201cThere is too much uncertainty about what a Trump administration is likely to do,\u201d she said."

      "Facebook and Instagram users in Europe will get the option to see less personalized ads if they don\u2019t want to pay for an ad-free subscription",
      "LONDON -- Facebook and Instagram users in Europe will get the option to see less personalized ads if they don't want to pay for an ad-free subscription, social media company Meta said Tuesday, bowing to pressure from Brussels over privacy and digital competition concerns.",
      "Meta Platforms has been offering European Union an ad-free subscription option for about a year to comply with the continent's strict data privacy rules, but regulators had accused the company of giving people a false choice.",
      "The company said in a blog post that while people will still be able to choose between the subscription and existing free versions, it would also start giving free users an extra option over the coming weeks to see digital ads that are less personalized.",
      "This means ads will be targeted at users based only on what they see during their current session on Facebook or Instagram going back no more than two hours, plus minimal personal information such as age, location, gender as well as how they engage with ads.",
      "Data from all of a user's previous time spent on Facebook or Instagram, which is typically combined to precisely target an individual with tailored ads, won't be used.",
      "\u201cWhile this new choice is designed to give people an additional control over their data and ad experience, it may result in ads that are less relevant to a person\u2019s interests,\u201d Meta said in a blog post. \u201cThat means people will see ads that they don\u2019t find as interesting. This drop in relevance is inevitable given that drastically reduced data is being used to show these less personalized ads to people.\u201d",
      "People who choose the new option will see ad breaks that can't be skipped for a few seconds, Meta said.",
      "European Union regulators had accused Meta of breaching the 27-nation bloc's digital rules when it gave user the option to pay a monthly fee to avoid being targeted by ads based on their personal data.",
      "The U.S. tech giant had rolled out the option after the European Union\u2019s top court ruled Meta must first get consent before showing ads to users, in a decision that threatened its business model of tailoring ads based on individual users\u2019 online interests and digital activity.",
      "The company also said Tuesday it's slashing monthly subscription prices for the ad-free option. Web users will pay 5.99 euros ($6.36), down from 9.99 euros previously, while iPhone and Android users will be charged 7.99 euros instead of 12.99 euros, which includes commissions charged by the Apple and Google mobile app stores.",
      "Meta's new subscription model could hit the company's lucrative digital ad business in one of its biggest markets. The company said it has already factored the new offering into its most recent business outlook and financial guidance.",
      "The options are available to users 18 and older in the EU\u2019s 27 member countries, plus Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein."

      "WASHINGTON -- Scientists can't know precisely when a volcano is about to erupt, but they can sometimes pick up telltale signs.",
      "That happened two years ago with the world's largest active volcano. About two months before Mauna Loa spewed rivers of glowing orange molten lava, geologists detected small earthquakes nearby and other signs, and they warned residents on Hawaii's Big Island.",
      "Now a study of the volcano's lava confirms their timeline for when the molten rock below was on the move.",
      "\u201cVolcanoes are tricky because we don\u2019t get to watch directly what\u2019s happening inside \u2013 we have to look for other signs,\" said Erik Klemetti Gonzalez, a volcano expert at Denison University, who was not involved in the study.",
      "Upswelling ground and increased earthquake activity near the volcano resulted from magma rising from lower levels of Earth\u2019s crust to fill chambers beneath the volcano, said Kendra Lynn, a research geologist at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory and co-author of a new study in Nature Communications.",
      "When pressure was high enough, the magma broke through brittle surface rock and became lava \u2013 and the eruption began in late November 2022. Later, researchers collected samples of volcanic rock for analysis.",
      "The chemical makeup of certain crystals within the lava indicated that around 70 days before the eruption, large quantities of molten rock had moved from around 1.9 miles (3 kilometers) to 3 miles (5 kilometers) under the summit to a mile (2 kilometers) or less beneath, the study found. This matched the timeline the geologists had observed with other signs.",
      "The last time Mauna Loa erupted was in 1984. Most of the U.S. volcanoes that scientists consider to be active are found in Hawaii, Alaska and the West Coast.",
      "Worldwide, around 585 volcanoes are considered active.",

      "Andrews compared volcano forecasts to weather forecasts \u2013 informed \u201cprobabilities\u201d that an event will occur. And better data about the past behavior of specific volcanos can help researchers finetune forecasts of future activity, experts say.",
      "(asterisk)We can look for similar patterns in the future and expect that there\u2019s a higher probability of conditions for an eruption happening,\u201d said Klemetti Gonzalez.",

      "As President-elect Donald Trump begins filling key posts in his second administration, social media users are pushing false claims that the 2024 election was rigged in his favor.",
      "One such narrative claims that billionaire Elon Musk facilitated the alleged fraud with his internet service provider Starlink, manipulating the vote count through election equipment such as ballot tabulators. Starlink, a subsidiary of Musk's SpaceX company, uses satellites to offer high-speed internet, even in remote areas.",
      "Some rural counties used the technology during the 2024 race to access their electronic poll books.",
      "Here's a closer look at the facts.",
      "CLAIM: Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk used his internet provider Starlink to steal the 2024 election for President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "THE FACTS: These claims are unfounded. Election officials, including from multiple swing states, told The Associated Press that their voting equipment doesn\u2019t use Starlink and is not even connected to the internet. States have additional security measures to ensure that the count is accurate, according to experts. Election officials and security agencies have reported no significant issues with the 2024 race.",
      "\u201cIt is not possible that Starlink was used to hack or change the outcome of the US presidential election,\u201d David Becker, founder and executive director of The Center for Election Innovation and Research, wrote in an email. \u201cThis, quite simply, did not happen, and could not happen, thanks to the security measures we have in place, and these conspiracy theories echo other disinformation we\u2019ve heard over the past several years.\u201d",
      "Becker further explained that the country's nearly 10,000 election jurisdictions use a wide range of voting machines that are not connected to the internet while voting occurs and that nearly all votes are recorded on paper ballots, which are audited by hand to confirm the results of electronic tabulators.",
      "\u201cIf anyone tried to interfere with the machines to rig the election, it would be discovered through multiple means, including reconciling the registered voters who cast ballots with the number of votes, as well as the audits,\u201d he added.",
      "Certain jurisdictions in a few states allow for ballot scanners in polling locations to transmit unofficial results, using a mobile private network, after voting has ended on Election Day and the memory cards containing the vote tallies have been removed.",
      "Election officials who allow this say it provides for faster reporting of unofficial election results on election night. They say the paper records of the ballots cast are used to authenticate the results during postelection reviews, and that those records would be crucial to a recount if one was needed. Computer security experts have said this is an unnecessary risk and should be prohibited.",
      "Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Jen Easterly said in a statement on Nov. 6 that CISA has \u201cno evidence of any malicious activity that had a material impact on the security or integrity of our election infrastructure.\u201d",
      "Despite a lack of evidence, many on social media suggested that Starlink could indeed have been used to steal the election.",
      "\u201cIf Trump & Elon's \u2018little secret\u2019 was to use Starlink in swing states to tally the votes & rig the election \u2014 an investigation & hand recount is crucial. Now,\u201d reads one X post that had been liked and shared approximately 41,700 times as of Tuesday.",
      "Another widely shared X post states: \u201cElon Musk used Starlink to hack our elections so he can have nice things while inflicting pain on Americans. Are we really going to turn a blind eye to what happened and let the worst people among us run the country.\u201d",
      "Election officials in North Carolina, Georgia and Pennsylvania \u2014 three of the seven swing states Trump won \u2014 told the AP that their voting equipment is never connected to the internet. In some cases, this is mandated by state law.",
      "\u201cSatellite-based internet devices were not used to tabulate or upload vote counts in North Carolina,\u201d said Patrick Gannon, a spokesperson for the North Carolina State Board of Elections. \u201cIn addition, our tabulated results are encrypted from source to destination preventing results being modified in transit. And no, tabulators and ballot-marking devices are never connected to the internet in North Carolina.\"",
      "The Tar Heel State prohibits its voting systems from being \u201cconnected to a network\u201d and requires any feature that allows such a connection to be disabled. This includes the internet, as well as any other wired or wireless connections.",
      "Gannon added that North Carolina has \u201cno evidence of any alteration of votes by anyone\u201d and requested that people stop spreading misinformation about elections.",
      "Mike Hassinger, a spokesperson for the Georgia secretary of state's office, called the claims spreading online \u201cabsolutely conspiratorial nonsense.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe don't use Starlink equipment for any part of our elections, and never have,\u201d he said. \u201cOur election equipment is 100% air-gapped and never connected to the internet.\u201d",
      "The term \u201cair-gapped\u201d refers to a security measure that isolates a secured computer network from those that are unsecured. This means it is impossible to use the internet to manipulate the software that tallies Georgia's votes or the memory cards on which they're recorded, according to Hassinger. He explained that memory cards are transported by hand in secure bags with tamper-evident ties to a central elections office where votes are tabulated. There is also a chain of custody protocol in place so that their movement is well documented.",
      "Matt Heckel, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of State, wrote in an email: \u201cCounties do not use Starlink to transmit unofficial or official election results. No voting system in Pennsylvania is ever connected to the internet.\u201d",
      "A pilot program in Arizona's Coconino, Apache and Navajo counties intended to \u201cenhance connectivity in underserved areas\" uses Starlink systems for electronic poll book synchronization, according to JP Martin, a spokesperson for the Arizona secretary of state's office. The state's election equipment is air-gapped, one of many security measures.",
      "Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin also employ stringent precautions to protect the integrity of their voting equipment.",
      "Some posts spreading online pointed to a local news segment in which the registrar of voters in Tulare County, California, noted that internet connectivity at the county's poll sites was improved this year thanks to Starlink. Stephanie Hill, a systems and procedures analyst for the agency, wrote in an email that \u201cthis connection is strictly for voter check-in purposes only and in no way a part of our voting system.\u201d California is among the states that prohibit their voting equipment from being connected to the internet.",
      "Trump is currently beating Vice President Kamala Harris in Tulare County with 60% of the vote.",
      "Pamela Smith, president and CEO of Verified Voting, agreed that the idea that Starlink was used to rig the election is absurd.",
      "\u201cWhile Starlink provided connectivity in a number of jurisdictions for electronic poll books (EPBs) in this election, neither Starlink nor other types of communication networks play any role in counting votes,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cOur elections produce huge quantities of physical evidence. A satellite system like Starlink cannot steal that.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Wall Street is already making big bets on what take two for a White House led by Donald Trump will mean for the economy.",
      "Since Election Day, investors have sent prices zooming for stocks of banks, fossil-fuel producers and other companies expected to benefit from Trump\u2019s preference for lower tax rates and lighter regulation. For retailers, meanwhile, the outlook is murkier because of uncertainty about whether they\u2019ll be able to absorb any of the higher costs created by tariffs.",
      "Professional investors are warning about the risk of getting carried away by the momentum. While strong rhetoric on the campaign trail can cause these big swings, not all of the promises turn into actual policy. Plus, the broad U.S. stock market tends to move more on long-term growth in profits than anything else.",
      "\u2014 Stan Choe",
      "Here's a look at where Wall Street is placing its bets at the moment:",
      "Technology stocks soared in Trump\u2019s first term, helped by the administration\u2019s tax policies. But the relationship was tempestuous: Trump\u2019s immigration stance threatened a source of high-skilled immigrants that comprises a significant part of the industry\u2019s work force and his trade wars threatened international sales and supply chains.",
      "This time around, tech could benefit from an anticipated loosening of antitrust regulation that discouraged big deals from getting done and threatened to rein in the power of Google, Apple and Amazon. What\u2019s more, Trump is expected to clear the way for Big Tech to make more inroads in artificial intelligence technology \u2014 an area increasingly seen as a crucial battleground in the duel for global power between the U.S. and China.",
      "Trump\u2019s vow to impose tariffs and other restrictions on trade does pose a potential downside for chip makers, particularly stock market darling Nvidia. A possible rollback of Biden administration efforts to boost U.S. semiconductor production also is a concern.",
      "Still, in a sign of tech\u2019s more conciliatory attitude, Trump\u2019s election was greeted by congratulatory posts from most of the industry\u2019s luminaries, including Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy and Google CEO Sundar Pichai.",
      "\u2014 Michael Liedtke",
      "Trump\u2019s victory brings a big dose of uncertainty for the retail industry.",
      "Trump has proposed extending 2017 tax cuts for individuals and restoring tax breaks for businesses that were being reduced. He also wants to further cut the corporate tax rate. Those would be tailwinds for shoppers and businesses, analysts said.",
      "But the president-elect\u2019s trade proposals could have a huge downside. He\u2019s proposed 60% tariffs on Chinese goods and tariffs of 10% to 20% on other imports. Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, a research firm, said retailers would either take a big hit on profits or be forced to increase prices.",
      "As opposed to Trump\u2019s first term, retailers will have a harder time absorbing tariffs this time because their costs of doing business are already higher, Saunders said.",
      "Many companies, including Nike and eyewear retailer Warby Parker, have been diversifying their sourcing away from China. Shoe brand Steve Madden says it plans to cut imports from China by as much as 45% next year.",
      "The National Retail Federation is forecasting higher prices for U.S. shoppers if Trump\u2019s new tariffs are implemented. For example, an $80 pair of men\u2019s jeans would cost $90 to $96.",
      "\u2014 Anne D'Innocenzio",
      "Trump has said he wants to \u201cdrill, drill, drill\u201d starting on Day 1 of his presidency, so it\u2019s expected that traditional fossil fuel-focused companies will get a boost and renewable energy outfits could be disadvantaged.",
      "Oilfield services companies including Haliburton and Schlumberger would likely benefit from initiatives to expand drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska. Natural gas companies including EQT and CNX Resources could benefit from facilities and pipeline projects. Meanwhile, clean energy companies, such as First Solar and many electric vehicle makers, could have a harder time growing if Trump cuts tax credits and other incentives for the industry.",
      "But remember Trump\u2019s first term, says Austin Pickle, investment strategy analyst at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. The thought back then, like now, was that Trump would boost prices for oil-and-gas stocks. But energy stocks ended up struggling late in his term when the price of oil briefly went below zero during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u2014 Damian Troise",
      "Drugmakers, insurers and other health care companies could benefit from fewer regulatory roadblocks to mergers and a lighter regulatory stance overall.",
      "Insurers, in particular, may see some regulatory relief for Medicare Advantage plans, which are privately run versions of the government\u2019s Medicare program mainly for people ages 65 and older. Under Democratic leadership, some insurers were facing smaller bonus payments tied to their Medicare Advantage plans. Some drugmakers are facing revenue hits on certain drugs covered by Medicare. Those challenges could abate under Republican rule, analysts at Morningstar noted.",
      "A second Trump administration also may challenge health care companies.",
      "The approval of drugs and vaccines could become less predictable, depending on the role anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plays, said Morningstar analyst Karen Andersen.",
      "Health insurers that sell coverage on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s insurance marketplaces or manage state-and-federally funded Medicaid coverage could face challenges if Republicans attempt to dismantle parts of the law, said Julie Utterback of Morningstar.",
      "In particular, extra subsidies that help people buy marketplace coverage are slated to expire at the end of next year, which could lead to enrollment drops.",
      "\u2014 Tom Murphy",
      "The auto industry is another that should welcome less restrictive regulations but dread tariffs.",
      "Trump is likely to roll back or scrap tailpipe emissions limits for 2027 through 2032 imposed by the Biden administration. Companies like General Motors, Ford and Stellantis could more easily sell larger, less-efficient vehicles without paying hefty fines.",
      "Companies would also face less pressure to sell more electric vehicles to offset emissions from big trucks and SUVs, which make big profit margins, said Kevin Tynan, research director for The Presidio Group.",
      "Tariffs are a different story. Trump has threatened tariffs on imported vehicles to force more production in the U.S. The threat of 100% tariffs on vehicles imported from Mexico is a big concern.",
      "Morningstar analyst David Whiston said such tariffs could potentially cost General Motors, Stellantis and Ford billions in profits. About 30% of GM\u2019s North American production comes from Mexico, while it\u2019s 24% for Stellantis and about 15% for Ford.",
      "Whiston notes that tariffs on vehicles built in Mexico would violate the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement negotiated during Trump\u2019s first term. But that can be reworked in July of 2026. Whiston said those tariffs would mean higher prices and many buyers already can\u2019t afford the current average price of over $47,000.",
      "Trump also has threatened to get rid of electric vehicle tax credits that have helped boost sales of EVs.",
      "\u2014 Tom Krisher",
      "Bank stocks could benefit if Trump's policies boost the U.S. economy and more customers apply for loans. In addition, Wells Fargo banking analyst Mike Mayo believes the Trump victory can usher in a \u201cnew era\u201d of lighter financial regulation after 15 years of stricter oversight following the financial crisis of 2008-2009. Under Biden, banks were facing requirements to set aside more capital to reduce risk, but the Trump administration is likely to take a step back.",
      "Dealmaking could see a revival under Trump, which would help banks with large investment banking operations like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. That also increases the odds the pending merger between Capital One Financial and Discover Financial gets federal clearance. Regional banks should benefit if a growing economy prompts the creation of new small businesses or the expansion of existing ones.",
      "\u2014 Paul Harloff",
      "Construction companies are looking at a mixed bag, with lighter regulations a plus but higher materials costs a potential minus.",
      "Construction companies, including homebuilders KB Home and PulteGroup, could benefit from tax incentives and more friendly regulations. A surge in development could help relieve some pressure on a housing market pressured by a lack of supply for new homes. A boost in construction could also help suppliers of raw materials including steel and aggregates used in concrete.",
      "But the potential for overall raw material price increases is a threat. Higher costs could cut into profits for construction companies and homebuilders. Steel tariffs could help shield U.S. producers from competition, but a jump in global prices as a result could negate that benefit, while also squeezing construction companies.",
      "Plans for an immigration crackdown could worsen an existing labor shortage and result in delays for projects.",

      "Crypto industry players welcomed Trump\u2019s victory, in hopes that he would push through legislative and regulatory changes that they\u2019ve long lobbied for. And Trump had promised that, if elected, he would remove the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, who has been leading the U.S. government\u2019s crackdown on the crypto industry and repeatedly called for more oversight.",

    "story": [
      "A hacking group that is believed to be Chinese state-sponsored has compromised two websites with ties to the Tibetan community in an attack meant to install malware on users\u2019 computers",
      "BANGKOK -- A hacking group that is believed to be Chinese state-sponsored has compromised two websites with ties to the Tibetan community in an attack meant to install malware on users' computers, according to findings released Wednesday by a private cybersecurity firm.",
      "The hack of the Tibet Post and Gyudmed Tantric University websites appears geared toward obtaining access to the computers of people visiting to obtain information on them and their activities, according to the analysis by the Insikt Group, the threat research division of the Massachusetts-based cybersecurity consultancy Recorded Future.",
      "The hackers, known in the report as TAG-112, compromised the websites so that visitors are prompted to download a malicious executable file disguised as a security certificate, Insikt Group said. Once opened, the file loads Cobalt Strike Beacon malware on the user's computer that can be used for key logging, file transferring and other purposes, including deploying additional malware.",
      "\u201cWhile we do not have visibility into the activity that TAG-112 conducted on compromised devices in this campaign, given their likely cyber espionage remit and the targeting of the Tibetan community, it is almost certain that they were engaged in information collection and/or surveillance rather than destructive attacks,\u201d Insikt Group senior director Jon Condra told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cThis behavior aligns with historical targeting of the Tibetan community,\u201d he said.",
      "Chinese authorities have consistently denied any form of state-sponsored hacking, saying China itself is a major target of cyberattacks.",
      "The Chinese Foreign Ministry said it was not aware of the hacking of the two websites reported by the Insikt Group.",
      "\u201cChina's stance on the issue of cybersecurity is consistent and clear,\u201d the ministry said in a faxed reply to a request for comment without elaborating.",
      "According to the Insikt group research, the sites were first compromised in late May and the attacks bear many overlaps with a previously tracked hacker group known as TAG-102, leading analysts to conclude it is a subgroup of the already known group \u201cworking toward the same or similar intelligence requirements,\u201d Insikt Group said.",
      "Overlaps include reuse of specific tactics, techniques and procedures and going after identical targets, Condra said.",
      "\u201cThese two threat clusters are almost certainly interrelated,\u201d he said.",
      "TAG-102, known by multiple names such as Evasive Panda and StormBamboo, has been in operation since as early as 2012, and is widely thought to be a Chinese-sponsored advanced persistent threat, or APT, group, Insikt Group said.",
      "Among other things, it uses custom malware frameworks used by other Chinese APT groups and its targeting \u201caligns with likely Chinese intelligence requirements,\u201d Condra said.",
      "\u201cThe group has engaged in a wide variety of campaigns over the years, with an emphasis on targeting individuals and organizations in opposition to the Chinese government, such as human rights organizations, religious organizations, ethnic minority groups, academic institutions, and supporters of democracy or independence movements in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and even in mainland China,\u201d Insikt Group said.",
      "The university and the news website, which are both located in India, have been informed by Insikt Group of the hack. As of this week, it appears the Gyudmed Tantric University, which is a place of learning about Tibetan Buddhism, language, history and culture, has remediated the problem while the news website remained compromised, Condra said.",
      "The Tibet Post is known for promoting democracy, freedom of speech and for advocating Tibetan independence from China, he said.",
      "China claims Tibet has been part of its territory for centuries, although it only established firm control over the Himalayan region after the Communist Party swept to power during a civil war in 1949.",
      "Many Tibetans' loyalties still lie with the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader who has lived in exile in India since a failed anti-Chinese uprising in 1959.",
      "China has been regularly accused of human rights abuses in Tibet, including earlier this year over its efforts to forcibly urbanize villagers and herders as part of a drive to assimilate rural Tibetans through control over their language and traditional Buddhist culture."

    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 19:30:25 -0500",
    "summary": "Even as Earth sets new heat records, humanity this year is pumping 330 million tons (300 million metric tons) more carbon dioxide into the air by burning fossil fuels than it did last year",

      "Even as Earth sets new heat records, humanity this year is pumping 330 million tons (300 million metric tons) more carbon dioxide into the air by burning fossil fuels than it did last year",
      "BAKU, Azerbaijan -- Even as Earth sets new heat records, humanity this year is pumping 330 million tons (300 million metric tons) more carbon dioxide into the air by burning fossil fuels than it did last year.",
      "This year the world is on track to put 41.2 billion tons (37.4 billion metric tons) of the main heat-trapping gas into the atmosphere. It\u2019s a 0.8% increase from 2023, according to Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists who track emissions. Several United Nations reports say the globe must cut emissions by 42% by 2030 to possibly limit warming to an internationally agreed-upon threshold.",
      "This year's pollution increase isn't quite as large as last year's 1.4% jump, scientists said while presenting the data at the United Nations climate talks in Azerbaijan.",
      "If the world continues burning fossil fuels at today's level, it has six years before passing 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels, the limit agreed to at the 2015 climate talks in Paris, said study co-author Stephen Sitch. The Earth is already at 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 Fahrenheit), according to the United Nations.",
      "\u201cWe clearly are not doing enough on a global scale to reduce emissions. It\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d said study co-author Mike O'Sullivan, a University of Exeter climate scientist. \"We need to massively increase ambition and actually just think outside the box of how we can change things, not be so tied to fossil fuel interests.''",
      "Scientists used reported emissions from rich countries and oil industry data, O\u2019Sullivan said. The 2024 figure includes projections for the last couple months or so. The Global Carbon Project team released figures for the four biggest carbon emitters \u2014 China, the United States, India and Europe. It also produced more detailed and final figures for about 200 countries for 2023.",
      "The continued rise in carbon emissions is mostly from the developing world and China. Many analysts had been hoping that China \u2014 by far the world's biggest annual carbon polluting nation with 32% of the emissions \u2014 would have peaked its carbon dioxide emissions by now. Instead China's emissions rose 0.2% from 2023, with coal pollution up 0.3%, Global Carbon Project calculated. But it could drop to zero in the next two months and is \u201cbasically flat,\u201d O'Sullivan said.",
      "That's nothing close to the increase in India, which at 8% of the globe's carbon pollution is third-largest carbon emitter. India's carbon pollution jumped 4.6% in 2024, the scientists said.",
      "Carbon emissions dropped in both the United States and the European Union. They fell 0.6% in the U.S. mostly from reduced coal, oil and cement use. The U.S. was responsible for 13% of the globe's carbon dioxide in 2024. Historically, it's responsible for 21% of the world's emissions since 1950, a figure that matters since the gas persists in the atmosphere for centuries.",
      "Twenty-two nations have shown steady decreases in emissions, O'Sullivan said, singling out the United States as one of those. The biggest emission drops from 2014 to 2023 were in the United States, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.",
      "Europe, which accounts for 7% of the world's carbon pollution, saw its carbon dioxide output drop 3.8% from last year \u2014 driven by a big cut in coal emissions.",
      "Global carbon emissions are well more than double what they were 50 years ago and 50% than they were in 1999. Emissions have gone up about 6% in the past decade.",
      "\u201cThis is a needed reminder of the urgency with which we need to address the cause of the climate crisis,\" said PowerShift Africa founder Mohamed Adow, who wasn't part of the study. \u201cThe problem is the fossil fuel industry is kicking and screaming for us to slow down and to keep them in business for longer. That\u2019s why they poured money into Donald Trump\u2019s election campaign.\u201d",
      "Carbon dioxide from humanity's burning of coal, oil and natural gas amounts to 2.6 million pounds (nearly 1.2 million kilograms) of the heat-trapping gas every second.",
      "Total carbon emissions \u2014 which include fossil fuel pollution and land use changes such as deforestation \u2014 are basically flat because land emissions are declining, the scientists said. That\u2019s an important and encouraging milestone amid bad news, said University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann",

    "story": [
      "For the first time, a group of U.S. researchers has concluded that China has built a land-based prototype nuclear reactor to power future aircraft carriers",
      "BANGKOK -- China has built a land-based prototype nuclear reactor for a large surface warship, in the clearest sign yet Beijing is advancing toward producing its first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, according to a new analysis of satellite imagery and Chinese government documents provided to The Associated Press.",
      "China\u2019s navy is already the world\u2019s largest numerically, and it has been rapidly modernizing. Adding nuclear-powered carriers to its fleet would be a major step in realizing its ambitions for a true \"blue-water\u201d force capable of operating in seas far from China in a growing global challenge to the United States.",
      "\u201cNuclear-powered carriers would place China in the exclusive ranks of first-class naval powers, a group currently limited to the United States and France,\u201d said Tong Zhao, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, D.C. \u201cFor China\u2019s leadership, such a development would symbolize national prestige, fueling domestic nationalism and elevating the country\u2019s global image as a leading power.\u201d",
      "Researchers at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California said they made the finding while investigating a mountain site outside the city of Leshan in the southwest Chinese province of Sichuan, where they suspected China was building a reactor to produce plutonium or tritium for weapons.",
      "Instead they concluded that China was building a prototype reactor for a large warship. The project at Leshan is dubbed the Longwei, or Dragon Might, Project and is also referred to as the Nuclear Power Development Project in documents.",
      "Neither China\u2019s Defense Ministry nor Foreign Affairs Ministry responded to requests for comment.",
      "There have long been rumors that China is planning to build a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, but the research by the Middlebury team is the first to confirm that China is working on a nuclear-powered propulsion system for a carrier-sized surface warship.",
      "\u201cThe reactor prototype at Leshan is the first solid evidence that China is, in fact, developing a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier,\" said Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at Middlebury and one of the researchers on the project. \"Operating a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier is an exclusive club, one that China looks set to join.\u201d",
      "Drawing on satellite images and public documents including project tenders, personnel files, environmental impact studies \u2014 and even a citizen\u2019s complaint about noisy construction and excessive dust \u2014 they concluded a prototype reactor for naval propulsion was being built in the mountains of Mucheng township, some 70 miles (112 kilometers) southwest of Sichuan's provincial capital Chengdu.",
      "The reactor, which procurement documents indicate will soon be operational, is housed in a new facility built at the site known as Base 909, which houses six other reactors that are operational, decommissioned or under construction, according to the analysis. The site is under the control of the Nuclear Power Institute of China, a subsidiary of the China National Nuclear Corporation, which is tasked with reactor engineering research and testing.",
      "Documents indicating that China\u2019s 701 Institute, formally known as China Ship Research and Design Center, which is responsible for aircraft carrier development, procured reactor equipment \u201cintended for installation on a large surface warship\u201d under the Nuclear Power Development Project as well as the project\u2019s \u201cnational defense designation\u201d helped lead to the conclusion the sizable reactor is a prototype for a next-generation aircraft carrier.",
      "Satellite mages from 2020 to 2023 have shown the demolition of homes and the construction of water intake infrastructure connected to the reactor site. Contracts for steam generators and turbine pumps indicate the project involves a pressurized water reactor with a secondary circuit \u2014 a profile that is consistent with naval propulsion reactors, the researchers say.",
      "An environmental impact report calls the Longwei Project a \u201cnational defense-related construction project\u201d that is classified \u201csecret.\u201d",
      "\u201cUnless China is developing nuclear-powered cruisers, which were pursued only by the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, then the Nuclear Power Development Project most certainly refers to a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier development effort,\u201d researchers wrote in a detailed 19-page report on their findings shared exclusively with the AP.",
      "Jamie Withorne, an analyst at the Oslo Nuclear Project who was not involved in the research and reviewed the findings, said Middlebury's team made a \u201cconvincing argument.\u201d",
      "\u201cFrom the identifying reports, co-location with other naval reactor facilities, and correlating construction activity, I think it can be said that it is likely the Longwei Project is housed at Base 909, and it could potentially be located at the identified building,\u201d she said.",
      "The research does not, however, provide clues as to when a Chinese nuclear-powered carrier could be built and become operational, she said.",
      "Sarah Laderman, a senior analyst with Open Nuclear Network, a program of the U.S.-based NGO PAX sapiens foundation, said the findings were \u201ccarefully conducted and thoroughly researched.\u201d",
      "\u201cGiven the evidence presented here, I see a compelling case made that China seems to be working towards building a nuclear propulsion system for its naval surface ships (likely aircraft carriers) at this location,\u201d said Laderman, who is based in Vienna and was not involved in Middlebury\u2019s research.",
      "China\u2019s first carrier, commissioned in 2012, was a repurposed Soviet ship, and its second was built in China but based upon the Soviet design. Both ships \u2014 named the Liaoning and the Shandong \u2014 employ a so-called \u201cski-jump\u201d type launch method, with a ramp at the end of a short runway to help planes take off.",
      "The Type 003 Fujian, launched in 2022, was the country's third carrier and its first to be indigenously designed and built. It employs an electromagnetic-type launch system like those developed and used by the U.S. Navy. All three carriers are conventionally powered.",
      "Sea trials hadn\u2019t even started for the Fujian in March when Yuan Huazhi, political commissar for China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy, confirmed the construction of a fourth carrier. Asked if it would be nuclear-powered, he said at the time that would \u201csoon be announced,\u201d but so far it has not been.",
      "There has been speculation that China may begin producing two new carriers at once \u2014 one Type 003 like the Fujian and one nuclear-powered Type 004 \u2014 something that it has not attempted before but that its shipyards have the capacity to do.",
      "Matthew Funaiole, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies\u2019 China Power Project, said he doubts China's next carrier will be nuclear-powered. Instead, he said, he would expect the People's Liberation Army Navy's fourth carrier to focus on optimizing the existing design of the Fujian carrier with \u201cincremental improvements.\u201d",
      "Nick Childs, senior fellow for naval forces and maritime security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said the Chinese \u201chave taken an incremental approach to their carrier development with a number of ambitions that will evolve over time.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor now, their deployments have been relatively cautious, remaining largely within range of shore support, but projecting influence and to some extent coercion within their near waters.\u201d",
      "Eventually, however, \u201clarger carriers more akin to their U.S. counterparts will give them more options to project power,\u201d Childs said.",
      "It takes several years to build a carrier and bring it into operation, but developing nuclear propulsion for its next generation of warships would eventually give China more power to run advanced systems, such as electromagnetic launchers, radars and new technology weapons, Childs said.",
      "\u201cAs well as obviating the need for the ship to refuel regularly and therefore giving it much greater range, nuclear power means that without the need to carry fuel oil for the ship there will be room aboard for fuel and weapons for its aircraft, extending their capabilities,\u201d Childs said.",
      "\u201cMuch will depend on what overall size the next carrier is, but the addition of nuclear power will represent a significant step further in China\u2019s carrier development with a vessel more comparable to the U.S. Navy\u2019s carriers.\u201d",
      "Zhao, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said nuclear-powered carriers would provide the Chinese military \u201cwith greater flexibility and endurance to operate around strategic hotspots, especially along the First Island Chain, where most territories disputed by China are located,\u201d said Zhao.",
      "The First Island Chain includes the self-governed island of Taiwan, which China claims as its own and vows to annex it by force if necessary.",
      "The U.S. is obligated by a domestic law to supply Taiwan with sufficient weapons to deter invasion, and it could provide assistance to the island from its bases in the Pacific in the event of an invasion or blockade. Tensions also have risen in the South China Sea between China and neighboring nations over territorial disputes and maritime claims.",
      "\u201cThese carriers could also extend Chinese operations deeper into the Western Pacific, further challenging the U.S. military\u2019s ability to \u2018intervene\u2019 in regional matters that China views as best resolved by countries from the region only,\u201d Zhao said.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has tasked defense officials with building a \u201cfirst-class\u201d navy and becoming a maritime power as part of his blueprint for the country\u2019s rejuvenation.",
      "The country\u2019s most recent white paper on national defense, dated 2019, said the Chinese navy was adjusting to strategic requirements by \u201cspeeding up the transition of its tasks from defense on the near seas to protection missions on the far seas.\u201d",
      "The People's Liberation Army Navy is already the world\u2019s largest navy with more than 370 ships and submarines. The country also boasts powerful shipbuilding capabilities: China\u2019s shipyards are building many hundreds of vessels each year, whereas the U.S. is building five or fewer, according to a U.S. congressional report late last year.",
      "However, the Chinese navy lags behind the U.S. Navy in many respects. Among other advantages, the U.S. currently has 11 carriers, all nuclear powered, allowing it to keep multiple strike groups deployed around the world at all times, including in the Indo-Pacific.",
      "But the Pentagon is growingly increasingly concerned about China\u2019s rapid modernization of its fleet, including the design and construction of new carriers.",
      "That aligns with China's \u201cgrowing emphasis on the maritime domain and increasing demands\" for its navy \"to operate at greater distances from mainland China,\u201d the Defense Department said in its most recent report to Congress on China's military.",
      "And China's \u201cgrowing force of aircraft carriers extend air defense coverage of deployed task groups beyond the range of land-based defenses, enabling operations farther from China\u2019s shore,\u201d the report said.",

      "As money continues to pour into crypto following Donald Trump\u2019s reelection, bitcoin has climbed to yet another record high",
      "NEW YORK -- As money continues to pour into crypto following Donald Trump's reelection last week, bitcoin has climbed to yet another record high.",
      "The world's largest cryptocurrency topped $89,000 for the first time, briefly peaking at $89,995 early Tuesday, according to CoinDesk. Bitcoin's price oscillated throughout the day, but is still up more than 27% over the last week \u2014 standing at about $88,288 as of 5 p.m. ET.",
      "That's part of a rally across cryptocurrencies and crypto-related investments since Trump won the U.S. presidential election. Analysts credit much of the recent gains to an anticipated \u201ccrypto-friendly\u201d nature of the incoming administration, which could translate into more regulatory clarity but also leeway.",
      "Still, as with everything in the volatile cryptoverse, the future is hard to predict. And while some are bullish, others continue to warn of investment risks.",
      "Here's what you need to know.",
      "Cryptocurrency has been around for a while now, but has come under the spotlight in recent years.",
      "In basic terms, cryptocurrency is digital money. This kind of currency is designed to work through an online network without a central authority \u2014 meaning it's typically not backed by any government or banking institution \u2014 and transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain.",
      "Bitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, although other assets like Ethereum, Tether and Dogecoin have gained popularity over the years. Some investors see cryptocurrency as a \u201cdigital alternative\u201d to traditional money \u2014 but it can be very volatile, and reliant on larger market conditions.",
      "A lot of the recent action has to do with the outcome of last week's election.",
      "Trump was previously a crypto skeptic, but changed his mind and embraced cryptocurrencies during this year's presidential race. He has pledged to make the U.S. \u201cthe crypto capital of the planet\u201d and create a \u201cstrategic reserve\u201d of bitcoin. His campaign accepted donations in cryptocurrency and he courted fans at a bitcoin conference in July. He also launched World Liberty Financial, a new venture with family members to trade cryptocurrencies.",
      "Crypto industry players welcomed Trump\u2019s victory, in hopes that he would be able to push through legislative and regulatory changes that they\u2019ve long lobbied for. And Trump had previously promised that, if elected, he would remove the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, who has been leading the U.S. government\u2019s crackdown on the crypto industry and repeatedly called for more oversight.",
      "\u201cCrypto rallied as Election Day progressed into the night and as it became increasingly clear that Trump would emerge victorious,\u201d Citi analysts David Glass and Alex Saunders wrote in a Friday research note, pointing to larger industry sentiment around Trump being \u201ccrypto-friendly\" and a potential shift in regulatory backing.",
      "But even before the post-election rally, assets like bitcoin posted notable gains over the past year or so. Much of the credit goes to early success of a new way to invest in the asset: spot bitcoin ETFs, which were approved by U.S. regulators in January.",
      "Inflows into spot ETFs, or exchange-traded funds, \"have been the dominant driver of Bitcoin returns from some time, and we expect this relationship to continue in the near-term,\u201d Glass and Saunders noted. They added that spot crypto ETFs saw some of their largest inflows on record in the days following the election.",
      "In April, bitcoin also saw its fourth \u201chalving\u201d \u2014 a preprogrammed event that impacts production by cutting the reward for mining, or the creation of new bitcoin, in half. When that reward falls, so does the number of new bitcoins entering the market. And, if demand remains strong, some analysts say this \u201csupply shock\u201d can also help propel the price long term.",
      "Crypto assets like bitcoin have a history of drastic swings in value \u2014 which can come suddenly and happen over the weekend or overnight in trading that continues at all hours, every day.",
      "In short, history shows you can lose money as quickly as you've made it. Long-term price behavior relies on larger market conditions.",
      "At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, bitcoin stood at just over $5,000. Its price climbed to nearly $69,000 by November 2021, in a time marked by high demand for technology assets, but later crashed during an aggressive series of Federal Reserve rate hikes aimed at curbing inflation. Then came the 2022 collapse of FTX, which significantly undermined confidence in crypto overall.",
      "At the start of last year, a single bitcoin could be had for less than $17,000. Investors, however, began returning in large numbers as inflation started to cool \u2014 and gains skyrocketed on the anticipation and then early success of spot ETFs. While some crypto supporters see the potential for more record-breaking days, experts still stress caution, especially for small-pocketed investors.",
      "\u201cInvestors should only dabble in crypto with money that they can be prepared to lose,\u201d Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said last week. \u201cBecause we\u2019ve seen these wild swings in the past.\u201d",
      "Assets like bitcoin are produced through a process called \u201cmining,\" which consumes a lot of energy. And operations relying on pollutive sources have drawn particular concern over the years.",
      "Recent research published by the United Nations University and Earth\u2019s Future journal found that the carbon footprint of 2020-2021 bitcoin mining across 76 nations was equivalent to the emissions from burning 84 billion pounds of coal or running 190 natural gas-fired power plants. Coal satisfied the bulk of bitcoin\u2019s electricity demands (45%), followed by natural gas (21%) and hydropower (16%).",
      "In the U.S., the Energy Information Administration notes that crypto mining across the country has \u201cgrown very rapidly over the last several years,\" adding that grid planners have begun to express concern over increases in related electricity demand. Preliminary estimates released by the EIA in February suggest that annual electricity use from crypto mining probably represents between 0.6% to 2.3% of U.S. electricity consumption.",
      "Environmental impacts of bitcoin mining boil largely down to the energy source used. Industry analysts have maintained that clean energy has increased in use in recent years, coinciding with rising calls for climate protections from regulators around the world.",

      "When a volcanic eruption buried the ancient city of Pompeii, the last desperate moments of its citizens were preserved for centuries",
      "When a volcanic eruption buried the ancient city of Pompeii, the last desperate moments of its citizens were preserved in stone for centuries.",
      "Observers see stories in the plaster casts later made of their bodies, like a mother holding a child and two women embracing as they die.",
      "But new DNA evidence suggests things were not as they seem \u2014 and these prevailing interpretations come from looking at the ancient world through modern eyes.",
      "\u201cWe were able to disprove or challenge some of the previous narratives built upon how these individuals were kind of found in relation to each other,\u201d said Alissa Mittnik of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany. \u201cIt opens up different interpretations for who these people might have been.\u201d",
      "Mittnik and her colleagues discovered that the person thought to be a mother was actually a man unrelated to the child. And at least one of the two people locked in an embrace \u2014 long assumed to be sisters or a mother and daughter \u2014 was a man. Their research was published Thursday in the journal Current Biology.",
      "The team, which also includes scientists from Harvard University and the University of Florence in Italy, relied on genetic material preserved for nearly two millennia. After Mount Vesuvius erupted and destroyed the Roman city in 79 A.D., bodies buried in mud and ash eventually decomposed, leaving spaces where they used to be. Casts were created from the voids in the late 1800s.",
      "Researchers focused on 14 casts undergoing restoration, extracting DNA from the fragmented skeletal remains that mixed with them. They hoped to determine the sex, ancestry and genetic relationships between the victims.",
      "There were several surprises in \u201cthe house of the golden bracelet,\u201d the dwelling where the assumed mother and child were found. The adult wore an intricate piece of jewelry, for which the house was named, reinforcing the impression that the victim was a woman. Nearby were the bodies of another adult and child thought to be the rest of their nuclear family.",
      "DNA evidence showed the four were male and not related to one another, clearly showing \u201cthe story that was long spun around these individuals\u201d was wrong, Mittnik said.",
      "Researchers also confirmed Pompeii citizens came from diverse backgrounds but mainly descended from eastern Mediterranean immigrants \u2013 underscoring a broad pattern of movement and cultural exchange in the Roman Empire. Pompeii is located about 150 miles (241 kilometers) from Rome.",
      "The study builds upon research from 2022 when scientists sequenced the genome of a Pompeii victim for the first time and confirmed the possibility of retrieving ancient DNA from the human remains that still exist.",
      "\u201cThey have a better overview of what\u2019s happening in Pompeii because they analyzed different samples,\" said Gabriele Scorrano of the University of Rome Tor Vergata, a co-author of that research who was not involved in the current study. \u201cWe actually had one genome, one sample, one shot.\u201d",
      "Though much remains to be learned, Scorrano said, such genetic brushstrokes are slowly painting a truer picture of how people lived in the distant past.",

      "The Australian government announced on Thursday what it described as world-leading legislation that would set an age limit of 16 years for children to start using social media, and hold platforms responsible for ensuring compliance",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- The Australian government announced on Thursday what it described as world-leading legislation that would institute an age limit of 16 years for children to start using social media, and hold platforms responsible for ensuring compliance.",
      "\u201cSocial media is doing harm to our kids and I\u2019m calling time on it,\u201d Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said.",
      "The legislation will be introduced in Parliament during its final two weeks in session this year, which begin on Nov. 18. The age limit would take effect 12 months after the law is passed, Albanese told reporters.",
      "The platforms including X, TikTok, Instagram and Facebook would need to use that year to work out how to exclude Australian children younger than 16.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to thousands of parents, grandparents, aunties and uncles. They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "The proposal comes as governments around the world are wrestling with how to supervise young people's use of technologies like smartphones and social media.",
      "Social media platforms would be penalized for breaching the age limit, but under-age children and their parents would not.",
      "\u201cThe onus will be on social media platforms to demonstrate they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access. The onus won\u2019t be on parents or young people,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "Antigone Davis, head of safety at Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, said the company would respect any age limitations the government wants to introduce.",
      "\u201cHowever, what\u2019s missing is a deeper discussion on how we implement protections, otherwise we risk making ourselves feel better, like we have taken action, but teens and parents will not find themselves in a better place,\u201d Davis said in a statement.",
      "She added that stronger tools in app stores and operating systems for parents to control what apps their children can use would be a \u201csimple and effective solution.\u201d",
      "X did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday. TikTok declined to comment.",
      "The Digital Industry Group Inc., an advocate for the digital industry in Australia, described the age limit as a \u201c20th Century response to 21st Century challenges.\u201d",
      "\u201cRather than blocking access through bans, we need to take a balanced approach to create age-appropriate spaces, build digital literacy and protect young people from online harm,\u201d DIGI managing director Sunita Bose said in a statement.",
      "More than 140 Australian and international academics with expertise in fields related to technology and child welfare signed an open letter to Albanese last month opposing a social media age limit as \u201ctoo blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\u201d",
      "Jackie Hallan, a director at the youth mental health service ReachOut, opposed the ban. She said 73% of young people across Australia accessing mental health support did so through social media.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re uncomfortable with the ban. We think young people are likely to circumvent a ban and our concern is that it really drives the behavior underground and then if things go wrong, young people are less likely to get support from parents and carers because they\u2019re worried about getting in trouble,\u201d Hallan said.",
      "Child psychologist Philip Tam said a minimum age of 12 or 13 would have been more enforceable.",
      "\u201cMy real fear honestly is that the problem of social media will simply be driven underground,\u201d Tam said.",
      "Australian National University lawyer Associate Prof. Faith Gordon feared separating children from there platforms could create pressures within families.",
      "Albanese said there would be exclusions and exemptions in circumstances such as a need to continue access to educational services.",
      "But parental consent would not entitle a child under 16 to access social media.",
      "Earlier this year, the government began a trial of age-restriciton technologies. Australia\u2019s eSafety Commissioner, the online watchdog that will police compliance, will use the results of that trial to provide platforms with guidance on what reasonable steps they can take.",
      "Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said the year-long lead-in would ensure the age limit could be implemented in a \u201cvery practical way.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere does need to be enhanced penalties to ensure compliance,\u201d Rowland said.",
      "\u201cEvery company that operates in Australia, whether domiciled here or otherwise, is expected and must comply with Australian law or face the consequences,\u201d she added.",
      "The main opposition party has given in-principle support for an age limit at 16.",
      "Opposition lawmaker Paul Fletcher said the platforms already had the technology to enforce such an age ban.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not really a technical viability question, it\u2019s a question of their readiness to do it and will they incur the cost to do it,\u201d Fletcher told Australian Broadcasting Corp.",
      "\u201cThe platforms say: \u2019It's all too hard, we can\u2019t do it, Australia will become a backwater, it won\u2019t possibly work.' But if you have well-drafted legislation and you stick to your guns, you can get the outcomes,\u201d Fletcher added."

      "As U.S. President-elect Donald Trump prepares for his second term in office, China is bracing for unpredictability in its ties with the United States",
      "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- The first time China faced Donald Trump in the White House, there was a trade war, a breach of protocol involving Taiwan\u2019s former leader, and a president-to-president bromance that turned sour.",
      "As President-elect Trump prepares to start his second term in office, China is bracing for unpredictability in its ties with the United States and renewed tensions over trade, technology and Taiwan.",
      "Perhaps the biggest consequence for China \u2014 if Trump stays true to his campaign promises \u2014 is his threat to slap blanket 60% tariffs on all Chinese exports to the U.S.",
      "Tariffs like that would be a blow to China\u2019s already unstable economy, which is suffering from high youth unemployment, a lengthy property slump and government debt. A 60% duty on Chinese imports could shave off 2.5 percentage points, or about half, of China\u2019s projected economic growth, according to an analysis published earlier this year by UBS.",
      "During Trump's previous term in office, the U.S. imposed tariffs on more than $360 billion of Chinese products. That brought Beijing to the negotiating table, and in 2020 the two sides signed a trade deal in which China committed to improve intellectual property rights and buy an extra $200 billion of American goods. A research group a couple of years later showed China had bought essentially none of the goods it had promised.",
      "President Joe Biden retained most of those tariffs and added fresh duties this year on imports including steel, solar cells and electric vehicles.",
      "Like last time, tariffs could serve as a tool to force Beijing back to the negotiating table, said Henry Gao, a law professor at Singapore Management University who focuses on international trade.",
      "\u201cGiven the weak economic position of China this time, I think there will be more willingness to talk,\u201d he said. \u201cThus, while the tariff might have some short-term effects on the Chinese economy, the situation might improve once they reach a deal.\u201d",
      "Factoring into the trade talks could be Trump\u2019s appeals to Chinese President Xi Jinping to help negotiate a resolution to the Ukraine war, which Trump has boasted he\u2019ll be able to do quickly, without saying how.",
      "Trump previously sought Xi's help in dealing with North Korea's rogue leader Kim Jong Un. That dynamic could repeat itself, with Trump weighing trade grievances against seeking China's support in global crises, according to Wang Huiyao, founder of the Beijing-based think tank Center for China and Globalization.",
      "\u201cChina is the largest trading partner of both Russia and Ukraine,\" Wang wrote in a recent commentary. \"These close economic ties give China a unique opportunity to play a greater role in peace-making efforts.\u201d",
      "There is one scenario in which Trump has threatened to impose even higher tariffs \u2014 150% to 200% \u2014 on Chinese goods: if China invades Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy that Beijing claims as its own.",
      "The U.S. does not recognize Taiwan as a country, but is its strongest backer and biggest arms provider.",
      "Trump angered Beijing in December 2016 by taking a congratulatory call from Taiwan\u2019s then-president Tsai Ing-wen in a breach of diplomatic protocol. No U.S. president had spoken directly to a Taiwanese leader since Washington and Beijing established ties in 1979.",
      "Trump's move created anxiety in China-watching circles, but ultimately, he stuck to supporting the status quo in relations between Taipei and Beijing.",
      "China expects him to continue to do so, said Zhu Feng, dean of the School of International Relations at Nanjing University.",
      "\u201cWill (he) want to turn to support Taiwan independence? It is unlikely,\u201d he said.",
      "As for China\u2019s repeated threats to annex Taiwan, Trump told The Wall Street Journal last month that he would not have to use military force to prevent a blockade of Taiwan because Xi \u201crespects me and he knows I\u2019m (expletive) crazy.\u201d",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump sometimes talked up his personal connection with Xi, which started exuberantly during his first term but soured over disputes about trade and the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "But Trump has also said that Taiwan should pay the U.S. for defending it against China, likening the relationship to insurance. Taiwan spends about 2.5% of its GDP on defense, and purchased hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of U.S. weapons this year.",
      "In a congratulatory message to Trump after his victory, Xi called for the U.S. and China to manage their differences and get along in a new era, according to Chinese state media. History has shown that both sides gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation, Xi said.",
      "Trump has purposely maintained a sense of uncertainty in his relationship with China, said Da Wei, director of the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University in Beijing.",
      "\u201cWe are clear about the challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cAs for opportunities, we are yet to see them clearly.\u201d",
      "During his first term, Trump began targeting Chinese technology firms over security concerns, focusing on large companies like the telecoms giant Huawei. Biden continued in that direction by placing curbs on China\u2019s access to advanced semiconductors, which are needed to develop strategic industries such as artificial intelligence.",
      "But Trump has criticized Biden\u2019s CHIPS and Science Act, a bipartisan bill that earmarked $53 billion to build up domestic manufacturing of semiconductors. Currently, Taiwan produces nearly 90% of the world\u2019s supply of the most advanced chips.",
      "The island\u2019s largest semiconductor manufacturer, TSMC, expanded production in Arizona, partly to respond to the CHIPS Act, and to be prepared to withstand any other protectionist policies in the U.S., said Shihoko Goto, director of the Indo-Pacific Program at the Wilson Center.",
      "Trump has promised to do away with the CHIPS Act, though critics say that would undermine his campaign to reindustrialize the U.S. The president-elect has also accused Taiwan of \u201cstealing\u201d the chip industry from the U.S. decades ago.",
      "\u201cRather than providing a silicon shield, Taiwan\u2019s dominance in the chip industry could actually be the source of tension between Taipei and Trump, as Taiwan\u2019s successes in the chip sector may be seen as having only been possible as a result of the United States being taken advantage of,\u201d Goto said."

The weekend before Election Day, the 16-year-old teen, who identifies as nonbinary and uses the pronouns \u201che\u201d and \u201cthey,\u201d called a crisis hotline at the Rainbow Youth Project.

This year, Biden's administration said the law forbids discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation, but Trump can undo that. Biden's new guidance had limited implementation in any case: After a spate of lawsuits, courts had issued injunctions pausing the rule in 26 states.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump's expected choice of Sen. Marco Rubio and Rep. Mike Waltz as his secretary of state and national security adviser, respectively, indicates China is going to be at the center of U.S. foreign policy, deepening U.S.-China tensions.",
      "Rubio and Waltz are both staunch China hawks. In fact, Rubio was sanctioned twice by Beijing in 2020 and may still be banned from entering China.",
      "Naming Rubio and Waltz is a \"strong sign that Trump's foreign policy priority will focus on China above all else,\" said Neil Thomas, a fellow for Chinese politics at the Asia Society Policy Institute's Center for China Analysis. Though there will be a near-term focus on finding a resolution to the wars overseas, \"over the next four years, China -- by far and away -- will be the major focus,\" he said.",
      "That tracks with what Waltz has said himself. Earlier this month, he co-wrote in The Economist that the U.S. should \"urgently\" bring the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East to an end so the U.S. can \"finally focus strategy attention where it should be: countering the greater the threat from the Chinese Communist Party.\"",
      "Rubio has called China the \"threat that will define this century\" and backed a bill to prevent the import of goods made by China's Uyghur minority. Waltz, who has said the U.S. is in a \"cold war\" with China, called for the U.S. to boycott the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.",
      "Trump has vowed to slap 60% tariffs on Chinese goods. He'll likely act on tariffs early in his administration, experts say, as an easy win that he can act on unilaterally to show he's delivering a key campaign promise. It will be highly disruptive to U.S.-China relations and U.S. businesses, so experts say there will likely be a lot of lobbying from Trump's allies in the business world to narrow the tariffs to a few key sectors.",
      "In addition to tariffs, the U.S. has a \"huge toolkit for economic warfare\" that the Trump administration could use, according to Thomas, including more sanctions on Chinese companies and expanding export controls to more industries.",
      "But billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk could be a moderating voice for a softer approach to China amid all of this. Musk has deep business interests in China and could become a key middleman for dialogue between Trump and China's Xi Jinping.",
      "Telsa depends on China for production and as a key consumer market. Musk is a household name in China and gets the red-carpet treatment from Chinese officials when he visits.",

    "summary": "Trump's unlikely to endorse, sources say, because he doubts Rick Scott can win.",
    "story": [
      "He's unlikely to endorse McConnell critic Rick Scott for GOP Senate leader.",
      "Some of Donald Trump's most fervent and loudest supporters on the MAGA right are pointing to Wednesday's Senate GOP leadership election as the first major test of Republican loyalty to the president-elect, and the final battle between Trump and his occasional Republican nemesis, outgoing GOP leader Mitch McConnell.",
      "Republican senators meet behind closed doors on Wednesday morning to cast their votes to choose McConnell's successor in a three-person race that pits two senators -- John Thune and John Cornyn -- who are seen as McConnell proteges and the third -- Rick Scott -- who has pledged his loyalty to Trump.",
      "Many of Trump's most high-profile supporters -- including Elon Musk, Steve Bannon and Tucker Carlson -- are loudly campaigning against Thune and Cornyn, saying the race will determine whether the Republican-controlled Senate will be sufficiently loyal to the Trump agenda.",
      "As Carlson put it, \"Rick Scott of Florida is the only candidate who agrees with Donald Trump. Call your senator and demand a public endorsement of Rick Scott.\"",
      "Those campaigning against Thune and Cornyn portray the race as more than a leadership battle.",
      "\"We're taking over every institution of government,\" one prominent Trump ally told me. \"This is not a transition. You do understand that, right? We're taking over and it starts with the Senate.\"",
      "But for all the blunt talk about the Senate race, Trump has not taken sides and all indications are that he won't. One key factor, sources close to the president-elect say, is that Trump doesn't think Rick Scott can win the race and the last thing he wants to do is endorse a loser.",
      "Even without that endorsement, Scott is running as the one real pro-Trump candidate in the race, saying under his leadership the Senate agenda will be \"identical to the Trump agenda.\"",
      "Thune and Cornyn both endorsed Trump and say they are also committed to passing the Trump agenda.",
      "But both have also shown a willingness to occasionally stand up to Trump. After he voted to acquit Trump in the Senate impeachment trial in February 2021, for example, Thune said: \"My vote to acquit should not be viewed as exoneration for his conduct on January 6 \u2026 or in the days and weeks leading up to it. What former President Trump did to undermine faith in our election system and disrupt the peaceful transfer of power is inexcusable.\"",
      "Cornyn has said Trump used \"reckless and incendiary speech\" on Jan. 6. and criticized Trump's handling of COVID-19.",
      "While Trump himself has not endorsed any candidate, over the weekend he made two big demands of all three of them: 1) He wants them to promise confirm cabinet secretaries without a vote in the Senate if necessary (through the use of so-called \"recess appointments\"); and, 2) He wants them to block confirmations of any judges while the Democrats still control the Senate.",
      "Scott responded almost immediately, announcing on X he would go along with Trump's demands: \"100% agree. I will do whatever it takes to get your nominations through as quickly as possible.\"",
      "In a sign of Trump's influence, Thune and Cornyn also expressed support for Trump's demand, both saying they are committed to doing everything possible to quickly confirm Trump's nominations and saying they are open to recess appointments, too.",
      "But if either Thune or Cornyn emerges as the next Republican leader in the Senate, it may be a sign that Trump\u2019s influence is not unlimited \u2013 or, at that very least, that a Republican leader can show some independence and still survive in Trump\u2019s Republican Party."

With McConnell announcing his intent to step aside earlier this year, Sen. John Thune, the current Republican whip, is running against Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas senator and former Republican whip, and Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican who just won reelection to his second term.",
      "Ahead of the vote, slated for Wednesday morning, Republicans gathered behind closed doors for over two hours Tuesday evening to hear arguments from Thune, Cornyn and Scott, as well as other senators who are running for downballot leadership positions. Any other candidate who might wish to throw their name in the running for party leadership would have been permitted to do so during the meeting.",
      "It was described by Senators in the room as \"energetic\" but not a debate.",

      "When asked specifically about the whip count, Thune remained vague.",
      "\"You never know until the voters vote,\" Thune said.",

      "And Thune, who perhaps has had the iciest relationship with Trump among the contenders, also made clear he's been in regular contact with Trump's team, and he's made public statements supporting Trump proposals, including potential changes to Senate operating procedure.",
      "Trump has not endorsed a candidate in the leadership race, opting instead to insist that whichever candidate is selected will support his use of recess appointments, which would allow him to temporarily fill federal vacancies without Senate approval.",
      "All three candidates have signaled their willingness to use that strategy to quickly fill out Trump's Cabinet."

      "\"This case should not require very much preparation since it's a retrial,\" Judge Jed Rakoff said during a conference Tuesday.",
      "A lawyer for the newspaper, David Axelrod, raised the possibility the two sides could settle and asked for more time. The judge did not agree to push the case into the summer.",
      "Ken Turkel, a lawyer for Palin, agreed the idea would be to try and mediate.",
      "\"We just wanted to take some of the pressure off,\" Turkel said.",
      "The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled this summer that Palin can again try to hold the paper liable for a 2017 editorial that wrongly suggested she incited the 2011 mass shooting that killed six people and wounded then-Democratic Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords.",

      "The 2017 editorial, entitled \"America's Lethal Politics,\" linked the 2011 shooting of Giffords to a digital graphic of a crosshairs over Democratic congressional districts published in March 2010 by Palin's political action committee. A relationship between the crosshairs map and the shooting was never established. Rather, at the time of the editorial, the attack was widely viewed as a result of the shooter's mental illness.",
      "Palin's original defamation lawsuit was dismissed but, in 2019, the 2nd Circuit vacated the dismissal. The case went to trial in 2022, and Rakoff granted the Times' motion for a directed verdict days before the jury found the newspaper was not liable for defaming Palin.",

      "The Biden administration gave Israel a 30-day window to \"surge\" food and emergency aid into the devastated territory last month, warning that failure to address the issue may trigger U.S. laws requiring restrictions on military aid to Israel. The deadline for progress is Tuesday.",

      "In 2021, she opposed Afghan refugees coming into South Dakota amid the U.S. troops' withdrawal from Afghanistan, even though she had accepted Syrian refugees under the Trump administration in 2019. Earlier this year, she spent millions of dollars of the state's Emergency and Disaster Fund to deploy the National Guard to the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas.",

      "Online searches for topics related to women's health have spiked since the Nov. 5 election, particularly when it comes to birth control, Google data shows.",
      "Searches for IUDs, birth control pills, and Plan B are trending higher than they have since June 2022, when Roe v. Wade was overturned, giving states the power to decide abortion access.",
      "Since then, at least 14 states have ceased nearly all abortion services, and 21 states have put into effect restrictions on abortion.",
      "The current abortion landscape combined with Trump's comments about birth control on the campaign trail and his first administration's efforts to roll back insurance coverage of contraceptives have led to uncertainty about what will happen in his second term.",
      "Here are five questions answered.",
      "1. What does the term 'birth control' include?",
      "Birth control, also known as contraception, is the broad term for the act of preventing pregnancy.",
      "The term includes everything from medicines and methods to devices and surgery used to prevent pregnancy, according to the National Library of Medicine.",
      "Editor\u2019s Picks",

      "New research shows benefits of getting 1-year supply of birth control pills at once",
      "Inside Project 2025: Former Trump official outlines hard right turn against abortion",

      "Around 14% of women in the United States between the ages of 15 to 49 currently use the pill, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "2. What did Trump say about birth control on the campaign trail?",
      "During an interview with a Pittsburgh TV station in May, Trump was asked if he supports any restrictions on a person's right to contraceptives.",
      "\"Well, we're looking at that and we're going to have a policy on that very shortly,\" Trump responded with. \"And I think it's something you'll find interesting and it's another issue that's very interesting.\"",
      "When asked to clarify if he was suggesting he was open to supporting some restrictions on contraceptives, \"like the morning-after pill,\" Trump responded, \"Things really do have a lot to do with the states -- and some states are going to have different policy than others.\"",
      "The former president quickly took to social media to clarify his position, claiming that he was not advocating for restrictions on contraceptives.",
      "\"I HAVE NEVER, AND WILL NEVER ADVOCATE IMPOSING RESTRICTIONS ON BIRTH CONTROL, or other contraceptives,\" he wrote in a May 21 post on his social media platform.",
      "The Trump campaign further attempted to clarify, claiming the policy Trump was referring to during the interview was mifepristone, often used in pregnancy termination. However, Trump was not asked about the abortion medication.",
      "After winning the 2024 presidential election, Trump and the transition team have been advised on health-related appointments by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has also been in discussions to possibly fill a major role in the next administration, sources familiar with the matter told ABC News.",
      "ABC News has not found public comment from RFK Jr. on the issue of birth control.",
      "3. What happened on birth control during Trump's first administration?",
      "During Trump's first term, the Department of Health and Human Services issued new rules allowing more employers to opt-out of the Affordable Care Act mandate guaranteeing no-cost contraceptive services for women.",
      "The Supreme Court upheld the HHS decision in a 7-2 ruling in 2020, giving an employer or university with a religious or moral objection to opt out of covering contraceptives for employees.",
      "4. As president, what power does Trump have over birth control?",
      "As president, Trump would have the authority to order rollbacks of measures implemented by President Joe Biden's administration to protect birth control.",
      "As recently as October, the Biden administration announced a plan to require insurers to fully cover over-the-counter contraceptives.",
      "In January, the administration announced several other measures to protect contraception access, including federal agencies issuing new guidance to \"clarify standards\" and make sure Food and Drug Administration-approved contraceptive medications are available for free under the Affordable Care Act.",
      "Once Trump is in office, he will also have the chance to appoint Supreme Court justices if vacancies arise. During his first term, Trump appointed three justices.",
      "Trump could also work with Congress to enact legislation on women's reproductive rights, including birth control. Following the Nov. 5 election, control of the House of Representatives is still up in the air, while ABC News has projected that Republicans will win the Senate.",
      "5. What has the Supreme Court said on birth control?",
      "When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, a solo concurring opinion by Justice Clarence Thomas included a line on birth control.",
      "In his opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that the court \"should reconsider\" Griswold v. Connecticut, the Supreme Court ruling that invalidated a Connecticut law that made it illegal to use birth control devices or to advise about their use.",
      "\"We have a duty to 'correct the error' established in those precedents,\" Thomas wrote, citing the Griswold ruling among others.",

      "ROME -- The city of Florence took new measures Tuesday to crack down on overtourism, just as the Italian government hosts the Group of Seven tourism ministers in the Renaissance city and seeks to significantly boost the country\u2019s place as a top visitor destination.",
      "Mayor Sara Funaro\u2019s Cabinet approved a 10-point plan that, among other things, would ban key boxes on buildings in Florence\u2019s historic center as well as the use there of loudspeakers by tour guides, a statement from City Hall said.",
      "The keyboxes \u2014 small boxes with a digital pad that are used by owners of short-term rental apartments to easily leave keys for visitors \u2014 have become something of the symbol of local Florentine anger at tourists, whose numbers have rebounded after COVID-19.",
      "In a recent protest, Florentines taped red Xs over the keyboxes, outraged at the transformation of the city center and its magnificent palazzi and narrow streets into a collection of short-term vacation rentals that have displaced local residents and the long-standing businesses that served them.",
      "According to national statistics bureau ISTAT, 2023 saw the most visitors ever in Italy with 134 million arrivals and 451 million people staying in hotels or other registered lodgings. The number of visitors opting for non-hotel lodging grew nearly 17% compared to 2022, ISTAT said in a June report.",
      "Italy ranks fourth on the U.N. World Tourism Barometer of international tourist destinations, after France, Spain and the United States. The tourism industry contributed some 10.5% of Italy\u2019s gross domestic product in 2023, according to Statista research.",
      "Florence, long run by the center-left, last year announced a ban on new short-term private rentals in the center in hopes of stemming the exodus of locals. It has repeatedly pressed for a special regulation from the national government, currently headed by right-wing Premier Giorgia Meloni, to cap the number of days a property can be rented out at 120.",
      "To date, only Venice has been permitted to limit short-term rentals. The lagoon city has been drowning under overtourism for years and this year began imposing a day-tripper tax to try to regulate tourist flows.",
      "The right-left political divide over Florence and its tourism woes could come to a head precisely as Italy hosts the G7 tourism ministers starting Wednesday in Florence.",
      "At a warm-up event this weekend, Tourism Minister Daniela Santanche acknowledged some art cities were suffering from too many visitors. But she said that overall Italy is hardly taking advantage of its tourism potential and needed 50 million visitors more a year.",
      "Lamenting Italy\u2019s fourth-place position on the list of the world's top destinations, she said Italy needed to sustainably grow its tourism potential with quality offerings.",
      "\u201cWe can grow much more, we can develop much more and the industry of tourism can truly become the leading industry of our nation,\u201d she said.",

      "The park's director Gabriel Zuchtriegel said visitors to the main archaeological site now exceed an average of 15,000 to 20,000 every day, and the new daily cap will prevent the numbers from surging further.",

      "It\u2019s now acknowledged almost universally that Mr. Biden should not have sought a second term, but the Democratic establishment denied the obvious and propped him up politically, even as evidence of his decline mounted. Prominent Democratic politicians changed their tune only after a disastrous debate performance in June made it impossible to conceal Mr. Biden\u2019s frailty from the public any longer \u2014 and forced them to confront the possibility of electoral disaster in November.",
      "The credibility problems that Ms. Harris\u2019s repeated defense of Mr. Biden\u2019s sharpness illustrated were part of the reason Democrats met defeat.",
      "Make no mistake: As dissemblers go, President-elect Donald Trump has no equal, and his dishonesty is a continual disgrace. Even his strongest supporters acknowledge he exaggerates for effect and plays fast and loose with facts. But voters obviously see other qualities in him that offset his dishonesty, perhaps drawn from rosy recollections of living under the first Trump presidency.",
      "Democrats tried to make fidelity to science, facts and truth their distinguishing characteristic as a party. The White House\u2019s aggressive coverup of Mr. Biden\u2019s decline undermined that claim. Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minnesota) was the only lawmaker willing to challenge Mr. Biden for the Democratic presidential nomination. He was ostracized and lost his spot in House leadership. Mr. Biden\u2019s allies concocted terms such as \u201ccheap fakes\u201d to dismiss embarrassing video clips in which Mr. Biden appeared dazed, confused, tired and inaudible. Allies of the president frequently labeled content they didn\u2019t approve of as \u201c disinformation,\u201d cheapening the term. When a few journalists reported accurately on Mr. Biden\u2019s decline, the White House fed critical talking points about their stories to others in the media.",
      "The harder they spun, the less believable they became. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said days after the June 27 debate that Mr. Biden was \u201c as sharp as ever.\u201d Eventually, Mr. Biden bowed to reality and stepped aside. But Ms. Harris struggled whenever she was asked to explain her defenses of Mr. Biden. On Oct. 22, NBC\u2019s Hallie Jackson pressed Ms. Harris five times on this topic. The vice president dodged when asked whether she ever saw anything like what happened during the debate behind closed doors. \u201cIt\u2019s a judgment question, that\u2019s why I ask,\u201d Ms. Jackson responded. \u201cCan the American people trust you in these moments, even when it\u2019s maybe uncomfortable?\u201d Ms. Harris did not answer directly.",
      "To the bitter end, Mr. Biden\u2019s team has covered for him. In the last week of the campaign, White House press staff altered the official transcript of a public appearance in which Mr. Biden described Trump supporters as \u201cgarbage.\u201d The Associated Press reported that an apostrophe was added to the initial version prepared by the official White House stenographers so it would appear that he was referring only to a single supporter: the comedian who had joked that Puerto Rico is a \u201c floating island of garbage.\u201d",
      "All of this took a toll on believability. Polls showed more voters believed that Mr. Trump would actually implement his campaign promises than Ms. Harris would hers.",
      "This is not to say that Ms. Harris\u2019s defense of Mr. Biden, or its effect on her credibility, was the decisive factor in this week\u2019s election. Any accounting must include the fact that incumbent parties across the world are losing in a tough post-covid-19 political environment, along with the damage the Democratic Party\u2019s leftward lurch, led by Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts), did to the Democratic label, particularly during the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries.",
      "But the record does highlight one of the things Democrats must do to resuscitate their brand: live up to their billing as truth-tellers.",

      "News of Donald Trump \u2019s victory sent the rial, Iran\u2019s currency, to an all-time low this week. The party may be over for the Iranian regime, which took in more than $40 billion in extra oil revenue during the Biden years owing to nonenforcement of U.S. sanctions. The rolling bribe bought America nothing and gave China cheap oil.",
      "Shock waves from the U.S. election are felt throughout the Mideast, which noticed Wednesday\u2019s CNN report that Brian Hook is expected to lead the State Department transition team. Mr. Hook led the first Trump Administration\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d sanctions campaign against Iran, and he has been living under Iranian threats on his life. His presence is a signal that America means business again.",
      "As Iran weighs striking Israel a third time, it must know that its defenses are down after Israel\u2019s recent retaliation\u2014and not only the Russian equipment. The Biden Administration can no longer protect the Iranian regime. President Biden\u2019s leverage over Israel has largely collapsed, thanks to U.S. voters.",
      "When Mr. Biden deemed Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities off-limits to Israeli retaliation, Mr. Trump disagreed. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing you want to hit, right?\u201d he said Oct. 4. \u201cThe answer should have been: Hit the nuclear first and worry about the rest later.\u201d You can bet that one landed on Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei\u2019s desk.",
      "The election also sends a warning to the International Criminal Court, which is abusing its powers to bring up Israel\u2019s leaders on politicized charges. America is next on the ICC\u2019s target list. Tough U.S. sanctions against the ICC are all but guaranteed after Republicans take control of Congress.",
      "President Biden and Sen. Chuck Schumer could stop blocking bipartisan sanctions on the ICC right now. Freed from pandering to voters in Dearborn, Mich., they can head off those ICC arrest warrants, which may be issued shortly. If Democrats don\u2019t, and the court acts first, it will be too late to save the court from the consequences of its overreach.",
      "The Middle East awaited Nov. 5 to determine the conclusion of the war. The election of Mr. Trump\u2014who wants Israel to finish up and win, as opposed to handcuffing it and pressuring it to lose\u2014improves Israel\u2019s bargaining position with Hezbollah and Hamas.",
      "The pressure is on them to succumb to Israel\u2019s terms. In one of Mr. Trump\u2019s biggest applause lines at the Republican convention, he warned, \u201cWe want our hostages back, and they better be back before I assume office or you will be paying a very big price.\u201d That threat is now operative, and the clock is ticking.",
      "On Jan. 20, 1981, during President Reagan\u2019s inaugural address, Iran released 52 U.S. hostages after 444 days in captivity. Today some 50 hostages are believed to be alive in Gaza, including four Americans: Edan Alexander, Omer Neutra, Sagui Dekel-Chen and Keith Siegel. We\u2019re coming up on 400 days.",

      "The Los Angeles Times on abortion rights on ballots across the country",
      "Ever since the Supreme Court took away the constitutional right to abortion in 2022, the people have been taking it back state by state.",
      "Before last week\u2019s election, voters in six states had either enshrined abortion rights in their state constitutions or defeated ballot measures that would have restricted them.",
      "On Tuesday, that number more than doubled. In seven of the 10 states where abortion rights measures were on the ballot, they prevailed. From the most liberal of those states (New York) to the most conservative (Missouri), and regardless of how they voted in the presidential race, voters asserted the right to control their own bodies. Even in Florida, where an abortion rights measure failed, it won a more decisive majority than Donald Trump. (More about that later.)",
      "Ballot measures in New York, Maryland, Colorado and Montana enshrined abortion rights (and, in New York, other equal rights protections) in the constitutions of states where they are already substantially protected by law. Abortion is legal to the point of fetal viability in Montana, for example, but lawmakers there have repeatedly tried to restrict it.",
      "These measures may be unnecessary in liberal states where abortion remains legal \u2014 and let\u2019s hope they are. But every state that codifies abortion rights in its constitution reinforces them against the whims of elected officials. California voters passed a constitutional amendment bolstering the state\u2019s already strong abortion protections in 2022.",
      "The most important victories Tuesday were for measures in Arizona, which outlawed abortion after 15 weeks, and Missouri, where abortion was illegal with no exceptions for incest or rape. Missouri legislators have hardly missed an opportunity to attack abortion rights: One legislator floated a measure to make it illegal to help someone leave the state for an abortion.",
      "Both of those states now have constitutionally guaranteed rights to abortion up to the point of viability. Although legal or legislative efforts will be necessary to lift their now unconstitutional bans, it\u2019s astonishing progress for those states and the people who live in them.",
      "These election results should send a powerful message to state and federal elected officials and the incoming Trump administration: Americans will not tolerate the trampling of their reproductive rights in blue, purple or red states. Federal officials should keep that in mind as conservative state attorneys general consider trying to block abortion medication from being provided by mail.",
      "Three abortion rights measures did fail last week, all of them in states that could have desperately used constitutional amendments to ensure abortion access.",
      "In Florida, which bans abortion beyond six weeks \u2014 a point when most women don\u2019t even know they\u2019re pregnant \u2014 Amendment 4 would have constitutionally guaranteed a right to an abortion up to the point of fetal viability, which is roughly 24 weeks. The initiative earned a healthy majority of 57.2% but fell 3 points short of the state\u2019s undemocratic 60% threshold for approval of constitutional amendments. Trump carried the state with a smaller majority, 56.1%.",
      "A failed measure in South Dakota, where abortion is banned, would have allowed the procedure up to 12 weeks, which is considered restrictive in other states. Major reproductive rights groups such as the regional Planned Parenthood organization did not believe the measure would adequately restore abortion rights and refused to support it.",
      "And in Nebraska, where abortion is banned after 12 weeks with some exceptions, the presence of two measures on the ballot made for some confusion. The one that failed, Initiative 439, would have guaranteed a right to abortion up to viability and was supported by advocates of abortion access. The one that passed, Initiative 434, bans most abortions after 12 weeks. Under this measure, abortion could remain legal up to 12 weeks, but the Legislature has leeway to further restrict abortion rights, up to a complete ban.",
      "Advocates have more work to do to convince voters in states with abortion bans and restrictions that there is an electoral path to restore reproductive rights. \u201cEvery state that has a citizens\u2019 initiative constitutional process and restrictions on abortion is a place where we will be looking,\u201d said Kelly Hall, the executive director of the Fairness Project, which worked on the ballot measures in Missouri and elsewhere this election season.",
      "In states that don\u2019t allow citizens\u2019 initiatives, progress will be more challenging. But people in all kinds of states, liberal and conservative, have shown that they want to protect their right to control their own bodies.",

      "The Boston Herald on the next step from Democrats and Republicans",
      "The voters have spoken. Former president Donald Trump has not only won a solid majority in the Electoral College, he seems destined to win the popular vote, and by a substantial margin \u2014 the first time he will have accomplished that feat in his three presidential campaigns. Bitterness among Democrats will now confront triumphalism among Republicans, as the country struggles to pick up the pieces after a campaign harshly colored by apocalyptic warnings on both sides.",
      "Once again Trump has proven his political resilience and defied predictions on the left that he could never win a majority of the American electorate. Pundits and historians will wrestle with the forces that led to his victory, but in the broadest of terms, it seems clearly rooted in a post-pandemic unease about the state of the world, the economy, and the nation\u2019s very character.",
      "Despite his strongman bluster and bullying nature, a stubborn majority of voters \u2014 fairly or not \u2014 associated Trump with economic prosperity and global stability. What Democrats viewed as a threat to the nation\u2019s democratic character, Republicans embraced as an unwavering leadership to guide the nation out of chaos and decline.",
      "It will be easy to criticize Vice President Kamala Harris for running a button-downed, cramped campaign that failed to answer voters\u2019 concerns about her abilities and policies. And indeed, perhaps she could have spoken more forcefully about stemming the migrant crisis, about resolving the Middle East war, about acknowledging the shortcomings of the Biden administration, and about the ways she might have done things differently. But it is impossible to know whether any of that would have made a difference.",
      "It seems equally fair to credit her with running a vigorous and mostly uplifting campaign amid the disinformation, bigotry, and character assassination she endured daily. She faced extraordinary headwinds that even the most flawless campaign would have struggled to overcome: a deeply unpopular and visibly frail President Biden who declined to get out of the race until too late, leaving Harris too little time to help Americans know her better; inflation driven mainly by pandemic shutdowns, supply chain bottlenecks, and the war in Ukraine; a broad loss of faith in the assumption that the United States was the dominant power in the world.",
      "For Republicans, this will inevitably be a time of feeling vindication and jubilation against a Democratic Party they have come to view as arrogant, entitled elitists. But they would do well to not overplay their hand. They, as much or more than Democrats, should also be prepared to insist loudly that the president-elect set aside the warlike rhetoric aimed at their fellow Americans, resist calls for political persecution of his enemies, and oppose his gleeful pledges to disregard the law. Whatever deportation policies Trump puts into place, his victory should not open the door to extramural intimidation or even violence against law-abiding immigrants, legal or not.",
      "Urging Republicans to oppose violence against their neighbors and support the Constitution does not seem an unreasonable ask. Neither does holding Trump to his late-campaign pledges to leave abortion to the states and to protect women. Meanwhile, the independent institutions of American democracy \u2014 Congress, the judiciary, the press \u2014 need to be ready to stand up for democratic norms if Trump attacks them, as seems likely.",
      "It would also not be unreasonable for Republicans to insist that Trump start rebuilding faith in the American electoral system that he did so much to undermine. The very same system that he claims was rigged against him when he lost in 2020 this time around elected him with a relative lack of disruption. He should begin telling his supporters that the system worked and resist his party\u2019s temptation to disenfranchise the urban and minority voters who opposed him.",
      "For their part, Democrats should think hard about the substantive reasons Trump prevailed. Filter out, if you can, the bluster and bigotry, and it is possible to discern Trumpian notes that clearly resonated with many voters. The decline in American manufacturing. The need to forcefully counter an assertive China. The frustration of communities struggling with the cost of uncontrolled migration. The futility of trying to exert American military power everywhere in the world. The dismay with a reflexive progressiveness so dominant in American universities and cultural institutions. The feeling that they have been left behind.",
      "This will not be easy to do after an election result that, for many Democrats, seemed a rejection of all that they hold dear about their country: its democratic institutions; its commitment to civil rights; its legacy as a haven for striving immigrants. Overcoming their bitterness in order to see the legitimate hopes, aspirations, and humanity of their Trumpian neighbors is going to be difficult. But they should also recognize that the surest way back to power will be to win over some of those neighbors, not to shun them.",
      "At some point, when both the grieving and elation die down, Americans on both sides will need to decide that they are ready to come together again as a single nation. They will need to relinquish the instinct to retreat into perpetually warring fiefdoms. The genius of the founders was that they created a system meant to accommodate conflicting factions and to bend in the winds of history without snapping. But nothing made by man is unbreakable. The time to prevent the breaking has arrived.",

      "The Guardian on Trump's tariff promises, global fair trade",
      "\u201cTo me, the most beautiful word in the dictionary is tariff,\u201d Donald Trump told business leaders in October. \u201cIt\u2019s my favourite word. It needs a public relations firm.\u201d Now, with his election victory, Mr Trump\u2019s words send a shiver through global capitals. Many fear he may pull a curtain across the US economy, locking them out of the world\u2019s largest market and cutting off access to US technology. These fears are amplified by last year\u2019s contraction in merchandise trade \u2013 which was the first such shrinkage at a time when the global economy was growing.",
      "However, it\u2019s wise to take Mr Trump seriously, not literally. During his last term, he imposed tariffs on more than $400bn in US-China trade and renegotiated the North American free trade agreement (Nafta) in a push to reshore blue-collar jobs. In many ways, Joe Biden continued \u2013 and even accelerated \u2013 these trends. Mr Trump averaged 144,000 reshored jobs a year; in 2022, Mr Biden reached 364,000.",
      "As a self-styled deal-maker, Mr Trump will probably push for better terms for the US economy. German carmakers are concerned; South Korea expects  its companies would need to boost US investments if Mr Trump raises tariffs. The EU, China and Japan watch warily. The difference this time is that Mr Trump\u2019s unpredictable approach seems more erratic and his rightwing rhetoric even more deranged. It could be a bumpy ride.",
      "Britain is in poor shape to deal with global trade wars. The UN points out that its export revenues were down by 4% year-on-year. This is in part due to subdued demand from key partners, such as China. But no one should underestimate the continuing fallout from a disastrous Brexit.",
      "Importantly, a protectionist stance from richer nations isn\u2019t new. In 2022, the EU became the first major economy to legislate a \u201cgreen tariff\u201d on imports. A year later, the UK announced plans to follow suit. By 2027, both will levy charges on goods based on the carbon emitted during production \u2013 a move aimed at preventing \u201cpollution havens\u201d, where emissions are simply offshored to regions with weaker regulations.",
      "This may sound like a positive move, but it disrupts \u201cfree trade\u201d enough that some developing nations have labelled it discriminatory and pledged retaliation. Studies indicate that Africa, home to 33 of the world\u2019s 46 least-developed countries, could lose $25bn annually, at 2021 prices, from green levies. This impact is partly due to the fact that key exports such as fertiliser, cement, iron and steel are more carbon-intensive to produce in Africa than elsewhere.",
      "Stifling the progress of developing nations seems not only unfair but also shortsighted. What\u2019s needed isn\u2019t \u201cfree trade\u201d but fair trade. Perhaps that\u2019s not a phrase that Mr Trump favours, but it should be. African countries must be empowered to develop on terms that suit their needs, enabling them to earn the foreign exchange essential for a green transition. Otherwise, the rich world risks undermining African growth. This would be a loss not only for Africa but for the world.",
      "Wealthy countries didn\u2019t grow using the policies they now push on poorer nations. Almost all relied on tariffs and subsidies to build their industries \u2013 even Britain, despite claims of virtually no state intervention. As global competition intensifies for green tech, AI and robotics, trade policies should be crafted more fairly than they are today.",

      "Donald Trump has long criticized America's spy agencies, accusing them of trying to undermine his first administration and campaign to retake the White House",
      "WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump has long viewed the nation's spy services with suspicion, accusing them of trying to undermine his first term and campaigns. Now that he's returning to the White House, Trump's promises to overhaul the U.S. intelligence agencies put him on a collision course with one of most secretive and powerful parts of government.",
      "Trump announced Tuesday that he is nominating John Ratcliffe to lead the CIA. A former Republican congressman from Texas, Ratcliffe served as director of national intelligence for the final months of Trump\u2019s first term, leading the U.S. government\u2019s spy agencies during the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "Ratcliffe is a more traditional pick for the position, which requires Senate confirmation, than some rumored loyalists pushed by some of Trump\u2019s supporters.",
      "For the CIA and other intelligence agencies, the start of Trump's second administration is a way to reset an often challenging relationship with a leader who has in the past dismissed them as the deepest of the deep state \u2014 Trump's label for the thousands of career federal employees that carry out the work of government regardless of who is president.",
      "For Trump, the return to power offers an opportunity to follow through on promises to clean house of officials that he believes have tried to challenge his leadership and criticize his actions.",
      "Former and current intelligence officials also are watching for clues indicating whether Trump will use U.S. intelligence to inform foreign policy and national security decisions or whether he will realize the fears of critics, who worry he could spill classified secrets or seek to weaponize intelligence work against Americans.",
      "\u201cIf he comes in committed to retribution and cleaning house, that\u2019s going to impact the agency. We're going to lose people, and there's going to be this fear: \u2018What will get me in trouble politically?\u2019\u201d said Douglas London, a 34-year CIA veteran who now writes about intelligence work and teaches at Georgetown University.",
      "In selecting Ratcliffe to lead the nation's premier spy agency, Trump chose a loyalist who has been willing to defend him in some of his most politically charged battles in Washington. When serving in the House, Ratcliffe was on Trump's advisory team during his first impeachment proceedings.",
      "As intelligence director during the final days of the 2020 election, Ratcliffe angered Democrats by declassifying Russian intelligence alleging damaging information about Democrats during the 2016 race even though he acknowledged it might not be true.",
      "Given his experience in Congress and the intelligence community, Ratcliffe is seen as a relatively traditional pick for the position of CIA director. House Intelligence Chairman Mike Turner, R-Ohio, hailed Trump's selection in a statement, saying Ratcliffe \u201cknows what it will take\" to lead the agency and counter threats posed by China, Russia, Iran and North Korea.",
      "If confirmed by the Senate, Ratcliffe will be responsible for carrying out any changes Trump has in mind for the CIA. Trump has said he wants a complete reorganization.",
      "\u201cWe will clean out all of the corrupt actors in our national security and intelligence apparatus, and there are plenty of them,\u201d Trump said in a video from 2023 that supporters recirculated following his win last week. \u201cThe departments and agencies that have been weaponized will be completely overhauled.\u201d",
      "In an effort to head off any difficulties with the president-elect, intelligence agencies are emphasizing their nonpartisan mission and their usefulness to any new president looking to understand a globe complicated by wars in Ukraine and the Middle East and the growing partnership between China, Russia, North Korea and Iran.",
      "London said that in his experience, intelligence officials work hard to avoid any appearance of partisanship and put their constitutional oaths ahead of politics.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s very little agency officials can do,\u201d London added, \u201cother than to show: \u2018We\u2019re here, we\u2019re on your team, we\u2019re here to support you.\u2019\u201d",
      "Intelligence officials won't say if Trump has already received an intelligence briefing, but the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a statement saying it is following a standard procedure for new presidents that dates to Dwight Eisenhower's election.",
      "\u201cODNI is acting consistent with the tradition, in place since 1952, of providing intelligence briefings to the president-elect,\" the office wrote.",
      "During his time in the White House or on the campaign trail, Trump has been anything but traditional, displaying an animosity toward the nation\u2019s spy agencies unlike any seen since Richard Nixon, who believed the CIA and other agencies sought to undermine his presidency.",
      "Trump often railed against the CIA and other spy agencies, accusing them of working to undermine his first administration and seeking to prevent him from retaking the White House. He also has blamed intelligence officials for questioning his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Trump received fewer intelligence briefings as president than any other recent commander in chief. In 2021, President Joe Biden suggested that Trump should no longer receive the standard intelligence briefings given to former presidents, calling Trump \u201cerratic.\u201d",
      "Trump also was accused of mishandling classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate \u2014 a case now stalled in the courts that prosecutors are seeking to wind down following the election.",
      "Trump's win gives him a mandate to carry out his vision for national security and intelligence, said Elbridge Colby, who served as a deputy assistant secretary of defense in the first Trump administration.",
      "Colby said wars in the Middle East and Ukraine, along with China's growing rivalry, show Trump doesn't have time to be delicate with the nation's national security and intelligence agencies, likening them to the Titanic heading toward an iceberg.",
      "\u201cIf you turn the Titanic 90 degrees, people are going to fall out of their bunks, chandeliers and beautiful plates are going to get broken,\" Colby said Sunday on Tucker Carlson's internet show. \u201cBut that's where we are. ... President Trump ran against the system.\u201d"

      "In the Aug. 29 email, Maricopa County Judge Bruce Cohen lamented that he didn\u2019t speak out when Harris was called a \u201cDEI hire,\u201d believes that white men must speak out against unfair treatment of women, and raised a historical lesson from the Holocaust about the need to speak up when people are attacked.

      "Cohen, who was appointed to the bench by Democratic Gov. Janet Napolitano in 2005, was scheduled to retire in January.",
      "Most of the defendants had asked Cohen to throw out the charges under an Arizona law that bars using baseless legal actions in a bid to silence critics. The law had long offered protections in civil cases but was amended in 2022 by the Republican-led Legislature to cover people facing most criminal charges.",
      "Cohen recused himself before deciding whether to dismiss the case, which will be assigned to another judge.",
      "The defendants argued that Mayes tried to use the charges to silence them for their constitutionally protected speech about the 2020 election and actions taken in response to the race\u2019s outcome. They say Mayes campaigned on investigating the fake elector case and had shown a bias against Trump and his supporters.",
      "Prosecutors said the defendants didn\u2019t have evidence to back up their retaliation claim and that they had crossed the line from protected speech to fraud. Mayes\u2019 office also has said the grand jury that brought the indictment wanted to consider charging Trump, but prosecutors urged them not to.",
      "Two defendants have already resolved their cases.",
      "Former Trump campaign attorney Jenna Ellis, who worked closely with Giuliani, signed a cooperation agreement with prosecutors that led to the dismissal of her charges. Republican activist Loraine Pellegrino also became the first person to be convicted in the Arizona case when she pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge and was sentenced to probation.",
      "The remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty to the charges. Trump wasn\u2019t charged in Arizona, but the indictment refers to him as an unindicted coconspirator.",

      "Annual inflation may have risen in October for the first time in seven months, a sign that price increases might be leveling off after steadily cooling for more than two years",
      "WASHINGTON -- Annual inflation may have risen in October for the first time in seven months, a sign that price increases might be leveling off after steadily cooling for more than two years.",
      "Consumer prices are thought to have increased 2.6% from 12 months earlier, according to a survey of economists by the data provider FactSet, up from 2.4% in September. Measured month to month, prices are believed to have ticked up 0.2% from September to October, the same as in the previous month.",
      "Excluding volatile food and energy costs, so-called core prices are forecast to have risen 3.3% from a year earlier, unchanged from the previous month. From September to October, core prices are expected to have risen 0.3% for a third straight month \u2014 a pace that, if sustained, would exceed the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target.",
      "An uptick in prices could fuel concerns in financial markets that progress in taming inflation might be slowing. It might make the Fed less inclined to cut its key interest rate in December and next year, as its officials have previously indicated they likely would.",
      "Still, most economists think inflation will eventually resume its slowdown. Consumer inflation, which peaked at 9.1% in 2022, has since fallen steadily, though overall costs are still about 20% higher than they were three years ago. The price spike soured Americans on the economy and on the Biden-Harris administration's economic stewardship and contributed to Vice President Kamala Harris' loss in last week's presidential election.",
      "Yet Donald Trump\u2019s election victory has raised considerable uncertainty about where inflation might be headed and how the Fed would react if it reaccelerated. Trump has vowed to reduce inflation, mostly by ramping up oil and gas drilling. But mainstream economists have warned that some of his proposals, notably substantially higher tariffs on U.S. imports and mass deportations of migrants, would worsen inflation if fully implemented.",
      "Stock prices surged in the wake of Trump\u2019s election victory, mostly out of optimism that his proposed tax cuts and deregulation would boost the economy and corporate profits. But bond yields also jumped, likely reflecting fear that inflation could stay elevated or even increase.",
      "In addition, the economy is growing faster than many economists had expected earlier this year. It has expanded at nearly a 3% annual rate over the past six months, with consumers, particularly those with higher incomes, spending freely and fueling growth.",
      "\u201cTax cuts and tariffs, among other policy proposals, have the potential to materially impact inflation, inflation expectations and economic growth,\u201d said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. \u201cWith uncertainties around tax and trade policies, inflationary pressures, and economic resilience, the Fed is likely to slow its rate-cutting pace.\u201d",
      "Higher used-car prices are thought to have raised overall inflation last month. Airfares, too, may have helped fuel inflation.",
      "But clothing costs are believed to have declined, along with prices for groceries, gas and other energy sources.",
      "At a news conference last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell expressed confidence that inflation is still heading down to the central bank's 2% target, though perhaps slowly and unevenly.",
      "\u201cWe feel like the story is very consistent with inflation continuing to come down on a bumpy path over the next couple of years and settling around 2%,\u201d Powell said. \u201cOne or two really good data months or bad data months aren\u2019t going to really change the pattern at this point now that we\u2019re this far into the process.\u201d",
      "Powell also noted that most sources of price pressures are cooling, suggesting that inflation isn't likely to accelerate in the coming months. Wages are still growing and have outpaced prices for the past year and a half. But Powell noted that wages aren't rising quickly enough to boost inflation.",
      "A survey released Tuesday by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that consumers expect prices to rise just 2.9% in the next 12 months, which would be the lowest such measure in nearly four years. Lower inflation expectations are important because when consumers expect milder price increases, they're less likely to act in ways that raise inflation, such as accelerating their purchases or demanding higher pay to offset higher prices.",
      "Another potential source of relief for Americans' budgets is in apartment rents. They are now barely rising on average nationwide, according to the real estate brokerage Redfin. Its measure of median rent was just 0.2% higher than it was a year ago in October, at $1,619, though that figure reflects rents only for new leases.",
      "The government's measurement of rents is rising faster because it includes existing rents. Many landlords are still raising monthly payments to reflect higher costs for new leases over the past three years."

      "Apologetic rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine has been sentenced to 45 days in prison after repeatedly violating probation, disappointing a federal judge who rewarded his cooperation in a criminal case against him with leniency five years ago",
      "NEW YORK -- Apologetic rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine was sentenced Tuesday to 45 days in prison by a federal judge who said repeated violations of his probation after his cooperation against a violent gang won him leniency in a criminal case show that he doesn't have sufficient respect for judicial system rules.",
      "Judge Paul A. Engelmayer ordered the additional time be spent behind bars five years after giving the performer whose real name is Daniel Hernandez a two-year prison sentence that likely would have been decades behind bars if he had not testified at trial against the violent gang known as the Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods.",
      "The Manhattan judge said that five violations of probation rules including failing to show up for drug tests, traveling to Las Vegas from his Florida home without permission and lying to his probation officer \u201csay to me loud and clear that you don't believe the rules apply to you.\u201d",
      "He questioned whether Tekashi 6ix9ine, 28, thought he was above the law \u201cmaybe because you\u2019re a famous and wealthy rapper.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut the same rules do apply to you,\u201d Englemayer said.",
      "Before the judge announced the jail time, Tekashi 6ix9ine asked for mercy, saying he was disappointed in himself for having to face him again just a half year before his probation would have expired.",
      "\u201cI'm very sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm not minimizing my actions. I fully take responsibility. I let myself down. I let my family down. Give me an opportunity to clean things up.\u201d",
      "He said he didn't want the judge to \u201cthink of me as ill mannered or I'm a bad person,\" and he insisted that \u201cI don't go out of my way to break the law.\u201d",
      "After his jail stint is finished, Tekashi 6ix9ine will be subject to a month of home incarceration, a month of home detention and a month of curfews as apart of an extension of his probation period by one year. He also will not be allowed to travel internationally and will face electronic monitoring.",
      "In April 2020, Tekashi 6ix9ine was granted compassionate release from prison several months before his sentence was finished because asthma made him susceptible to the coronavirus, which was spreading through the nation\u2019s jails and prisons.",
      "He was arrested on Oct. 29 and has spent the past two weeks in solitary confinement, a particularly harsh detainment that the judge described as a reason why he didn't impose a three-month jail term.",
      "In 2018, Tekashi 6ix9ine was arrested on charges accusing him of joining Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods before trying to get others to commit violence against his perceived enemies.",
      "Engelmayer said the singer's parole violations weren't \u201cgravely serious,\u201d but they were \u201cprofound\u201d breaches of the court's trust.",
      "He also said Tekashi 6ix9ine has \u201crepeatedly flown very close to the flame\u201d as he cited two instances in which he was arrested in the Dominican Republic and a speeding violation for allegedly going 136 mph in a 65 mph zone.",
      "\u201cYour repeated brushes with the law underscore the need to get this message across to you,\u201d the judge said."

      "Officials say a driver has died after going around a barricade on a hurricane-damaged North Carolina highway that became a symbol of Helene\u2019s destruction",
      "WAYNESVILLE, N.C. -- A driver has died after going around a barricade on a hurricane-damaged North Carolina highway that became a symbol of Helene\u2019s destruction, then driving off the roadway, officials said.",
      "Photos of Interstate 40 with multiple lanes washed out by Helene near the Tennessee state line garnered widespread attention in the days after the storm as the region was largely cut off by numerous road closures.",
      "Emergency workers from Tennessee and North Carolina responded to a report of a crash involving a vehicle that went off the collapsed road and down an embankment on eastbound I-40 on Saturday night, according to a news release from the Junaluska Community Volunteer Fire Department.",
      "Crews rappelled down the embankment to reach the vehicle on its side about 100 feet (30 meters) from the road, the fire department said. Images from the scene show a worker trying to reach the crumpled, white vehicle at the bottom of a steep, rubble-covered slope. The driver, the only person in the vehicle, was extricated and taken to a hospital.",
      "The driver, identified as Patricia Mahoney, 63, of Southern Pines, North Carolina, died later that night, according to Sgt. Brandon Miller of the North Carolina State Highway Patrol, which is investigating the cause of the crash. She got on the highway around the 7-mile marker, headed westbound in eastbound lanes and went off the road around the 4-mile marker where the road ends. An autopsy is scheduled. There's no indication of why she went around the barricade, Miller said.",
      "The highway has been closed since late September when flood waters from Hurricane Helene washed away the interstate\u2019s eastbound lanes in four long swaths along the Pigeon River, but the North Carolina Department of Transportation has said it expects to reopen one lane in each direction by the new year."

      "ATLANTA -- Local officials are beginning to certify the results of this year\u2019s presidential election in a process that, so far, has been playing out quietly, in stark contrast to the tumultuous certification period four years ago that followed then-President Donald Trump\u2019s loss.",
      "Georgia was the first of the presidential battleground states to start certifying, with local election boards voting throughout the day Tuesday. As counties certified their results without controversy, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger hailed Georgia\u2019s election as \u201cfree, fair and fast.\u201d",
      "Trump won Georgia and the six other presidential battleground states, after losing six of them to Democrat Joe Biden in 2020. County certification meetings are scheduled later in the week in several other swing states \u2014 Nevada, North Carolina and Wisconsin.",
      "The lack of certification drama so far this week is a return to how the typically routine process worked before Trump lost his bid for reelection four years ago. As he sought then to overturn the will of the voters, he and his allies pressured Republican members of certification boards in Michigan to delay or halt the process. They also sought to delay certifications in Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania.",
      "The boards ultimately voted to certify, but Trump\u2019s focus on certification caught on among Republicans. Some local Republican officials have refused to certify results in elections since then, raising concerns of a wider movement to reject certification this year had Trump lost to Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "Some of that sentiment was present on Tuesday. Michael Heekin, a Republican member of the Fulton County Board of Registration and Elections said he disagreed that certifying election results \u201cis purely a ministerial duty.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe should be the first line of defense, at least one of the lines of defense in examining the goodness and the accuracy of the election,\u201d he said.",
      "A lawyer for the county, which includes heavily Democratic Atlanta, explained during the meeting that certification was a necessary step before any election challenge could proceed. The county election board certified the results late Tuesday.",
      "Unlike Trump four years ago, Harris acknowledged her loss and conceded. Trump also won the popular vote for the first time during his three runs for the White House and praised the election results. Rather than descending on county ballot counting centers in anger, his supporters have been jubilant.",
      "\u201cThis time four years ago, I was getting nasty phone calls constantly in my office,\u201d said Lisa Tollefson, the elections clerk in Rock County, Wisconsin. This year, she said, \u201cit\u2019s been very quiet.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s not to say everyone is happy. Conspiracy theories surrounding this year\u2019s election are circulating within both parties.",
      "Following Election Day, left-wing conspiracy theories proliferated on TikTok, X and other social platforms as users questioned why Harris\u2019 total vote count was around 60 million \u2014 about 20 million fewer votes than Biden received four years ago.",
      "Some right-wing accounts twisted the narrative, falsely claiming the vote gap was instead proof that Biden\u2019s 2020 tally must have included fake votes.",
      "The claims didn\u2019t consider the fact that tabulation would take several days, including in Arizona and California, the nation\u2019s most populous state. As votes continue to be counted this week, Harris has made up ground and now has nearly 72 million votes, a number that will continue to grow.",
      "Counties and other local jurisdictions across the country will be conducting post-election audits of the vote over the next few weeks. Those typically involve hand-counting a certain number of ballots and comparing the results to machine tallies to ensure accuracy.",
      "Before local results are certified, the top election official typically provides the vote totals by candidate in each race along with how many voters cast ballots and how many total ballots were cast. Any discrepancies get reported and explained.",
      "\u201cThe whole point of this period is to find those types of errors,\u201d said Kim Wyman, the former top election official in Washington state. \u201cThey are making sure the results were accurate, that the election was accurate.\u201d",
      "Every state will be going through the process, including presidential battlegrounds.",
      "Election certification meetings start Wednesday in Nevada, which backed a Republican in the presidential race for the first time in 20 years. The state's 17 counties have until Friday to certify, while Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar, a Democrat, and the Nevada Supreme Court must meet by Nov. 26 to finalize the statewide results.",
      "Arizona's 15 counties must certify by Nov. 21 and forward the results to the governor and secretary of state \u2014 both of whom are Democrats \u2014 for statewide certification four days later.",
      "In North Carolina, where election officials recovered quickly after Hurricane Helene devastated the western part of the state, election boards in all 100 counties were scheduled to meet Friday to certify results.",
      "Pennsylvania counties have until Nov. 25 to certify. Some larger counties were still reviewing and counting provisional ballots on Tuesday, the deadline for them to report unofficial results to the state. Litigation was possible with a U.S. Senate race hovering near the threshold for an automatic statewide recount.",
      "Michigan\u2019s 83 county canvassing boards have until Nov. 19 to review local results before forwarding them to the Board of State Canvassers. The four-member board, comprised of two Democrats and two Republicans, is scheduled to certify the results by Nov. 25.",
      "In Wisconsin, counties began the canvass process on Tuesday and have until Nov. 19 to certify. The Wisconsin Elections Commission will review the county reports and the chair \u2014 currently a Democrat \u2014 will certify the results by Dec. 1.",
      "The biggest potential problem in the state was identified on Election Day and corrected. Vote-tabulating machines used for mail ballots in Milwaukee were not properly sealed. A bipartisan decision was made to start over the process of counting the ballots once the problem was addressed.",
      "The state\u2019s nonpartisan top election administrator, Meagan Wolfe, said the election had been a success with no major problems. She attributed that to years of training and preparations by local election workers.",

    "story": [
      "Louisiana Attorney General Elizabeth Murrill says the state will ask a federal appeals court to quickly stay a lower court's order declaring unconstitutional a law requiring that the Ten Commandments be displayed in every public classroom by Jan. 1",
      "BATON ROUGE, LA. -- A new Louisiana requirement that the Ten Commandments be displayed in all public classrooms is \u201cunconstitutional on its face,\" a federal judge ruled Tuesday, ordering state education officials not to take steps to enforce it and to notify all local school boards in the state of his decision.",
      "U.S. District Judge John W. deGravelles in Baton Rouge said the law had an \u201covertly religious\u201d purpose, and rejected state officials' claims that the government can mandate the posting of the Ten Commandments because they hold historical significance to the foundation of U.S. law. His opinion noted that no other foundational documents \u2014 including the Constitution or the Bill of Rights \u2014 must be posted.",
      "Attorney General Elizabeth Murrill said she disagreed with the ruling and said her office would ask the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans to quickly stay the ruling pending appeal. Murrill said that by law, deGravelles' ruling can only apply to five local school boards named as defendants in the lawsuit \u2014 in East Baton Rouge, Livingston, St. Tammany, Orleans and Vernon parishes.",
      "That, Murrill said in a Tuesday interview, leaves Louisiana's 67 other school systems subject to the law. However, she acknowledged that deGravelles' order could have a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on any local board's decision to enforce the law.",
      "\u201cThe order itself creates confusion with regard to whether other school boards are subject to it,\u201d Murrill said. \u201cLegally, they\u2019re not. But I think it\u2019s plain intent was to create confusion.\u201d",
      "Murrill, a Republican who joined Gov. Jeff Landry in supporting the law, said the state disagrees with deGravelles' finding that the law conflicts with Supreme Court precedent and said she hopes the 5th Circuit stays his order quickly.",
      "DeGravelles ordered the state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education, state Superintendent Cade Brumley and five local school boards that are named as defendants in the case not to take any steps to enforce the requirement. The board and Brumley were also ordered to notify all local school boards that the law is unconstitutional. Murrill issued a statement Tuesday saying",
      "In granting a preliminary injunction, DeGravelles said opponents of the law are likely to win their ongoing lawsuit against the law. The lawsuit argues that the law violates the First Amendment's provisions forbidding the government from establishing a religion or blocking the free exercise of religion. They had argued that the poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments would isolate students, especially those who are not Christian.",
      "DeGravelles said the law amounts to unconstitutional religious government coercion of students: \u201cAs Plaintiffs highlight, by law, parents must send their minor children to school and ensure attendance during regular school hours at least 177 days per year.\u201d",
      "Proponents say that the measure is not solely religious, but that it has historical significance to the foundation of U.S. law.",
      "Plaintiffs in the case were a group of parents of Louisiana public school children.",
      "The new law in Louisiana, a reliably Republican state that is ensconced in the Bible Belt, was passed by the state's GOP-dominated Legislature earlier this year.",
      "The legislation, which has been touted by Republicans including President-elect Donald Trump, is one of the latest pushes by conservatives to incorporate religion into classrooms \u2014 from Florida legislation allowing school districts to have volunteer chaplains to counsel students to Oklahoma\u2019s top education official ordering public schools to incorporate the Bible into lessons.",
      "In recent years, similar bills requiring the Ten Commandments to be displayed in classrooms have been proposed in other states including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah. However, with threats of legal battles over the constitutionality of such measures, none have gone into effect.",
      "In 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law was unconstitutional and violated the First Amendment establishment, which says Congress can \u201cmake no law respecting an establishment of religion.\u201d The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather served a plainly religious purpose.",
      "Louisiana\u2019s legislation, which applies to all public K-12 schools and state-funded university classrooms, requires the Ten Commandments to be displayed on a poster or framed document at least 11 inches by 14 inches (28 by 36 centimeters) where the text is the central focus and \u201cprinted in a large, easily readable font.\u201d",
      "Each poster must be paired with the four-paragraph \u201ccontext statement\u201d describing how the Ten Commandments \u201cwere a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries.\u201d",
      "Tens of thousands of posters would likely be needed to satisfy the new law. Proponents say schools are not required to spend public money on the posters, and instead that they can be bought using donations or that groups and organizations will donate the actual posters.",

      "Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to be ambassador to Israel, has long rejected a Palestinian state in territory previously seized by Israel and has repeatedly signaled his staunch support for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",
      "Huckabee, a former TV host and Baptist preacher, frequently visits Israel and once said he wanted to buy a holiday home there. He has maintained throughout the years that the West Bank belongs to Israel, and recently said \u201cthe title deed was given by God to Abraham and to his heirs.\u201d",
      "His argument for a so-called \u201cone-state solution\u201d contradicts longstanding official U.S. support for the eventual establishment of a Palestinian state.",
      "He has described the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas as \u201chorrific\" and \" beyond anything I\u2019ve ever witnessed in my lifetime\u201d and argued that the U.S. needs to stand firmly behind Israel.",
      "Here are some things Huckabee has said over the years about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.",
      "Huckabee has never supported a two-state compromise even when Netanyahu endorsed the idea in 2009.",
      "Israel captured the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war. Palestinians want those territories for a future state and view them as parts of a single country now under military occupation.",
      "The U.S., along with most of the international community, has supported the establishment of a Palestinian state based on the 1967 lines as the cornerstone of a peace agreement. Even Israel\u2019s hardline prime minister once endorsed a two-state solution while rejecting a return to Israel\u2019s pre-1967 lines. Netanyahu now rejects the creation of a Palestinian state.",
      "Huckabee has never supported any solution that would require Israeli settlers to be uprooted.",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press in 2015, Huckabee, then running for the GOP presidential nomination, said recognizing the West Bank as Israeli would be the \u201cformal position\u201d of his administration. He criticized Israel's 2005 withdrawal from Gaza and described settlers evacuated by Israeli forces as having been \u201cmarched at gunpoint.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel that we have a responsibility to respect that this is land that has historically belonged to the Jews,\u201d he said.",
      "In 2015, Huckabee likened the Iran nuclear deal to marching Israelis \u201cto the door of the oven,\u201d a reference to the crematorium in a Nazi concentration camp during the Holocaust.",
      "Huckabee was criticizing then-President Barack Obama for his role in the agreement the U.S. and other world powers reached with Tehran. Republicans back then were united in their opposition to the deal, arguing it didn\u2019t address Iran's support for terrorism. Trump during his first administration withdrew from the deal, in which Iran agreed to limit its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.",
      "The comment was denounced by Democrats, but Huckabee stood by it.",
      "In a recent interview with a podcaster, Huckabee said he did not believe in referring to the Arab descendants of people who lived in British-controlled Palestine as \u201cPalestinians.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere really isn\u2019t such a thing,\u201d he said earlier this year on \u201cThink Twice\u201d with Jonathan Tobin. \u201cIt\u2019s a term that was co-opted by Yasser Arafat in 1962,\u201d referring to one of the early leaders of the Palestine Liberation Organization.",
      "During the same podcast, Huckabee described himself as an \u201cunapologetic, unreformed Zionist.\u201d",
      "In defending Israel, Huckabee said he wished people understood that \u201cthis is an extraordinary oasis in a land of totalitarianism surrounded by tyranny.\u201d",
      "The former governor also said many \u201cradical Muslims want to take us back to the seventh century.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don't want to go back there,\u201d he said. \u201cI like modernity.\u201d",
      "Huckabee has described the attack on Oct. 7, 2023, as \u201chorrific\u201d and \u201cbeyond anything I\u2019ve ever witnessed in my lifetime.\" He was outraged by how Hamas spread images of the killings on social media.",
      "\u201cAs horrible as the Nazis were, they weren\u2019t posting their atrocities on social media and trying to trumpet what they were doing to the world,\u201d he said in an appearance with the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews. \u201cWhich is what makes this horrendous thing Hamas has done so much, to me, worse, because they want everyone to see what they\u2019ve done.\u201d",
      "Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took about 250 people hostage. Israel responded with one of the deadliest and most destructive military campaigns in recent history, killing more than 43,000 people, Palestinian health officials say."

      "WASHINGTON -- Republican senators will gather behind closed doors Wednesday to decide who will replace longtime Senate leader Mitch McConnell and lead their new majority next year \u2014 a decision that could shape the future of the Senate, and the party, as Donald Trump reclaims the presidency.",
      "South Dakota Sen. John Thune, Texas Sen. John Cornyn and Florida Sen. Rick Scott have been scrambling to win the most votes in the secret ballot election, promising a new direction in the Senate even as they furiously compete for Trump's favor. It will be the first test of Trump\u2019s relationship with Congress after he won the election decisively and claimed a mandate for his agenda.",
      "It\u2019s uncertain who will win.",
      "Thune and Cornyn have campaigned mostly within the Senate, working senators individually and privately and raising millions of dollars for Senate GOP candidates. Both quickly mobilized in March after McConnell announced he would step aside from leadership.",
      "Scott has run an insurgent campaign outside of the Senate, campaigning publicly as the candidate closest to Trump and winning endorsements from people who are close to the former and future president. Scott received an outpouring of support on X over the weekend as Trump allies, including Elon Musk, pushed his bid.",
      "Who senators choose, and whether Trump ultimately endorses a candidate in the final hours, could set the tone for Trump\u2019s attempts to assert control over the legislative branch in his second presidency. His relationship with McConnell was strained in his first term, and Trump was often frustrated that lawmakers would not fully bend to his will.",
      "Both Cornyn and Thune have drawn closer to Trump in recent months after criticizing him as he tried to overturn his election defeat in 2020. But the two longtime senators are both viewed by their colleagues as institutionalists more in the mold of McConnell, while Scott has worked to gather support outside of the Senate, and within Trump's inner circle, to pressure an overhaul within.",
      "\u201cWe got a mandate a week ago that people want change,\" said Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, who is supporting Scott, as he walked into a forum for the candidates on Tuesday night. \u201cThey want President Trump to have more leeway than he had last time. He was kind of tied down a little bit.\u201d",
      "Tuberville said that whoever is chosen, he wants to make sure Trump \u201cfeels good about it.\u201d",
      "No matter who wins, all three senators have shown they will defer to the incoming president as the leader of the party, and that they are willing to cede some of the Senate\u2019s power to do so.",
      "When Trump posted on X Sunday that the new leader \u201cmust agree\u201d to allow him to appoint Cabinet members and others when the Senate is on recess, avoiding confirmation votes, all three quickly signaled they were open to the idea.",
      "To select the new leader, Senate Republicans will meet privately in a ceremonial space in the Capitol for several hours to hear the candidates make their case. Few aides are allowed in. The contenders will each be introduced and nominated by two other senators, and then they make a speech of their own. Ballots are cast secretly. If no one wins a majority on the first ballot, they proceed to a second round, and so on, until someone wins a majority of the vote.",
      "The clubby contest is a stark contrast from the House, where lawmakers publicly announce their votes for speaker in an election on the House floor.",
      "And aside from Scott\u2019s challenge to McConnell two years ago, in which he won 10 votes, it is the first competitive election for Republican leader in three decades. McConnell, who has been a force for the party but has repeatedly feuded with Trump, was uncontested when he first became party leader in 2007.",
      "Unlike most previous contests, there is no clear front-runner going into the election. Because senators are casting secret ballots, the majority won't say who they are voting for. And some may never tell.",
      "\u201cIt's a secret ballot and it's a secret ballot for a reason,\u201d said South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds, who said early on he would support his home state colleague Thune. \u201cEach member chooses the leader that they think they can work with the best over this two year period of time.\u201d",
      "Rounds said that he prefers the way that Thune and Cornyn have \u201chandled it one-on-one with everybody,\u201d but that he had talked to Scott as well. \u201cWe've got three qualified individuals,\u201d he said.",
      "One thing all candidates agree on is change from McConnell, who called most of the shots as leader \u2014 a top demand from the far-right faction of the caucus who disagreed with McConnell on aid to Ukraine and increasingly turned on him as he feuded with Trump.",
      "Thune, Scott and Cornyn said they would like to see more opportunity for individual senators to bring bills to the floor and offer amendments, and they have pledged to be better communicators within the conference than the often-reserved McConnell. At the forum on Tuesday evening, the three agreed on many of the issues discussed, according to senators leaving the meeting.",
      "Thune, McConnell\u2019s current No. 2, has been seen by colleagues as an incumbent of sorts, having taken over for several weeks last year when McConnell was absent due to medical reasons. He is well-liked among his fellow senators, and was seen for some time as the front-runner in the race. But Cornyn, who served as McConnell\u2019s No. 2 before Thune, is also well-liked and has also won some commitments from colleagues.",
      "Thune and Cornyn are similar on policy, voting generally in step with the conference but working with Democrats at times. Cornyn is a longtime member of the Senate Judiciary Committee who took a leading role on bipartisan gun legislation two years ago. Thune worked across the aisle as a former chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee.",
      "The two differ on whether the leader should be term limited \u2014 a key demand from some in the conservative wing. Cornyn has pushed for limits, while Thune has not.",
      "Scott, the former governor of Florida, was elected in 2018 and quickly positioned himself as a foil to McConnell, running against him for leader in 2022 and aligning with Utah Sen. Mike Lee and others who have been highly critical of the current leadership. As Thune and Cornyn wooed their colleagues all year, Scott spent most of the year tied up in his own reelection race. He handily defeated Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell by more than 10 points.",
      "Scott has campaigned on his business experience. He said Tuesday night that the pitch boils down to that \u201cI support Donald Trump's agenda. He's got a mandate.\u201d",
      "Also voting in the election on Wednesday are the senators-elect who handed Republicans the majority next year, even though they aren't yet sworn in. Republican Bernie Moreno, who beat Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, attended the forum on Tuesday night and said afterward that there was \u201cincredible energy\u201d in the room.",
      "Still, he said that he hasn't decided who he will vote for. \u201cWe've got three great candidates who should get us to where we are going,\u201d he said."

      "In the first seriously contested Senate Republican leadership election in decades, three senators are vying to replace longtime GOP leader Mitch McConnell when he steps down from the post at the beginning of next year",
      "WASHINGTON -- In the first seriously contested Senate Republican leadership election in decades, three senators are vying to replace longtime GOP leader Mitch McConnell when he steps down from the post at the beginning of next year and Republicans take back the Senate majority.",
      "South Dakota Sen. John Thune, Texas Sen. John Cornyn and Florida Sen. Rick Scott have been furiously campaigning to win their colleagues\u2019 support in the secret-ballot election Wednesday. All three are trying to convince their colleagues that they have the ear of President-elect Donald Trump and will be the best person to implement his agenda.",
      "They are also trying to differentiate themselves from McConnell, saying they will give rank-and-file senators more power and be more communicative.",
      "It\u2019s not clear who will win, or if there will be multiple rounds of votes before a winner is chosen.",
      "A look at the three candidates:",
      "Thune, 63, defeated then-Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle in 2004 after arguing during the campaign that Daschle had lost his South Dakota roots during his years in Democratic leadership. Now Thune is running to become majority leader himself.",
      "Well liked and a respected communicator, Thune has been perceived as a front-runner for much of the year. He is currently the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, and took over for McConnell for a few weeks last year when he was on a medical leave. He is also a former chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee.",
      "As he geared up to run for leader, Thune spent much of the year campaigning for his colleagues. According to his aides, he raised more than $31 million to elect Senate Republicans this cycle, including a $4 million transfer from his own campaign accounts to the Senate\u2019s main campaign arm.",
      "One potential liability for Thune has been his previously rocky relationship with Trump. Thune was highly critical of the then-president as he tried to overturn his election defeat in 2020 and after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by Trump\u2019s supporters. Thune said then that Trump\u2019s efforts to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power were \u201cinexcusable.\u201d",
      "This year, though, Thune and Trump have talked frequently on the phone and Thune visited the then-GOP candidate at his home in Florida. Thune told The Associated Press over the summer that he views their potential relationship as a professional one. If they both win their elections, Thune said, \u201cwe\u2019ve got a job to do.\u201d",
      "Like Thune, Cornyn is a popular and respected member of the Senate GOP conference. A former Texas attorney general and member of the state Supreme Court, much of his work has been on the Senate Judiciary Committee. He was also McConnell\u2019s No. 2, the job Thune now holds, for six years before he was term-limited out of the job.",
      "Cornyn, 72, has also spent much of the year courting his colleagues one by one and fundraising for them around the country. He has long been one of the best fundraisers in the Senate, and his aides say he has raised more than $400 million for party candidates during his 22 years in office.",
      "In 2022, after a gunman stormed a Texas elementary school and killed 19 children and two teachers, Cornyn was tapped by McConnell to lead the GOP in negotiating gun legislation with Democrats. The bill, passed that summer, stepped up background checks for buyers under 21, increased prosecutions for unlicensed gun sellers and put millions of dollars into youth mental health services. While Cornyn has touted his work on the gun bill, it could cost him some votes with the conference\u2019s most conservative members.",
      "Cornyn also had some past tensions with Trump, including his early suggestions that Trump might not be the best GOP candidate to run in 2024. But he, too, has smoothed relations with the incoming president, meeting him when he was in Texas to campaign and visiting him in Florida.",
      "While Thune and Cornyn both have leadership experience and have spent the better part of the year methodically trying to woo individual senators, Scott is running a different kind of campaign. And he believes he has a distinct advantage: his relationship with Trump.",
      "Scott, a former two-term governor of Florida and a successful businessman, was reelected to a second term in the Senate last week, beating Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell by more than 10 points. He is a longtime booster of the incoming president, and has positioned himself as a strong ally. Scott traveled to New York to support Trump during Trump\u2019s hush money trial earlier this year, and has openly said he wants Trump to endorse him.",
      "He won a rush of support on social media over the weekend when he was endorsed by people close to Trump, including Elon Musk. But Trump has not weighed in on the Senate contest.",
      "It\u2019s unclear if Scott\u2019s outside approach could win him more support in the clubby Senate. He won 10 votes when he challenged McConnell for the post in 2022, and he will be aiming to improve that count in the first round of balloting Wednesday.",
      "Scott, 71, is part of a growing group of far-right senators who have criticized McConnell\u2019s tenure and advocated for more power for individual members. Several senators in that group, including Utah Sen. Mike Lee and Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, have endorsed him, arguing that his business experience and relationship with Trump should put him over the top."

      "Financial markets greeted Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the US presidential election with a blistering rally.",
      "That's despite considerable debate about how Trump\u2019s plans for tariffs, lower taxes and mass migrant deportations might affect the world\u2019s largest economy.",
      "A week on, the surge finally appears to be settling. The three major stock indexes in the US ended the day lower on Tuesday, after rising roughly 5% since 4 November, the day before the election.",
      "Here are some of the companies that have come out ahead, as investors try to game out what the next four years might bring.",
      "Tesla",
      "Tesla shares have surged roughly 35% since 4 November.",
      "The rally has pushed the market value of the firm back above $1tn for the first time since 2022 and boosted the wealth of boss Elon Musk, who owns a roughly 13% stake in the company, by more than $50bn.",
      "It marks a bet by investors that a Trump White House might ease up on some of the investigations by safety regulators into features such as self-driving.",
      "The ties between Trump and Musk could also help Tesla navigate shifts in relationship between the US and China, where the company has a significant presence.",
      "Although Trump is generally expected to reduce government support for electric vehicles, such as tax credits, analysts say this could actually benefit Tesla, the market leader in the US, making it harder for rivals to catch up.",
      "Cryptocurrency",
      "The price of the best-known cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, jumped more than 25% to new all-time records this week on the back of Trump's win, briefly storming past $89,000.",
      "The gains are a sign that investors are anticipating big changes for the sector, which faced a crackdown under the Biden administration from regulators warning it was rife with hucksters and fraudsters.",
      "Trump once also called crypto a scam, but he changed his tune on the campaign trail this year, promising to make the US the \u201ccrypto capital of the planet\u201d.",
      "He said he would create a strategic bitcoin stockpile and sack Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler, who had sparked anger by taking legal action against firms under existing financial laws.",
      "Crypto firms insist their sector should be subject to new, tailor-made rules. That likely depends on Congress, where they could also get a friendlier hearing this year.",
      "Banks",
      "Shares in some of America's biggest banks have seen double digit gains since the day before the election as investors bet financial firms will be among the most immediate beneficiaries of Trump's promises for lighter regulation.",
      "Among other issues, he will now have a voice shaping pending rules that set how much cash banks must keep on hand as financial cushion.",
      "Trump is also expected to part ways with Lina Khan, current head of the Federal Trade Commission, who is known for her anti-monopoly views and is blamed for casting a chill on deal-making, a key business for banks.",
      "Shares in Capital One and Discover, which have a merger under review by regulators, have jumped more than 15% since the result.",
      "Prison operators",
      "Shares in the leading publicly traded prison firms GEO Group and CoreCivic have jumped roughly 70% since 4 November.",
      "The gains point to the big opportunity investors see for private prison operators as Trump vows to round up and deport millions of migrants.",
      "In 2021, President Joe Biden had ordered the Justice Department to stop doing business with private prison companies.",
      "But Trump, who reversed a similar order during his first term, is expected to change that policy and drive new business, as he looks for help to carry out his immigration promises.",
      "Trump's first actions as president have been focused on assembling the team in charge of immigration policy, a signal it is likely to be a priority.",
      "The dollar",
      "The dollar index is hovering at its highest level since April, rising more than 2% in the last week.",
      "It is good news for American tourists travelling abroad - but a more mixed signal about the economy.",
      "That is in part because the strength of the dollar is closely tied to interest rates, which investors are now betting could stay higher than previously anticipated.",
      "It partially reflects data from before the election suggesting the US economy is stronger than previously understood.",
      "But investors also see a risk that lower taxes, less immigration and new trade barriers could keep pressure on inflation, making the US central bank more reluctant to cut interest rates.",
      "Last week, the Federal Reserve offered little guidance about the months ahead, saying it was too early to tell what impact Trump's policies might have."

      "Mr Duffy lives in a traditional stone-walled detached house in Sheffield. He estimates that he spends \u00a33,100 every year on heating and electricity.",
      "Despite being someone who cares about climate change, and keen to retrofit his property to make it more efficient, there\u2019s a problem.",
      "\u201cThe whole question of how to better insulate the house is a real mystery to me,\u201d says Mr Duffy, a director of sustainability think-tank Citizen Network. \u201cI don\u2019t know where the expertise for that is.\u201d He also adds that he\u2019s also not sure whether he could install solar panels, given that he lives in a conservation area.",
      "Millions of homeowners across the country could be facing the same dilemma.",
      "Around 29 million British homes require retrofitting by 2050, according to the UK Green Building Council, an industry body.",
      "Retrofitting might involve measures such as improving your home\u2019s insulation, upgrading the heating system, or installing energy-generating devices such as solar panels, or even a private wind turbine.",
      "These adjustments can cost thousands of pounds up front, but, if properly executed, they could improve comfort and reduce people\u2019s bills in the long-run.",
      "Plus, increased energy efficiency ought to cut carbon emissions from homes, especially if property owners switch away from gas or oil-fired boilers, for example.",
      "Roughly one fifth of the UK\u2019s total emissions comes from residential buildings.",
      "Amy Peace and her husband live in the northwest of England, near Warrington. The pair both work in sustainability, advising businesses on their path to net zero.",
      "They were keen to improve the quality of their home and apply the principles they promote at work to their own lives \u2013 but they too faced challenges when deciding on how to go about it.",
      "\u201cEven though we\u2019ve got this background, and we\u2019re engineers as well, what we weren\u2019t entirely clear on was where was best to spend the money,\u201d says Mrs Peace.",
      "The couple spoke to multiple consultants, but Mrs Peace found the advice they received was often geared towards meeting Passivhaus standards \u2013 an ultra-energy efficient type of building.",
      "\u201cThere weren\u2019t many in that pragmatic middle space where you are literally saying, \u2018We\u2019ve got this much money, where would we be best putting it?\u2019,\u201d Mrs Peace adds.",
      "Perseverance during the past three years paid off, however, and the couple\u2019s 1930\u2019s detached house now has improved insulation, a heat pump, and an electric car charging point. Solar panels and battery will follow shortly, if all goes to plan.",
      "Conscious of the confusion around approaches to retrofit, some organisations are moving to improve the advice available to homeowners. Among them is Ecofurb.",
      "\u201cWe can model all the different options that are available, suitable for your home and your budget, and identify a package of measures,\u201d says Liz Lain\u00e9, of Parity Projects, a housing data analysis company, which runs Ecofurb.",
      "The firm offers this initial consultation for free, but full plans, with personalised input from a retrofit coordinator, start at \u00a3470. Ecofurb can also oversee any works as they are carried out by contractors to avoid \u201chorror stories\u201d, says Ms Lain\u00e9.",
      "There are many other organisations that offer to help homeowners plan a retrofit.",
      "The work often involves carrying out a heat-loss survey, to spot cold areas that require insulation, and to better understand a property\u2019s heating demand. Experts might also advise on the suitability of solar panels for your home, for example.",
      "There\u2019s the Get a Heat Pump website, launched by the charities Nesta and The MCS Foundation, which explains what heat pumps are and how they might fit into a home renovation plan.",
      "RICS, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, has also just launched a new retrofit standard for its members \u2013 essentially, it encourages surveyors with the appropriate training to offer their services to homeowners planning or undergoing a retrofit.",
      "The RICS website will soon include a range of retrofit advice and a tool to help homeowners find a suitable surveyor in their local area, says Steve Lees, from the RICS retrofit project team.",
      "Improving the energy efficiency of homes is \u201cessential\u201d for decarbonisation, says Gerald Charles, head of housing retrofit at the Centre for Sustainable Energy, but he adds that the current lack of good advice remains a genuine problem.",
      "\u201cThe industry as a whole don\u2019t appreciate the importance of good retrofit advice,\u201d he says.",
      "One entrepreneur who has noticed a knowledge gap in the market is James Major, founder and chief executive of HubbPro, which helps architects plan energy efficient buildings. Architects don\u2019t always have the latest information about how to incorporate energy-saving technologies into their designs, notes Mr Major.",
      "\u201cClean tech isn\u2019t part of what they do or what they should know \u2013 that\u2019s an engineering function,\u201d he says. And yet architects\u2019 clients increasingly ask about such tech when planning a new home or an extension.",
      "Through an initiative called MyHubb, Mr Major is now offering architects detailed reports that estimate the carbon reduction potential and payback period on retrofitted measures - such as heat pump-based heating systems or solar panels, for instance.",
      "He says these reports cost around \u00a31,000, though he adds that this price is not yet finalised.",
      "Mr Duffy says he will keep looking for solutions to his own retrofit conundrum. But he makes another point. So much of the currently available technology and advice is tailored to individual homeowners.",
      "He suggests that neighbourhood-scale schemes, for example to provide solar power to a whole street, might make more sense and could include more people in one go.",

      "Three years ago, a court in The Hague backed a case by Friends of the Earth and 17,000 Dutch citizens requiring Shell to reduce its CO2 emissions significantly, in line with the Paris climate accords.",

      "Uplift accused regulators of \"failing to be transparent\" in granting the consents and said Rosebank would damage marine life in the North Sea.",
      "The UK government said in August that it would not fight any cases over Rosebank and Jackdaw.",

      "Ruth Crawford KC, who is acting for Greenpeace during the case, told the court that the greenhouse gas emissions from Rosebank and Jackdaw would be \u201csizeable and significant\u201d and would have a \u201csubstantial impact\u201d on the environment and human health.",
      "She said the UK government had admitted that it was an \u201cerror of law\u201d to have failed to have taken into account greenhouse gas emissions from the eventual burning of oil and gas extracted from Rosebank and Jackdaw (known as Scope 3 emissions).",
      "Ms Crawford said granting a licence was ultimately a political decision but it must be done only after a lawful consenting process which included an environmental impact assessment taking into account Scope 3 emissions.",
      "She said politicians must not simply consider short-term issues when considering oil and gas projects but also the long-term effect on the climate.",
      "In this case, she argued, they failed to do so (because information about Scope 3 emissions was not available).",
      "To allow these two fields to proceed without a new environmental impact assessment taking into account Scope 3 emissions \u201cwould be to completely ignore that a crucial part of the decision making has not happened and will never happen.\u201d",
      "Greenpeace, she said, was not asking for oil rigs and drilling equipment to be removed. It was only asking that the oil and gas companies involved \u201cdo no further work to get petroleum from the fields.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe work must stop. No more. No less,\u201d she concluded.",

      "On the contrary, argued Mr Duncan, the legal landscape had been far from stable and Rosebank\u2019s developers Equinor and Ithaca were now \u201cthe beneficiaries of an unlawful decision,\u201d who wanted the court \u201cto allow them to continue to be the beneficiaries of an unlawful decision.\u201d",
      "Mr Duncan went on to outline another objection to the granting of consent for Rosebank.",
      "He argued that, in approving the field, the Oil and Gas Authority (now known as the North Sea Transition Authority) had unlawfully and irrationally failed to give reasons for its decision.",
      "Uplift has a third objection to the decision, claiming that the previous government and the regulator failed to adequately assess the marine impacts of Rosebank.",

      "The snapshot survey by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) found people working from home gained almost an hour on average from not needing to commute.",
      "The data, which includes people who worked for at least seven hours, suggested those working from home spent 10 minutes less working on average, although the ONS said its estimates were not precise enough to be sure it was the case.",
      "The data shows where people said they were working on the day they completed the survey, rather than their wider working pattern.",

      "Working solely from home has gradually become less common since the end of the Covid pandemic.",
      "In October, 13% of working adults in Great Britain said they did their job solely from home, according to the ONS.",
      "But hybrid working - a mix of working from home and in the office or on a site - has become more popular, though only 28% of people said they had such a working arrangement.",
      "The ONS said working parents were more likely to have hybrid working arrangements (35%), compared with workers that do not have children (24%).",
      "Of working parents, men were more likely to hybrid work than women, at 41% and 30% respectively, although it is not clear what factors are driving the difference.",

      "Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election has helped push the price of Bitcoin to a series of record highs.",
      "Backers of the digital currency are celebrating, and wondering how much more valuable it could become - with some suggesting it could reach $100,000 per coin.",
      "Its price is rocketing because the president-elect has vowed to make the US \"the crypto capital of the planet\" - a remarkable turnaround given as recently as 2021 he was calling Bitcoin a \"scam.\"",
      "He even started accepting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as donations to his election campaign and raised millions from the industry.",
      "But that is just one of the many twists and turns in the jaw-dropping story of Bitcoin, which continues to captivate people worldwide and has seen the making - and losing - of huge fortunes.",
      "Here's the BBC's list of the seven wildest moments - so far - in Bitcoin's tumultuous history.",
      "1. The mysterious creator of Bitcoin",
      "Despite its enormous profile, no-one actually knows for sure who invented Bitcoin. The idea for it was posted on internet forums in 2008 by someone calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto.",
      "They explained how a peer-to-peer digital cash system could work to enable people to send virtual coins over the internet, just as easily as sending an email.",
      "Satoshi created a complex computer system that would process transactions and create new coins using a huge network of self-appointed volunteers around the world who used special software and powerful computers.",
      "But he - or they - never revealed their identity, and the world has never worked it out.",
      "In 2014, Japanese-American man Dorian Nakamoto was pursued by reporters who thought he was the elusive Bitcoin creator, but it proved to be false lead caused by some mistranslated information.",
      "Australian computer scientist Craig Wright said it was him in 2016 - but after years of legal battles, a High Court judge concluded he was not Satoshi.",
      "Earlier this year, a Canadian Bitcoin expert called Peter Todd strongly denied being Satoshi, while in London this month a British man, Stephen Mollah, claimed he was - but no-one believed him.",
      "2. Making history with pizza",
      "Bitcoin now underpins a two trillion-dollar cryptocurrency industry - but the first recorded transaction using it was the purchase of pizza.",
      "On 22 May 2010, Lazlo Hanyecz, offered $41 worth of Bitcoin on a crypto forum in return for two pizzas.",
      "A 19-year-old student obliged and the day went down in history for fans of the currency as #BitcoinPizza day.",
      "A source of memes for those in crypto community, it also showcased the power of Bitcoin - an internet money that could genuinely buy items online.",
      "Criminals must have been watching too, because within a year the first darknet marketplace was launched selling drugs and other illegal goods in exchange for Bitcoin.",
      "The deal looks pretty bad for Lazlo now too. If he had held onto those coins they would now be worth hundreds of millions of dollars!",
      "3. Becoming legal tender",
      "In September 2021, President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador, central America, made Bitcoin legal tender.",
      "Hairdressers, supermarkets and other shops had to accept Bitcoin by law, alongside its main currency, the US dollar.",
      "Many Bitcoin enthusiasts and reporters visited the area, briefly boosting tourism to the country.",
      "While President Bukele hoped the move would increase investment in his country and cut costs for citizens exchanging money, it did not become as popular as he hoped.",
      "He is still hoping it will take off but for now the US dollar still remains king in the country.",
      "As well as the huge amount of public money President Bukele spent on trying to make people embrace Bitcoin he also, controversially, bought more than 6,000 bitcoins over the past few years.",
      "The president spent at least $120m buying up bitcoins at various prices in the hope of making a profit for his cash-strapped country.",
      "It started to look good for him in December 2023 when, for the first time, his stash skyrocketed in value.",
      "A website built by Dutch software engineer Elias Zerrouq is tracking the country's Bitcoin holdings and currently estimates that the coins have risen 98% in value.",
      "4. Kazakhstan's crypto boom and bust",
      "In 2021, Kazakhstan became a hotspot for Bitcoin mining - the process of crunching through the complex calculations that underpin crypto transactions.",
      "These days it takes warehouses full of the latest computers running all day and all night, but the reward is brand new bitcoins for those companies that take part.",
      "Warehouses of computers require lots of power - and many businesses moved to Kazakhstan where electricity was abundant thanks to huge coal reserves.",
      "At first the government welcomed them with open arms as they brought investment.",
      "But too many miners arrived and put huge strain on the electricity grid, putting the country at risk of blackouts.",
      "Within a year, Kazakhstan's Bitcoin mining industry went from boom to bust as the government imposed restrictions and increased taxes to curb the growth.",
      "Around the world it is estimated that the Bitcoin network uses as much electricity as a small country, raising concerns about its environmental impact.",
      "5. Bitcoins in the rubbish dump",
      "Imagine having a crypto wallet worth more than $100m (\u00a378m) - and then  accidentally throwing away a hard drive containing the login details.",
      "That's what James Howells, from south Wales, says happened to him",
      "The very nature of crypto means that recovery is not as easy as resetting your password. With no banks involved - there is no customer support helpline.",
      "Unfortunately for him, his local council in Newport refused to let him access the landfill site where he says the device ended up - even after he offered to donate 25% of his Bitcoin stash to local charities if they let him.",
      "He told the BBC: \"It was a penny dropping moment and it was a sinking feeling.\"",
      "6. Crypto King fraudster",
      "No one has lost as much Bitcoin as former billionaire crypto mogul, Sam Bankman-Fried. The founder of the massive crypto firm FTX was nicknamed the Crypto King and loved by the community.",
      "FTX was a cryptocurrency exchange that allowed people to trade normal money for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.",
      "His empire was worth an estimated $32bn and he was flying high until everything came crashing down within days.",
      "Journalists had discovered that Bankman-Fried's company was financially shaky and had been illegally transferring FTX customer funds to prop up his other company, Alameda Research.",
      "Just before his arrest at his luxury apartment complex in the Bahamas in December 2022 he spoke to reporters. He told the BBC: \"I don't think I committed fraud. I didn't want any of this to happen. I was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was.\"",
      "After being extradited to the US he was found guilty of fraud and money laundering and was jailed for 25 years.",
      "7. Investment bank boom",
      "Despite all the turmoil, Bitcoin continues to attract attention from investors and big companies.",
      "In fact, in January 2024, some of the biggest financial firms in the world added Bitcoin to their official asset lists as Spot Bitcoin ETFs. These are like stocks and shares, linked to the value of Bitcoin but you don't have to personally own any.",
      "Customers have been pouring billions into these brand new products. Companies including Blackrock, Fidelity and GrayScale, have also been buying up Bitcoins in their thousands, pushing up its value to record highs.",
      "It is a huge milestone for crypto with some fans believing that Bitcoin is finally being taken as seriously as the mysterious Satoshi imagined.",
      "Nonetheless, few would back against more wild moments as the Bitcoin story continues to unfold."

      "In his second appearance in front of the inquiry, Patterson also admitted that he did not know whether Fujitsu had done an independent report into the software system.",
      "Though he added that he would welcome a third-party investigation.",
      "Between 1999 and 2015, hundreds of sub-postmasters and postmistresses were wrongly prosecuted after Horizon made it look like money was missing from their branches.",
      "Fujitsu's Horizon contract is up for renewal early next year and could be extended for a further five years.",
      "Patterson said he was \"very worried\" about what might happen if this happens because of how unreliable Horizon is.",

      "Mr Patterson said Fujitsu was committed to paying out compensation to the victims of the scandal, calling it a \u201cmoral obligation\u201d, but said the firm was waiting until the end of the inquiry before actually doing so.",

      "But she said her row with the Treasury over the time it was taking to issue compensation last August was not just a case of her \"posturing\".",
      "Badenoch said Mr Bates vs The Post Office, which was broadcast in January, raised awareness of the issue, turning compensation from \"a value for money perception to a public perception question\".",
      "She insisted work was being done on the issue by the previous government, but admitted it was \"too slow\" and criticised the whole \"government machine\" for slowing down compensation.",
      "The inquiry heard how Badenoch told the Treasury she wanted to give \u00a3100,000 \"flat offers\" to all sub-postmasters with a claim, with the inquiry to the counsel Jason Beer KC describing her mention of \"ministerial direction\" as a threat.",
      "He said this could be seen as \"soft power\" or \"posturing\".",
      "But Badenoch denied the claim, saying: \"It was signalling the direction I wanted the department to take to make it very clear.\"",

      "Badenoch was also questioned over her sacking of former Post Office chairman Henry Staunton.",
      "She said she was not aware of how serious concerns were about him because of \"vanilla updates\" from civil servants.",
      "Her evidence statement provided her reasons for Staunton's dismissal, which included the former chairman attempting to shut down a whistleblowing probe into his conduct, behaving in an aggressive, intimidating and disrespectful manner, and having a poor understanding of Post Office's work.",

      "This was echoed by Rip-Off Britain's legal expert Gary Rycroft, who told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast the legal precedent set by the Court of Appeal ruling meant \"secret commission\" was deemed unlawful.",

      "\u201cWith paying off the agreement for three years, I had only scratched the surface,\" he said.",
      "Dealerships were not acting outside of the rules and regulations of the industry by taking this sort of commission at that time, but they had a duty to inform their clients.",
      "The court of appeal said \u201cburying such a statement in the small print which the lender knows the borrower is highly unlikely to read will not suffice\u201d.",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 06:00:13 GMT",
    "summary": "Technology differences mean meters in northern England and Scotland may not work properly, energy firm body admits.",
    "story": [
      "The way smart energy meters work in northern England and Scotland is causing issues for customers, BBC Panorama has been told.",
      "The body that represents energy companies, Energy UK, has confirmed for the first time there is a regional divide - because of the way meters send usage data back to suppliers.",
      "The technology used in the north of Great Britain can affect whether smart meters work properly - and could leave customers having to submit manual readings and receiving estimated bills.",
      "The issues have also been confirmed by meter engineers who have spoken to the BBC.",
      "In the Midlands, Wales and southern England, all meters use cellular technology - similar to mobile phones - to send data to energy providers.",
      "But in northern England and Scotland, meters instead rely on longer-range radio frequencies.",
      "It is a legal requirement, the government says, for suppliers to make sure smart meters are working and it expects suppliers to \u201cresolve all issues at a much faster pace\u201d.",
      "The mass roll-out of smart meters began 12 years ago, with the goal of helping people save money on their bills, while lowering carbon emissions as part of the government\u2019s net zero plan.",
      "By showing how much energy households are using, and how much it is costing, meters are intended to encourage people to use more energy at times of day when it is cheaper - because there is a surplus while most are in bed and factories are closed.",
      "As more energy comes from renewable sources, smart meters will form a vital part of a \u201csmart grid\u201d, allowing consumers\u2019 demand for energy to match the available supply, minute-by-minute.",
      "The cost of installing smart meters across Great Britain is estimated to be \u00a313.5bn, according to the government. There are 36 million such devices in England, Wales and Scotland - but recent government figures show 3.5 million of them are not working properly.",
      "As a rule of thumb, smart meters in the northern region designed to connect to the radio signal have two small indicator lights on the communications hub, fitted to the top of the smart meter. The hubs fitted to smart meters in central and southern regions, receiving the cellular signal, usually have five of these indicator lights.",
      "Northern Ireland\u2019s energy market is separate with its own rules and regulator - and a consultation on a proposed smart meter roll-out is taking place.",
      "Hartesh Battu, a doctor from Glasgow, has had six different smart meters, fitted by two energy suppliers, none of which have worked. \u201cI just think it\u2019s astonishingly bad in terms of the technology,\u201d he told us. \u201cI do feel like, \u2018how could billions of pounds be spent on something so bad?\u2019\u201d",
      "He told the BBC he had wanted a smart meter so he could save energy on his bills and take advantage of a night-time rate that would make it cheaper to charge his electric car.",
      "His current energy supplier, Octopus Energy, told him the problem was down to signal issues in the area and may be because he lived \u201cfar up north\u201d - reasoning that left him feeling deeply unimpressed. \u201cI just thought that was a bit bonkers because I live in Glasgow, I\u2019m hardly up in Shetland, I\u2019m not rural at all.\u201d",
      "When the mass roll-out started, the decision to use radio signals across northern England and Scotland - rather than the mobile technology further south - was because it was thought the signals would be able to travel far across the hills and mountains, reaching more rural communities more easily.",
      "But Energy UK admits there are problems regarding how the radio signals transmit. \u201cThere are issues in the north,\u201d chief executive Dhara Vyas told us.",
      "She said there were \u201clive conversations\u201d within the industry about increasing the network range in the north of England and Scotland.",
      "This technological divide has been experienced by smart meter engineers who have spoken anonymously to Panorama.",
      "One engineer, \u201cAhmed\u201d told us there were more problems in northern England and Scotland on average, adding that the technology further south was more up to date.",
      "\u201cYou can end up going to someone\u2019s house at the bottom of a mountain in the north and the radio frequency can\u2019t get through. But there could be a good 3G signal nearby and that could get through - the customer doesn\u2019t know that,\u201d he said.",
      "Another engineer, \u201cSteve\u201d working for a major energy supplier in Merseyside, who has experience of installing meters in homes on both sides of the regional divide, told us it was \u201cfar easier to complete a successful installation\u201d in the south and Midlands where he could use the cellular network.",
      "The truth about smart meters",
      "Smart meters are supposed to make paying our energy bills easier and cheaper. But is that the whole story?",
      "Watch now on BBC iPlayer - or on BBC One on Monday 11 November at 20:00 (20:30 in Wales and Northern Ireland).",
      "Energy suppliers do not have direct control over the communication network - in both the north and south. Instead it is run by an organisation known as the Data Communications Company (DCC) and is operated by outsourcing company, Capita.",
      "Panorama contacted Dr Battu\u2019s energy supplier, Octopus Energy, about the problems he was having with his meter. The company said the situation was \u201cfrustrating\u201d because government regulations dictated it must use the radio-wave technology to provide a signal to Dr Battu\u2019s meter - and that it was not permitted to access the local 3G signal instead.",
      "However, in what they described as \u201ca highly unusual move\u201d, Octopus told us that it had in fact decided to break the rules and fix his meter by connecting it to the mobile network. It added that \u201cregulation has not moved with technology\u201d.",
      "Capita told the BBC it advised energy suppliers against using alternative technological solutions, because that would mean there was no contractual or consumer protection for the meter user to ensure service was maintained or problems addressed.",
      "It said the network it runs provides 99.3% coverage across Great Britain, adding that it was \u201cfully committed to resolving connection issues\u201d.",
      "In a statement it added: \u201cThe DCC is actively working with government to provide a future-proof 4G technology solution for the whole of Britain.\u201d",
      "Most energy users pay a little bit extra on their bills towards the cost of installing and fixing smart meters. That is supposed to be offset by the savings they could make and the environmental benefits.",
      "Energy suppliers are primarily responsible for funding the communications infrastructure - and, according to the National Audit Office, some or all of these costs are passed on to consumers in bills.",
      "The latest figures show that nine in 10 smart meters are working fine. But a recent survey by Citizens\u2019 Advice suggests one in five households have had to regularly send manual meter readings because their smart meters haven\u2019t worked properly.",
      "The government told Panorama that \u201cwhile over 90% of smart meters are operating normally\u2019\u2019 the number not working properly was \u201cstill too high\u201d and, as a result, \u201cmany households are missing out on cheaper, flexible tariffs\u201d.",
      "It also said that a recent customer experience survey by Ofgem \u201cfound no statistically significant differences\u201d in the proportion of customers reporting that their meter was not sending readings to their suppliers for areas in, or predominantly\u202fin, the north.",
      "Most experts agree smart meters can help to deliver lower bills and lower carbon emissions. But if the tech problems continue, that could put people off having them and undermine the government\u2019s goal of getting them into every home."

      "University graduates across the UK are being urged by a campaign group to check whether they are due a refund on their student loan repayment after it was revealed that nearly \u00a3200m was overpaid last year.",
      "Save the Student's comments come after figures were published which show that hundreds of thousands of people currently paying off their loans are eligible for a share of \u00a3184m in refunds.",
      "It is easy to check whether a refund is owed by logging on to the government's Student Loan Company portal, where individual refunds could range from tens of pounds to more than \u00a31,000.",
      "Tom Allingham from Save the Student said for many getting a refund could make a world of difference.",
      "Charlotte Gill is one such former student who was eligible for a refund on her loan payments, to the tune of \u00a368.",
      "She said it did not make a huge difference \"but every little helps when you are a student\".",
      "\"At the end of the day, it's your money, it\u2019s not the government's money, so if you've got any entitlement to a refund then absolutely take it,\" she said.",
      "Martin De'Ath received \u00a3396 in his refund and says the substantial payment made him question how he could have used it in the 10 months he was without it.",
      "\"I was definitely pleased to get it back at least,\" he said.",
      "There are four reasons people may be eligible for refunds.",
      "The main reason, behind \u00a3146m of the total, is that repayments were taken from people despite them not earning above the annual threshold at which point repayments automatically kick in.",
      "This can happen when someone earns above the monthly threshold which triggers the beginning of loan repayments, due to things like to taking extra shifts, getting a new job or receiving a bonus, but their annual earnings might still fall below the yearly threshold.",
      "Since May, those who fall into this category have been able to use a new service offered by the SLC to request refunds online. In the first six months of the service, 418,000 people have done so.",
      "Other reasons may be that former students are charged repayments before they are required to pay, which is generally in the April after they finish studying.",
      "Some people may have been put on the wrong payment plans by their employer, while others may have continued making payments after their loan had been paid off in full.",
      "Any money overpaid does count towards the full repayment of the loan, and may save graduates money in the long run on interest.",
      "However, as Mr Allingham said, many university graduates may need the cash for their day-to-day expenses.",
      "\"It is definitely worth doing, particularly even with the cost of living crisis still lingering on a little bit, having that extra boost of cash right now could make a world of difference,\" Mr Allingham said.",

      "\"But you do have to want the actual products,\" says Cissy. \"Otherwise, it\u2019s a bit of a waste of money.\"",

      "Greater Nammuldi has a fleet of more than 50 self-driving trucks that operate independently on pre-defined courses, along with a handful that remain manually driven and work separately in a different part of the mine.",
      "Being trialled is also an autonomous water cart affectionately known as Henry, which, along with manually driven ones, sprays the mine roads to keep the dust down.",
      "The company vehicle I am in is able to operate alongside the autonomous trucks only because it has been fitted with high-accuracy GPS, which allows it to be seen within a virtual system.",
      "Before entering the mine\u2019s gated autonomous zone, we logged onto this system and a controller verified over the radio that we were visible.",
      "It has encased our vehicle in a virtual bubble that the self-driving trucks \"see\" and which causes them to manage their proximity by slowing or stopping as necessary.",
      "A touch screen in our cabin displays all the staffed and autonomous vehicles and other equipment in the vicinity, along with \"permission lines\" that show the immediate routes the self-driving trucks are intending to take. Had I looked at the screen instead of fretting I would have seen that truck was going to turn.",
      "In addition to all vehicles being fitted with a big red emergency button that can stop the system, the autonomous trucks have lasers and radars front and rear to detect collision risks.",
      "The sensors also detect obstacles. If a large rock fell off the back of a truck, the sensors on the next truck along would notice it and the vehicle would stop.",
      "However, some trucks seem extra sensitive \u2013 on my tour I see a couple foiled simply by rough roads.",
      "Co-ordinating and monitoring these robots is Rio Tinto\u2019s Operations Centre (OC) in Perth, about 1,500km (930 miles) to the south.",
      "It\u2019s the nerve centre for all the company\u2019s Pilbara iron ore operations, which span 17 mines in total, including the three making up Greater Nammuldi.",
      "Guided from here by controllers, include more than 360 self-driving trucks across all the sites (about 84% of the total fleet is automated); a mostly autonomous long-distance rail network to transport the mined ore to port facilities; and nearly 40 autonomous drills. OC staff also remotely control plant and port functions.",
      "Autonomy isn\u2019t new to Rio\u2019s Pilbara operations: introduction began in the late 2000s.",
      "Nor is it unique: Australia has the greatest number of autonomous trucks and mines that use automation of any country, and other mining companies in the Pilbara also use the technology.",
      "But the scale Rio has grown its operations to here, including at Greater Nammuldi \u2013 which has one of the largest autonomous truck fleets in the world \u2013 gives it global significance.",
      "And it's a global trend. According to GlobalData the number of self-driving haul trucks worldwide has roughly quadrupled over the past four years to more than 2,000, with most made by either Caterpillar or Komatsu.",
      "The biggest reason for introducing the technology has been to improve the physical safety of the workforce, says Matthew Holcz, the managing director of the company\u2019s Pilbara mines.",
      "Mining is a dangerous occupation: heavy machinery can be unpredictably operated by people who can also become fatigued. \u201cThe data clearly shows that, through automation, we've got a significantly safer business,\u201d says Mr Holcz.",
      "It has also improved productivity \u2013 to the tune of about 15%, he estimates. Autonomous equipment can be used more because there are no gaps due to shift changes or breaks. And autonomous trucks can also go faster when there is less staff-operated equipment on the scene.",
      "Such automation does not come cheap. Rio won\u2019t disclose what it has spent in total on its Pilbara automation journey to date, but observers put it at multiple billions of dollars.",
      "Meanwhile, employment opportunities have evolved. The narrative might be one of robots taking jobs, but that doesn\u2019t seem the case here so far.",
      "While the OC has about one controller for every 25 autonomous trucks \u2013 according to Rio, no one has lost their job because of automation.",
      "Instead, there have been redeployments: truck drivers have joined the OC as controllers themselves, been reskilled to operate different pieces of equipment, such as excavators, loaders and dozers, or gone to drive manual trucks at different sites.",
      "On the OC\u2019s large open plan floor, amid the banks of monitors arranged in clusters for the different mines, I meet Jess Cowie who used be a manual driller but now directs autonomous ones from the central drill pod. \u201cI still put holes in the ground\u2026just without the dust, the noise and being away from the family,\u201d she says.",
      "Automation is delivering a \u201cstep change\u201d in terms of safety in the mining industry says Robin Burgess-Limerick, a professor at the University of Queensland in Brisbane who studies human factors in mining. But it doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t room for improvement.",
      "Professor Burgess-Limerick has analysed incidents involving autonomous equipment reported to regulators.",
      "As he sees it, the interfaces used by staff both in the field and in control centres to gain information aren\u2019t optimally designed. There have been situations where field staff have lost awareness of the situation, which better screen design may have prevented. \u201cThe designers of the technology should put a bit more effort into considering people,\u201d he says.",
      "And there is also a risk that controllers\u2019 workloads can be overwhelming - it is a busy, high stakes job.",
      "Over-trust, where people become so confident the autonomous equipment will stop that they start putting themselves at risk, can also be an issue, and he notes effort needs to be directed into improving the ability of trucks themselves to detect moisture. There have been incidents where wet roadways have caused them to lose traction.",
      "There can be legitimate safety concerns with autonomous equipment, says Shane Roulstone, co-ordinator for the Western Mine Workers Alliance, which represents mining-related workers in the Pilbara.",
      "He points to a serious incident this May where an autonomous train slammed into the back of a broken-down train, which workers at the front end were repairing (they evacuated before it hit but were left shaken).",
      "But Mr Roulstone also praises Rio generally for having, over time, developed \u201csome good strategies, procedures and policies\u201d around how people interact with automated vehicles.",
      "Mr Roulstone expects that at some point options for redeployment will lessen and there will job losses. \u201cIt is just the mathematics of it,\u201d he says.",
      "Meanwhile, Rio\u2019s automation journey in the Pilbara continues with more trucks, drills and Henry the water cart. It is also closely watching work by Komatsu and Caterpillar to develop un-staffed excavators, loaders and dozers.",
      "Late in the afternoon, waiting at Greater Nammuldi\u2019s airport for the last flight back to Perth, the announcement comes that it has been cancelled due to an issue with the plane. That\u2019s 150 extra people who will now need to be fed and accommodated. It is nothing for Rio, but I can\u2019t help but think we humans are complicated compared to robots.",

    "story": [
      "The Eastern European country of Moldova is continuing efforts to attract overseas firms, as it tries to move past political uncertainty.",
      "\"I went with a backpack, and set up a business,\" says Dutch entrepreneur Luc Vocks, recalling how he moved to Moldova in 2007.",
      "Mr Vocks had first visited the former Soviet republic three years earlier, and recalls experiencing \"the clich\u00e9 that one would have of Eastern Europe at that time\".",
      "\"Everything was dirt cheap, and if you were a foreigner you'd get attention,\" he says.",
      "Today, Mr Vocks is the owner of a Moldovan company called DevelopmentAid. Based in the capital Chisinau, it employs 180 people in the country, and runs a website that lists job vacancies in the international development community.",
      "Mr Vocks is one of a growing number of foreign entrepreneurs in Moldova. The government wants to attract more like him and hopes that low business tax rates will help.",
      "The country's standard corporation tax rate - the amount that firms have to pay on their profits - is just 12%. This compares with 25% in the UK, and 25.8% in the Netherlands where Mr Vocks had initially launched his company before relocating it to Moldova.",
      "There's an even better deal for tech firms. In 2018 the Moldovan government launched an initiative to grow the country's IT sector - the Moldova IT Park (MITP).",
      "This isn't a physical business park. Instead it is virtual scheme open to all IT firms in the country - and those that wish to move there from overseas. Firms that sign up only have to pay a corporation tax rate of 7%.",
      "The MITP is part of a wider effort by the Moldovan government to modernise and expand its economy ahead of a bid to join the European Union in 2030.",
      "This drive is being led by Moldova's pro-EU President Maia Sandu, who this week was re-elected for a second term. And last month Moldovans voted \"yes\" on pro-EU constitutional changes.",
      "However, the vote was extremely close, with Yes getting 50.46% and No receiving 49.54%. Although Russia denied interfering in the vote, Moldova\u2019s authorities said attempts had been made to buy up to 300,000 votes in what Maia Sandu described as an \"unprecedented assault on freedom and democracy\".",
      "Moscow is opposed to Moldova joining the EU, and supports Moldova's breakaway region of Transnistria economically, politically and militarily.",
      "Dumitru Alaiba, Moldova's deputy prime minister and minister for economic development and digitalisation, is positive about where Moldova is heading.",
      "\"Moldova in the past 10 to 15 years has really proven that it's a country that can change very fast,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"This used to be a highly corrupt country, a country where, exactly 10 years ago, a billion dollars from our central banks just disappeared.\"",
      "\"We are moving very fast towards joining the EU, and we are reforming our economy at top speed. Of course, we have a long way to go.\"",
      "He pointed to Moldova's rise on the global Corruption Perceptions Index, produced by anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International.",
      "Out of 180 countries - with a lower placing meaning that a country is less corrupt - Moldova is now in 76th place, up from 91st a year earlier.",
      "\"Now entrepreneurs can breathe freely without fear of repercussion, without fear of corrupt inspectors, without fear of a filthy justice sector that commits crazy abuses.\"",
      "Mr Vocks agrees that Moldova is now a much easier place in which to do business than when he first set up his company there back in 2007.",
      "\"Back then, it was extremely bureaucratic. It was hard to get a residence permit. It was painful to register a company, especially as a foreigner.",
      "\"It was painful intersecting with the tax agency. The banks were rough to work with.\"",
      "Member companies of the MITP don't just benefit from the 7% corporation tax rate. They also don't need to make employer social security contributions, and staff don't have to pay income tax. Mr Volks signed up DevelopmentAid almost immediately.",
      "The MITP has also simplified immigration procedures through the IT Visa program.",
      "More than 2,000 companies are now registered with the MITP, 300 of which have come from overseas. The most common countries these have moved from being the US, UK, Germany, Netherlands, and Ukraine.",
      "In the first half of 2024, MITP firms generated a combined \u20ac365m ($397m; \u00a3308m) in revenues, according to official figures. And now employing 22,000 people in general, they are said to contribute around 6% of the country's GDP.",
      "While the MITP scheme has worked to boost Moldova's IT sector, the influx of foreign tech companies has driven up salaries in the industry considerably.",
      "Sven Wiese, a German expat who has set up a small IT services business in the country called Trabia, says he is now finding himself priced out when it comes to employee pay.",
      "He says that the biggest firms signed up to the MITP can offer IT specialists more than \u20ac100,000 a year, \"because that is still cheaper than hiring people within a bigger country like the US or Germany\".",
      "At the same time he says that many Moldovan IT sector workers still want to leave the country. \"Fewer people are now leaving Moldova, but emigration is still high.\"",
      "Another negative issue is the continuing war in neighbouring Ukraine, which is likely making some Western IT firms think twice about investing in Moldova. Mr Alaiba says is confident that Moldova is safe \"as long as the free world is supporting Ukraine\".",
      "Marina Bzovii, MITP's administrator and an assistant professor at the Technical University of Moldova, already sees Moldova as a regional business hub. \"Moldova is connecting even Central Asia, countries like Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, who are culturally much further from Europe.",

      "There are four reasons people may be eligible for refunds.",

      "This can happen when someone earns above the monthly threshold which triggers the beginning of loan repayments, due to things like to taking extra shifts, getting a new job or receiving a bonus, but their annual earnings might still fall below the yearly threshold.",
      "Since May, those who fall into this category have been able to use a new service offered by the SLC to request refunds online. In the first six months of the service, 418,000 people have done so.",
      "Other reasons may be that former students are charged repayments before they are required to pay, which is generally in the April after they finish studying.",
      "Some people may have been put on the wrong payment plans by their employer, while others may have continued making payments after their loan had been paid off in full.",
      "Any money overpaid does count towards the full repayment of the loan, and may save graduates money in the long run on interest.",

    "story": [
      "A 17-year-old girl in China hailed as a genius in a mathematics contest cheated, competition organisers have said - ending months of scepticism over her stellar results.",
      "Jiang Ping, a fashion design student from a rural town in Jiangsu province, made headlines in June when she came 12th in the qualifiers of an international maths contest run by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba.",
      "She was the first finalist since the competition began in 2018 to have come from a lowly vocational school, Chinese media reported. The vast majority of the 800 finalists came from elite universities.",
      "Jiang's results turned her into an overnight sensation, and she was labelled a \"prodigy\" in the press and on social media.",
      "Under China's notoriously cut-throat education system, academic excellence is lauded. Many people online were encouraged by Jiang's results, seeing them as proof that students from vocational institutes could still excel academically.",
      "However, as doubt surrounding her abilities snowballed, competition organisers  said last Sunday that Jiang had violated competition rules in the preliminary round, by receiving help from her teacher, who was also a contestant himself.",
      "\u201cThis has exposed problems like inadequacies in the competition format and the lack of rigour in supervision. We sincerely apologise,\u201d organisers said in a statement.",
      "According to the final results announced on Sunday, neither Jiang nor her teacher was among 86 winners in the competition.",
      "The rise of a maths sensation",
      "The annual mathematics contest is open to contestants from institutions worldwide and hosted by Damo Academy, Alibaba\u2019s research institute.",
      "This year, Jiang, a student at Jiangsu Lianshui Secondary Vocational School, outperformed other finalists from some of the world\u2019s most prestigious institutions \u2014 including Peking University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the University of Oxford.",
      "She had chosen to study at the vocational school both because she was interested in fashion design, and because her sister and friends were there, said local media outlets.",
      "Jiang's results and unconventional educational background soon grabbed nationwide attention. Her story was featured in a video produced by Damo Academy and she was interviewed by news outlets across the country.",
      "\u201cLearning maths is bumpy, but every time I solve the problems I feel quite happy,\u201d she told the state-run People\u2019s Daily. \u201cNo matter what the future holds, I will keep learning.\u201d",
      "Jiang\u2019s teacher, Wang Runqiu, was also thrust into the spotlight, hailed as an educator who noticed and encouraged her passion for maths. Speaking to the media, he described her as an attentive student who had learnt advanced mathematics herself.",

      "China's education system focuses much of its resources on those taking the \"Gaokao\" - the notoriously difficult exam that students need to take in order to get into university. Those in vocational schools had long faced restrictions in taking the gaokao and enrolling in regular universities, until an education reform in 2022 offered vocational school students an alternative university entrance exam.",
      "An earlier op-ed in state-news media outlet Xinhua said that Jiang's results \u201chint[ed] at an awkward truth: even youths as talented as her may be easily buried without good education credentials\u201d.",
      "'She was not the mastermind'",
      "But as Jiang\u2019s fame burgeoned, criticism and scepticism surrounding her skills also started to bubble.",
      "In June, dozens of other finalists published a joint letter they wrote to the competition organising committee demanding an investigation into Jiang. They also called for her answers to the preliminary test questions to be made public.",
      "The finalists alleged that Jiang had made \u201cseveral apparent writing mistakes\u201d in an online video and that she \u201cseemed unfamiliar with these mathematical expressions and symbols\u201d.",
      "While the preliminary round of the competition allowed participants to use programming software, the final round was a closed-book exam. The results of the finals, which were initially set to be released in August, were postponed for several months.",
      "When the results were finally made public on Sunday, Jiang was not among the 86 winners of the final round.",
      "Her school also confirmed in a statement on Sunday that Jiang had been helped by her teacher Wang, and that Wang had been given a warning and disqualified from teachers\u2019 awards for the year. The statement also called for leniency and protection for the teenager.",
      "Attempts by the BBC to contact Jiang's family were unsuccessful. A social media account once used by her mother is now defunct, and a phone number linked to her father has been deactivated. Multiple phone calls by the BBC to Jiang's school went unanswered, and a village official declined to discuss Jiang when contacted by the BBC.",
      "While Sunday\u2019s revelation unleashed a wave of criticism of Jiang and her teacher, many social media users also spoke up for the teenager, arguing the bigger responsibility lay with her school and teacher.",

    "published": "Wed, 13 Nov 2024 03:55:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Before Tupac's murder, producer Quincy Jones brought stars together to try to end violence in hip-hop.",
    "story": [
      "Before the east and west coast rap beef of the 1990s boiled over with the murders of Tupac Shakur and Notorious BIG, legendary producer Quincy Jones called a secret meeting at which he appealed for an end to the violence.",
      "As hip-hop rose from the streets to the mainstream in the 90s, the rappers and hustlers that broke through had few role models who had trodden that path before them.",
      "There was one man, though, who had been there, and done pretty much everything.",
      "Quincy Jones had been in gangs and had been stabbed at the age of seven in 1930s Chicago, before becoming a major force in American music thanks to his work with legends like Ray Charles, Frank Sinatra and Michael Jackson.",
      "He was at the heart of revolutions in jazz, swing, soul, funk, disco and pop - but one aspect of his career that got less attention when he died last week at the age of 91 was his place in hip-hop.",
      "Jones was revered in all corners of music, including rap. Unlike most in the old guard and the media, he immediately realised the scene's artistic and cultural importance.",
      "Hip-hop reminded him of the bebop jazz of his youth. \"I feel a kinship there because we went through a lot of the same stuff,\" he said.",
      "\"Quincy understood it and got it right away,\" says pioneering artist, rapper and presenter Fab 5 Freddy.",
      "Jones worked with leading rappers in the 80s, and in the 90s he recognised risks including a volatile rivalry that had begun to erupt between competing labels and stars.",
      "So he brought artists, executives and elder black American statesmen together for a secret summit in 1995, hoping it would be a turning point.",
      "The east coast was hip-hop's spiritual home. In 1992, Sean Combs - then known as Puffy and later as P Diddy - launched his Bad Boy record label in New York with artists including Notorious BIG, aka Biggie Smalls.",
      "Meanwhile, across America, Los Angeles was coming into its own as the capital of gangsta rap, led by menacing mogul Suge Knight's Death Row Records, which had Dr Dre and Tupac.",
      "In 1994, Tupac was shot and injured during a robbery in the lobby of a studio. He later implied that his former friend Biggie may have known about the attack in advance. Biggie then released the track Who Shot Ya?, which Tupac thought was about him.",
      "The beef continued at the Source magazine awards on 3 August 1995, when Knight goaded Combs and Bad Boy Records from the stage.",
      "Jones, who had his own magazine, Vibe, held his summit three weeks later.",
      "Quincy Jones: From 'street rat' to music mastermind",
      "Quincy Jones: His brilliance explained in 10 songs",
      "'He changed my life': Stars remember Quincy Jones",
      "The brewing east-west beef wasn't the only reason Jones called it - it was mainly intended to discuss the state of hip-hop and let the new generation hear life and business advice from a group of highly successful black executives.",
      "But rap's negative image and the burgeoning tensions were a big talking point.",
      "\"He knew this was a bubbling issue, and so his idea was to bring together a symposium,\" says Fab 5 Freddy, who was hosting Yo! MTV Raps at the time and was the event's moderator.",
      "Jones told the summit: \"The thing that really provoked me to say it's time to pay attention now is Tupac.\"",
      "Tupac was missing, however - he was in jail for sexual assault at the time. Suge and Dre were there, as were Combs and Biggie.",
      "Jones had already experienced his own beef with Tupac - the rapper criticised the producer in a 1993 edition of Source for marrying white women.",
      "\"We finally hooked up, even though it was tension conditions in the beginning,\" Jones said at the event.",
      "\"We finally talked to each other, and he said nobody had talked to him like that before.",
      "\"And I said, I can't take it any more. Because we can no longer afford to be non-political, and I'm talking to the hip-hop nation now.\"",
      "About 50 influential artists and executives were in the room, including Public Enemy's Chuck D, members of A Tribe Called Quest, MC Lyte, Kris Kross, Jermaine Dupri and Boyz n the Hood film-maker John Singleton.",
      "Jones wrote in his now-out-of-print 2001 autobiography: \"I had been concerned about the potentially volatile diversity of a group who'd never been in the same room together.\"",
      "They were joined by veteran executives Clarence Avant and Ahmet Ertegun, plus Colin Powell, the former national security adviser and head of the US military who would go on to become the first African-American secretary of state.",
      "Powell had presidential ambitions - that was why the summit was held in secret. Jones wanted to save Powell from being associated with the negative publicity that surrounded rap music.",
      "He switched venues at the last minute to throw press off the scent, and confiscated the recordings.",
      "\"Rest assured that my discretion is based on a deep respect for you and a valued friendship,\" Jones wrote to Powell in an unpublished letter held at Indianapolis University Library.",
      "\"I know that we are going to make a difference at this conference. Thanks for the way you handled the situation. Maybe we can turn the battleship an inch or two.\"",
      "Jones later wrote in his book: \"Some of the younger rappers didn't even know who he was. When addressing some of the more confrontational comments from the floor, Powell maintained his South Bronx demeanour and authoritative cool throughout.\"",
      "Fab 5 Freddy remembers one exchange between Powell and Knight. \"There was an encounter where he [Knight] had something to say, and Colin Powell responded.",
      "\"Here you have this guy who was a four-star general talking to Suge Knight, and he pretty much put Suge in his place.\"",
      "Jones finally released a clip of the event for a 2018 Netflix documentary about his life.",
      "\"We've got to seriously talk about what you are going to deal with,\" he is seen telling the assembled attendees.",
      "\"They are not playing, there's real bullets out there, believe me. Maybe literally and figuratively.",
      "\"It's a very emotional thing,\" he added, his voice cracking. \"I want to see you guys live to at least my age.\"",
      "\"Quincy did get emotional,\" Fab 5 Freddy recalls, \"because he sensed what could happen.",
      "\"And the worst, unfortunately, did happen.\"",
      "Who was Tupac Shakur?",
      "Ex-gang leader pleads not guilty to Tupac murder",
      "Diddy accused of 'revenge' rape over Tupac claims",
      "Jones had ended up reconciling with Tupac. After Tupac's 1993 comments, Jones's 17-year-old daughter Rashida - who would go on to star in US sitcom The Office - wrote an irate letter to Source attacking the rapper.",
      "When Tupac bumped into one of Jones's other daughters, Kidada, he apologised, thinking she was Rashida. But Tupac and Kidada hit it off and began a relationship.",
      "\"Though we got off to a rocky start, as I came to know and feel him I saw his enormous potential and sensitivity as an artist and as a human being,\" Quincy Jones wrote.",
      "There have also been claims that Tupac was planning to leave Death Row for Jones's record label.",
      "But in September 1996, a year after the summit, Tupac was shot and killed.",
      "A former gang leader, Duane \"Keffe D\" Davis, was charged with his murder last year. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Then in 1997, Notorious BIG was shot dead outside a party thrown by Jones's record label and magazine. No-one has ever been charged.",
      "Meanwhile, today Knight is in prison for a hit-and-run, while Combs is awaiting trial on charges of racketeering and sex trafficking, which he denies.",
      "The violence in the 90s \"wasn't necssary\" and was caused by \"wannabes and gang-related troublemakers\" on the edges of the music industry, according to Fab 5 Freddy.",
      "\"Also, the east/west coast beef was mainly ignited by jealousy. It was an ashtray fire fanned into a big deal by media outlets that led to Biggie and Tupac getting killed.\"",
      "Despite his stature, not even Jones could alter the forces of power and pride that were at work and prevent the bloodshed.",
      "Freddy believes some lessons were learned at the summit, however, and that it deserves a place in hip-hop history.",
      "\"It was incredible and electric to be in that room.",
      "\"It was a thrilling moment. And then it became even more legendary because it was never released, so the only people that really knew about it were the people that were there.\""

      "Dyke, who was director general when Lineker first began hosting the football show in 1999, did not speculate on whether Lineker had been \"offered a new contract or not\".",
      "He also said he did not know whether the recent controversy over the presenter's social media use was connected with his departure.",

      "The other winners included Raye, Sabrina Carpenter, Tyla and Benson Boone.",

      "He brings a wealth of experience, having regularly stood in to present Match of the Day and fronted its sister programme, Match of the Day 2, for over a decade.",

      "After starting her broadcasting career at Sky, she moved to ITV, deputising for Des Lynam on The Premiership, the channel's highlights show launched after they won the rights from the BBC between 2001 and 2004.",

      "The former England and Arsenal midfielder became the first female analyst to be taken to a men's World Cup by the BBC when Russia hosted the tournament in 2018.",
      "Later that summer, she also debuted as Sky Sports' first woman football pundit.",

      "She previously told GQ that the show's success relies on its uninhibited feel, calling it the \"locker room environment translated onto television\" - mirroring the personality-driven tone younger audiences are used to from online sports content.",
      "One of its pundits, Micah Richards (see below), has separately described Scott as the \"glue\" that keeps the controlled chaos of the show together; balancing frolics (such as being teased into revealing her first kiss) with genuine analysis from the panel.",
      "As young audiences increasingly turn their back on terrestrial TV, the BBC is under pressure to adapt - particularly as individual match highlights now appear on YouTube long before Match of the Day's 10:30pm time slot.",
      "There's no doubt the new-age formula has worked for CBS, but it is a far cry from the traditions of Match of the Day. Could it work on the BBC? And would Scott want to risk jeopardising CBS' popular dynamic?",
      "Alan Shearer",
      "Alan Shearer, alongside Lineker, is one of England's all-time great goal-scorers. Despite retiring in 2006, he still holds the Premier League goal record and remains top scorer for Newcastle United.",
      "This pedigree helped him become a mainstay pundit on the BBC and Match of the Day. He also formed a strong trio with Lineker and Richards, first on the BBC's Match of the Day podcast and latterly The Rest is Football - produced independently on Lineker's hugely successful Goalhanger podcast company. These have allowed him to show off more of his personality.",
      "Now almost 20 years into his media career, Shearer is however yet to host a show - could that step up to becoming Match of the day anchor finally be on the horizon?",
      "Micah Richards",
      "The ex-Manchester City and England defender burst onto the footballing scene as a teenager, but, after an on-pitch career curtailed by a knee injury, Richards has blossomed as the ever-animated pundit with a mega-watt personality to boot.",
      "He embodies the modern take on the role, engaging viewers not only with analysis but also fun-loving camaraderie shared between analysts and presenter.",
      "His media career blossomed as a jovial foil to the tough-talking, former Manchester United captain Roy Keane on Sky Sports' Super Sunday.",
      "Similar roles have followed on Match of the Day and for CBS' Champions League coverage - where humorous off-script moments between presenter Abdo, Richards himself and Premier League legends Jamie Carragher and Thierry Henry regularly trend on social media.",
      "Asking Richards to make the step up to presenting duties on a show as prestigious as Match of the Day would represent a risk from bosses, but certainly mark a fresh start and shift in tone.",
      "He also has the backing of Lineker, who, when discussing the speculation over his future on The Rest is Football, told Richards: \"I'd love to see you take over. I think you'd be brilliant in the chair.\"",
      "Colin Murray",
      "Beginning his career in music as a fun-loving, noughties upstart on BBC Radio 1, Colin Murray soon moved into sport broadcasting.",
      "The Northern Irishman balanced hosting BBC Radio 5 Live's raucous sport comedy panel show Fighting Talk with anchoring European football on Channel 5, before moving to precede Mark Chapman in the hot seat on Match of the Day 2.",

      "Murray is certainly a tried, tested and trusted football anchor with appeal spanning all age groups.",
      "Dan Walker",
      "Prior to quitting the BBC for Channel 5 in 2022, Dan Walker shared his high-profile  BBC Breakfast presenting role with 12 years as the host of Football Focus.",
      "Walker would offer bosses a clean cut image and a safe pair of hands were he to take the role, having previously also covered Olympics and football World Cups for the BBC. He has also recently covered games for Amazon Prime.",
      "But questions remain over Walker's own interest - he is on a bumper contract at Channel 5 and has persistently batted away suggestions of a return to the BBC.",
      "Laura Woods",
      "Laura Woods made her name on TalkSport, receiving plaudits for her relatable style as a host and interviewer.",
      "She has since stepped up to become lead presenter for TNT Sports' Champions League coverage, replacing Jake Humphrey when the channel rebranded from BT Sport last year.",
      "Woods also presents football on Amazon Prime and ITV - joining the latter for coverage of this summer's Euros.",
      "Earlier this summer she spoke of receiving \"numerous death threats\" online after commenting on an article questioning the eligibility of Olympic champion boxers Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting.",
      "Woods fits the mould of Scott and Richards in bringing a more personality-led style to her broadcasting.",
      "Jake Humphrey",
      "Humphrey is a vastly experienced sports broadcaster, with a catalogue of BBC experience to draw upon prior to his later career exploits.",
      "After an early career on BBC children's TV, by 2006 he had started working with BBC Sport, presenting Formula 1, Football Focus, Final Score and becoming the youngest ever host in Match of the Day's history.",
      "Since stepping back from BT Sport, Humphrey has focused on his successful High-Performance podcast, exploring the lives of high-achieving individuals. However, Humphrey remains a fan of Match of the Day, previously telling The Express he would \"never say never\" to hosting the \"legendary show\".",
      "Kelly Cates",
      "An experienced anchor across radio and TV, football is Cates' life-blood, quite literally - she is the daughter of Liverpool and Scotland legend Kenny Dalglish.",
      "The broadcaster has hosted BBC Radio 5 Live's 606 football phone-in and, more recently, the station's Football Daily podcast, in amongst numerous other roles at major tournaments.",
      "But she is best-known in front of the camera as part of the presenting roster for Sky Sports' Premier League coverage - including its flagship Super Sunday programme.",
      "Cates, like Logan, brings both pedigree and gender diversity - but it remains to be seen if she could be tempted away from Sky.",
      "Correction 12 November 2024: An earlier version of this article incorrectly suggested that Colin Murray left the BBC over a controversy on Fighting Talk. It has been amended to make clear he left to take a presenting job at Talk Sport Radio."

      "\u201cEven though the first series was such a huge global success, honestly I didn\u2019t make much,\u201d he tells me. \u201cSo doing the second series will help compensate me for the success of the first one too.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe stress I feel now is much greater,\u201d he says.",
      "Three years after the first series aired, Hwang is even more pessimistic about the state of the world.",
      "He points to current wars, climate change and a widening global wealth gap. Conflicts are no longer confined between the rich and poor, they are playing out intensely between different generations, genders and political camps, he says.",

      "This, I am told, will lead to more factionalism and fights.",
      "It is part of director Hwang\u2019s plan to expose the dangers of living in an increasingly tribal world. Forcing people to pick sides, he believes, is fuelling conflict.",
      "For all those who were captivated by the shocking storytelling of Squid Game, there were others who found it gratuitously violent and difficult to watch.",

      "This series he has relished having scenes without a mask, in which he can fully express himself \u2013 a chance he nearly did not get.",
      "Hwang tried for 10 years to get Squid Game made, taking out large loans to support his family, before Netflix swooped in.",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:05:39 GMT",
    "summary": "Everything we learned on the red carpet and behind the scenes of the MTV Europe Music Awards.",
    "story": [
      "The MTV Awards came to Manchester for the first time in their 30-year history on Sunday night, but somehow didn't feel very Mancunian.",
      "There was no sign of Take That or Aitch, or Liam Gallagher - even though he won best rock star.",
      "Organisers made a few subtle nods to the city: The stage was framed in the black and yellow stripes of Factory Records, and New Order's Blue Monday pumped through the speakers every time nominees were announced.",
      "But the show took a more global perspective, highlighting acts from Mexico, South Korea, South Africa and America - including a predictable victory for Taylor Swift in the night's two biggest categories, best artist and video of the year.",
      "She only appeared by video, choosing instead to spend the night watching her boyfriend, American Football player Travis Kelce, lead the Kansas City Chiefs to victory against the Denver Broncos.",
      "But there were plenty of other stars at the show and on the red carpet. Here's some of the gossip we picked up along the way.",
      "1) Raye gave an update on her missing song books",
      "Two weeks ago, Raye told fans her second album had been delayed by thieves who stole her car and, with it, several notebooks full of lyrics and song ideas.",
      "On the red carpet, she confirmed the police hadn't been able to track them down, saying: \"I've just had to let it go.\"",
      "The singer said she couldn't recreate a lot of the ideas, because the act of writing them down freed her mind to work on other things.",
      "\"You let it go, because you think you can come back to it - and now there are so many ideas that are just gone. It's so sad.\"",
      "But the singer, who won best UK artist, maintained a positive outlook.",
      "\"Everything happens for a reason. I'll have to start again and maybe it's a blessing in disguise.\"",
      "2) Busta Rhymes revealed his unlikely comedy hero",
      "The decision to bring rap legend Busta Rhymes to Manchester to receive a global icon award wasn't as random as it sounded.",
      "Before he developed his rapid-fire rap delivery, an 11-year-old Rhymes spent two summers living with his Aunt Velma in Morecambe.",
      "\"I went to karate school, and we illegally went into nightclubs, to make a little money break-dancing,\" he told us.",
      "\"I remember Boy George was cool, Wham was cool,\" he continued.",
      "\"But our favourite was Benny Hill. Benny Hill is still our favourite to this day. I don't think anybody has as ever been as funny or as charismatic as Benny Hill.\"",
      "So, during those halcyon days of watching smutty comedy in Morecambe, did he ever think he'd be back, winning a lifetime achievement prize?",
      "\"You can never foresee something like that,\" he said. \"When we first got involved with hip-hop, we didn't do it for none of the accolades. We just did it because we loved it.",
      "\"But with that being said, tonight is a dream come true.\"",
      "To honour that moment, he gave a nine-minute acceptance speech thanking everyone from his mother to an art teacher he'd met backstage.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never got an award from MTV before. Thirty four years of professionally recording [and] this is the first time I\u2019m getting an award from MTV. It feels incredible.\"",
      "3) Olly Alexander had advice for next year's Eurovision contestant",
      "Olly Alexander played a pre-show party on Saturday night, and couldn't quite believe the reception for Dizzy - the song which earned him 18th place at this year's Eurovision Song Contest.",
      "\"That went down a lot better than it did in Eurovision,\" he laughed, shortly before Jedward invaded the stage and caused utter chaos.",
      "At the main ceremony, Alexander was there to award song of the year to Sabrina Carpenter's Espresso. But he also had a few words for anyone considering representing the UK at next year's contest.",
      "\"I would say to them, whoever it is, 'Call me, and we will have a serious conversation about it',\" he said with the haunted look of a man who has seen some things.",
      "4) Benson Boone has a new fan: Bez",
      "In addition to winning best new artist, US singer Benson Boone opened the ceremony with a spectacular performance that saw him suspended mid-air on a grand piano, before pulling off a spectacular front flip from a platform at the side of the stage.",
      "\"The insurance is always crazy,\" he laughed, \"but I love to perform.\"",
      "One person who couldn't believe his eyes was Happy Mondays star Bez, who accosted Boone during an interview with Rita Ora.",
      "\"I was so blown away by that performance, mate,\" he told the singer.",
      "\"When you came down on that shiny piano, I thought, 'Elton John is going to be so gutted.'\"",
      "5) Le Sserafim escaped to Manchester's Christmas market",
      "Manchester is home to the UK's biggest K-Pop shop and, on Sunday morning, the staff couldn't quite believe one of the genre's biggest girl bands had landed in their city.",
      "\"Le Sserafim were posting pictures from the Christmas market,\" one of them told me. \"That's only five minutes from here!\"",
      "The five-piece, who've been setting chart records over in the US, jetted in for their first-ever UK performance, a mash-up of Chasing Lightning and the 90s house banger Crazy.",
      "But they were more excited to be out on the town without being mobbed.",
      "\"It was so good, we had baklava!\" enthused singer Huh Yun-Jin; while her bandmate Sakura tucked into a portion of fish and chips.",
      "\"It was my first time,\" she said. \"I loved it.\"",
      "On stage at the EMAs, the band got one of the biggest screams of the night, despite being relatively unknown in the UK... for now.",
      "\"Coming to Europe is something that we've always dreamt of, so this is absolutely surreal,\" said Yun-Jin. \"We just want to make a good impression.\"",
      "Mission accomplished.",
      "6) Jedward spent two hours on the red carpet",
      "For absolutely no reason at all, Jedward went on a massive charm offensive for the international press.",
      "\"Oasis are back and Jedward are back!\" they declared, before racing over to baffled German and French journalists, while singing Stop Crying Your Heart Out.",
      "This went on for two deliriously brilliant hours, as the twins, who found fame on The X Factor 15 years ago, insisted that \"a lot of artists have been inspired by Jedward\".",
      "And, to be fair, they have proof. Mercury Prize nominee CMAT recently said the brothers had encouraged her to finish her second album, with a motivational voice message.",
      "\"You have to think about it, in life,\" explained John.",
      "\"Don't always think you're the main character. Reach out to other people. Serve that tennis ball and see what they do.\"",
      "\"It's always about keeping that spark alive,\" added Edward. \"We're like a support animal for all the artists.\"",
      "They were, to be honest, an absolute blast.",
      "7) The Liam Payne tribute was perfectly judged",
      "Liam Payne won 12 MTV EMAs during his time in One Direction, and later used the ceremony to launch his solo career, performing his global smash hit Strip That Down at the 2017 ceremony.",
      "It was only fitting that the event marked his death - but striking the right tone in the middle of a huge showbiz event is never easy.",
      "In the end, his friend and collaborator Rita Ora just spoke from the heart.",
      "\"There were so many ways that we were talking about honouring him,\" she said. \"But sometimes simply speaking is enough.\"",
      "Addressing the camera directly, she shared her memories of the 31-year-old, as her voice cracked.",
      "\"Liam Payne was one of the kindest people that I knew,\" she said. \"He brought so much joy to every room he walked into. And he left such a mark on this world.\"",
      "It was sombre and restrained, yet powerfully emotional. Ora wasn't the only one crying.",
      "8) Tyla paid tribute to Aaliyah",
      "South African star Tyla, best known for her viral hit Water, clinched both the best R&B and best Afrobeats awards.",
      "The awards marked her continued ascent, after being named one of the BBC's Sounds of 2024 - but she made sure to honour her inspirations.",
      "On the red carpet, she rocked a vintage Roberto Cavalli dress with a turquoise blue zebra print.",
      "The exact same dress had previously been worn by US rapper Eve at the 2000 Soul Train Awards.",
      "And R&B legend Aaliyah wore a canary yellow version at the 2000 MTV Awards, where she won best female video for Try Again.",
      "The ceremony took place in September 2000, less than a year before Aaliyah's tragic death in an plane accident.",
      "The singer was just 22 at the time - the same age that Tyla is now."

    "published": "Sat, 09 Nov 2024 09:31:07 GMT",
    "summary": "I have felt the shadow of Timmy since childhood - but never imagined the name would be hurled at me by strangers in my 30s.",
    "story": [
      "I can feel the anger rising. How am I facing this abuse again after 20 years?",
      "My name is Alex. But increasingly young people shout \u201cTimmy\u201d at me in the street. This isn\u2019t mistaken identity - it\u2018s mockery because I use a wheelchair.",
      "I should ignore it, but this time, I react. I turn to see a group of young teenage boys smirking in front of me. \u201cI heard you,\u201d I tell them. \u201cI know exactly who Timmy is.\u201d",
      "I know this because although we do not share a name, I have felt the shadow of Timmy since childhood - never through choice.",
      "A disabled character from dark-humoured satire cartoon series South Park, he uses a wheelchair and can only shout his name, mainly loudly and uncontrollably.",
      "Growing up at the show\u2019s initial peak during the turn of the millennium, Timmy followed me through school corridors, classrooms and playgrounds - no matter my friends, sociability or relatively good grades.",
      "Now, in my 30s, he\u2019s back. For the third time in a year, this time heading to my local train station in my wheelchair, I hear the familiar, brutish drawl: \u201cTimmaaah.\u201d",
      "A laugh. A snigger. An assumption I either won\u2019t hear or be unable to understand.",
      "When I confront the group of boys, one feigns innocence, claiming he\u2019d been speaking to his friend.",
      "\u201cYou weren\u2019t,\u201d I say. \u201cI was watching the show before you were born.\u201d",
      "Initially I was baffled as to how this phenomenon had returned to a new young generation, 24 years after the character first appeared.",
      "The answer lies in social media, particularly TikTok, where hundreds of short user-edited clips of Timmy and audio of him saying his name are sparking the revival.",
      "TikTok users often take part in trends by using the audio of popular videos and overlaying it with their own clips.",
      "That\u2019s what many have done with Timmy, where the name is used as a punchline, or played on top of unrelated clips of wheelchair users, reinforcing harmful and dehumanising stereotypes.",
      "The irony is that the character Timmy is presented with warmth in South Park and given character depth by co-creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker.",
      "An equal in the show\u2019s unflinching satire, his disability isn\u2019t necessarily the butt of the joke.",
      "Timmy is an accepted member of the class: he fails to complete homework, faces adversity and causes trouble with his disabled best friend Jimmy. His personality is conveyed through the different intonations in which he delivers his name.",
      "One episode, Timmy 2000, sees him win a battle of the bands as frontman for a metal group. The adult characters are shown to respond in an over-protective and condescending way - a striking criticism of the way society often treats disabled people.",
      "Nearly 20 years ago, a poll by Ouch! - the former name of the BBC\u2019s disability section - crowned Timmy as the most popular disabled TV character.",
      "Seattle Times\u2019 late disabled critic Jeff Shannon described Timmy as the most \u201cprogressive, provocative and socially relevant disability humour ever presented on American television\u201d.",
      "\u201cWithout telling viewers what to think, South Park challenges [the audience\u2019s] own fears and foibles regarding disability, and Timmy emerges triumphant,\u201d he wrote in 2005.",
      "In interviews Stone and Parker have spoken of how carefully and purposefully they integrated him into the show.",
      "But two decades later, the fact remains that on meeting Timmy, certainly at first glance, many find him outrageously offensive.",
      "Disability slurs: 'We can't keep being poked like a bear'",
      "Soap star condemns 'daily abuse and prejudice'",
      "Heartstopper: 'How Netflix show's eating disorder story helps me'",
      "South Park has always worked on multiple levels - offering outrageous forbidden shock value for schoolchildren while delivering crunching adult satire.",
      "None of this nuance is reflected in the TikTok trend, which reduces Timmy, and by extension wheelchair users and disability, to one-dimensional ridicule.",
      "This warped revival parallels the case of Joey Deacon, a man with cerebral palsy whose appearance on Blue Peter in the 1980s backfired to spark playground mockery, with kids shouting \u201cyou're a Joey!\u201d, and \u201cdo the Joey face\u201d.",
      "TikTok says its community guidelines strictly prohibit hate speech and content promoting discrimination, violence or harm based on disability.",
      "It removed the videos flagged by the BBC for violating this policy. But it didn\u2019t remove the Timmy sound used on several other videos - meaning it can be used again.",
      "TikTok didn\u2019t respond to a specific question about removing offensive audio.",
      "Ciaran O\u2019Connor, from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), a think tank focusing on online hate, says that sounds are a \u201cblind spot in TikTok\u2019s content moderation practices\u201d.",
      "Even if a video with an \u201coriginal sound\u201d is removed by the platform, the audio usually isn\u2019t, he says.",
      "This makes it a common way of bypassing TikTok\u2019s content moderation guidelines - including for harassment and abuse.",
      "Bullying and trolling of disabled people is still common online. Three in 10 said they\u2019d experienced it in a survey of 4,000 disabled people carried out by charity Scope.",
      "My last experience of having the name hurled at me on the street shocked me not so much in the name-calling, but the absolute lack of contrition shown even when challenged.",
      "It mirrored an experience last year when teenagers, again taunting me, rode off shouting \u201cTimmy is going to run us over.\u201d",
      "Ross Hovey, a wheelchair user and Liverpool fan, recently posted on LinkedIn about a near-identical experience.",
      "He was heading to a Liverpool match with his 79-year-old father and care assistant when a group of young men shouted \"Timmy\" at him. When Ross challenged them with \u201cI heard you,\u201d they too tried to claim innocence.",
      "The abuse raises questions about what role platforms should take in providing context to young users.",
      "\u201cBrief, contextless clips and participatory trends are at the heart of TikTok\u2019s popularity,\u201d  says O\u2019Connor.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s normally good and positive and funny \u2026 but when these dynamics are being used to demean, mock or stigmatise others, it does raise the question of whether TikTok should be doing more to inform or educate users.\u201d",
      "Alison Kerry, head of communications at Scope, told the BBC \"these kinds of ableist trends are deeply harmful. They don\u2019t exist in a vacuum, so a social media trend can quickly turn into someone facing abuse in their everyday life.\u201d",
      "The real-world impact is certainly becoming more noticeable.",
      "Disabled TikTokers have been posting about their experiences, and a teacher recently wrote a Reddit thread titled \u201cGetting real sick of this Timmy trend\u201d, expressing frustration at students' lack of awareness.",
      "This is why I challenged the teens at the station - I felt a duty not only to my 12-year-old self, who once burst into tears feeling helpless at similar taunts, but also to disabled students today.",
      "I returned a second time when the boys called out \u201cTimmy\u201d again after I turned to leave.",
      "\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked forcefully. Silence. One of the group eventually apologised, admitting the behaviour was wrong.",
      "\u201cSpeak to your friends,\u201d I pleaded, sensing a glimmer of hope. \u201cMaybe then they\u2019ll listen.\u201d"

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 20:11:53 GMT",
    "summary": "The BBC will lose one of its highest-profile presenters when he stops hosting Match of the Day.",
    "story": [
      "Gary Lineker, who will leave Match of the Day at the end of this season, BBC News understands, has been the steady hand who guided millions of fans through football's agonies and ecstasies.",
      "As host of the flagship show for 25 years, he is also one of the corporation's highest-profile presenters, earning \u00a31.3 million last year.",
      "His one-line pay-offs at the end of each show, summing up both the fans' mood and the match, may have looked seamless.",
      "But they were the result of years of honing his craft and presenting skills.",
      "As a former footballer of considerable pedigree - including England captain and striker, with 48 goals in 80 appearances - he famously never received a red or yellow card during his career.",
      "His ability to keep his cool on the pitch stood him in good stead for a career in live broadcasting when he retired as a player in 1994.",
      "Even while he was still at school, he had his sights set on sports journalism, deciding it would be his fall-back if football didn't work out.",
      "Clearly it did.",
      "Gary Lineker to leave BBC's Match of the Day",
      "Gary Lineker to leave BBC's Match of the Day",
      "Known for his ability to find gaps in the opposition's defence, and his \"poacher's instinct\" , Lineker was the 1986 World Cup Golden Boot winner, and the top goal-scorer in England three times, each with a different club: Leicester City, Everton and Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "But while his sports career was at its peak at the 1986 and 1990 World Cup finals, Lineker spent time with journalists staying in the same hotel as the England team.",
      "\"As early as my mid-20s, I knew which direction I wanted to go in when I retired from playing,\" he told the BBC in 2014.",
      "\"I would watch the newspaper guys write their opening paragraphs and sit with the radio journalists and talk to them about how they did their job.\"",
      "His ultimate aim was to end up as the presenter rather than a pundit.",
      "But he admitted his transition into radio and TV \"took a lot of work\".",
      "",
      "His early broadcasting attempts were \"fairly appalling\", he told the BBC's Media Show's Ros Atkins in 2021.",
      "Starting out on Radio 5 Live \"was all part of the learning process\", he said.",
      "\"I managed to stumble my way through it, and I learned from really good people alongside me who were incredibly helpful in the early days.\"",
      "Lineker built on that experience, writing all his own scripts and carving out a role for himself.",
      "Having watched ex-sports stars David Gower presenting the cricket and Sue Barker presenting the tennis, he questioned why it wasn't the same in football.",
      "\u201cI just thought, as a player who\u2019s played right at the top, if I could crack presenting it would give me a niche,\" he told BBC Radio 4 podcast Don't Tell Me the Score in 2019.",
      "\"It would give me an advantage over all the others.\"",
      "Meanwhile, his popularity as a footballer endured. In 1991, Arthur Smith and Chris England wrote a stage play called An Evening With Gary Lineker, about a couple trying to rekindle their marriage during the 1990 World Cup semi-final.",
      "Starring Caroline Quentin, Clive Owen, Paul Merton and Martin Clunes, it was filmed for TV in 1994 - with Lineker making a cameo appearance.",
      "He also began building his wider TV career, appearing as a team captain on BBC One's comedy panel show, They Think It's All Over, from 1995 to 2003.",
      "As a presenter, he got himself noticed when he stood in for Des Lynam on the Saturday afternoon sports show Grandstand, in 1997.",
      "By the mid-90s, Lineker was also appearing on Match of the Day as a pundit.",
      "This gave him a prime learning spot - right next to its experienced and slick host Lynam.",
      "\"Des was very helpful - I used to ask a lot of questions about the little things that he did, and picked up some of his nuances,\" the former footballer said.",
      "\"He told me to be brave occasionally with closing lines, and not to be afraid to try to be amusing.",
      "\"Again, the little pay-offs I sometimes make at the end of the show are something that came from him.\"",
      "By 1999, Lineker was hosting the show, and reaching audiences the BBC sometimes struggled to attract and retain.",
      "People would also tune in to see his chemistry with the show's pundits - including other former footballers such as Alan Shearer, Ian Wright, Micah Richards and Alan Hansen.",
      "Lineker's questions kept the analysis flowing, while he was always willing to share a joke and opinion of his own.",
      "He also memorably introduced the show in his pants in 2016, having pledged to \"do the first MOTD of next season in just my undies\" if his former club Leicester won the Premier League, which they did.",
      "Shearer and Wright couldn't keep straight faces.",
      "Their friendships often shone through. In June this year, Lineker and Shearer sent an emotional message of support to Hansen, after hearing the news that he was seriously ill in hospital.",
      "But despite his rapport with his colleagues, off-screen matters were not as straightforward.",
      "As one of the BBC's highest-paid presenters, regularly topping the list of the staff whose salaries are declared, he faced constant scrutiny.",
      "Lineker did not shy away from speaking out about his own views, particularly on social media, while simultaneously working for a broadcaster committed to impartiality.",
      "In March last year, he posted on X about the government's asylum policy - resulting in the BBC briefly suspending him.",
      "Shearer, Wright and other BBC sport presenters refused to appear on air, in protest at his absence.",
      "Match of the Day was reduced to a 20-minute edition minus its host, pundits and commentary - and the story made headline news for several days, with politicians and media commentators all weighing in on the issue.",
      "BBC director general Tim Davie subsequently apologised to licence fee payers for the disruption, calling it a \"difficult day\" for the corporation.",
      "Lineker was reinstated nine days later.",
      "The presenter later said the response to his tweet was \"silly - it shouldn't have been\".",
      "\"I love the BBC. I've been there for nearly 30 years but people make mistakes, they recognise that and they addressed it and in the end, thankfully, we're all back to work,\" he said.",
      "The headlines and dramas generated by his online views reinforced not only his high celebrity status - but also how keen the BBC was to hang on to him.",
      "The incident prompted a review of BBC social media guidelines. Last September, new rules were published for BBC flagship presenters, saying they should be allowed to express views on issues and policies, but stop short of political campaigning.",
      "Lineker said the recommendations were \"all very sensible\".",
      "By February this year, he said he was using X less often, saying the platform had become \"increasingly toxic\" under its new owner, Elon Musk.",
      "Despite this, he and the BBC are still parting company, and its flagship football show no longer has a host.",
      "Lineker has plenty of outside business interests, including the successful podcast production company he co-founded, called Goalhanger.",
      "It produces shows including The Rest Is History, The Rest Is Entertainment and The Rest Is Politics, which won the Champion prize at this year's Podcast Awards.",
      "But for the BBC, Lineker's departure comes hot on the heels of several scandals.",
      "Former Match of the Day and The One Show host Jermaine Jenas was sacked in August following complaints about workplace conduct.",
      "In September, the BBC apologised to Amanda Abbington and upheld some of her complaints against her 2023 Strictly dance partner Giovanni Pernice, while clearing him of the most serious allegations.",
      "In the same month, Mr Davie said he could not see disgraced ex-news presenter Huw Edwards working at the corporation again.",
      "Edwards was given a six-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, after he admitted charges of making indecent images of children.",
      "So the BBC is in need of some good headlines - and Lineker's departure means it now has to find an exceptional host to fill his shoes, which will not be an easy task.",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 13:58:27 GMT",
    "summary": "The actress was the last surviving original cast member of BBC Radio 4 serial The Archers.",
    "story": [
      "June Spencer, who has died aged 105, was the last surviving original cast member of The Archers.",
      "For nearly 70 years, she played Peggy Woolley in the long-running radio drama: one of the best-loved matriarchs in British broadcasting.",
      "Spencer helped launch BBC Radio's \"everyday story of country folk\" on 1 January 1951. Clement Attlee was Prime Minister, and meat, cheese, sugar, and petrol were still being rationed after World War Two.",
      "As Peggy, she weathered the ups and downs of life in Ambridge, with plot lines including alcoholism, gambling, and dementia, until Spencer\u2019s retirement in 2022 at the age of 103.",
      "At the time, her colleagues paid tribute to an actor who never fluffed a line.",
      "\u201cI have rarely worked with such an inventive, focused and technically brilliant actor,\u201d said Jeremy Howe \u2013 the editor of the programme, \"or with such a lovely person\".",
      "The Archers radio star June Spencer dies aged 105",
      "June Rosalind Spencer was born on 14 June 1919, just six months after the end of World War One.",
      "Her acting career began at the age of three, when she was cast as King of the Land of Nod in a school play. When she heard the audience laugh, June knew it was the life for her.",
      "She went to Nottingham High School for Girls, which she found \u201cvery stark, grey and cold\u201d.",
      "She was forced to give up sport \u2013 her favourite lesson \u2013 when a doctor somehow misdiagnosed a heart condition.",
      "An only child, her father was a \u201csensible and supportive\u201d biscuit salesman, but her mother was another story.",
      "A \u201ccomplex woman\u201d, Mrs Spencer had once aspired to the stage herself, but \u2013 according to her daughter - \u201cjust gave up on life... and decided she was an invalid at the age of 40\u201d.",
      "June Spencer had little choice but to leave school to look after her mother \u2013 who eventually lived until she was 94.",
      "Miserably, mother and daughter sat together in a darkened room in case Mrs Spencer had \"an attack\".",
      "Her headmistress was angry, complaining that her former pupil was throwing her life away. \u201cI was frightened of her,\u201d June later recalled.",
      "\u201cShe told me, \u2018Of course, you can't expect to get anywhere without your School Certificate\u2019.",
      "\"I have thought of those words many times since, particularly when I received my OBE.\u201d",
      "In her teens, the aspiring actress enjoyed writing comic monologues - performing them as part of the after-dinner entertainment at local Masonic lodges.",
      "But with her heart set on the stage, her mother was obstructive: refusing to let her daughter sit the exams for the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.",
      "\u201cI think my mother thought I would fall in with a bad lot,\u201d Spencer said. \"When I did finally get in [to the theatre] she said: 'Oh well, I suppose it was inevitable'.\"",
      "She joined a drama club, studied for a London Guildhall drama school certificate, and finally joined a local theatre company in 1942.",
      "The same year she married a \u201cfair-haired, blue-eyed boy with the cheekiest grin I\u2019d ever seen\u201d.",
      "She had first met Roger Brocksom when she was 17 years old, on holiday near Skegness \u2013 but he didn\u2019t have the money to buy her a ring.",
      "The wedding took place while he was on leave from the army; wartime shortages meant they had rice paper rather than icing on the cake.",
      "A series of small parts on BBC radio programmes followed, and \u2013 by the time her husband returned from the war \u2013 Spencer was finding regular work.",
      "Then came the moment that changed her life.",
      "The founder of The Archers, Godfrey Baseley, is said to have talked openly in meetings about who was going to be in his new programme \u2013 and news travelled fast.",
      "It reached a mystified June Spencer while she was getting lunch in the BBC canteen.",
      "\u201cA girl said to me, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re going to be in The Archers, aren\u2019t you?\u2019\" she recalled. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Am I? What\u2019s The Archers?\u2019\u201d",
      "In 1950, there were a few pilot episodes and then the big launch on New Year\u2019s Day, 1951 \u2013 with June Spencer playing a heavily pregnant Peggy Archer.",
      "The series hoped to be a public service for farmers, with gentle storylines that brought urban listeners into rural surroundings \u2013 almost as if they were eavesdropping on farmers and their wives.",
      "To start with, Spencer had a 13-week contract and little idea that she was helping to create a unique slice of British life.",
      "The shows were then broadcast live, with producers creeping in and scribbling alterations on scripts, moments before she read them.",
      "But The Archers was an instant hit with the actors \u2013 despite never having their credits read out on air \u2013 in demand for local appearances.",
      "\"I remember going down to a gathering of all the Women's Institutes in Cornwall,\u201d June recalled, \u201cand I was mobbed. It was quite frightening.\"",
      "There was a brief break from the show when June and Roger adopted two children in the late 1950s. Thelma Rogers took over the part for a while, but soon returned to the theatre.",
      "On taking back the role, Spencer insisted she had little in common with Peggy, who rather lacked a sense of humour, but her on-air journey from young barmaid to grieving widow saw them both involved in some of the show's strongest storylines.",
      "Peggy\u2019s first husband, Jack Archer, succumbed to alcoholism, while her second husband Jack Woolley \u2013 with whom she hoped to enjoy a happy retirement - was diagnosed with Alzheimer's.",
      "The show\u2019s slow-moving plot lines meant each disease unfolded over years - as they do in real life. And both issues were close to June\u2019s heart.",

      "\u2018Very disappointing\u2019",
      "The demand had been based on modelling the spread of the virus, along with the need to deal with other pressures that coming winter and resume more planned, or elective, surgery and other treatments for non-Covid patients.",
      "But the inquiry heard the Treasury and the prime minister\u2019s private office had refused the request, saying they wanted more use made of temporary Nightingale hospitals along with the private sector.",
      "And Ms Prichard had been told the decision would be looked at again as part of a wider spending review expected in the autumn of 2021.",
      "She called the decision \u201cvery disappointing\u201d, saying waiting lists for planned NHS treatment in England would be in \u201cquite a different position\u201d today had the extra funding been agreed.",
      "\u201cIf we had had that capacity, we could certainly have treated thousands more patients\u2026 as well as being more resilient going into the second wave of the pandemic and into winter more generally,\u201d Ms Prichard said.",

      "By that point, new treatments had been discovered, including the cheap steroid dexamethasone, and the first Covid vaccines were starting to be rolled out in small numbers.",

      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has announced fresh climate change targets at a global summit, saying he wants the UK to lead on cutting emissions.",
      "The UK will now aim for an 81% cut in its emissions by 2035, he told the UN conference of parties (COP29) in Azerbaijan.",
      "The target updates a 78% pledge by 2035 under the previous Conservative government, although that also included international aviation and shipping emissions, and goes beyond another pledge of a 68% reduction by 2030.",
      "Sir Keir insisted the government would not \"tell people how to live their lives\" but the target was vital to the UK's future prosperity and energy security.",
      "Climate talks open in shadow of Trump victory",
      "What is COP29 and how will Trump\u2019s election affect the climate talks?",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "The prime minister said the new target was based on recommendations from the UK's independent climate change committee (CCC) aimed at limiting global warming to 1.5C compared to levels in 1990.",
      "He was one of only seven G20 leaders attending the summit, with 13 absentees including the premiers of the US, China, France and Germany.",
      "Sir Keir would not be drawn on his views about president-elect Donald Trump, who has promised to cut climate rules during his election campaign.",
      "He said: \"Make no mistake, the race is on for the clean energy jobs of the future, the economy of tomorrow, and I don't want to be in the middle of the pack - I want to get ahead of the game\".",
      "The target will be included in papers to go before Parliament before February and, although Sir Keir did not announce any new policies, he did commit to continuing to provide \u00a311.6bn of climate finance until March 2026, a pledge made under the previous government.",
      "Announcing a \u00a31bn investment in a wind turbine project in Hull, which he said would create 1,300 local jobs, Sir Keir said the world was standing at a \"critical juncture in the climate crisis\".",
      "The UK has called for other countries to match the new target, following stark warnings from the United Nations that the world is on course for a 3.1C rise without further cuts.",
      "The latest target is broadly in line with the UK\u2019s legally-binding carbon-cutting path towards net zero emissions by 2050, contained in the 2015 Paris Agreement.",
      "That international agreement ties the UK to ratcheting up new \"nationally determined contributions\" (NDCs) for carbon reduction every five years, which has seen the a 68% cut by 2030 increase to an 81% cut by 2035.",
      "The Climate Change Act 2008 also set legally-binding domestic agreements on carbon budgets in five year chunks until 2050, which unlike the NDC targets also include international aviation and shipping emissions.",
      "The latest of these is the sixth carbon budget, which runs between 2033-2037, and has already been set at 78%.",
      "Since taking power in July, Labour has ended an effective ban on new onshore wind projects and pledged not to issue any new oil and gas exploration licenses in the North Sea, as well as closing the UK's last coal power plant in September.",
      "The switch towards greener energy has already halved the UK's annual greenhouse gas emissions since 1990 - but the CCC has previously said further reductions will be difficult without lifestyle changes.",
      "The government advisers said taxes on meat and dairy might be needed if people do not voluntarily reduce their consumption of the products, and there should be moves to phase out the use of petrol cars.",
      "Speaking at the summit, Sir Keir said the new UK target would be \"difficult\" but \"achievable\", and he wanted government to \"tread lightly on people's lives\".",
      "\"It\u2019s not about telling people how to live their lives \u2013 I\u2019m not interested in that,\" he added.",
      "\"I am interested in making sure their energy bills are stable, that we\u2019ve got energy independence, and that we also along the way pick up the next generation of jobs.\"",
      "However, shadow energy secretary Claire Coutinho claimed the new target would lead to \"hardship\" for the British people.",
      "During energy questions in the Commons, Coutinho said making \"already stringent carbon emission targets even higher\" would require a \"shift away from meat and dairy\" and \"less travel\".",
      "The Conservative MP claimed the approach would \"see our reliance on Chinese imports - a country which is 60% powered by coal - go through the roof\".",
      "In response, energy minister Kerry McCarthy said: \"It's really important that we are stepping up and showing global ambition.",
      "\"Reaching net zero in this country and getting to clean power by 2030 is a massive opportunity - it is not a cost.\"",
      "The interim chair of the CCC, Professor Piers Forster, welcomed the new target and said it was feasible based on the latest science, technological developments, and the UK\u2019s national circumstances.",
      "\"Our analysis shows that this is a feasible target that will support jobs and investment,\" he said, adding the UK was currently running behind schedule on delivering its 2030 target of 68% cuts.",
      "He added: \"A target is only as meaningful as the delivery against it.",
      "\"The UK needs to get back on track to deliver against our existing 2030 NDC commitment.",
      "\"We need to see further urgent action to speed up deployment of low-carbon solutions such as electric vehicles, heat pumps, and tree planting.\"",
      "All countries who have signed up to the Paris Agreement should submit their latest carbon reduction targets by a deadline of February next year and a copy of that memo, known as the Information to facilitate Clarity, Transparency and Understanding (ICTU), will be presented to MPs before then."

      "Jobs controversy",
      "Ahead of the 2021 election, the SNP changed internal rules to require MPs to resign their seat at Westminster to fight for selection to Holyrood.",
      "The party previously criticised former Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross for holding seats at Westminster and Holyrood, as well as being a professional football referee.",
      "In 2021, SNP MSP Karen Adam claimed Ross was \u201cfailing\u201d his constituents \u201cby thinking he can do both jobs properly\u201d.",

      "He pointed to examples of SNP politicians who have held seats in both parliaments before, citing First Minister John Swinney and ex-First Minister Alex Salmond.",
      "SNP MSP Emma Roddick said she hoped Flynn \"rethinks\" his ambition to hold two seats seats.",
      "She posted on X: \u201cParty members set this rule for good reasons. Rightly, Douglas Ross was criticised for holding two roles simultaneously.\"",
      "The Highlands and Islands representative said she could not imagine \"being a good MSP\" while spending \"half\" her time in London.",
      "She added: \"(It is) Key that rules apply to everyone equally; men and women.\"",
      "One former SNP MP told BBC Scotland News: \"I'm not sure being seen to do Audrey Nicoll out of her job so that he can have two jobs is a smart pitch.\"",

      "The SNP is yet to decide what its rules will be for candidates at the next election.",
      "The change on dual mandates led to then-MP Joanna Cherry pulling out of the selection contest for the Edinburgh Central seat.",
      "Health Secretary Neil Gray also had to resign as an MP before being elected to Holyrood in 2021.",
      "Cherry - who lost her Westminster seat in July\u2019s general election and has ruled out a bid for election to Holyrood in 2026 - said the SNP rule was \u201cperson specific\u201d.",
      "Responding to Flynn\u2019s announcement, she added in a post on X that the rule \u201cserved its purpose\u201d and predicted it would not be in place for 2026.",
      "The Scottish government recently said it intended to launch a consultation on proposals to ban MSPs from holding dual mandates, though any changes are not expected to be introduced in time for the 2026 election.",
      "'Absolute hypocrisy'",

      "He told BBC Scotland News: \u201cIt\u2019s absolute hypocrisy and it\u2019s appalling.\u201d",

      "Few who follow Scottish politics will be surprised by Stephen Flynn\u2019s decision.",
      "He\u2019s widely regarded as one of the SNP\u2019s most talented politicians. And Holyrood offers opportunities for him that Westminster never will (such as being a government minister or - one day perhaps - first minister).",

    "story": [
      "Boris Johnson\u2019s government blocked a request to fund another 10,000 hospital beds at the height of the Covid pandemic, the chief executive of NHS England has said.",
      "Amanda Pritchard told the UK Covid-19 Inquiry the decision, made by the Treasury in July 2020, had been \u201cvery disappointing\u201d.",
      "Extra beds and staff would have been used to cut waiting lists for planned care and \u201cbuild resilience\u201d going into a second winter wave of the pandemic, she said.",
      "The government has said it cannot comment while the inquiry is in progress.",
      "Health ministers from the time are expected to give evidence later this month, to the third section of the inquiry, looking at Covid's impact on the NHS and healthcare systems across the UK.",
      "Ms Pritchard served as NHS England\u2019s chief operating officer from 2019 until she was promoted to chief executive, in August 2021.",
      "In her evidence, she said a request had been made to the government, for 10,000 extra permanent, staffed hospital beds, in July 2020.",
      "\u2018Very disappointing\u2019",
      "The demand had been based on modelling the spread of the virus, along with the need to deal with other pressures that coming winter and resume more planned, or elective, surgery and other treatments for non-Covid patients.",
      "But the inquiry heard the Treasury and the prime minister\u2019s private office had refused the request, saying they wanted more use made of temporary Nightingale hospitals along with the private sector.",
      "And Ms Prichard had been told the decision would be looked at again as part of a wider spending review expected in the autumn of 2021.",
      "She called the decision \u201cvery disappointing\u201d, saying waiting lists for planned NHS treatment in England would be in \u201cquite a different position\u201d today had the extra funding been agreed.",
      "\u201cIf we had had that capacity, we could certainly have treated thousands more patients\u2026 as well as being more resilient going into the second wave of the pandemic and into winter more generally,\u201d Ms Prichard said.",
      "In the summer of 2020, the NHS in England had a total permanent bed capacity to treat about 95,000 patients in acute hospitals.",
      "That was increased by another 4,000 from winter 2023, under a recovery plan agreed by then Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.",
      "\u2018Completely overwhelming\u2019",
      "Later in her evidence, Ms Pritchard said the health service had faced a period of \u201cextreme pressure\u201d in the winter of 2020-21, as another wave of Covid spread across the country.",
      "By that point, new treatments had been discovered, including the cheap steroid dexamethasone, and the first Covid vaccines were starting to be rolled out in small numbers.",
      "But the level of community transmission at the time meant some intensive-care units were still being pushed \u201cto the brink\u201d and were \u201cright on the edge\u201d of running out of bed space.",
      "Nationally, the health service had never had to \u201csystematically limit\u201d access to treatments because hospitals could not cope with demand, Ms Pritchard said.",
      "\u201cThat does not mean, though, that it did not feel completely overwhelming to staff at this time in those places - and it does not mean that the kind of care that was being provided was anything like normal,\u201d she added.",
      "'Field hospitals'",
      "Ms Pritchard was also asked about the seven temporary Nightingale hospitals built quickly, in March and April 2020, across England to treat Covid patients.",
      "Data seen by the inquiry shows the total cost to the taxpayer, including setting up and decommissioning, is now estimated at \u00a3358.5m.",
      "The hospitals \u2013 in Birmingham, Bristol, Exeter, Harrogate, London, Manchester and Sunderland \u2013 treated 141 Covid patients in the first wave of the virus and 1,097 Covid and other patients in the second wave.",
      "In total, \u00a350.4m was spent on one site, Birmingham, which was never used by patients in the pandemic.",
      "The site in Bristol also carried out 6,554 assessments for patients from the eye hospital in the city.",
      "Ms Pritchard told the inquiry the programme had still been \u201cuseful\u201d, as the sites had been envisaged as \u201cmilitary field hospitals\u201d at the time.",

      "He added he would not comment on \"hypothetical scenarios\" of a future US administration.",

    "story": [
      "Top pub and restaurant bosses have warned the chancellor that tax rises in last month's Budget will \"unquestionably\" cause closures and job losses.",
      "In a letter, more than 200 signatories have said the hospitality industry is disproportionately impacted by an \"unsustainable\" hike in the amount employers pay in National Insurance contributions (NICs).",
      "It adds that businesses have \"no capacity to pass the costs onto customers\", which would instead lead to job cuts and closures of smaller firms.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has said that her National Insurance changes for businesses will generate \u00a325bn, which would aid funding of public services, such as the NHS.",
      "From April, the rate employers pay in National Insurance will rise from 13.8% to 15%, and the threshold at which they start paying the tax on each employee's salary will be reduced from \u00a39,100 per year to \u00a35,000.",
      "Darren Jones, chief secretary to the Treasury, told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that the changes had been designed in a way \"that tried to limit the extra cost on small business\".",
      "Signatories of the letter include Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UKHospitality, the bosses of pub firms Fuller's and Stonegate Group, and Premier Inn's owner, Whitbread.",
      "They are supported by a further 209 businesses, together employing tens of thousands of people across the UK.",
      "According to the letter, the cost increases will cause jobs to be \"drastically\" cut and hours to be reduced for workers.",
      "Ms Nicholls told the BBC that firms in the industry facing these \"tough decisions\" may also reconsider investing.",
      "\"We understand that the government has a tough job to do,\" she said, but urged politicians to \"have a rethink\".",
      "Jones said that the government would not reassess the plan, and that many employers would pay the same in NI contributions as they do now, or less.",
      "\"I think the public would recognise that bigger businesses are able to burden some of the contributions that we need to make to the state.",
      "\"Getting the NHS back on its feet so workers who are off sick can get back to work is probably something that we'd say we'd all benefit from,\" he added.",
      "Impact on lower earners",
      "The letter from industry bosses suggests that changes in the NICs threshold are \"regressive in their impact on lower earners and will impact flexible working practices which many older workers and parents rely upon\".",
      "The signatories are calling for the government to consider one of two measures to \"protect businesses who employ low earners\"  to mitigate the impact.",
      "Suggested measures are a new employer NICs band which would apply between \u00a35,000 and \u00a39,100 at a lower rate of 5%, or implementing an exemption for taxpayers working fewer than 20 hours per week.",
      "The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has calculated that three quarters of the impact of the NI changes will be felt by employees as bosses hold back on pay rises and hiring in the face of higher wage bills.",
      "During a select committee hearing on Tuesday, the OBR's Prof David Miles said it was \"very plausible\" this would disproportionately affect lower-paid workers.",
      "The changes set out in the Budget are, however, predicted to raise some \u00a325bn a year, making it one of the biggest single tax-raising measures in history.",
      "The chancellor has previously said that she was not immune to \"criticism\" over the move, but has argued that it will put public finances on a \"firm footing\".",
      "The hospitality industry's letter follows on from big British supermarkets such as M&S and Sainsbury's hinting that they may put up prices in a bid to offset higher wage bills.",

      "But by the time Keir Starmer became prime minister in July this year, the proportion of people in England living in social housing had fallen to about 16% of the population \u2013 about four million.",
      "About two million council-built properties have been sold to their tenants at significantly discounted prices under the Right To Buy (RTB) scheme since it was introduced by Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Conservative government in the early 1980s.",
      "Michael Heseltine described the advent of RTB as \"laying the foundations of one of the most important social revolutions of the century\", but was selling off council houses more cheaply than new ones could be built simply laying the foundations of a housing crisis?",
      "Waiting lists",
      "Historically, money raised from selling off council houses has not gone far towards building new ones - new ones desperately needed, considering about 1.3 million people are on waiting lists for them in England.",
      "Across the north-west of England, for example, about 4,350 council houses have been sold off in the last 10 years, with the money made from the sales going towards building or buying just over 1,400 others, according to government data.",
      "While the \u00a3336,612,000 raised from those sales may sound a reasonable sum, it works out on average at about \u00a377,000 per house. And, generally, councils have not been allowed to keep the whole amount, instead having to hand a sizeable chunk back to the government.",
      "About 200,000 people are on waiting lists for social housing in the region.",
      "While housing associations may have built homes, and there may have been schemes funded by cash from other government pots, the fact that the money raised from selling off homes is nowhere near enough to rebuild or buy like-for-like has been a long-standing concern.",
      "And it would seem Labour deputy prime minister and minister for housing Angela Rayner \u2013 who famously bought her own council house in Stockport under RTB \u2013 has taken on board the views of RTB critics.",
      "Rayner has said recently she may impose restrictions so that people who move into newly built council houses will not be able to buy them in the future.",
      "It is a decision that is likely to be welcomed by Labour politicians in regions where the need for social housing is arguably as great as ever, but the amount of it available is very low.",
      "The Labour metro-mayors of both Liverpool and Manchester regions have both said they want to see more social housing built in their regions.",
      "In May, Andy Burnham, leader of Greater Manchester, called on the-then Conservative government to pause RTB on new builds after losing 500 social homes to the scheme in 2022.",
      "He argued that if planned homes could be bought by their tenants, it would be \"like trying to fill a bath without the plug in\".",

      "People who are tenants of RSLs can buy their homes under \u201cpreserved\u201d RTB if they lived in their homes when the council owned them.",
      "And once someone has lived in an RSL property for three years, they can apply for the Right To Acquire.",
      "Rotheram says cheaper borrowing rates for RSLs and a moratorium on sales would help boost growth in social housing.",
      "\"You are not going to build a lot of houses for someone to come along in three or four years and buy it below market value,\" he says.",
      "\"How we deal with this is part of our growth plan going to the government, and we are now trying to see if we can work with [Rayner] to come up with proposals.\"",
      "Blackpool Council\u2019s cabinet member for economy and the built environment, Mark Smith, is clear that while the money generated from RTB sales is used to support various investments in housing, the RTB receipts his council receives are \"not sufficient to replace lost social rent housing\".",
      "And he says even with changes such as the government giving councils more flexibility to allow RTB receipts to be used alongside cash from other streams such as funds given by developers who get planning permission for private schemes, there is still some red tape in the way of using different types of funding together to build council housing.",
      "\"We do the best we can within the parameters of the policy as it exists currently but there is always room for improvement,\" he says.",
      "Under the new Labour government policies, councils and housing associations are being given \u201cmore freedom\u201d to decide how to use their RTB money.",
      "Previously, only 50% of the money a council received from a sale could go towards building or buying a new house.",
      "But in future councils will be able to use all that money, and put money received from private developers handed over as part of planning agreements into projects as well.",
      "These deals, known as Section 106 agreements, see developers give money to councils to mitigate any negative impacts their private schemes might have on local communities or housing markets.",
      "Sources within the social housing sector say that in the past the \"policy has never achieved anything like a one-for-one replacement ratio\".",
      "\"If it had then there would be a lot less concern about the policy,\" one says.",
      "\"Yes, a Right To Buy home continues to be a home after it\u2019s sold, but it contributes to a huge loss of social housing stock and contributes to housing waiting lists, or people having to live in unsuitable accommodation.\"",
      "'Serious shortage'",
      "The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils, says there is a \"serious housing shortage in this country\" and \"record numbers of people living in temporary accommodation\".",
      "Adam Hug, the LGA\u2019s housing spokesman, says: \u201cWhile the Right To Buy can and has delivered home ownership for many the scheme in its current form does not work.",
      "\"Rising discounts, alongside other measures that restrict councils\u2019 use of Right To Buy receipts, mean that the money raised from the sale of property is usually not sufficient to cover the building costs of replacing the property.",
      "\"We have long called for the removal of rules and restrictions which disincentivise local authorities from building social homes, at risk of losing them.",
      "\"Councils must be given the control, power and flexibility to use receipt monies in a way that works best for their local areas, which includes retaining 100 per cent of the receipts permanently.\"",
      "'Scandal'",
      "In 2012, the Conservative-led government increased the discount a tenant could receive when buying their home.",
      "Since coming to power, Labour has said the discount will be reduced to between \u00a316,000 and \u00a338,000, depending on the location \u2013 a significant reduction from the \u00a3136,000 discount currently available in London and the discount of just over \u00a3100,000 elsewhere.",
      "Rayner, who bought her Stockport council house under a RTB discount in 2007 and sold it several years later for \u00a348,000 more than she paid for it, said she wanted to see a \u201cfairer\u201d system.",
      "Her department says it is a \"scandal\" that only about one third of homes lost to RTB have been replaced since 2012, and that it was \"working at pace to reverse the continued decline of social rented homes\".",
      "But while the government stresses there are \"no plans to abolish the RTB\", the \"social revolution\" Lord Heseltine heralded nearly 45 years ago is clearly facing a radical change to everything but its name.",

      "And earlier on the Today programme, former Defence Secretary Ben Wallace accused Labour of making an effective \u201ccut in our defence budget\u201d by including \u00a33bn of Ukraine funding in it.",
      "If Labour reach the 2.5% target, he said he\u2019d welcome it, \u201cbut it\u2019s got to be real money with a timetable\u201d.",
      "There is little disagreement that more resources are needed.",
      "John Healey himself has acknowledged the military \u201chave not been ready to fight\u201d. A squeeze on funding over many years had made money tight \u2013 the forces \u201chollowed out\u201d, according to Wallace.",

      "Some insiders argue rising threats around the world mean the UK should spend way more than 2.5% in any case.",
      "Another former minister told me, \u201cby any measure we are underspending \u2013 if you don\u2019t buy the insurance policy you end up having to pay yourself and the cost of real conflicts would be immense in comparison\u201d.",
      "A defence source told me, \u201cwe are going to have to make a move on spending or we can put our fingers in our ears and hope we get through it \u2013 the Treasury has to do the maths on this \u2013 the way to stop spending 5 percent of GDP in the future is to spend now.\u201d",

      "Twenty-three now meet the 2% target, up from just six countries in 2021.",
      "Rather than worrying about what Trump might do in office, they said, \u201ca precondition for Trump to take European defence seriously is for Europe to take its own defence seriously.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s hard to see how that does not mean more countries on the continent spending more of their own cash.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s not kid ourselves, Nato does deter Russia, and we have to make sure that happens,\u201d said a defence source.",
      "America\u2019s role in our security is vital. But sources in government acknowledge that Europe, with conflict on its fringes, must play a vigorous financial part.",
      "Eager to be seen as the leader in Nato, the UK is taking steps to boost defence cooperation across the continent \u2013 leaders recently signed a \u201clandmark defence agreement\u201d with Germany.",

    "story": [
      "The mystery as to why a beluga whale appeared off the coast of Norway wearing a harness may finally have been solved.",
      "The tame white whale, which locals named Hvaldimir, made headlines five years ago amidst widespread speculation that it was a Russian spy.",
      "Now an expert in the species says she believes the whale did indeed belong to the military and escaped from a naval base in the Arctic Circle.",
      "But Dr Olga Shpak does not believe it was a spy. She believes the beluga was being trained to guard the base and fled because it was a \"hooligan\".",
      "Seeking sanctuary for whale dubbed a Russian spy",
      "Russia has always refused to confirm or deny that the beluga whale was trained by its military.",
      "But Dr Shpak, who worked in Russia researching marine mammals from the 1990s until she returned to her native Ukraine in 2022, told BBC News: \u201cFor me it\u2019s 100% (certain).\u201d",
      "Dr Shpak, whose account is based on conversations with friends and former colleagues in Russia, features in a BBC documentary, Secrets of the Spy Whale, which is now on BBC iPlayer and being shown on BBC Two on Wednesday at 21:00 GMT.",
      "Secrets of the Spy Whale",
      "The mysterious whale first came to public attention five years ago when it approached fishermen off the northern coast of Norway.",
      "\u201cThe whale starts rubbing against the boat,\u201d Joar Hesten, one of the fishermen, says. \u201cI heard about animals in distress that instinctively knew that they need help from humans. I was thinking that this is one smart whale.\u201d",
      "The sighting was unusual because the beluga was so tame and they're rarely seen as far south. It was also wearing a harness, which had a mount for a camera, and bore the words, in English, \u201cEquipment St Petersburg\u201d.",
      "Mr Hesten helped to remove the harness from the whale, which then swam to the nearby port of Hammerfest, where it lived for several months.",
      "Seemingly unable to catch live fish to eat, it charmed visitors by nudging at their cameras and even on one occasion returning a mobile phone.",
      "\u201cIt was very obvious that this particular whale had been conditioned to be putting his nose on anything that looked like a target because he was doing it each time,\u201d says Eve Jourdain, a researcher from the Norwegian Orca Survey.",
      "\u201cBut we have no idea what kind of facility he was in, so we don\u2019t know what he was trained for.\u201d",
      "Captivated by the whale's story Norway made arrangements for the beluga to be monitored and fed. The name it was given \u2013 Hvaldimir - is a nod to hval which is Norwegian for whale, and the name of Russia's President, Vladimir Putin.",
      "Dr Shpak did not want to name her sources in Russia for their own safety but said she had been told that when the beluga surfaced in Norway, the Russian marine mammal community immediately identified it as one of theirs.",
      "\u201cThrough the chain of vets and trainers the message came back \u2013 that they were missing a beluga called Andruha,\u201d she says.",
      "According to Dr Shpak, Andruha/Hvaldimir had first been captured in 2013 in the Sea of Okhotsk in Russia's Far East. A year later it was moved from a facility owned by a dolphinarium in St Petersburg to the military programme in the Russian Arctic, where his trainers and vets remained in contact.",
      "\u201cI believe that when they started to work in open water, trusting this animal (not to swim away), the animal just gave up on them,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cWhat I've heard from the guys at the commercial dolphinarium who used to have him was that Andruha was smart, so a good choice to be trained. But at the same time, he was kind of like a hooligan - an active beluga - so they were not surprised that he gave up on (following) the boat and went where he wanted to.\u201d",
      "Satellite images from near the Russian naval base in Murmansk show what could have been Hvaldimir/Andruha\u2019s old home. Pens can clearly be seen in the water with what appear to be white whales inside.",
      "\u201cThe location of the beluga whales very close to the submarines and the surface vessels might tell us that they are actually part of a guarding system,\u201d says Thomas Nilsen, from Norwegian online newspaper The Barents Observer.",
      "Russia, for its part, has never officially addressed the claim that Hvaldimir/Andruha was trained by its army. But it does have a long history of training marine mammals for military purposes.",
      "Speaking in 2019, a Russian reserve colonel, Viktor Baranets, said: \"If we were using this animal for spying, do you really think we'd attach a mobile phone number with the message 'Please call this number'?\"",
      "Sadly, Hvaldimir/Andruha\u2019s incredible story does not have a happy ending.",
      "Having learned to feed himself, it spent several years travelling south along Norway\u2019s coast and in May 2023 was even spotted off the coast of Sweden.",
      "Then on September 1 2024 its body was found floating at sea, near the town of Risavika, on Norway's south-western coast.",
      "Had the long arm of Putin\u2019s Russia caught up with the reluctant beluga?",
      "It appears not. Despite some activist groups suggesting that the whale had been shot, that explanation has been dismissed by the Norwegian police.",
      "They say there was nothing to suggest that human activity directly caused the beluga\u2019s death. A post-mortem examination revealed that Hvaldimir/Andruha died after a stick became lodged in his mouth."

    "story": [
      "The planet Uranus and its five biggest moons may not be the dead sterile worlds that scientists have long thought.",
      "Instead, they may have oceans, and the moons may even be capable of supporting life, scientists say.",
      "Much of what we know about them was gathered by Nasa\u2019s Voyager 2 spacecraft which visited nearly 40 years ago.",
      "But a new analysis shows that Voyager's visit coincided with a powerful solar storm, which led to a misleading idea of what the Uranian system is really like.",
      "Uranus is a beautiful, icy ringed world in the outer reaches of our solar system. It is among the coldest of all the planets. It is also tilted on its side compared to all the other worlds \u2013 as if it had been knocked over \u2013 making it arguably the weirdest.",
      "We got our first close-up look at it in 1986, when Voyager 2 flew past and sent back sensational pictures of the planet and its five major moons.",
      "But what amazed scientists even more was the data Voyager 2 sent back indicating that the Uranian system was even weirder than they thought.",
      "The measurements from the spacecraft\u2019s instruments indicated that the planets and moons were inactive, unlike the other moons in the outer solar system. They also showed that Uranus\u2019s protective magnetic field was strangely distorted. It was squashed and pushed away from the Sun.",
      "A planet\u2019s magnetic field traps any gases and other material coming off the planet and its moons. These might be from oceans or geological activity. Voyager 2 found none, suggesting that Uranus and its five largest moons were sterile and inactive.",
      "This came as an enormous surprise because it was unlike the solar system\u2019s other planets and their moons.",
      "But the new analysis has solved the decades-long mystery. It shows that Voyager 2 flew past on a bad day.",
      "The new research shows that just as Voyager 2 flew past Uranus, the Sun was raging, creating a powerful solar wind that might have blown the material away and temporarily distorted the magnetic field.",
      "So, for 40 years we have had an incorrect view of what Uranus and its five largest moons are normally like, according to Dr William Dunn of University College London.",
      "\u201cThese results suggest that the Uranian system could be much more exciting than previously thought. There could be moons there that could have the conditions that are necessary for life, they might have oceans below the surface that could be teeming with fish!\u201d.",
      "Linda Spilker was a young scientist working on the Voyager programme when the Uranus data came in. She is now still serving as the project scientist for the Voyager missions. She said that she was delighted to hear about the new results, which have been published in the Journal Nature Astronomy.",
      "\u201cThe results are fascinating, and I am really excited to see that there is potential for life in the Uranian system,\u201d she told BBC News.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m also so pleased that so much is being done with the Voyager data. It\u2019s amazing that scientists are looking back at the data we collected in 1986 and finding new results and new discoveries\u201d.",
      "Dr Affelia Wibisono of the Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies, who is independent of the research team, described the results as \u201cvery exciting\u201d.",
      "\u201cIt shows how important it is to look back at old data, because sometimes, hiding behind them is something new to be discovered, which can help us design the next generation of space exploration missions\u201d.",
      "Which is exactly what Nasa is doing, partly as a result of the new research.",
      "It has been nearly 40 years since Voyager 2 last flew past the icy world and its moons. Nasa has plans to launch a new mission, the Uranus Orbiter and Probe, to go back for a closer look in 10 years\u2019 time.",
      "According to Nasa\u2019s Dr Jamie Jasinski, whose idea it was to re-examine the Voyager 2 data, the mission will need to take his results into account when designing its instruments and planning the scientific survey.",
      "\u201cSome of the instruments for the future spacecraft are very much being designed with ideas from what we learned from Voyager 2 when it flew past the system when it was experiencing an abnormal event. So we need to rethink how exactly we are going to design the instruments on the new mission so that we can best capture the science we need to make discoveries\u201d.",
      "Nasa\u2019s Uranus probe is expected to arrive by 2045, which is when scientists hope to find out whether these far-flung icy moons, once thought of as being dead worlds, might have the possibility of being home to life."

    "story": [
      "Someone moved the UK's oldest satellite and there appears to be no record of exactly who, when or why.",
      "Launched in 1969, just a few months after humans first set foot on the Moon, Skynet-1A was put high above Africa's east coast to relay communications for British forces.",
      "When the spacecraft ceased working a few years later, gravity might have been expected to pull it even further to the east, out over the Indian Ocean.",
      "But today, curiously, Skynet-1A is actually half a planet away, in a position 22,369 miles (36,000km) above the Americas.",
      "Orbital mechanics mean it's unlikely the half-tonne military spacecraft simply drifted to its current location.",
      "Almost certainly, it was commanded to fire its thrusters in the mid-1970s to take it westwards. The question is who that was and with what authority and purpose?",
      "It's intriguing that key information about a once vital national security asset can just evaporate. But, fascination aside, you might also reasonably ask why it still matters. After all, we're talking about some discarded space junk from 50 years ago.",
      "\"It's still relevant because whoever did move Skynet-1A did us few favours,\" says space consultant Dr Stuart Eves.",
      "\"It's now in what we call a 'gravity well' at 105 degrees West longitude, wandering backwards and forwards like a marble at the bottom of a bowl. And unfortunately this brings it close to other satellite traffic on a regular basis.",
      "\"Because it's dead, the risk is it might bump into something, and because it's 'our' satellite we're still responsible for it,\" he explains.",
      "Dr Eves has looked through old satellite catalogues, the National Archives and spoken to satellite experts worldwide, but he can find no clues to the end-of-life behaviour of Britain's oldest spacecraft.",
      "It might be tempting to reach for a conspiracy theory or two, not least because it's hard to hear the name \"Skynet\" without thinking of the malevolent, self-aware artificial intelligence (AI) system in The Terminator movie franchise.",
      "But there's no connection other than the name and, in any case, real life is always more prosaic.",
      "UK military satellite launches to boost space power",
      "MoD contracts Airbus for Skynet telecoms satellite",
      "How do we solve the problem of space debris?",
      "What we do know is that Skynet-1A was manufactured in the US by the now defunct Philco Ford aerospace company and put in space by a US Air Force Delta rocket.",
      "\"The first Skynet satellite revolutionised UK telecommunications capacity, permitting London to securely communicate with British forces as far away as Singapore. However, from a technological standpoint, Skynet-1A was more American than British since the United States both built and launched it,\" remarked Dr Aaron Bateman in a recent paper on the history of the Skynet programme, which is now on its fifth generation.",
      "This view is confirmed by Graham Davison who flew Skynet-1A in the early 70s from its UK operations centre at RAF Oakhanger in Hampshire.",
      "\"The Americans originally controlled the satellite in orbit. They tested all of our software against theirs, before then eventually handing over control to the RAF,\" the long-retired engineer told me.",
      "\"In essence, there was dual control, but when or why Skynet-1A might have been handed back to the Americans, which seems likely - I'm afraid I can't remember,\" says Mr Davison, who is now in his 80s.",

      "It is understood that one of its representatives approached the COP29 team posing as the head of a fictitious Hong Kong investment firm specialising in energy.",
      "He said this company was interested in sponsoring the COP29 summit but wanted to discuss investment opportunities in Azerbaijan's state energy firm, Socar, in return. An online meeting with Soltanov was arranged.",

      "\"There are a lot of joint ventures that could be established,\" Soltanov says on the recording. \"Socar is trading oil and gas all over the world, including in Asia.\"",

      "The UN climate science body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, acknowledges there will be a role for some oil and gas up to 2050 and beyond. However, it has been very clear that \"developing\u2026 new oil and gas fields is incompatible with limiting warming to 1.5C\".",

      "Attempting to do business deals as part of the COP process appears to be a serious breach of the standards of conduct expected of a COP official.",
      "These events are supposed to be about reducing the world's use of fossil fuels \u2013 the main driver of climate change \u2013 not selling more.",
      "The standards are set by the UN body responsible for the climate negotiations, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).",

      "Christiana Figueres, who oversaw the signing of the 2015 Paris agreement to limit global temperature rises to well below 2C, told the BBC that she was shocked anyone in the COP process would use their position to strike oil and gas deals.",
      "She said such behaviour was \"contrary and egregious\" to the the purpose of COP and \"a treason\" to the process.",

      "Scientists say this should act as an alarm call ahead of next week's UN climate conference in Azerbaijan, COP29.",
      "\"This latest record sends another stark warning to governments at COP29 of the urgent need for action to limit any further warming,\" says Liz Bentley, chief executive of the Royal Meteorological Society.",

      "Global temperatures have been so high through the first 10 months of 2024 that only an implausibly sharp drop in the final two months would prevent a new record from being set.",
      "In fact, it is likely that 2024 will end up at least 1.55C hotter than pre-industrial times, according to data from the European Copernicus Climate Change Service.",
      "\"Pre-industrial\" refers to the benchmark period of 1850-1900, which roughly equates to the time before humans started significantly heating up the planet, for example by burning large amounts of fossil fuels.",
      "The projection means that 2024 could surpass the current record of 1.48C, which was set only last year.",
      "\"This marks a new milestone in global temperature records,\" says Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus.",
      "This would also represent the first time that a calendar year has passed 1.5C of warming, according to Copernicus data.",
      "This would be symbolic, because almost 200 countries pledged to try to limit long-term temperature rises to that level under the Paris climate agreement in 2015, hoping to avoid some of the worst impacts of climate change.",
      "If the 1.5C limit is breached, that does not mean the Paris goal has been broken, because it refers to average temperatures over a period of 20 years or so, in order to smooth out natural variability.",
      "But every year-long breach brings the world closer to passing the 1.5C mark in the longer term. Last month, the UN warned that the world could warm by more than 3C this century based on current policies.",
      "The specifics of 2024 also offer cause for concern.",
      "Early 2024 warmth was boosted by the natural El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern. This is where surface waters in the east tropical Pacific Ocean are warmer than usual, which releases extra heat into the atmosphere.",
      "This latest El Ni\u00f1o phase began in mid-2023 and ended around April 2024, but temperatures have remained stubbornly high since.",
      "Over the past week, global average temperatures have set new records for the time of year every day, according to Copernicus data.",
      "Many scientists expect the opposite, cooler phase, La Ni\u00f1a, to develop soon. This should, in theory, lead to a temporary drop in global temperatures next year, although exactly how this will play out is uncertain.",

      "Published9 November 2024",
      "Published9 November 2024",
      "Sky watchers will be looking out for the Northern Taurids meteor shower which will peak overnight on Monday (11-12 November).",
      "The meteors can be seen from virtually anywhere on Earth but sightings will be affected by the phase of the Moon and the weather conditions.",
      "These showers, known for their slow-moving, long-lasting meteors, are linked to Comet Encke.",
      "There are two streams to the Taurids with the Southern Taurids having peaked earlier in the month.",
      "What is the Taurid meteor shower?",
      "The Taurid meteor shower is caused by the debris - ice and dust - from Comet Encke as it passes through our solar system.",
      "Each time Encke returns to the inner solar system, its nucleus sheds ice and rock into space into a vast debris stream. When Earth passes through this debris the \"comet crumbs\" heat up as they enter our atmosphere and burn up in bright bursts of light.",
      "Taurid meteors tend to be larger than other meteors and can survive for longer periods as they pass through Earth's atmosphere. They also travel relatively slowly, crossing the sky at about 17 miles (27km) per second. This is about half the speed of the Perseids.",
      "A recent theory as to why Encke has such a large debris stream is that it was once part of a larger comet that broke up about 20,000 years ago. It has the shortest orbital period of any known comet within our solar system, taking just 3.3 years to orbit the Sun.",
      "When is the peak?",
      "Encke's debris stream is so large and spread out that it takes Earth a rather long time to pass through it. This is why we experience two separate parts to the shower - the Southern Taurids and the Northern Taurids.",
      "The Southern Taurids run from about 23 September to 12 November and peaked earlier this month. Northern Taurids stem from a nearby but slightly different stream and are active from about 13 October to 2 December, peaking around 11-12 November.",
      "The Taurids are not very prolific, tending to produce only five meteors per hour but they can be very bright. The showers sometimes produce fireballs \u2013 a perfect target for astrophotography.",
      "There seems to be a seven-year cycle with these fireballs. There were lots of sightings of them in 2022 and the next best opportunity may be in 2029.",
      "How do I watch?",
      "You do not need any equipment such as telescopes or binoculars as the secret is to take in as much sky as possible and allow about 30 minutes for your eyes to adjust to the dark.",
      "The best time to view is around midnight when the shower's radiant (the spot in the sky from which the meteors appear to emanate), the Taurus constellation, is high in the sky.",
      "To find Taurus, look for the constellation Orion and then peer to the north-east to find the red star Aldebaran, the star in the bull's eye. Shooting stars will be visible all over the night sky so move your gaze around the nearby constellations.",
      "Skies have been clearing over the past 24 hours, leading to improved viewing conditions.",
      "Will I be able to see them?",
      "Viewing the Taurids may be affected by the illumination of the Moon, which could obscure some of the fainter meteors. The Moon will be in a waxing gibbous phase \u2013 going from half moon to full moon.",
      "However, the weather is looking much more favourable for stargazing now. The recent blanket of cloud we have had for several weeks has moved off, leaving a clearer air mass and a much better view of the night sky.",
      "Fog patches may obscure the sky for some - especially across southern Scotland, Northern Ireland, north-west England and north Wales. Any fog will tend to sit in the valleys though, so head for higher ground in these regions to have a better chance of spotting some spectacular shooting stars.",
      "If you do miss this meteor shower you won't have long to wait until the next one, as the Leonid meteor shower is expected to peak next week on the morning of 18 November.",

      "But that is just one of the many twists and turns in the jaw-dropping story of Bitcoin, which continues to captivate people worldwide and has seen the making - and losing - of huge fortunes.",
      "Here's the BBC's list of the seven wildest moments - so far - in Bitcoin's tumultuous history.",
      "1. The mysterious creator of Bitcoin",
      "Despite its enormous profile, no-one actually knows for sure who invented Bitcoin. The idea for it was posted on internet forums in 2008 by someone calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto.",
      "They explained how a peer-to-peer digital cash system could work to enable people to send virtual coins over the internet, just as easily as sending an email.",
      "Satoshi created a complex computer system that would process transactions and create new coins using a huge network of self-appointed volunteers around the world who used special software and powerful computers.",
      "But he - or they - never revealed their identity, and the world has never worked it out.",
      "In 2014, Japanese-American man Dorian Nakamoto was pursued by reporters who thought he was the elusive Bitcoin creator, but it proved to be false lead caused by some mistranslated information.",
      "Australian computer scientist Craig Wright said it was him in 2016 - but after years of legal battles, a High Court judge concluded he was not Satoshi.",
      "Earlier this year, a Canadian Bitcoin expert called Peter Todd strongly denied being Satoshi, while in London this month a British man, Stephen Mollah, claimed he was - but no-one believed him.",
      "2. Making history with pizza",
      "Bitcoin now underpins a two trillion-dollar cryptocurrency industry - but the first recorded transaction using it was the purchase of pizza.",
      "On 22 May 2010, Lazlo Hanyecz, offered $41 worth of Bitcoin on a crypto forum in return for two pizzas.",
      "A 19-year-old student obliged and the day went down in history for fans of the currency as #BitcoinPizza day.",
      "A source of memes for those in crypto community, it also showcased the power of Bitcoin - an internet money that could genuinely buy items online.",
      "Criminals must have been watching too, because within a year the first darknet marketplace was launched selling drugs and other illegal goods in exchange for Bitcoin.",
      "The deal looks pretty bad for Lazlo now too. If he had held onto those coins they would now be worth hundreds of millions of dollars!",
      "3. Becoming legal tender",
      "In September 2021, President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador, central America, made Bitcoin legal tender.",
      "Hairdressers, supermarkets and other shops had to accept Bitcoin by law, alongside its main currency, the US dollar.",
      "Many Bitcoin enthusiasts and reporters visited the area, briefly boosting tourism to the country.",
      "While President Bukele hoped the move would increase investment in his country and cut costs for citizens exchanging money, it did not become as popular as he hoped.",
      "He is still hoping it will take off but for now the US dollar still remains king in the country.",
      "As well as the huge amount of public money President Bukele spent on trying to make people embrace Bitcoin he also, controversially, bought more than 6,000 bitcoins over the past few years.",
      "The president spent at least $120m buying up bitcoins at various prices in the hope of making a profit for his cash-strapped country.",
      "It started to look good for him in December 2023 when, for the first time, his stash skyrocketed in value.",
      "A website built by Dutch software engineer Elias Zerrouq is tracking the country's Bitcoin holdings and currently estimates that the coins have risen 98% in value.",
      "4. Kazakhstan's crypto boom and bust",
      "In 2021, Kazakhstan became a hotspot for Bitcoin mining - the process of crunching through the complex calculations that underpin crypto transactions.",
      "These days it takes warehouses full of the latest computers running all day and all night, but the reward is brand new bitcoins for those companies that take part.",
      "Warehouses of computers require lots of power - and many businesses moved to Kazakhstan where electricity was abundant thanks to huge coal reserves.",
      "At first the government welcomed them with open arms as they brought investment.",
      "But too many miners arrived and put huge strain on the electricity grid, putting the country at risk of blackouts.",
      "Within a year, Kazakhstan's Bitcoin mining industry went from boom to bust as the government imposed restrictions and increased taxes to curb the growth.",
      "Around the world it is estimated that the Bitcoin network uses as much electricity as a small country, raising concerns about its environmental impact.",
      "5. Bitcoins in the rubbish dump",
      "Imagine having a crypto wallet worth more than $100m (\u00a378m) - and then  accidentally throwing away a hard drive containing the login details.",
      "That's what James Howells, from south Wales, says happened to him",
      "The very nature of crypto means that recovery is not as easy as resetting your password. With no banks involved - there is no customer support helpline.",
      "Unfortunately for him, his local council in Newport refused to let him access the landfill site where he says the device ended up - even after he offered to donate 25% of his Bitcoin stash to local charities if they let him.",
      "He told the BBC: \"It was a penny dropping moment and it was a sinking feeling.\"",
      "6. Crypto King fraudster",
      "No one has lost as much Bitcoin as former billionaire crypto mogul, Sam Bankman-Fried. The founder of the massive crypto firm FTX was nicknamed the Crypto King and loved by the community.",
      "FTX was a cryptocurrency exchange that allowed people to trade normal money for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.",
      "His empire was worth an estimated $32bn and he was flying high until everything came crashing down within days.",
      "Journalists had discovered that Bankman-Fried's company was financially shaky and had been illegally transferring FTX customer funds to prop up his other company, Alameda Research.",
      "Just before his arrest at his luxury apartment complex in the Bahamas in December 2022 he spoke to reporters. He told the BBC: \"I don't think I committed fraud. I didn't want any of this to happen. I was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was.\"",
      "After being extradited to the US he was found guilty of fraud and money laundering and was jailed for 25 years.",
      "7. Investment bank boom",
      "Despite all the turmoil, Bitcoin continues to attract attention from investors and big companies.",
      "In fact, in January 2024, some of the biggest financial firms in the world added Bitcoin to their official asset lists as Spot Bitcoin ETFs. These are like stocks and shares, linked to the value of Bitcoin but you don't have to personally own any.",
      "Customers have been pouring billions into these brand new products. Companies including Blackrock, Fidelity and GrayScale, have also been buying up Bitcoins in their thousands, pushing up its value to record highs.",
      "It is a huge milestone for crypto with some fans believing that Bitcoin is finally being taken as seriously as the mysterious Satoshi imagined.",
      "Nonetheless, few would back against more wild moments as the Bitcoin story continues to unfold."

      "\"This one is for the mums and dads... They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online. I want Australian families to know that the government has your back,\" he said.",
      "While many of the details are yet to be debated, the government said the ban would apply to young people already on social media.",
      "There will be no exemptions on the age limit for children who have consent from their parents. The government says that the onus would be on social media platforms to show they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access.",

      "\u201cThe whole question of how to better insulate the house is a real mystery to me,\u201d says Mr Duffy, a director of sustainability think-tank Citizen Network. \u201cI don\u2019t know where the expertise for that is.\u201d He also adds that he\u2019s also not sure whether he could install solar panels, given that he lives in a conservation area.",
      "Millions of homeowners across the country could be facing the same dilemma.",
      "Around 29 million British homes require retrofitting by 2050, according to the UK Green Building Council, an industry body.",
      "Retrofitting might involve measures such as improving your home\u2019s insulation, upgrading the heating system, or installing energy-generating devices such as solar panels, or even a private wind turbine.",
      "These adjustments can cost thousands of pounds up front, but, if properly executed, they could improve comfort and reduce people\u2019s bills in the long-run.",
      "Plus, increased energy efficiency ought to cut carbon emissions from homes, especially if property owners switch away from gas or oil-fired boilers, for example.",
      "Roughly one fifth of the UK\u2019s total emissions comes from residential buildings.",
      "Amy Peace and her husband live in the northwest of England, near Warrington. The pair both work in sustainability, advising businesses on their path to net zero.",
      "They were keen to improve the quality of their home and apply the principles they promote at work to their own lives \u2013 but they too faced challenges when deciding on how to go about it.",
      "\u201cEven though we\u2019ve got this background, and we\u2019re engineers as well, what we weren\u2019t entirely clear on was where was best to spend the money,\u201d says Mrs Peace.",

      "\u201cThere weren\u2019t many in that pragmatic middle space where you are literally saying, \u2018We\u2019ve got this much money, where would we be best putting it?\u2019,\u201d Mrs Peace adds.",
      "Perseverance during the past three years paid off, however, and the couple\u2019s 1930\u2019s detached house now has improved insulation, a heat pump, and an electric car charging point. Solar panels and battery will follow shortly, if all goes to plan.",
      "Conscious of the confusion around approaches to retrofit, some organisations are moving to improve the advice available to homeowners. Among them is Ecofurb.",
      "\u201cWe can model all the different options that are available, suitable for your home and your budget, and identify a package of measures,\u201d says Liz Lain\u00e9, of Parity Projects, a housing data analysis company, which runs Ecofurb.",

      "There are many other organisations that offer to help homeowners plan a retrofit.",
      "The work often involves carrying out a heat-loss survey, to spot cold areas that require insulation, and to better understand a property\u2019s heating demand. Experts might also advise on the suitability of solar panels for your home, for example.",
      "There\u2019s the Get a Heat Pump website, launched by the charities Nesta and The MCS Foundation, which explains what heat pumps are and how they might fit into a home renovation plan.",
      "RICS, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, has also just launched a new retrofit standard for its members \u2013 essentially, it encourages surveyors with the appropriate training to offer their services to homeowners planning or undergoing a retrofit.",
      "The RICS website will soon include a range of retrofit advice and a tool to help homeowners find a suitable surveyor in their local area, says Steve Lees, from the RICS retrofit project team.",
      "Improving the energy efficiency of homes is \u201cessential\u201d for decarbonisation, says Gerald Charles, head of housing retrofit at the Centre for Sustainable Energy, but he adds that the current lack of good advice remains a genuine problem.",
      "\u201cThe industry as a whole don\u2019t appreciate the importance of good retrofit advice,\u201d he says.",
      "One entrepreneur who has noticed a knowledge gap in the market is James Major, founder and chief executive of HubbPro, which helps architects plan energy efficient buildings. Architects don\u2019t always have the latest information about how to incorporate energy-saving technologies into their designs, notes Mr Major.",
      "\u201cClean tech isn\u2019t part of what they do or what they should know \u2013 that\u2019s an engineering function,\u201d he says. And yet architects\u2019 clients increasingly ask about such tech when planning a new home or an extension.",

      "Giant trucks the size of townhouses, capable of hauling 300 tonnes, criss-cross red-earth roads in various sections of this open-pit mine complex.",
      "For an outsider like me their size is intimidating enough, but multiplying that feeling is the knowledge that there's no driver at the wheel.",
      "During a tour of the site in a normal-sized company vehicle, one of the trucks comes into view, approaching from a side road.",
      "I sigh with relief as it deftly turns and continues in the direction we have just come. \u201cDid it make you feel uncomfortable?,\u201d asks the vehicle\u2019s driver Dwane Pallentine, a production superintendent.",
      "Greater Nammuldi has a fleet of more than 50 self-driving trucks that operate independently on pre-defined courses, along with a handful that remain manually driven and work separately in a different part of the mine.",
      "Being trialled is also an autonomous water cart affectionately known as Henry, which, along with manually driven ones, sprays the mine roads to keep the dust down.",
      "The company vehicle I am in is able to operate alongside the autonomous trucks only because it has been fitted with high-accuracy GPS, which allows it to be seen within a virtual system.",
      "Before entering the mine\u2019s gated autonomous zone, we logged onto this system and a controller verified over the radio that we were visible.",
      "It has encased our vehicle in a virtual bubble that the self-driving trucks \"see\" and which causes them to manage their proximity by slowing or stopping as necessary.",
      "A touch screen in our cabin displays all the staffed and autonomous vehicles and other equipment in the vicinity, along with \"permission lines\" that show the immediate routes the self-driving trucks are intending to take. Had I looked at the screen instead of fretting I would have seen that truck was going to turn.",
      "In addition to all vehicles being fitted with a big red emergency button that can stop the system, the autonomous trucks have lasers and radars front and rear to detect collision risks.",
      "The sensors also detect obstacles. If a large rock fell off the back of a truck, the sensors on the next truck along would notice it and the vehicle would stop.",
      "However, some trucks seem extra sensitive \u2013 on my tour I see a couple foiled simply by rough roads.",
      "Co-ordinating and monitoring these robots is Rio Tinto\u2019s Operations Centre (OC) in Perth, about 1,500km (930 miles) to the south.",
      "It\u2019s the nerve centre for all the company\u2019s Pilbara iron ore operations, which span 17 mines in total, including the three making up Greater Nammuldi.",
      "Guided from here by controllers, include more than 360 self-driving trucks across all the sites (about 84% of the total fleet is automated); a mostly autonomous long-distance rail network to transport the mined ore to port facilities; and nearly 40 autonomous drills. OC staff also remotely control plant and port functions.",
      "Autonomy isn\u2019t new to Rio\u2019s Pilbara operations: introduction began in the late 2000s.",
      "Nor is it unique: Australia has the greatest number of autonomous trucks and mines that use automation of any country, and other mining companies in the Pilbara also use the technology.",
      "But the scale Rio has grown its operations to here, including at Greater Nammuldi \u2013 which has one of the largest autonomous truck fleets in the world \u2013 gives it global significance.",
      "And it's a global trend. According to GlobalData the number of self-driving haul trucks worldwide has roughly quadrupled over the past four years to more than 2,000, with most made by either Caterpillar or Komatsu.",
      "The biggest reason for introducing the technology has been to improve the physical safety of the workforce, says Matthew Holcz, the managing director of the company\u2019s Pilbara mines.",
      "Mining is a dangerous occupation: heavy machinery can be unpredictably operated by people who can also become fatigued. \u201cThe data clearly shows that, through automation, we've got a significantly safer business,\u201d says Mr Holcz.",
      "It has also improved productivity \u2013 to the tune of about 15%, he estimates. Autonomous equipment can be used more because there are no gaps due to shift changes or breaks. And autonomous trucks can also go faster when there is less staff-operated equipment on the scene.",
      "Such automation does not come cheap. Rio won\u2019t disclose what it has spent in total on its Pilbara automation journey to date, but observers put it at multiple billions of dollars.",
      "Meanwhile, employment opportunities have evolved. The narrative might be one of robots taking jobs, but that doesn\u2019t seem the case here so far.",
      "While the OC has about one controller for every 25 autonomous trucks \u2013 according to Rio, no one has lost their job because of automation.",
      "Instead, there have been redeployments: truck drivers have joined the OC as controllers themselves, been reskilled to operate different pieces of equipment, such as excavators, loaders and dozers, or gone to drive manual trucks at different sites.",
      "On the OC\u2019s large open plan floor, amid the banks of monitors arranged in clusters for the different mines, I meet Jess Cowie who used be a manual driller but now directs autonomous ones from the central drill pod. \u201cI still put holes in the ground\u2026just without the dust, the noise and being away from the family,\u201d she says.",
      "Automation is delivering a \u201cstep change\u201d in terms of safety in the mining industry says Robin Burgess-Limerick, a professor at the University of Queensland in Brisbane who studies human factors in mining. But it doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t room for improvement.",
      "Professor Burgess-Limerick has analysed incidents involving autonomous equipment reported to regulators.",
      "As he sees it, the interfaces used by staff both in the field and in control centres to gain information aren\u2019t optimally designed. There have been situations where field staff have lost awareness of the situation, which better screen design may have prevented. \u201cThe designers of the technology should put a bit more effort into considering people,\u201d he says.",
      "And there is also a risk that controllers\u2019 workloads can be overwhelming - it is a busy, high stakes job.",
      "Over-trust, where people become so confident the autonomous equipment will stop that they start putting themselves at risk, can also be an issue, and he notes effort needs to be directed into improving the ability of trucks themselves to detect moisture. There have been incidents where wet roadways have caused them to lose traction.",
      "There can be legitimate safety concerns with autonomous equipment, says Shane Roulstone, co-ordinator for the Western Mine Workers Alliance, which represents mining-related workers in the Pilbara.",
      "He points to a serious incident this May where an autonomous train slammed into the back of a broken-down train, which workers at the front end were repairing (they evacuated before it hit but were left shaken).",
      "But Mr Roulstone also praises Rio generally for having, over time, developed \u201csome good strategies, procedures and policies\u201d around how people interact with automated vehicles.",
      "Mr Roulstone expects that at some point options for redeployment will lessen and there will job losses. \u201cIt is just the mathematics of it,\u201d he says.",
      "Meanwhile, Rio\u2019s automation journey in the Pilbara continues with more trucks, drills and Henry the water cart. It is also closely watching work by Komatsu and Caterpillar to develop un-staffed excavators, loaders and dozers.",
      "Late in the afternoon, waiting at Greater Nammuldi\u2019s airport for the last flight back to Perth, the announcement comes that it has been cancelled due to an issue with the plane. That\u2019s 150 extra people who will now need to be fed and accommodated. It is nothing for Rio, but I can\u2019t help but think we humans are complicated compared to robots.",

      "Many conservatives believe that China poses the single greatest threat to continued US global dominance, both economically and militarily. While Trump has been more circumspect, limiting most of his China critiques to the realm of trade, he is filling his foreign policy team with vocal China critics.",
      "The president-elect picked Florida Congressman Mike Waltz, a retired Army colonel, as his national security adviser \u2013 a key foreign policy post within the White House. Waltz has said the US is in a \u201ccold war\u201d with China and was one of the first members of Congress to call for a US boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.",

      "As Trump takes office, Republicans have control of the Senate and could still take the House, albeit by a slim margin. However, the president-elect\u2019s early actions suggest he is more concerned with exercising his presidential power than working with the legislative branch.",
      "Last week, he posted on social media that the Senate\u2019s Republican leadership should smooth the way for more presidential \u201crecess appointments\u201d \u2013 allowing him to fill top administration jobs without Senate approval when Congress is not in session. The move would strengthen presidential power by undercutting the chamber\u2019s constitutional role to \u201cadvise and consent\u201d on political appointees.",
      "Meanwhile, the president-elect keeps chipping away at those narrow congressional majorities. Senators who move to administration roles can quickly be replaced by appointment from the governor of their home state. But any House vacancies \u2013 such as ones created by Stefanik and Waltz\u2019s departures \u2013 require special elections that can take months to schedule.",
      "Some of Trump\u2019s advisers, including Musk, have warned that the president-elect could be endangering his legislative agenda if he plucks too many more Republicans from the chambers.",
      "Even in the best of circumstances, congressional legislation takes time, effort and compromise. Executive action, such as new immigration enforcement, can be done with the stroke of a presidential pen.",
      "Trump\u2019s actions indicate he is, at least at the moment, more focused on the latter.",
      "Rewarding loyalists",
      "Trump has only just begun filling out the thousands of jobs that open up with a new presidential administration, not including the senior-level career bureaucrats he has said he will replace.",
      "In 2016, as a political newcomer, he had to rely on more establishment Republicans for key roles. This time, he has a wealth of prospective candidates with proven track records of supporting him and after eight years, Trump loyalists are the Republican establishment.",
      "On Tuesday, Trump named South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem as homeland security secretary, and Fox News host and conservative author Pete Hegseth as defence secretary. Both have been fierce Trump defenders from the start.",
      "Others, like Rubio and Stefanik, were critics of Trump early in his first presidential bid, but they have now spent years demonstrating that their harsh words are a thing of the past.",
      "Rubio, who ran for president against Trump in 2016, may still have White House ambitions, however. Trump often soured on appointees who seemed drawn to the limelight during his first term, and even the warmest of relationships could go bad.",
      "Trump may be placing a premium on loyalty with his early staff announcements, but the pressures of governing ultimately will reveal whether his second four years in office end up different from his first.",

      "The sighting was unusual because the beluga was so tame and they're rarely seen as far south. It was also wearing a harness, which had a mount for a camera, and bore the words, in English, \u201cEquipment St Petersburg\u201d.",
      "Mr Hesten helped to remove the harness from the whale, which then swam to the nearby port of Hammerfest, where it lived for several months.",
      "Seemingly unable to catch live fish to eat, it charmed visitors by nudging at their cameras and even on one occasion returning a mobile phone.",
      "\u201cIt was very obvious that this particular whale had been conditioned to be putting his nose on anything that looked like a target because he was doing it each time,\u201d says Eve Jourdain, a researcher from the Norwegian Orca Survey.",
      "\u201cBut we have no idea what kind of facility he was in, so we don\u2019t know what he was trained for.\u201d",
      "Captivated by the whale's story Norway made arrangements for the beluga to be monitored and fed. The name it was given \u2013 Hvaldimir - is a nod to hval which is Norwegian for whale, and the name of Russia's President, Vladimir Putin.",
      "Dr Shpak did not want to name her sources in Russia for their own safety but said she had been told that when the beluga surfaced in Norway, the Russian marine mammal community immediately identified it as one of theirs.",
      "\u201cThrough the chain of vets and trainers the message came back \u2013 that they were missing a beluga called Andruha,\u201d she says.",
      "According to Dr Shpak, Andruha/Hvaldimir had first been captured in 2013 in the Sea of Okhotsk in Russia's Far East. A year later it was moved from a facility owned by a dolphinarium in St Petersburg to the military programme in the Russian Arctic, where his trainers and vets remained in contact.",
      "\u201cI believe that when they started to work in open water, trusting this animal (not to swim away), the animal just gave up on them,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cWhat I've heard from the guys at the commercial dolphinarium who used to have him was that Andruha was smart, so a good choice to be trained. But at the same time, he was kind of like a hooligan - an active beluga - so they were not surprised that he gave up on (following) the boat and went where he wanted to.\u201d",
      "Satellite images from near the Russian naval base in Murmansk show what could have been Hvaldimir/Andruha\u2019s old home. Pens can clearly be seen in the water with what appear to be white whales inside.",
      "\u201cThe location of the beluga whales very close to the submarines and the surface vessels might tell us that they are actually part of a guarding system,\u201d says Thomas Nilsen, from Norwegian online newspaper The Barents Observer.",
      "Russia, for its part, has never officially addressed the claim that Hvaldimir/Andruha was trained by its army. But it does have a long history of training marine mammals for military purposes.",
      "Speaking in 2019, a Russian reserve colonel, Viktor Baranets, said: \"If we were using this animal for spying, do you really think we'd attach a mobile phone number with the message 'Please call this number'?\"",
      "Sadly, Hvaldimir/Andruha\u2019s incredible story does not have a happy ending.",
      "Having learned to feed himself, it spent several years travelling south along Norway\u2019s coast and in May 2023 was even spotted off the coast of Sweden.",
      "Then on September 1 2024 its body was found floating at sea, near the town of Risavika, on Norway's south-western coast.",
      "Had the long arm of Putin\u2019s Russia caught up with the reluctant beluga?",
      "It appears not. Despite some activist groups suggesting that the whale had been shot, that explanation has been dismissed by the Norwegian police.",
      "They say there was nothing to suggest that human activity directly caused the beluga\u2019s death. A post-mortem examination revealed that Hvaldimir/Andruha died after a stick became lodged in his mouth."

    "story": [
      "The climate-damaging vapours left behind by jet planes could be easily tackled, aviation experts say, with a new study suggesting they could be eliminated for a few pounds per flight.",
      "Jet condensation trails, or contrails, have spawned wild conspiracy theories alleging mind control and the spreading of disease, but scientists say the real problem is their warming effect.",
      "Researchers argue these smoky trails essentially double the amount of heating that\u2019s caused by aviation's use of fossil fuels.",
      "The problem will be discussed at the UN climate conference, COP29, in Baku for the first time.",
      "Contrails form in the sky in the same way that your breath goes misty on a chilly morning.",
      "When a plane passes through cold humid air, the contrails form as the vapour from the engines condenses on unburned fuel fragments in the exhaust stream.",
      "While the causes of contrails have been known about for decades, it\u2019s only in recent years that the climate warming impact of these human generated clouds has been recognised.",
      "\u201cThey create an artificial layer of clouds, which traps the heat from the Earth that\u2019s trying to escape to outer space,\u201d said Carlos Lopez de la Osa, from the Transport & Environment campaign group, which has carried out a new study on the solutions to contrails.",
      "\u201cThe scale of the warming that's associated with them is roughly having a similar impact to that of aviation carbon emissions.\u201d",
      "Conspiracy theories have grown up around contrails, with some people alleging they are in fact \u201cchemtrails\u201d that contain chemical or biological substances.",
      "The aim of these chemtrails is either vaccinating the population, spreading pandemics or controlling the minds of the masses, the conspiracy theories go on to claim.",
      "All of these ideas are completely untrue.",
      "\u201cIt is unfortunate that these conspiracy theories are muddying the water on an issue where we need a lot of consensus, a lot of clarity,\u201d said Matteo Mirolo, from Breakthrough Energy, and one of the organisers of the COP29 discussion about the contrails.",
      "\u201cChemtrails are an unfounded theory. There's simply no scientific backing.\u201d",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "What is COP29 and how will Trump\u2019s election affect the climate talks?",
      "What does net zero mean?",
      "The COP event aims to draw attention to the fact that relatively simple changes to aviation practice could eliminate much of the warming impact of these trails.",
      "According to the Transport & Environment study, some 80% of the warming associated with contrails is generated by just 3% of flights.",
      "Tweaking the flight paths of a handful of aircraft could reduce contrail warming by more than half by 2040, at a cost of less than \u00a34 per flight.",
      "Geography and a flight's latitude have a strong influence on whether a contrail is warming. Flights over North America, Europe and the North Atlantic region accounted for more than half of global contrail warming in 2019, the report said.",
      "Time of day also influences the climate effects of contrails. Those formed by evening and night flights have the largest warming contribution. Seasonality is also important - the most warming contrails tend to occur in winter.",
      "\u201cPlanes are already flying around thunderstorms and turbulence areas,\u201d Mr Lopez de la Osa said.",
      "\u201cWe will need to add one more constraint to flight planning, which is avoiding areas of contrail formation.\u201d",
      "\u201cOf the climate solutions which are being discussed at COP29, it's arguably one of the simplest ones.\u201d",
      "The researchers are hoping that by holding this event at COP they will spread awareness of the problem and the solutions.",
      "They point to the huge amounts of money and research going into developing sustainable aviation fuels.",
      "They believe that tackling contrails could achieve a major win for the climate, at a fraction of the cost.",

    "summary": "Delhi woke up to a thick layer of smog on Wednesday morning as pollution levels soared in the city.",
    "story": [
      "People in India's capital Delhi woke up to a thick layer of smog as the air quality deteriorated to severe levels in the city.",
      "Delhi and its neighbouring cities are experiencing pollution levels that are at least 30-35 times the safe limit recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).",
      "Every year, Delhi and northern states battle hazardous air during the winter months of October to January due to plummeting temperatures, smoke, dust, low wind speed, vehicular emissions and crop stubble burning.",
      "This time, experts say that the condition is likely to get worse in the coming days.",
      "According to IQAir, a Swiss-based Air Quality Index (AQI) monitoring group,  pollution levels in several parts of Delhi touched the 500 mark on Wednesday morning.",
      "AQI measures the levels of particulate matter, also called PM 2.5, in the air. These tiny particles can enter the lungs and cause a host of diseases.",
      "According to WHO guidelines, air with AQI values at or below 100 is considered to be satisfactory for breathing, while readings in the 400-500 range denote that pollution levels are \"severe\" in an area.",
      "The satellite cities of Noida and Gurgaon also registered AQI levels touching the 500 mark.",
      "Several northern states have been experiencing toxic air and poor visibility over the past few weeks. There have been reports of flights to and from Delhi being cancelled or delayed due to low visibility.",
      "So thick is the smog that it is visible even from space. A few days ago, Nasa shared satellite images of a blanket of smog engulfing parts of northern India and neighbouring Pakistan.",
      "The toxic air is also affecting people's health.",
      "A survey by LocalCircles, an online community platform, in Delhi and nearby cities revealed that 81% of families reported at least one member suffering from health issues due to pollution in the last three weeks. Over a third of respondents said they had purchased cough syrup during that time.",
      "The Delhi government has enacted its Graded Response Action Plan - which bans all activities that involve the use of coal and firewood, as well as diesel generator use for non-emergency services - but that has not saved the city from experiencing toxic levels of pollution.",
      "Authorities have also urged residents to stay indoors as much as possible and to use public transport to cut vehicular emissions.",
      "Delhi was the most polluted capital city in the world in 2023, according IQAir.",
      "India was also ranked as the world's third-most polluted country after neighbours Bangladesh and Pakistan, IQAir said.",
      "Air pollution is a serious problem in a number of Indian cities.",
      "Experts say that rapid industrialisation coupled with weak enforcement of environmental laws have played a role in increasing pollution in the country.",
      "India has seen a lot of development in the past few decades, but poor industrial regulation means that factories do not follow pollution-control measures. Rapid construction has also contributed to rising levels of pollution.",

    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 23:46:17 GMT",
    "summary": "Several Capitol riot defendants have asked for hearings to be delayed in anticipation of pardons.",
    "story": [
      "Out of all of Donald Trump\u2019s supporters, Derrick Evans has a particular reason to be happy with November\u2019s election results \u2013 he hopes the president-elect will give him a pardon for participating in riot at the US Capitol on 6 January 2021.",
      "\u201cA pardon will be life changing,\u201d said Evans, who was a member of the West Virginia legislature when he and at least 2,000 others stormed Congress. It was part of an effort to overturn the results of the US election, inspired by the false belief that it was Trump, not President Joe Biden, who had won.",
      "He reached an agreement with prosecutors which saw him plead guilty to civil disorder and spent three months in federal prison in 2022. On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly said he would pardon the rioters, whom he has called \u201cpatriots\u201d and \u201cpolitical prisoners\u201d. But who exactly might be pardoned - and when - is still an open question.",

      "When does he become president again?",
      "What happens to his legal cases now",
      "How he pulled off an incredible comeback",
      "In March, Trump wrote on his Truth Social account that one of his first acts as president would be to \u201cFree the January 6 Hostages being wrongfully imprisoned!\u201d",
      "He repeated the pledge at a National Association of Black Journalists forum in Chicago in July.",
      "\"Oh, absolutely, I would,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they're innocent, I would pardon them.\"",
      "But he has stopped short of proposing a blanket pardon, at one point telling CNN: \"I am inclined to pardon many of them. I can't say for every single one, because a couple of them, probably they got out of control.\"",
      "His campaign has previously said decisions would be made \u201con a case-by-case basis when he is back in the White House\u201d.",
      "Arrests still being made",
      "The events of 6 January resulted in one of the largest federal investigations in US history. Nearly 600 people have been charged with assaulting, resisting or impeding police officers.",
      "Some of those who have been given the longest sentences, such as Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes and Enrique Tarrio, leader of the Proud Boys, did not participate in the violence inside the building. Instead, they were convicted of seditious conspiracy and other felonies for organising the melee.",
      "Arrests are still being made. In an update issued last week, the FBI said it is still looking for nine suspects wanted for violent assaults on police officers.",
      "But with Trump coming back to the White House, the future of the investigation remains uncertain.",
      "Citing justice department sources, NBC News reported that officials are focusing on trying the \u201cmost egregious\u201d cases before Trump\u2019s inauguration on 20 January.",
      "Delayed hearings",
      "In the meantime, several Capitol riot defendants have asked for hearings to be delayed in anticipation of pardons.",
      "Among them are Christopher Carnell, a North Carolina man who was found guilty of several riot-related charges earlier in the year.  His lawyers asked for a hearing to be delayed last week because of possible \"clemency actions relevant to his case\u201d, but the request was turned down.",
      "Jonathanpeter Klein, who along with his brother Matthew pleaded guilty to several charges in July, asked for his sentencing hearing, scheduled for 15 November, to be delayed. That request, too, was turned down.",
      "A lawyer for Joe Biggs, a member of the Proud Boys who was handed one of the longest riot-related sentences, told reporters that he would be asking Trump for a pardon.",
      "Biggs was sentenced to 17 years in prison in 2023 after being convicted of crimes including seditious conspiracy, intimidation or threats to prevent officials from discharging their duties, and interference with law enforcement during civil disorder.",
      "During the riot, Biggs and others led a group of Proud Boys, tearing through barriers and barging into the Senate chamber.",
      "At trial, Biggs and others argued they were merely following Trump\u2019s orders. His lawyer, Norman Pattis, told reporters in Florida that he would be seeking a pardon from the Trump administration.",
      "Wendy Via, co-founder of the not-for-profit Global Project Against Hate and Extremism (GPAHE), said that there is already a sense of excitement among rioters and their supporters.",
      "\u201cFolks on fringe sites are calling for the release of what they are calling the Jan 6 \u2018prisoners of war\u2019 or \u2018hostages\u2019,\u201d she said.",
      "They include Jake Lang, who is charged with a number of crimes including assaulting police officers, and who regularly posts online from his jail cell in New York.",

      "Laying low",
      "GPAHE also found that some groups plan to lay low until Trump takes office and pardons are made official.",
      "One post on a Proud Boys channel on Telegram suggested that members avoid the January inauguration: \u201cStay home or patronize your local watering hole and celebrate the inauguration of our President and the imminent release of our Boys.\u201d",
      "In a blog post, Via said pardons would \u201cmake a mockery of our justice system, and it will send the message to his followers that violence is a legitimate response to political outcomes they don\u2019t like\u201d.",
      "For the moment, the release of everyone charged with riot-related offences seems unlikely, but non-violent offenders such as Derrick Evans have called for large numbers to be freed.",
      "And, he suggested, a pardon would not be enough to compensate him and others for the time they spent behind bars.",
      "\u201cI think there needs to be some reparations and restitution involved as well,\u201d he said.",

      "Homan - an ex-policeman and former acting US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) director - has described immigration at the US border as \"the biggest national security vulnerability this nation has seen since 9/11 and we have to fix it.\"",
      "Addressing illegal immigrants in the US during the Republican National Convention in the summer, he said: \u201cYou better start packing now.\u201d",

      "Reversing Biden policies",
      "In an interview with CBS News's 60 Minutes in October, prior to Trump's election, Homan indicated he would seek to target non-criminal immigrants who are in the country illegally, after first prioritising \"public safety threats\" and \"national security threats\".",

      "Targeted arrests to facilitate deportations",
      "Homan has said he would use a targeted approach would be used when carrying out arrests and deportations.",
      "Asked in the same October interview how deportations would be carried out, Homan said: \"It's not gonna be a mass sweep of neighbourhoods. It's not gonna be building concentration camps. I've read it all. It's ridiculous.\"",

      "Homan has said he didn\u2019t write the policy memo that led to the separations, but he was one of three officials who signed it. He said he signed it \u201choping to save lives\u201d.",
      "Homan indicated that he would not seek to re-instate that policy.",
      "Rather, he has said families could be \"deported together\", when asked whether deportations could be carried out without separating families.",

      "Stefanik once billed herself to voters as a traditional conservative, but emerged as  one of Trump's most ardent defenders during the first impeachment trial against him in 2019. Her support for Trump has not wavered since.",

    "published": "Wed, 13 Nov 2024 03:55:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Before Tupac's murder, producer Quincy Jones brought stars together to try to end violence in hip-hop.",
    "story": [
      "Before the east and west coast rap beef of the 1990s boiled over with the murders of Tupac Shakur and Notorious BIG, legendary producer Quincy Jones called a secret meeting at which he appealed for an end to the violence.",
      "As hip-hop rose from the streets to the mainstream in the 90s, the rappers and hustlers that broke through had few role models who had trodden that path before them.",
      "There was one man, though, who had been there, and done pretty much everything.",
      "Quincy Jones had been in gangs and had been stabbed at the age of seven in 1930s Chicago, before becoming a major force in American music thanks to his work with legends like Ray Charles, Frank Sinatra and Michael Jackson.",
      "He was at the heart of revolutions in jazz, swing, soul, funk, disco and pop - but one aspect of his career that got less attention when he died last week at the age of 91 was his place in hip-hop.",
      "Jones was revered in all corners of music, including rap. Unlike most in the old guard and the media, he immediately realised the scene's artistic and cultural importance.",
      "Hip-hop reminded him of the bebop jazz of his youth. \"I feel a kinship there because we went through a lot of the same stuff,\" he said.",
      "\"Quincy understood it and got it right away,\" says pioneering artist, rapper and presenter Fab 5 Freddy.",
      "Jones worked with leading rappers in the 80s, and in the 90s he recognised risks including a volatile rivalry that had begun to erupt between competing labels and stars.",
      "So he brought artists, executives and elder black American statesmen together for a secret summit in 1995, hoping it would be a turning point.",
      "The east coast was hip-hop's spiritual home. In 1992, Sean Combs - then known as Puffy and later as P Diddy - launched his Bad Boy record label in New York with artists including Notorious BIG, aka Biggie Smalls.",
      "Meanwhile, across America, Los Angeles was coming into its own as the capital of gangsta rap, led by menacing mogul Suge Knight's Death Row Records, which had Dr Dre and Tupac.",
      "In 1994, Tupac was shot and injured during a robbery in the lobby of a studio. He later implied that his former friend Biggie may have known about the attack in advance. Biggie then released the track Who Shot Ya?, which Tupac thought was about him.",
      "The beef continued at the Source magazine awards on 3 August 1995, when Knight goaded Combs and Bad Boy Records from the stage.",
      "Jones, who had his own magazine, Vibe, held his summit three weeks later.",
      "Quincy Jones: From 'street rat' to music mastermind",
      "Quincy Jones: His brilliance explained in 10 songs",
      "'He changed my life': Stars remember Quincy Jones",
      "The brewing east-west beef wasn't the only reason Jones called it - it was mainly intended to discuss the state of hip-hop and let the new generation hear life and business advice from a group of highly successful black executives.",
      "But rap's negative image and the burgeoning tensions were a big talking point.",
      "\"He knew this was a bubbling issue, and so his idea was to bring together a symposium,\" says Fab 5 Freddy, who was hosting Yo! MTV Raps at the time and was the event's moderator.",
      "Jones told the summit: \"The thing that really provoked me to say it's time to pay attention now is Tupac.\"",
      "Tupac was missing, however - he was in jail for sexual assault at the time. Suge and Dre were there, as were Combs and Biggie.",
      "Jones had already experienced his own beef with Tupac - the rapper criticised the producer in a 1993 edition of Source for marrying white women.",
      "\"We finally hooked up, even though it was tension conditions in the beginning,\" Jones said at the event.",
      "\"We finally talked to each other, and he said nobody had talked to him like that before.",
      "\"And I said, I can't take it any more. Because we can no longer afford to be non-political, and I'm talking to the hip-hop nation now.\"",
      "About 50 influential artists and executives were in the room, including Public Enemy's Chuck D, members of A Tribe Called Quest, MC Lyte, Kris Kross, Jermaine Dupri and Boyz n the Hood film-maker John Singleton.",
      "Jones wrote in his now-out-of-print 2001 autobiography: \"I had been concerned about the potentially volatile diversity of a group who'd never been in the same room together.\"",
      "They were joined by veteran executives Clarence Avant and Ahmet Ertegun, plus Colin Powell, the former national security adviser and head of the US military who would go on to become the first African-American secretary of state.",
      "Powell had presidential ambitions - that was why the summit was held in secret. Jones wanted to save Powell from being associated with the negative publicity that surrounded rap music.",
      "He switched venues at the last minute to throw press off the scent, and confiscated the recordings.",
      "\"Rest assured that my discretion is based on a deep respect for you and a valued friendship,\" Jones wrote to Powell in an unpublished letter held at Indianapolis University Library.",
      "\"I know that we are going to make a difference at this conference. Thanks for the way you handled the situation. Maybe we can turn the battleship an inch or two.\"",
      "Jones later wrote in his book: \"Some of the younger rappers didn't even know who he was. When addressing some of the more confrontational comments from the floor, Powell maintained his South Bronx demeanour and authoritative cool throughout.\"",
      "Fab 5 Freddy remembers one exchange between Powell and Knight. \"There was an encounter where he [Knight] had something to say, and Colin Powell responded.",
      "\"Here you have this guy who was a four-star general talking to Suge Knight, and he pretty much put Suge in his place.\"",
      "Jones finally released a clip of the event for a 2018 Netflix documentary about his life.",
      "\"We've got to seriously talk about what you are going to deal with,\" he is seen telling the assembled attendees.",
      "\"They are not playing, there's real bullets out there, believe me. Maybe literally and figuratively.",
      "\"It's a very emotional thing,\" he added, his voice cracking. \"I want to see you guys live to at least my age.\"",
      "\"Quincy did get emotional,\" Fab 5 Freddy recalls, \"because he sensed what could happen.",
      "\"And the worst, unfortunately, did happen.\"",
      "Who was Tupac Shakur?",
      "Ex-gang leader pleads not guilty to Tupac murder",
      "Diddy accused of 'revenge' rape over Tupac claims",
      "Jones had ended up reconciling with Tupac. After Tupac's 1993 comments, Jones's 17-year-old daughter Rashida - who would go on to star in US sitcom The Office - wrote an irate letter to Source attacking the rapper.",
      "When Tupac bumped into one of Jones's other daughters, Kidada, he apologised, thinking she was Rashida. But Tupac and Kidada hit it off and began a relationship.",
      "\"Though we got off to a rocky start, as I came to know and feel him I saw his enormous potential and sensitivity as an artist and as a human being,\" Quincy Jones wrote.",
      "There have also been claims that Tupac was planning to leave Death Row for Jones's record label.",
      "But in September 1996, a year after the summit, Tupac was shot and killed.",
      "A former gang leader, Duane \"Keffe D\" Davis, was charged with his murder last year. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Then in 1997, Notorious BIG was shot dead outside a party thrown by Jones's record label and magazine. No-one has ever been charged.",
      "Meanwhile, today Knight is in prison for a hit-and-run, while Combs is awaiting trial on charges of racketeering and sex trafficking, which he denies.",
      "The violence in the 90s \"wasn't necssary\" and was caused by \"wannabes and gang-related troublemakers\" on the edges of the music industry, according to Fab 5 Freddy.",
      "\"Also, the east/west coast beef was mainly ignited by jealousy. It was an ashtray fire fanned into a big deal by media outlets that led to Biggie and Tupac getting killed.\"",
      "Despite his stature, not even Jones could alter the forces of power and pride that were at work and prevent the bloodshed.",
      "Freddy believes some lessons were learned at the summit, however, and that it deserves a place in hip-hop history.",
      "\"It was incredible and electric to be in that room.",
      "\"It was a thrilling moment. And then it became even more legendary because it was never released, so the only people that really knew about it were the people that were there.\""

    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 00:30:46 GMT",
    "summary": "Justice DY Chandrachud retired as India\u2019s chief justice on Sunday. Many are debating his legacy.",
    "story": [
      "How will history judge my tenure?",
      "That\u2019s a question Dhananjay Yashwant Chandrachud, who retired as India\u2019s 50th chief justice on Sunday, asked just weeks before he finished his term.",
      "Justice Chandrachud said his mind was \u201cheavily preoccupied with fears and anxieties about the future and the past\u201d.",
      "\u201cI find myself pondering: Did I achieve everything I set out to do? How will history judge my tenure? Could I have done things differently? What legacy will I leave for future generations of judges and legal professionals?\u201d he said.",
      "The soul searching came at a time when many in India are also debating what legacy he leaves behind.",
      "Justice Chandrachud served more than eight years as a top court judge and as chief justice for the past two years. He presided over one of the most powerful Supreme Courts in the world with jurisdiction over India\u2019s 1.4 billion citizens.",
      "The top court is the final court of appeal, the final interpreter of the constitution and its judgements, which are binding on all other courts in India, routinely make news - although judges seldom do.",
      "But Justice Chandrachud, sometimes described as India\u2019s \u201cfirst celebrity judge\u201d and a \"rockstar judge\", has routinely hit the headlines.",
      "According to Arghya Sengupta of the Vidhi Centre For Legal Policy, the jurist was India's most prolific chief justice who wrote 93 judgements - more than his last four predecessors put together \u2013 including some on matters of seminal importance. He also made huge strides in terms of digitisation and livestreaming of court hearings \u2013 making them more accessible to citizens.",
      "But some of the recent coverage has also been unflattering, with critics saying he wasn't assertive enough and his tenure has been disappointing.",
      "The Harvard-educated judge has many firsts to his name \u2013 he was the youngest to head a high court and his two-year-term was the longest for a chief justice in more than a decade. He\u2019s also the only chief justice whose father also served in the role.",
      "During his years in the Supreme Court, he developed a reputation for being a progressive, liberal judge known for his nuanced and thoughtful judgements related to matters of liberty, freedom of speech and gender and LGBT rights.",
      "He was part of landmark rulings that decriminalised homosexuality and allowed menstruating women into Kerala\u2019s Sabarimala shrine. His utterances on the right to privacy and right to dissent were extensively praised.",
      "So, his elevation to be India\u2019s top judge in November 2022 was welcomed by senior lawyers, activists and citizens with many expressing a \u201cstrong hope that under his leadership the court will rise to greater heights\u201d.",
      "It was a time when India\u2019s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government was getting ready to secure a third term in the 2024 general election.",
      "Opposition parties, activists and sections of the press were accusing the government of targeting them, with global rights organisations saying Indian democracy was under threat.",
      "Although the government denied any wrongdoing, many of India\u2019s top academics, rights activists and popular opposition leaders found themselves in jail and the country kept sliding on the global press freedom index. (The government has always rejected such ratings, saying they are biased against India.)",
      "Senior lawyer Kamini Jaiswal says Justice Chandrachud\u2019s appointment had come at \u201ca crucial juncture as some of the last chief justices had left under a cloud of dark spots and the position had been denigrated with serious allegations\u201d.",
      "\u201cSo, we thought Justice Chandrachud would use his erudition and brilliant mind to do a lot of good for the citizens. But he has been disappointing,\u201d she said.",
      "Senior Supreme Court lawyer Chander Uday Singh says his record is \u201ca mixed bag\u201d.",
      "\u201cIn his judgments, he would lay down the law brilliantly which could be used as a precedent for future cases. But whenever the state was heavily invested in any issue, he failed to hold power to account, so the state got away with what they had set out of achieve.\u201d",
      "For instance, he points out that the court struck down a government scheme that allowed people to make anonymous donations to political parties, calling it unconstitutional and illegal. \u201cBut then he did not hold anyone accountable for the illegality.\u201d",
      "Similarly, when it came to a political crisis in the western state of Maharashtra or Delhi\u2019s power struggle with the federal government, his judgments tended to favour the government, he adds.",
      "\u201cThere was hope that through his judgments, he would set things right in a country that is under a strong majoritarian government. But he fell short.\u201d",
      "Several top lawyers have also criticised Justice Chandrachud for what he did as the \u201cmaster of the roster\u201d by failing to effectively prevent the prolonged incarceration of political prisoners - leading to the death of some of them without ever getting bail. This happened despite Justice Chandrachud saying that bail should be the norm and not the exception.",
      "And as he neared his retirement, Justice Chandrachud also made headlines for what he did not in the court, but outside.",
      "In September, there was uproar over a viral video that showed him praying at home with PM Modi during a Hindu religious festival.",
      "Ms Jaiswal said by publicising the photo, \u201ca message was being sent that the chief justice is close to the PM\u201d. Lawyers, former judges, opposition politicians and many citizens also criticised him saying \u201cthe presence of a politician at a private event erodes the perception of impartiality of the judiciary\u201d.",
      "Another burst of criticism greeted Justice Chandrachud\u2019s comment last month when he said he had asked God for a solution to the vexed Babri Mosque-Ram temple dispute. \u201cI sat before the deity and told him he needed to find a solution and he gave it to me,\u201d he said.",
      "The comment led to a firestorm of criticism, not entirely unexpected as the mosque-temple dispute has been one of the most contentious and religiously polarising issues in modern India.",
      "The mosque was demolished by Hindu mobs in 1992. A five-judge bench, which included Justice Chandrachud, ruled in 2019 that the demolition was illegal, but still gave the disputed land to Hindus and a separate site for the mosque to be built. Earlier this year, PM Modi inaugurated a grand new temple at the site, fulfilling a longstanding promise by his party.",
      "So, no surprise then that Justice Chandrachud\u2019s comment, seen by many as religious, was extensively criticised.",
      "Retired high court judge Anjana Prakash told HW news that his comment was \u201cdramatic, filmy and laughable and it had brought down the level of judiciary\u201d.",
      "\u201cA judge has to decide cases on principles of law. Where does God come into a judgement? Besides, people have different gods. And if a justice from another faith had said this, would the reaction be the same?\u201d she asked.",
      "Justice Prakash and other critics wondered if he was cosying up to the government for a post-retirement assignment.",
      "In the days preceding his retirement, Justice Chandrachud addressed some of the criticism in interactions with the media.",
      "\u201cThe separation of powers doesn\u2019t mean antagonistic relations between the executive and the judiciary, it doesn\u2019t mean that they cannot meet,\u201d he said at an event by the Indian Express newspaper, adding that such meetings were not used \u201cto cut deals\u201d.",
      "\u201cThe ultimate proof of our good behaviour lies in the written word \u2013 in our judgements. Is it consistent with the constitution or not?\u201d",
      "Justice Chandrachud said his comment on seeking divine guidance was because \u201cI am a person of faith\u201d and \u201cto impute motives to judges is not right\u201d.",
      "He added that courts were facing pressure \u201cfrom lobbies and pressure groups\u201d and they would praise a decision critical of the government, but if he ruled in favour of the government, they questioned his independence.",
      "At his farewell on Friday, the outgoing chief justice said he was perhaps India\u2019s most trolled judge, but his \u201cshoulders are broad enough to accept all criticism\u201d.",
      "And at the weekend, he told Times of India that he believed he had \u201cleft the system better than I found it\u201d.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m retiring with a sense of satisfaction,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "As leaders of dozens of Arab and Islamic nations gather in the Saudi capital for a summit, there is widespread speculation about what a second Trump presidency will mean for the region.",
      "In sharp contrast to the fears voiced in Europe about Donald Trump\u2019s famous unpredictability, Gulf Arab countries tend to view him as a force for stability.",
      "Writing in the officially approved Arab News opinion column, the prominent UAE business leader Khalaf al-Habtoor says: \u201cIn a Middle East where security is paramount, Trump\u2019s focus on strengthening alliances and curbing extremist forces offers a way forward.\u201d",
      "Here in Saudi Arabia, Trump is viewed much more favourably than Joe Biden.",
      "Trump chose Riyadh for his first overseas trip as President in 2017, an idea reportedly brokered by Rupert Murdoch.",
      "Through his son-in-law Jared Kushner, Trump enjoys warm relations with the de facto Saudi ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known by his initials, MBS. The crown prince has never forgiven or forgotten Biden saying that Saudi Arabia needed to be made a pariah for its attitude to human rights.",
      "Trump\u2019s record in office is a mixed one when it comes to the Middle East.",
      "On the one hand he pleased Israel and upset the Arab world by recognising Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital as well as Israel\u2019s annexation of the occupied Golan Heights. But he also secured the Abraham Accords in 2020 which saw the UAE, Bahrain and Morocco establish full diplomatic relations with Israel and Sudan agree to do so.",
      "Trump was, and is, hawkish on Iran.",
      "In 2018, he pulled the US out of the Iran nuclear deal, the so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Calling it \u201cthe worst deal in history\u201d, he shared the views of many governments in the region that the deal, aimed at curbing Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions, failed to tackle Iran\u2019s ballistic missile programme while enriching the Revolutionary Guards with money then used to fund proxy militias around the region.",
      "In 2020, to Iran\u2019s fury but to the satisfaction of many in the Gulf Arab states, Trump ordered the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, the leader of the Revolutionary Guards\u2019 Quds Force.",
      "But today\u2019s Middle East is not the same as the one when Trump left the White House.",
      "Israel is at war with Hamas and Hezbollah, and exchanged blows with both the Houthis in Yemen and their backers in Iran.",
      "Under the Biden administration US influence in the region is seen to have waned with a White House largely ineffective at restraining its close ally, Israel, as it wages war in Gaza and Lebanon.",
      "Trump\u2019s return to the White House is thought likely to give Israel a freer hand to strike targets in Iran - like oil and nuclear facilities - that the Biden administration said were off limits.",
      "\u201cHis staunch support for Israel and aggressive stance towards Iran\u2019s destabilising efforts made him a key ally in the region, and his return to power is expected to intensify efforts to limit Iran\u2019s influence,\u201d former Israeli intelligence officer Joshua Steinrich says.",
      "But something else has changed in the region.",
      "Brokered by China, Saudi Arabia and Iran have agreed to put aside their differences, ending seven years of hostility, characterised most visibly by the war in Yemen where the Saudi air force bombed Iran-backed Houthi rebels.",
      "On Sunday, Saudi Arabia\u2019s military chief flew to Tehran to meet his Iranian counterpart, with both countries now talking about deepening their co-operation on defence and security.",
      "Ever since Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolution in 1979, Saudi Arabia and its Sunni Arab neighbours in the region have viewed Iran as a major threat to their security. But the surprise 2019 drone strike on Saudi oil facilities, attributed to Iran-backed militants in Iraq, was an uncomfortable reminder to the Gulf Arab states as to just how vulnerable they were to attack by Iran.",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 00:17:43 GMT",
    "summary": "The South Korean hit drama returns for a second season in December.",
    "story": [
      "When I ask the creator of the hit Korean drama Squid Game about reports that he was so stressed while shooting the first series he lost six teeth, he quickly corrects me. \u201cIt was eight or nine,\u201d he laughs.",
      "Hwang Dong-hyuk is speaking to me on set as he films the second series of his dystopian Netflix thriller, which sees hundreds of debt-laden contestants fight it out for a whopping cash prize, by playing a string of life-or-death children\u2019s games.",
      "But another series was not always on the cards. At one point, he swore against making one.",
      "Given the stress it has caused him, I ask what changed his mind.",
      "\u201cMoney,\u201d he answers, without hesitation.",
      "\u201cEven though the first series was such a huge global success, honestly I didn\u2019t make much,\u201d he tells me. \u201cSo doing the second series will help compensate me for the success of the first one too.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd I didn\u2019t fully finish the story,\u201d he adds.",
      "The first series was Netflix\u2019s most successful show to date, thrusting South Korea and its home-grown television dramas into the spotlight. Its dark commentary on wealth inequality touched a nerve with audiences around the globe.",
      "But having killed off almost every character, Hwang has had to start from scratch, with a new cast and set of games, and this time audience expectations are sky high.",
      "\u201cThe stress I feel now is much greater,\u201d he says.",
      "Three years after the first series aired, Hwang is even more pessimistic about the state of the world.",
      "He points to current wars, climate change and a widening global wealth gap. Conflicts are no longer confined between the rich and poor, they are playing out intensely between different generations, genders and political camps, he says.",
      "\u201cNew lines are being drawn. We\u2019re in an era of us vs them. Who\u2019s right and who\u2019s wrong?\u201d",
      "As I toured the show\u2019s playful set, with its distinctive brightly-coloured staircase, I picked up a few clues as to how the director\u2019s despair will be reflected this time around.",
      "In this series, the previous winner, Gi-hun, re-enters the game on a quest to bring it down and save the latest round of contestants.",
      "According to Lee Jung-jae, who plays the leading character, he is \"more desperate and determined\u201d than before.",
      "The floor of the dormitory, where the contestants sleep at night, has been divided in two.",
      "One half is branded with a giant red neon X symbol, the other with a blue circle.",
      "Now, after every game, the players must pick a side, depending on whether they want to end the contest early and survive, or keep playing, in the knowledge all but one of them will die. The majority decision rules.",
      "This, I am told, will lead to more factionalism and fights.",
      "It is part of director Hwang\u2019s plan to expose the dangers of living in an increasingly tribal world. Forcing people to pick sides, he believes, is fuelling conflict.",
      "For all those who were captivated by the shocking storytelling of Squid Game, there were others who found it gratuitously violent and difficult to watch.",
      "But it is clear from talking to Hwang, that the violence is fully thought out. He is a man who thinks and cares deeply about the world and is motivated by a mounting unease.",
      "\u201cWhen making this series, I constantly asked myself \u2018do we humans have what it takes to steer the world off this downhill path?\u2019. Honestly, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he says.",
      "While viewers of the second series might not get the answers to these big life questions, they can at least be comforted that some plot holes will be filled in \u2013 like why the game exists, and what is motivating the masked Front Man running it.",
      "\u201cPeople will see more of the Front Man\u2019s past, his story and his emotions,\u201d reveals the actor Lee Byung-hun, who plays the mysterious role.",
      "\u201cI don't think this will make viewers warm to him, but it may help them better understand his choices.\u201d",
      "As one of South Korea\u2019s most famous actors, Lee admits that having his face and eyes covered and his voice distorted throughout the first series, was \u201ca little bit dissatisfying\u201d.",
      "This series he has relished having scenes without a mask, in which he can fully express himself \u2013 a chance he nearly did not get.",
      "Hwang tried for 10 years to get Squid Game made, taking out large loans to support his family, before Netflix swooped in.",
      "They paid him a modest upfront amount, leaving him unable to cash in on the whopping \u00a3650m it is estimated to have made the platform.",
      "This explains the love-hate relationship South Korea\u2019s film and television creators currently have with international streaming platforms.",
      "Over the past few years, Netflix has stormed the Korean market with billions of dollars of investment, bringing the industry global recognition and love, but leaving creators feeling short-changed.",
      "They accuse the platform of forcing them to relinquish their copyright when they sign contracts \u2013 and with it, their claim to profit.",
      "This is a worldwide problem.",
      "In the past, creators could rely on getting a cut of box office sales or TV re-runs, but this model has not been adopted by streaming giants.",
      "The issue is compounded in South Korea, creators say, due to its outdated copyright law, which does not protect them.",
      "This summer, actors, writers, directors and producers teamed up to form a collective, to fight the system together.",
      "\u201cIn Korea, being a movie director is just a job title, it\u2019s not a way to earn a living,\u201d the vice-president of the Korean Film Directors Guild, Oh Ki-hwan, tells the audience at an event in Seoul.",
      "Some of his director friends, he says, work part-time in warehouses and as taxi drivers.",
      "Park Hae-young is a writer at the event. When Netflix bought her show, 'My Liberation Notes', it became a global hit.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been writing my whole life. So, to get global recognition when competing with creators from across the world, has been a joyful experience,\u201d she tells me.",
      "But Park says the current streaming model has left her reluctant to \u201cpour her all\u201d into her next series.",
      "\u201cUsually, I\u2019ll spend four or five years making a drama in the belief that, if it's successful, it could somewhat secure my future, that I'll get my fair share of compensation. Without that, what's the point of working so hard?\u201d",
      "She and other creators are pushing the South Korean government to change its copyright law to force production companies to share their profits.",
      "In a statement, the South Korean government told the BBC that while it recognised the compensation system needed to change, it was up to the industry to resolve the issue. A spokesperson for Netflix told us it offers \u201ccompetitive\u201d compensation, and guarantees creators \u201csolid compensation, regardless of the success or failure of their shows\u201d.",
      "Squid Game\u2019s Hwang hopes his candor over his own pay struggles will initiate that change.",
      "He has certainly sparked the fair pay conversation, and this second series will surely give the industry another bump.",
      "But when we catch up after filming has wrapped, he tells me his teeth are aching again.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t seen my dentist yet, but I\u2019ll probably have to pull out a few more very soon.\u201d",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 03:59:09 GMT",
    "summary": "Vistara is operating its last flight on Monday as it completes its merger with Air India.",
    "story": [
      "Indian full-service carrier Vistara will operate its last flight on Monday, after nine years in existence.",
      "A joint venture between Singapore Airlines and the Tata Sons, Vistara will merge with Tata-owned Air India to form a single entity with an expanded network and broader fleet.",
      "This means that all Vistara operations will be transferred to and managed by Air India, including helpdesk kiosks and ticketing offices. The process of migrating passengers with existing Vistara bookings and loyalty programmes to Air India has been under way over the past few months.",
      "\u201cAs part of the merger process, meals, service ware and other soft elements have been upgraded and incorporates aspects of both Vistara and Air India,\u201d an Air India spokesperson said in an email response.",
      "Amid concerns that the merger could impact service standards, the Tatas have assured that Vistara's in-flight experience will remain unchanged.",
      "Known for its high ratings in food, service, and cabin quality, Vistara has built a loyal customer base and the decision to retire the Vistara brand has been criticised by fans, branding experts, and aviation analysts.",
      "The consolidation was effectively done to clean up Vistara\u2019s books and wipe out its losses, said Mark Martin, an aviation analyst.",
      "Air India has essentially been \u201csuckered into taking a loss-making airline\u201d in a desperate move, he added.",
      "\"Mergers are meant to make airlines powerful. Never to wipe out losses or cover them.\"",
      "To be sure, both Air India and Vistara\u2019s annual losses have reduced by more than half over the past year, and other operating metrics have improved too. But the merger process so far has been turbulent.",
      "The exercise has been riddled with problems \u2013 from pilot shortages that have led to massive flight cancellations, to Vistara crew going on mass sick leave over plans to align their salary structures with Air India.",
      "There have also been repeated complaints about poor service standards on Air India, including viral videos of broken seats and non-functioning inflight entertainment systems.",
      "The Tatas have announced a $400m (\u00a3308m) programme to upgrade and retrofit the interiors of its older aircraft and also a brand-new livery. They\u2019ve also placed orders for hundreds of new Airbus and Boeing planes worth billions of dollars to augment their offering.",
      "But this \u201cturnaround\u201d is still incomplete and riddled with problems, according to Mr Martin. A merger only complicates matters.",
      "Experts say that the merger strikes a dissonant chord from a branding perspective too.",
      "Harish Bijoor, a brand strategy specialist, told the BBC he was feeling \u201cemotional\u201d that a superior product offering like Vistara which had developed a \u201cgold standard for Indian aviation\u201d was ceasing operations.",
      "\u201cIt is a big loss for the industry,\u201d said Mr Bijoor, adding it will be a monumental task for the mother brand Air India to simply \u201ccopy, paste and exceed\u201d the high standards set by Vistara, given that it\u2019s a much smaller airline that\u2019s being gobbled up by a much larger one.",
      "Mr Bijoor suggests a better strategy would have been to operate Air India separately for five years, focusing on improving service standards, while maintaining Vistara as a distinct brand with Air India prefixed to it.",
      "\u201cThis would have given Air India the time and chance to rectify the mother brand and bring it up to the Vistara level, while maintaining its uniqueness,\u201d he adds.",
      "Beyond branding, the merged entity will face a slew of operational challenges.",
      "\"Communication will be a major challenge in the early days, with customers arriving at the airport expecting Vistara flights, only to find Air India branding,\" says Ajay Awtaney, editor of Live From A Lounge, an aviation portal. \"Air India will need to maintain clear communication for weeks.\"",
      "Another key challenge, he notes, is cultural: Vistara's agile employees may struggle to adjust to Air India's complex bureaucracy and systems.",
      "But the biggest task for the merged carrier would be offering customers a uniform flying experience.",
      "These are \u201ctwo airlines with very different service formats are being integrated into one airline. It is going to be a hotchpotch of service formats, cabin formats, branding, and customer experience. It will involve learning and unlearning, and such a process has rarely worked with airlines and is seldom effective,\u201d said Mr Martin.",
      "Still, many believe Vistara had to go \u2013 now or some years later.",
      "A legacy brand like Air India, with strong global recognition and 'India' imprinted in its identity, wouldn\u2019t have allowed a smaller, more premium subsidiary to overshadow its revival process.",
      "Financially too, it makes little sense for the Tatas to have two loss-making entities compete with one another.",
      "The combined strength of Vistara and Air India could also place the Tatas in a much better position to compete with market leader Indigo.",
      "The unified Air India group (including Air India Express, which completed its merger with the former Air Asia India in October) \u201cwill be bigger and better with a fleet size of nearly 300 aircraft, an expanded network and a stronger workforce\u201d, an Air India spokesperson said.",
      "\u201cGetting done with the merger means that Air India grows overnight, and the two teams start cooperating instead of competing. There will never be one right day to merge. Somewhere, a line had to be drawn,\u201d said Mr Awtaney.",
      "But for many Vistara loyalists, its demise leaves a void in India\u2019s skies for a premium, full-service carrier - marking the third such gap after the collapse of Kingfisher Airlines and Jet Airways.",
      "It\u2019s still too early to say if Air India, which often ranks at the bottom of airline surveys, can successfully fill that void."

      "She only appeared by video, choosing instead to spend the night watching her boyfriend, American Football player Travis Kelce, lead the Kansas City Chiefs to victory against the Denver Broncos.",
      "But there were plenty of other stars at the show and on the red carpet. Here's some of the gossip we picked up along the way.",
      "1) Raye gave an update on her missing song books",
      "Two weeks ago, Raye told fans her second album had been delayed by thieves who stole her car and, with it, several notebooks full of lyrics and song ideas.",
      "On the red carpet, she confirmed the police hadn't been able to track them down, saying: \"I've just had to let it go.\"",
      "The singer said she couldn't recreate a lot of the ideas, because the act of writing them down freed her mind to work on other things.",
      "\"You let it go, because you think you can come back to it - and now there are so many ideas that are just gone. It's so sad.\"",
      "But the singer, who won best UK artist, maintained a positive outlook.",
      "\"Everything happens for a reason. I'll have to start again and maybe it's a blessing in disguise.\"",
      "2) Busta Rhymes revealed his unlikely comedy hero",
      "The decision to bring rap legend Busta Rhymes to Manchester to receive a global icon award wasn't as random as it sounded.",
      "Before he developed his rapid-fire rap delivery, an 11-year-old Rhymes spent two summers living with his Aunt Velma in Morecambe.",
      "\"I went to karate school, and we illegally went into nightclubs, to make a little money break-dancing,\" he told us.",
      "\"I remember Boy George was cool, Wham was cool,\" he continued.",

      "So, during those halcyon days of watching smutty comedy in Morecambe, did he ever think he'd be back, winning a lifetime achievement prize?",
      "\"You can never foresee something like that,\" he said. \"When we first got involved with hip-hop, we didn't do it for none of the accolades. We just did it because we loved it.",
      "\"But with that being said, tonight is a dream come true.\"",
      "To honour that moment, he gave a nine-minute acceptance speech thanking everyone from his mother to an art teacher he'd met backstage.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never got an award from MTV before. Thirty four years of professionally recording [and] this is the first time I\u2019m getting an award from MTV. It feels incredible.\"",
      "3) Olly Alexander had advice for next year's Eurovision contestant",
      "Olly Alexander played a pre-show party on Saturday night, and couldn't quite believe the reception for Dizzy - the song which earned him 18th place at this year's Eurovision Song Contest.",
      "\"That went down a lot better than it did in Eurovision,\" he laughed, shortly before Jedward invaded the stage and caused utter chaos.",
      "At the main ceremony, Alexander was there to award song of the year to Sabrina Carpenter's Espresso. But he also had a few words for anyone considering representing the UK at next year's contest.",
      "\"I would say to them, whoever it is, 'Call me, and we will have a serious conversation about it',\" he said with the haunted look of a man who has seen some things.",
      "4) Benson Boone has a new fan: Bez",
      "In addition to winning best new artist, US singer Benson Boone opened the ceremony with a spectacular performance that saw him suspended mid-air on a grand piano, before pulling off a spectacular front flip from a platform at the side of the stage.",
      "\"The insurance is always crazy,\" he laughed, \"but I love to perform.\"",
      "One person who couldn't believe his eyes was Happy Mondays star Bez, who accosted Boone during an interview with Rita Ora.",
      "\"I was so blown away by that performance, mate,\" he told the singer.",

      "It was only fitting that the event marked his death - but striking the right tone in the middle of a huge showbiz event is never easy.",
      "In the end, his friend and collaborator Rita Ora just spoke from the heart.",
      "\"There were so many ways that we were talking about honouring him,\" she said. \"But sometimes simply speaking is enough.\"",
      "Addressing the camera directly, she shared her memories of the 31-year-old, as her voice cracked.",
      "\"Liam Payne was one of the kindest people that I knew,\" she said. \"He brought so much joy to every room he walked into. And he left such a mark on this world.\"",
      "It was sombre and restrained, yet powerfully emotional. Ora wasn't the only one crying.",

      "South African star Tyla, best known for her viral hit Water, clinched both the best R&B and best Afrobeats awards.",
      "The awards marked her continued ascent, after being named one of the BBC's Sounds of 2024 - but she made sure to honour her inspirations.",

      "\"A Man on the Inside\" is no different, says series creator Mike Schur. \"I would say the purpose of this show is simply to discuss a subject that very few people discuss, which is aging,\" said Schur. \"It's this subject that we just don't like to talk about. It's thought of in this country (I think more than other countries) as something almost shameful or embarrassing.\"",
      "\"If you're dying, you somehow made a mistake,\" said Danson.",
      "\"You screwed up! Yeah, you screwed up, you got old, you know?\" Schur said. \"And I think that's weird, because this is what happens if we're lucky. If we're lucky, we get old!\"",
      "At 76, Danson himself is aging gracefully, with an attitude inspired by a Hollywood legend: Jane Fonda. \"She was turning 80, and at 70 I was starting to go, 'Well, I'd better look for a nice place to land, you know, this life plane,' or whatever,\" he said. \"And I looked at her and it was like, no. She has her foot on the gas pedal! She's, like, doing a 12-hour day, shooting her show, jumping on a bus to go, you know, support the service industry in Sacramento with a handful of women.",
      "\"Don't slow down, just keep going, keep living your life. I think that's one of the things our elders can pass on to us. This is how you live life right up until the end.\"",
      "Seems like Danson's elders set a good example: his parents wouldn't allow a TV in their home. \"My mother didn't like them,\" he said. \"She'd rather you read, or go out and play, or be creative.\"",
      "But then, Danson got famous, on TV. \u00a0His parents finally got one. \"But they put kind of this beautiful tapestry over the front of it, so when you walked in their house, you didn't see a TV, you saw this beautiful tapestry with a candle on top, and they would take it off and watch 'Cheers,'\" he said.",
      "Danson still credits his success today to that one show about a Boston bar. But since he hung up his bartender apron in 1993, he's been in hit after hit. He was the title character in \"Becker.\" In \"Damages,\" he held his own with Glenn Close. He went to heaven and hell in \"The Good Place.\" And he's even played himself in \"Curb Your Enthusiasm.\"",
      "Along the way Danson has used his fame to draw attention to his passion project, Oceana, an organization dedicated to preserving the world's oceans. Asked if he feels they have made progress, he replied, \"Yes. I mean, our focus is fishing, over-fishing, making sure that the fisheries of the world are healthy. Because if done right, you could feed a billion people a fish meal every day.\"",
      "That sounds a little like a miracle \u2013 something he touches on in his new show, and something he says he lives with every day.",
      "Asked what are the miracles in his life, Danson replied, \"Mary Steenburgen is, you know, literally heaven-sent. I did some work on myself for about a year before I met her, after 'Cheers,' becoming emotionally mature and real. And I worked hard at it. And then along came Mary Steenburgen. \u2026 We are so blessed. To love somebody and to be loved, is just one of those heaven-on-earth miracles, you know? And that came with Mary.\"",
      "And the idea Ted Danson is hoping to share with his latest project is that miracles can be found in any life, right up until the very end. \"This is your life,\" he said, \"not just up to, you know, 65 and then you retire and are going down. No, you get to live right up until you don't live. And it's your life. It's such a gift. Explore it, and be excited about it. Yes, it hurts. Yes, it's sad. Yes, there's grief. Yes, there's all of that. But embrace it. Embrace it, is kind of what I think the message of the show is. It's what I hope I live with.\"",
      "He got emotional sharing that. \"I'm just emotional 'cause I finally said something I wanted to say!\" he laughed.",

    "story": [
      "T Bone Burnett is best known as a music producer, but in April, he released \"The Other Side,\" his first album of new music in 18 years. Asked why he releases his own music so infrequently, Burnett replied, \"I've always been a behind-the-scenes person. I like creating in private.\"",
      "Maybe even more remarkable, this fall, he's touring behind it.",
      "He was quoted earlier this year saying he always viewed the audience as a mob coming to get him. \"Yeah, like a lynch mob or something,\" he laughed. \"It was just raw paranoia, but also just insecurity.\"",
      "Burnett is more at home in the studio, where he's produced albums for The Wallflowers, Greg Allman, and Elton John.",
      "Asked what he thinks he can get out of musicians that maybe other people don't, Burnett said, \"Well, what I try to get out of them is just their full love, their full being.\"",
      "He certainly did with Robert Plant and Alison Krauss on \"Raising Sand,\" and won the Grammy for album of the year in 2009:",
      "He described \"accidentally\" ending up in the commercial mainstream in a big way a couple of times. \"I mean, it's always a fluke, but, yes, I have.\"",
      "\"Has that surprised you?\" Mason asked.",

      "\"That was a vibe and it had to do with the swamp, and it had to do with the darkness of it all.\"",
      "\"Sounds kind of fun, actually!\"",
      "\"It was so fun!\" Burnett laughed. \"That's what I mean. It's fun to do the dark world, you know, as long as you don't have to actually live in it!\"",

Isn't that crazy? You know, I'm just sonically oriented.\"",
      "In 1975, Bob Dylan recruited Burnett to play guitar in his \"Rolling Thunder\" revue, starting a lifelong friendship. In 2021, they played together again, re-recording Dylan's classic, \"Blowin' in the Wind,\" using a special high fidelity analog system that Burnett says creates the highest quality audio ever.",
      "\"We decided to just make one disc; there are no copies,\" he said. \"The germ of it was, I wanted to do something that couldn't be put online. It couldn't be commoditized. I'm not doing this to keep it away from anybody. I'm just doing it to work at the highest possible level.\"\u00a0The disc sold at auction in 2022 for nearly $1.8 million.",

      "\"It's a mystical kind of thing,\" said Mason.",
      "\"Yeah, it is to me. And you build a world of resonance, and that's the stuff that's the most thrilling to me, and the part of life that a machine will never comprehend.\"",
      "T Bone Burnett's new record earned a Grammy nomination this past week for best Americana album, and at 76, he's even starting to enjoy another sound \u2026 the sound of a crowd. \"I think I had a much more benevolent view of the audience than I used to have,\" he said.",

      "Bloomberg News reports\u00a0the suit was filed days after a meeting last weekend between the justice department and heads of both health care companies failed to quell concerns of possible antitrust issues, despite the companies' joint offer to sell off 100-plus clinics to a Texas-based competitor.",
      "The justice department believes the acquisition could \"lead to higher prices in home health care in regions where Amedisys is a main competitor\" to LHC Group, Bloomberg reports, a business UnitedHealth purchased in 2023. Both companies operate in many of the same states, especially in the South.",
      "This isn't the first time the justice department has had UnitedHealth in its legal crosshairs. Just two years ago, it unsuccessfully sued the company amid its purchase of Change Healthcare, the IT firm targeted in the cyberattack in February that reportedly cost UnitedHealth $872 million due to a lack of multifactor authentication. UnitedHealth paid\u00a0a Bitcoin ransom valued at $22 million.",
      "Amedisys' stock value dropped on Tuesday following news of the upcoming suit. A UnitedHealth spokesperson gave this statement to WCCO on Tuesday:",

    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 14:52:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has vowed to combat \"the chronic disease epidemic in this country\" in the Trump administration, with the slogan \"Make America Healthy Aagain.\"",
    "story": [
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has outlined a number of promises to \"Make America Healthy Again\" under President-elect Donald Trump, vowing to combat an \"epidemic\" of chronic diseases that he has described as an \"existential\" threat to America's future.",
      "All are under the banner of fighting what Kennedy sees as a common thread behind a broad swath of ailments: that Americans have been \"mass poisoned by big pharma and big food,\" and that federal agencies have failed to stop it. In response, he has also floated a number of specific policy ideas to remake the federal government's public health institutions.",
      "\"[Trump] asked me to end the chronic disease epidemic in this country. And he said, I want to see results, measurable results in the diminishment of chronic disease within two years. And I said, Mr. President, I will do that,\" Kennedy said on Nov. 2.",
      "Authority for a MAHA agenda",
      "Kennedy's allies say Trump's election is also a mandate for their platform of health proposals, which they say delivered key votes for the president-elect. Trump has promised to let Kennedy \"go wild\" on health issues.",
      "\"The American people re-elected President Trump by resounding margins because they trust his judgement and support his policies, including his promise to Make America Healthy Again alongside well-respected leaders like RFK Jr.,\" Karoline Leavitt, Trump-Vance Transition spokeswoman, told CBS News in a statement.",
      "Some ideas in Kennedy's wide-ranging platform have evolved since his original longshot\u00a0presidential campaign. He has acknowledged Trump does not agree with him on every policy.",
      "The president-elect has listed oil and gas as one off-limits issue for Kennedy. In the past, Kennedy has been critical of \"big oil\" and natural gas, over the fatal toll of fossil fuel pollution and climate change.",
      "Several of Kennedy's ideas would require presidential or congressional action to implement, though it is possible that they could be supercharged by emergency powers.",
      "\"I'm going to urge President Trump on day one to do the same thing they did in COVID, which is to declare a national emergency, but not for infectious disease, but for chronic disease,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 26.",
      "Staff changes at federal agencies",
      "Kennedy claims a number of health issues have worsened due to federal inaction, including autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, sleep disorders, infertility rates, diabetes and obesity.",
      "He aims to address that by replacing many staff throughout the agencies, which Kennedy has accused of being too sympathetic to large food and drug companies. As a co-chair of Trump's transition, Kennedy has been vetting a slate of staffers who could fill top positions throughout the Trump administration.",
      "Kennedy has said Trump tasked him with returning agencies \"to their rich tradition of gold-standard, evidence-based science.\" He has also said \"medical expertise\" is not the priority for all staff picks.",
      "\"What we don't really need at HHS is more medical expertise. What we need is an expertise on decoupling the agency from institutional corruption. Because it's the corruption that has distorted the science,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 30.",
      "Kennedy has said he hopes \"to have every nutritional scientist\" across the Department of Health and Human Services and U.S. Department of Agriculture \"fired on Day One.\"",
      "Kennedy himself has been floated to head the Department of Health and Human Services, though some allies say he could be more effective in a \"czar\" type role out of the White House.",
      "\"Get the chemicals out\" of food",
      "When talking about his platform, Kennedy often lampoons products like McDonald's French fries or Fruit Loops cereal as examples of how foods sold in the U.S. are made with ingredients that are banned or discouraged abroad, or have changed for the worse.",
      "\"It's easy to fix. We have a thousand ingredients in our foods that are illegal in Italy and other countries in Europe,\" he said on Oct. 29.",
      "Trump agrees with his plans to \"get the chemicals out\" of America's food supply, Kennedy says, which also includes upending the use of common pesticides and herbicides by American farmers.",
      "Kennedy has described the food in the U.S. as \"just poison,\" citing his own anecdotal experience with his son struggling with eczema while eating pasta in the U.S.",
      "\"When he ate any kind of pasta in this country, he would get these terrible, terrible outbreaks, you know, really agonizing. And he moved to Italy and he lived off of pasta for a year and a half and he never got a case,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 19.",
      "Kennedy suspects that was caused by glyphosate, used in Roundup brand weed-killers, which Italy moved to start restricting in 2016. Italy's decision was over worries that it could pose a cancer risk, and some advocacy groups in the U.S. have also voiced similar concerns.",
      "Agricultural trade associations have defended glyphosate as \"one of the safest, most effective\" tools farmers have to manage weeds and support \"important conservation practices.\"",
      "Kennedy's plea to crack down on food additives and chemicals comes as the FDA is in the middle of launching its own new effort \u2014 and is calling on Congress to step up funding for \u2014 scrutinizing chemicals currently allowed in foods.",
      "Food industry groups have generally voiced support for the FDA to step up its vetting of chemicals in food, in hopes that it \"negates the ill advised and disruptive state by state patchwork\" of legislatures drawing up their own restrictions.",
      "Reducing unhealthy and processed foods in federal programs",
      "Kennedy has also promised to \"get processed food out of school lunch immediately\" and voiced frustration over the amount of federal food assistance for low-income Americans that goes towards sugary drinks and processed food.",
      "One way Kennedy could try to get at this issue is through the federal dietary guidelines process, jointly run by the USDA and HHS, which is in the final stages of crafting the next edition of recommendations that influence a broad range of government nutrition programs.",
      "\"Kids shouldn't be eating grains. They should definitely not be eating seed oils. And they for sure should not be eating sugar. And yet that is what we're forcing them to eat,\" he said on Sept. 26.",
      "On seed oils, Kennedy has claimed that the switch away from oils like beef tallow which were high in saturated fats in favor of vegetable oils was a mistake, and is to blame for a rise in obesity rates. That puts him at odds with longstanding recommendations to limit saturated fats.",
      "\"The guidance around this has been reviewed many times since, and has only become stronger in its conclusion for the role of saturated fat, particularly in its relationship with higher risks of cardiovascular disease,\" Deirdre Tobias, a researcher on this year's Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, said last month.",
      "Grains have been more divisive at this year's committee and the broader scientific community, which has debated setting lower limits to overall grain consumption alongside recommendations to switch from refined to whole grains.",
      "Setting new limits is difficult, scientists on the panel have said, because the only source of some key nutrients for many Americans is cereals and breads fortified with vitamins.",
      "Kennedy has also been critical of the panel of outside researchers put together to create the scientific report underpinning the recommendations, but acknowledges broader changes will also be needed to move the needle.",
      "While Kennedy says he personally would \"never eat anything in a package\" as a rule of thumb, he acknowledges \"most people don't have access to the resources I have.\"",
      "\"We need to start forcing these companies to internalize their costs. So the illusion of cheap food goes away, right? Because if you're drinking Coke and it seems cheap and it gives you diabetes over the long run, that's not very cheap,\" he said on Sept. 30.",
      "Curbing the influence of drugmakers",
      "Kennedy has called for a \"review\" of guidelines that govern advertising by pharmaceutical companies.",
      "The FDA currently regulates advertising about prescription drugs, going after drugmakers that misrepresent their products. Responsibility for some other medical products is shared between the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission.",
      "Kennedy has urged Trump to go further, saying he is advising the president-elect to \"ban pharmaceutical advertising on TV\" over concerns that it is influencing news coverage of health issues.",
      "He has also urged reform of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, which charges pharmaceutical companies millions of dollars for the cost of the FDA vetting their applications to decide whether to approve new drugs.",
      "\"We need to end the corruption. 50% of FDA's budget comes not from the taxpayer, but from the pharmaceutical industry,\" he said on Sept. 26.",
      "Kennedy has not said how Congress or the Trump administration would make up the difference from the fees if they were cut, which amount to around $3 billion out of FDA's budget.",
      "Undoing the fees could leave taxpayers effectively subsidizing a hefty bill previously paid for by drugmakers \u2014 or a return to the significant delays for new medications that initially spurred the creation of the fees.",
      "Promoting alternatives to drugs",
      "Kennedy has accused the FDA of waging a \"war on public health\" which he says includes \"aggressive suppression\" of anything \"that advances human health and can't be patented by Pharma.\"",
      "In his view, that includes treatments like psychedelics, which recently fell short of FDA approval, and foods like raw milk, which officials have stepped up warnings against amid this year's unprecedented bird flu outbreak on dairy farms.",
      "Kennedy has also praised the dietary supplement industry for a court win against the FDA, after the agency tried to take action against what it said was an illegally marketed anti-aging drug.",
      "Also on Kennedy's list are things like \"clean foods\" and exercise, which he wants to allow Medicare and Medicaid to cover.",
      "The promise has echoes of the \"food is medicine\" initiative, which has called for the health care system to offer more financial support for healthier lifestyle habits.",
      "\"If a doctor's patient has diabetes or obesity, the doctor ought to be able to say, I'm going to recommend gym membership, and I'm going to recommend, good food and Medicaid ought to be able to finance those things the same as they would Ozempic,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 30.",
      "Kennedy has also promised to promote healthier lifestyles in other ways, ranging from requiring nutrition classes in federally funded medical schools to reviving the presidential fitness test in schools.",
      "\"Informed choices\" on vaccines",
      "Kennedy has a long record criticizing the safety of vaccines, including recent misleading claims that shots have an \"exemption from pre-licensing safety testing\" before they are approved.",
      "In fact, the FDA requires new vaccines be studied for their safety and efficacy in large trials, results of which are published in peer-reviewed journals and publicly disclosed.",
      "His activism on the issue dates back decades, including a now-retracted article he published in Rolling Stone in 2005 claiming a link between autism and an ingredient called thimerosal that had been used in vaccines before 2001 \u2014 which medical research has disproven. His focus has broadened since then.",
      "\"This doesn't mean vaccines is the only cause of autism. Our kids today are swimming around in a toxic soup coming mainly from their foods that operate along the same biological pathways. But some of it's coming from pharmaceutical drugs,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 19.",
      "Kennedy has insisted that is not \"anti-vaccine\" and would not seek to ban them under Trump, instead saying he wants to \"restore the transparency\" around them \u2014 echoing lawsuits by the group he chaired, Children's Health Defense, over its Freedom of Information Act requests.",
      "\"[Trump] doesn't want me to take vaccines away from people. If you want to take a vaccine, you ought to be able to take it. We believe in free choice in this country. You ought to know the risks and benefits of everything you take,\" Kennedy said on Nov. 2.",
      "But Kennedy has also asserted \"there's no vaccine that is safe and effective,\" and encouraged people to \"resist\" CDC guidelines on vaccines for kids \u2014 raising concern among public health officials, who point to the success of vaccination in saving millions of children worldwide from debilitating illness or premature death from preventable diseases.",
      "Opposing water fluoridation",
      "Ahead of the election, Kennedy said one of Trump's first acts in the White House would be to \"advise all U.S. water systems to remove fluoride from public water.\"",
      "While a number of health risks have been tied to higher levels of fluoride, most are extremely rare in the U.S. and involve far greater exposure than what is added to drinking water.",
      "Fluoride has been incorporated into a majority of U.S. water systems for decades. The American Dental Association estimates that the practice has reduced tooth decay by about 25%, though some research suggests modern use of toothpaste with fluoride has reduced the policy's benefits.",
      "Kennedy's announcement does come as the Environmental Protection Agency is now under a federal court order to take action over one specific risk: the concern that fluoride might lower children's IQ \"at dosages that are far too close to fluoride levels in the drinking water of the United States,\" stemming in large part from a report published by the National Institutes of Health.",
      "Beyond influencing what rule the Trump administration's EPA ends up pursuing in response to the order, Kennedy could also take aim at fluoride through another route: changing the CDC's widely-cited statement about the practice, which hails water fluoridation as one of the greatest \"public health achievements of the 20th century.\"",
      "Kennedy himself has described fluoride as \"a poison\" and praised the nonprofits for suing over the issue.",
      "\"The simple answer is I don't like it,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 30.",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 17:30:46 -0500",
    "summary": "Allowing enhanced subsidies for health insurance bought through ACA marketplaces to expire would cause premiums to soar, experts warn.",
    "story": [
      "With Republicans edging closer to gaining control of Congress, millions of Americans may be at risk of losing enhanced subsidies that currently underwrite the cost of health insurance bought through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces, according to industry experts and the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The November 5 election gave control of the Senate to Republicans, while control of the House remains in limbo Monday as votes in several critical races continue to be tallied. Currently, Democrats are projected to win at least 210 House seats and Republicans 215 seats, with a party needing 218 seats in order to have the majority.",
      "If Republicans gain control of Congress, they are widely expected to allow the enhanced ACA subsidies to expire at the end of 2025, depriving many people who buy coverage through the ACA and who currently receive these subsidies of that financial assistance, according to health care policy experts.",
      "So-called enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, which lower the cost of health plans for millions of Americans and were passed under the Biden administration, will expire unless lawmakers renew them. During his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump backed efforts by Republican lawmakers to repeal the ACA, but hasn't yet revealed his plans for the program, commonly known as Obamacare, for his second term in office.",
      "Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said at a campaign stop last week just before the Nov. 5 election that \"the ACA is so deeply ingrained, we need massive reform to make this work, and we've got a lot of ideas on how to do that.\"",
      "Who is eligible for enhanced ACA subsidies?",
      "Americans with incomes over 400% of poverty \u2014 those who make just above four times the poverty level, or $103,280 for a family of four \u2014 are eligible for the enhanced ACA insurance subsidies. They also increase financial help for those who were already eligible for assistance under the ACA.",
      "KFF, an independent health policy nonprofit, estimates\u00a0the subsidies have cut premiums for eligible enrollees by 44%, or $705 annually. The organization says that if the tax credit expires, average premiums for subsidized enrollees in 12 states would at least double.",
      "In 2024, of the 21.6 million Americans who purchased health insurance plans from ACA marketplaces, 20.1 million received enhanced subsidies,\u00a0according\u00a0to the CBO.",
      "People most at risk of losing ACA coverage if the enhanced subsidies lapse are those who live in states where health insurance premiums are particularly high, including in rural parts of the U.S. Middle-income households that depend on the enhanced subsidies could see a sharp rise in premiums, Cynthia Cox, vice president and ACA policy researcher at KFF, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"They could go from paying no more than 8.5% of their income to easily paying 20% or more,\" she said. \"I imagine a lot of those folks would drop coverage.\"",
      "Without enhances subsidies, many middle income ACA Marketplace enrollees with incomes just above four times poverty would be priced out of health insurance coverage, according to Cox.",
      "Subsidies remain for 2025",
      "Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at\u00a0healthinsurance.org, noted that 93% of people who buy health insurance through ACA marketplaces receive enhanced subsidies. A sharp increase in their premiums would lead many to drop their coverage, leaving them uninsured, she said.",
      "The CBO\u00a0estimates\u00a0that 22.8 million total Americans will enroll in ACA marketplace health insurance plans in 2025. The agency expects enrollment to drop sharply, from 22.8 million to 18.9 million, in 2026 if the subsidies are not renewed. By 2030, enrollment could dip to 15.4 million people without the enhanced subsidies.",
      "For now, the subsidy enhancements will remain in place through the end of 2025.",
      "\"If people are signing up now during open enrollment, their coverage will take effect in January, and it will cover them for the whole year. Their premiums won't change \u2014 they're good for 2025,\" Norris said.",
      "The enhanced subsidies, which were first passed in 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, will have been in place for roughly five years when they expire in 2025, or about half as long as the ACA marketplace has existed, Cox said.",
      "Enrollment in ACA plans has roughly doubled since the enhance subsidies have been in place, she noted, with most of that growth coming from low-income enrollees. \"That's one group you might expect to see, if they have to start making a higher premium payments, would drop their coverage,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Idit Negrin would try anything to beat the trauma haunting her since attending the Nova Music Festival on October 7th, when Hamas massacred hundreds of civilians. \"We saw the terrorists, and they started shooting at us,\" she said. She ran for her life.",
      "Afterwards, \"I woke up every night, every night around 3 o'clock screaming and sweating and shaking. I think after a day, or two days after, I felt that I'm falling down, crying.\"",
      "We met her this summer as she was two-thirds of the way through her 60-session course of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). It's a treatment long used to combat compression sickness in divers, and wounds that will not heal. But at the Sagol Center for Hyperbaric Medicine and Research, in Be'er Ya'akov, Israel, they're now also treating a very different malady: post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.",
      "Negrin described her experiences with PTSD: \"You feel like you're going crazy. I call people and scream, 'There is a terror attack again!' And then you understand that you have no control of your brain.\"",
      "Negrin is trying to regain that control, along with about 650 other October 7th survivors suffering from PTSD who are being treated, for free, alongside military veterans at the Sagol Center \u2013 currently the largest hyperbaric center worldwide.",
      "Dr. Shai Efrati runs this clinic, where they're treating up to 350 patients a day, and are on the forefront of this sort of medicine. \"What we are doing is actually tricking the body,\" Efrati said. \"Hypoxia, lack of oxygen, is the most powerful trigger to induce all the repair mechanism cascade.\"",
      "Efrati says they're inducing repair mechanisms in the body and brain inside these pressurized chambers, where it feels like you're scuba diving down to 30 feet. Patients breathe in pure oxygen, which under such high-pressure conditions the body can absorb at up to 16 times the normal level. Then, masks are removed for five-minute intervals.",
      "Efrati said, \"The decline from very high back to the normal is being interpreted at the similar level as hypoxia, as lack of oxygen. That causes the body to trigger the stem cells, and for the first time even in humans, we can see generation of new neurons, generation of new blood vessels in the brain. And this is mind-blowing.\"",
      "The treatment has been described as \"unapproved\" and \"not proven.\" \"When we speak about hyperbaric oxygen therapy, this is how it should look like,\" Efrati said.",
      "\"You're saying there are a lot of frauds out there?\" asked Doane.",
      "\"Indeed. And this is not only not good, it can be even dangerous.\"",
      "Dr. Efrati is constantly experimenting with new ways to use this treatment. At his clinic near Tel Aviv, we got to see how they're catering hyperbaric medicine to athletes (\"If we can shorten the recovery period, you can push harder doing the exercises\"), and helping patients with brain injuries regain movement through the growth of new neurons and blood vessels in the brain.",
      "\"It's not that we are fixing his running,\" Efrati said about one athlete's performance. \"We are fixing the brain.\"",
      "They've published several studies, looking at PTSD in veterans. One, out today, found that 68% of patients showed significant improvement. Another reported that PTSD remission lasted at least two years, which is higher than other established treatments. \"We want to evaluate everything objectively,\" said Efrati.",
      "It's conclusive enough for the Israel Defense Forces, or IDF, to ask Efrati's team to stop testing and start treating. The doctor says that while you can always ask for more data, \"You see the evidence in front of you.\"",
      "Shachar Mizrhai was one of those IDF veterans referred in 2018 for the initial clinical trial. He was a soldier during a 2014 Israeli offensive in Gaza and was in an armored vehicle when it was ambushed. In the short term, he was thinking about survival; the suffering came later. \"I can't sleep at night,\" he said. \"In the moment I put [on] the uniform, I feel like I want to die. I smell blood. I smell war.\"",
      "He'd tried drugs, therapy and sleeping pills. He contemplated suicide. \"Nothing really helped to get back to life,\" he said. \"And I heard that this might be help, and maybe this is my last chance before I finish my life.\"",
      "Dr. Keren Doenyas-Barak, who heads the PTSD program at the Sagol Center, followed Mizrhai through his 60 sessions, and showed us his brain scans from June 2018, and March 2019, highlighting activation of areas used to effectively regulate emotion, or process information. The later brain scan images were lighting up; that wasn't happening before the treatment.",
      "\"Many people tend to look at PTSD as a psychological phenomenon, not as a biological phenomenon,\" Doenyas-Barak said. \"So, we treat PTSD very similar to other brain conditions.\"",
      "For Mizrhai, the treatment changed everything:\" \"It's the first time that I was feeling again. I begin to sleep at night, I was less afraid. It's make me feel alive again. \u2026 I was a dying man, and after this, I'm a living man.\"",
      "North Carolina Republican Congressman and medical doctor Greg Murphy said, \"If it's being offered in Israel and they're getting such good results, why the hell are we not offering it in the United States?\"",
      "That's a question Murphy \u2013 a member of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs \u2013 is raising in the halls of Congress. One in 10 of his constituents is a veteran. \"I love our VA,\" he said. \"But we're not reaching a certain segment of our veterans if we're having 22 commit suicide every day. And if we're doing something and there is a treatment that has shown definitive results, I believe it's medical malpractice not to offer that to our veterans.\"",
      "In 2023 he introduced the Veterans' National Traumatic Injury Treatment Act. \"We just basically want the VA to do a pilot study within their own confines to see whether they show that hyperbaric oxygen works or not,\" he said.",
      "And what is he hearing from the VA? \"They just don't want to do anything; it's just hands up,\" he said. \"The reasons that we've heard is, 'Well, the results are mixed.' Fine. Look at the results in the last 15 years. Look at the studies in Israel. We are seeing an absolute effect in this, and other disorders, for Parkinson's, migraines, some even MS, neurological disorders.\"",
      "\"Sunday Morning\" requested an interview with the Department of Veterans Affairs, but they declined to comment.",
      "In Salt Lake City, Utah, we met Dr. Lin Weaver, who runs Hyperbaric Medicine at Intermountain Health. They treat about 20 patients a day, which puts into perspective the huge numbers - 350 daily \u2013 being treated in Israel. \u00a0He says they use their hyperbaric chambers for PTSD patients rarely, because it is expensive, but he has seen positive results: \"I've had patients that I've treated. Every one has got surprisingly better,\" Weaver said.",
      "But insurance companies say there is not enough proof it works for PTSD. And in the U.S., out-of-pocket costs soar above $50,000.",
      "\"What's necessary is like a drug trial,\" Weaver said. \"But these trials take years to accomplish. It all rests with, 'Is there an initiative? And is there a funding source?'\"",
      "Doane asked, \"But if doctors like you feel so strongly that this works, why isn't there enough push coming from folks like you to say, 'Prove this'?\"",
      "\"Well, believe me, we've tried,\" Weaver replied. \"I have submitted proposals to extramural funding agencies. So far, they haven't accepted them.\"",
      "Doane asked Dr. Efrati, \"You are out on the frontier here of medicine. Is there a danger in that?\"",
      "\"As a scientist, I will always tell you I need more study, I need more data,\" he replied. \"But as a physician, when I'm sitting in front of you looking at your eyes, you have a problem now. This is our job as a physician.\"",
      "Idit Negrin says this treatment is giving her hope she can move past that nightmare at the Nova Music Festival. She hopes, with the therapy, she can move on with her life.",
      "But she wears a reminder \u2013 a Nova necklace \u2013 while she gets treatment. \"I don't get her off my neck,\" she said.",
      "Her progress is motivation for Dr. Efrati to keep innovating, thinking about the future so his patients can process the past.",
      "Doane said, \"Some people are gonna listen to this and say it sounds too good to be true.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 22:06:12 -0500",
    "summary": "Republicans' newly won control of the Senate may have buoyed Kennedy's odds of a role in the Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is now on a short list being floated by some Trump allies to serve as the next head of the Department of Health and Human Services, multiple people close to the president-elect's campaign say.",
      "Hopes among Kennedy's backers that he could be nominated to lead the department have risen in recent days, after Republicans cemented their majority in the Senate.",
      "Kennedy's odds of clearing a Senate led by Democrats would have been low, given his long record of what the party called \"anti-science, fringe public health stances\" that outraged Trump's opponents and a broad array of health experts during the campaign.",
      "That includes\u00a0a comment\u00a0that \"there's no vaccine that is safe and effective\" and his chairmanship of the group Children's Health Defense, which has claimed that the \"parallel between rising disease rates and the increasing number of childhood vaccines is hard to ignore.\" Doctors argue statements like these mislead about the safety of immunizations and threaten to erode hard-fought improvements in U.S. vaccination rates against preventable diseases.",
      "Kennedy himself has been noncommittal when asked publicly about the possibility he could be picked to head the sprawling HHS umbrella of agencies, which includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institutes of Health, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "Ahead of the election, Kennedy told Fox News he was \"confident that if I wanted to do HHS secretary, the president would fight like hell to make that happen,\" but also said that he was unsure if that would be \"the most effective\" role for him.",
      "In a CNN interview last month, Trump transition co-chair Howard Lutnick, was asked whether Kennedy would be in charge of HHS.",
      "\"Of course not,\" he replied.",
      "But two people close to the campaign say the election results have played a big role in changing the thinking on whether Kennedy could clear a steep and often painful Senate confirmation process that can bog down nominees.",
      "Kennedy's supporters argue that the election offers a mandate not just for Trump's platform overall but for Kennedy and his \"Make America Healthy Again\" proposals to combat chronic disease, citing the votes Kennedy may have delivered in Trump's favor.",
      "As one example, podcast host Joe Rogan initially voiced support for Kennedy and his ideas before later endorsing Trump.",
      "\"We have not yet decided exactly what that strategy is going to be, but that is a possibility,\" Kennedy told NPR in an interview after the election, asked if he would be named to a Senate-confirmed position.",
      "As to the question of whether Kennedy is now in serious contention for the HHS secretary role, Trump-Vance transition spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that Americans reelected Trump \"by resounding margins because they trust his judgement and support his policies, including his promise to Make America Healthy Again alongside well-respected leaders like RFK Jr.\"",
      "Other potential HHS secretary picks",
      "However, Kennedy is not the only name that has been floated by Republicans for the top job at HHS.",
      "Florida Governor Ron DeSantis suggested Wednesday his top health official, state surgeon general Dr. Joseph Ladapo, could be a candidate. Under Ladapo, the state's health department has warned some against getting COVID-19 booster shots, citing claims that federal health authorities and outside experts criticized as unproven or misleading.",
      "Other names floated by Trump allies in Washington include former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former deputy HHS secretary Eric Hargan, who supporters think could be effective because he knows how to navigate the department's bureaucracy.",
      "But people close to the campaign say few Trump surrogates and supporters have spent as much time with the president-elect as Kennedy or plotted as ambitious an agenda.",
      "The two spent hours flying together in the final stretch of the campaign. Kennedy was also in Florida after the election, huddling with the president-elect's top ranks to weigh potential candidates to fill the administration.",
      "\"He's going to help make America healthy again. And he's a great guy and he really means it. He wants to do some things, and we're going to let him go to it,\" Trump said on Wednesday morning after the election.",
      "Trump has previously said he's been friends with Kennedy \"for a long time\" and would let him \"go wild\" on many of his policy priorities, except for curbing fossil fuels.",
      "\"I'm going to let him go wild on health. I'm going to let him go wild on the food. I'm going to let him go wild on medicines. The only thing I don't think I'm going to let him even get near is the liquid gold that we have under our feet,\" Trump said in New York on Oct. 27.",
      "Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" platform",
      "Kennedy's nomination would come at a key time for many of the issues he campaigned on, which he says underpin \"the chronic-disease crisis.\"",
      "Kennedy has accused the FDA of \"aggressive suppression\" of a range of products, including psychedelics \u2014 after MDMA failed to earn the agency's approval earlier this year \u2014 and raw milk, which officials have discouraged amid the ongoing bird flu outbreak on dairy farms.",
      "Other proposals include restricting pharmaceutical advertising and rewriting the laws that currently rely on drugmakers paying fees to fund most FDA approvals. Ahead of the election, he warned FDA officials who \"are part of this corrupt system\" to \"pack your bags.\"",
      "In the days ahead of the election, Kennedy said Trump had asked him to \"root out the corruption and the conflicts of interests\" in agencies that oversee drugs and vaccines, pledging to \"restore transparency\" and stop \"hiding science.\"",
      "\"He doesn't want me to take vaccines away from people. If you want to take a vaccine, you ought to be able to take it. We believe in free choice in this country,\" Kennedy said in remarks posted on Nov. 2.",
      "His call for stopping water fluoridation comes as the Environmental Protection Agency is now facing a court order to take action against the practice.",
      "That ruling was driven in part by a review released by the NIH earlier this year, examining the risk it might lower children's IQ, and comes as critics have called on the CDC to revise its statement backing fluoridation. The NIH review found that concentrations of fluoride in drinking water higher than recommended levels were associated with lower IQ in children, but more studies were needed on the effect of lower concentrations of fluoride.",
      "But were he to end up HHS secretary, some of Kennedy's aims would fall outside of his jurisdiction, like the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Other responsibilities under the broad HHS umbrella could consume much of Kennedy's time, some allies worry, distracting from his priorities.",
      "\"Bobby is very action-oriented, brilliant, an excellent communicator, has a great grasp of details, and is a transformational leader. He is not, his skillset is not, as a bureaucrat administrator,\" said Dr. Robert Malone, a longtime Kennedy ally who was with him and Trump on election night.",
      "Malone said he had spoken with many of the aides from some of the \"at least four different HHS transition teams\" under Trump, but not personally with Kennedy, in recent weeks about the future of the department.",
      "He said he thought Kennedy would likely do better in a role at the White House, serving as a czar who could target specific issues across different departments.",
      "\"Make no mistake, what is being discussed is a major reimagining of the entire federal health research and promotion and protection infrastructure. That includes very significant reforms and changes in business practice,\" said Malone.",

    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 10:48:03 -0500",
    "summary": "Could the tariffs Trump's threatened to slap on Chinese imports backfire and help Beijing? Some experts say they will.",
    "story": [
      "Hong Kong \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to slap up a tariff of up to 60% on all goods imported to the U.S. from China. While that may sound like a potent economic threat to a country where economic growth is already faltering, could it actually be just what China needs?",
      "\"I do expect U.S.-China economic relations to be more volatile under Trump, but I think overall, this may turn out to be better for China,\" Chen Zhiwu, the top finance professor at the University of Hong Kong and a former professor at Yale University, told CBS News.",
      "Chen said if Trump does follow through with his threat of such steep tariffs on China, it \"might force the leadership in Beijing to have no other choice but to focus on the economy \u2014 especially given that the Chinese economy right now is in very big trouble.\"",
      "Since the start of Trump's first term in the White House, and through President Biden's term, China's economic growth has slowed from roughly 7% to 4.5%. The country's property market has crashed because of massive overbuilding, leading to the rise of empty ghost cities. Youth unemployment rocketed to a new high of nearly 19% in September, dimming prospects for China's future workforce.",
      "Beijing's intense focus over the past decade on bolstering its military to meet its geopolitical ambition of rivaling the U.S. and its European and Asia-Pacific allies has further sacrificed opportunities for domestic economic growth, said Chen.",
      "\"If you count the number of warships, China has by far the highest number of warships than any country, higher than even the U.S.' naval ships. What industries have grown the most so far this year? Definitely those warfare-related industries have gone up the most, but those consumer-oriented industries have had no growth or negative growth,\" he said.",
      "Most of China's top 20 aerospace and defense stocks have recorded double-digit growth over the past year alone.",
      "Tariffs \"a good thing for China for the long term\"?",
      "\"The pressure the U.S. is putting on China will become a good thing for China for the long term,\" agreed Wang Xiangwei, a former editor-in-chief of the Hong Kong-based newspaper South China Morning Post.",
      "China has relied on two primary engines to support rapid economic growth over the past 40 years, since former leader Deng Xiaoping initiated reforms and started opening the country up, Wang told CBS News. Those have been manufacturing cheap exports for the world by leveraging China's long-cheap labor force, and later, spending billions on domestic infrastructure including roads, rail and airports.",
      "But labor has become more expensive with the rise of China's booming middle class, and the government is running out of new things to build across the country.",

      "Trump's threatened tariffs could give a needed external push for that to change, said Wang.",
      "\"I believe China's going to suffer in the short term. In the long term, he's [Trump] going to help China to make that painful transition,\" Wang said, noting that in the U.S., domestic consumption accounts for 70% to 80% of the national GDP, while in China, it's \"only about 60%.\"",
      "In effect, pushing China's own people to buy more of their country's own goods and services could, in the view of the two analysts, prove to be Beijing's best protection against Trump's threatened tariffs.",
      "\"The best tool would be to stimulate consumption growth inside China,\" said Chen. \"At the moment, the leadership has not really tried to help the Chinese consumers by sending them government checks and even tax costs to corporations. I think if the Chinese government really moves in that direction more aggressively, then it would help the Chinese economy generate more internal domestic consumption demand to make up for some of their possible lost exports to the U.S.\"",
      "Beijing needs Washington, but tariffs could have a complex impact",
      "During Trump's first term as president, he imposed tariffs ranging from 10% to 25% on Chinese agricultural products imported to the U.S., including seafood, pork and dairy. Beijing retaliated with its own tariffs, kicking off a trade war between the world's two biggest economies.",
      "Nearly eight years later, however, Beijing appears less able to wage such a war, due to its close economic links with the U.S.",
      "\"In terms of retaliation choices for China, it's very limited,\" said Chen. \"China imports a lot of agricultural products like soybeans, corn. They may try to import more such agricultural products from Brazil, and also from Russia as one of their ways to retaliate against the U.S. But at the end of the day, China imports so much [computer] chips from Nvidia, Intel, especially Qualcomm,\" Wang said. \"Those products are what China needs. So, China cannot produce internally.\"",
      "In effect, if Beijing does impose retaliatory tariffs, it could be shooting itself in the proverbial foot. Tariffs would make all those products, vital to China's continued economic and technological development, more expensive for its own people.",
      "But another possible impact of Trump's expected protectionist policies could actually be to push some of America's oldest allies and trade partners closer to China, reversing the so-called decoupling of the U.S. and Western European economies from Beijing that Washington has pushed under Mr. Biden.",
      "5 ways Trump's next presidency could affect the U.S. economy and your money",
      "5 ways Trump's next presidency could affect the U.S. economy and your money",
      "\"The Biden administration did such a good job to more or less unite that,\" said Chen. \"If Trump makes the EU and NATO member countries upset, that makes it more possible for Germany, for France or Italy or even the U.K. to warm up more with China on the trade front. So, that may help neutralize, to some extent, the negative impact of the expected Trump tariffs on Chinese goods.\"",
      "Trump has claimed repeatedly that foreign companies would foot the bill, effectively absorbing the additional costs of exporting to the U.S. market imposed by his tariffs, but many economists disagree, and say it would effectively be a tax on American consumers.",
      "According to findings released by the National Retail Federation last week, U.S. consumers could lose between $46 billion and $78 billion in spending power per year on everything from clothes and toys to household appliances and travel goods if there is a 60% blanket tariff on Chinese goods.",
      "\"Retailers rely heavily on imported products and manufacturing components so that they can offer their customers a variety of products at affordable prices,\" NRF Vice President of Supply Chain and Customs Policy Jonathan Gold said. \"A tariff is a tax paid by the U.S. importer, not a foreign country or the exporter. This tax ultimately comes out of consumers' pockets through higher prices.\"",
      "All of that said, and despite Trump's history of anti-China rhetoric, it remains unclear how quickly his administration might actually move to roll out sweeping tariffs, with some economists speculating that the president-elect plans, initially at least, to use the threat of additional levies as a cudgel to negotiate more favorable trade terms with Beijing. Trump could also choose to gradually phase in tariffs, delaying their full impact on China's economy.",
      "Will China attack Taiwan, and would Trump come to the rescue?",
      "Trump's return to the White House may also help Beijing further its interests with Taiwan, the democratically governed island of 23 million people just off China's east coast that the country considers a renegade province. President Xi Jinping has vowed to bring Taiwan back under Beijing's control, by force if necessary.",
      "Since the U.S. government enacted the Taiwan Relations Act in 1979, the U.S. is strategically committed to aid in Taiwan's defense in the event of any aggression, including by selling weapons to the island's government.",
      "Open to interpretation, however, and left deliberately vague in the U.S. law, is whether Washington is obligated to directly defend Taiwan, using the power of the American military, if it does come under attack.",
      "President Biden, during his first term, said Washington would, breaking with the long-time policy of \"strategic ambiguity\" that the Biden White House later returned to.",
      "\"The sovereignty over Taiwan is the red line of all the red lines,\" Wang told CBS News. \"Trump, in his presidential campaign speeches, he made it very clear\u2026 [that he's] unlikely to send troops to defend Taiwan.\"",
      "\"I believe that China's not going to invade Taiwan anytime soon,\" Wang added, noting that Beijing has \"so many problems it'll have to fix at home.\"",
      "If Beijing did invade Taiwan, the fallout would be felt worldwide.",
      "\"That would be a devastating hit to the global economy,\" said Chen. \"I hope that it would not happen. So, maybe now, given the challenges with the Chinese economy, the leadership is realizing that without a stable economy, then all its global geopolitical ambitions would not have any economic foundation.\"",

      "The November 5 election gave control of the Senate to Republicans, while control of the House remains in limbo Monday as votes in several critical races continue to be tallied. Currently, Democrats are projected to win at least 210 House seats and Republicans 215 seats, with a party needing 218 seats in order to have the majority.",
      "If Republicans gain control of Congress, they are widely expected to allow the enhanced ACA subsidies to expire at the end of 2025, depriving many people who buy coverage through the ACA and who currently receive these subsidies of that financial assistance, according to health care policy experts.",
      "So-called enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, which lower the cost of health plans for millions of Americans and were passed under the Biden administration, will expire unless lawmakers renew them. During his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump backed efforts by Republican lawmakers to repeal the ACA, but hasn't yet revealed his plans for the program, commonly known as Obamacare, for his second term in office.",
      "Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said at a campaign stop last week just before the Nov. 5 election that \"the ACA is so deeply ingrained, we need massive reform to make this work, and we've got a lot of ideas on how to do that.\"",

      "Americans with incomes over 400% of poverty \u2014 those who make just above four times the poverty level, or $103,280 for a family of four \u2014 are eligible for the enhanced ACA insurance subsidies. They also increase financial help for those who were already eligible for assistance under the ACA.",
      "KFF, an independent health policy nonprofit, estimates\u00a0the subsidies have cut premiums for eligible enrollees by 44%, or $705 annually. The organization says that if the tax credit expires, average premiums for subsidized enrollees in 12 states would at least double.",

      "People most at risk of losing ACA coverage if the enhanced subsidies lapse are those who live in states where health insurance premiums are particularly high, including in rural parts of the U.S. Middle-income households that depend on the enhanced subsidies could see a sharp rise in premiums, Cynthia Cox, vice president and ACA policy researcher at KFF, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"They could go from paying no more than 8.5% of their income to easily paying 20% or more,\" she said. \"I imagine a lot of those folks would drop coverage.\"",
      "Without enhances subsidies, many middle income ACA Marketplace enrollees with incomes just above four times poverty would be priced out of health insurance coverage, according to Cox.",
      "Subsidies remain for 2025",
      "Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at\u00a0healthinsurance.org, noted that 93% of people who buy health insurance through ACA marketplaces receive enhanced subsidies. A sharp increase in their premiums would lead many to drop their coverage, leaving them uninsured, she said.",
      "The CBO\u00a0estimates\u00a0that 22.8 million total Americans will enroll in ACA marketplace health insurance plans in 2025. The agency expects enrollment to drop sharply, from 22.8 million to 18.9 million, in 2026 if the subsidies are not renewed. By 2030, enrollment could dip to 15.4 million people without the enhanced subsidies.",
      "For now, the subsidy enhancements will remain in place through the end of 2025.",
      "\"If people are signing up now during open enrollment, their coverage will take effect in January, and it will cover them for the whole year. Their premiums won't change \u2014 they're good for 2025,\" Norris said.",
      "The enhanced subsidies, which were first passed in 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, will have been in place for roughly five years when they expire in 2025, or about half as long as the ACA marketplace has existed, Cox said.",
      "Enrollment in ACA plans has roughly doubled since the enhance subsidies have been in place, she noted, with most of that growth coming from low-income enrollees. \"That's one group you might expect to see, if they have to start making a higher premium payments, would drop their coverage,\" she said.",
      "Making the enhanced subsidies permanent would cost $335 billion over 10 years,\u00a0according to\u00a0the CBO.",

    "title": "Here's what to know about House bill to expand Social Security benefits",
    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 16:07:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Measure that would repeal so-called \"government pensions offset\" has been gaining support in House.",
    "story": [
      "The House is expected to try to pass a Social Security-related bill this week to ensure benefits for workers who are also eligible for other pensions, despite a surprise move by hard-right Freedom Caucus leaders to derail the effort.",
      "It's a quick turnaround to salvage what had been a bipartisan effort to pass the bill, called the\u00a0Social Security Fairness Act, during what's now the lame-duck post-election period of the Congress.",
      "What is the Social Security Fairness Act?",
      "The Social Security Fairness Act would repeal the so-called \"government pensions offset,\" or GPO, which reduces Social Security spousal or widow(er) benefits for those who receive noncovered pensions, according to the Social Security Administration's\u00a0website.",
      "The summary also says the bill also eliminates the so-called \"windfall elimination provision\" that \"in some instances reduces Social Security benefits for individuals who also receive a pension or disability benefit from an employer that did not withhold Social Security taxes.\"",
      "Such pensions are paid by employers \u2014 typically, state and local governments or non-U.S. employers \u2014 that do not withhold Social Security taxes from employee salaries.",
      "\"The GPO reduces the spousal or widow(er) benefit by two-thirds of the monthly non-covered pension and can partially, or fully, offset an individual's spousal/widow(er) benefit, depending on the amount of the non-covered pension,\" according to SSA.gov.",
      "The bill would repeal the GPO provision and reinstate full Social Security benefits.",
      "For instance, under the GPO, an individual with a $900 spousal benefit from Social Security, who also has a $1,000 non-covered pension, would see their Social Security benefit reduced by $667, or two-thirds the non-covered pension amount. That leaves them with a $233 remaining spousal benefit.",
      "If the GPO measure is repealed, the same individual would be entitled to the entire $900 spousal benefit amount without an offset reduction.",
      "Does the bill have bipartisan support?",
      "Yes, the bill was introduced by a Republican, Rep. Garrett Graves of Louisiana, and a Democrat, Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, and it has gained support in the House. A robust 300 lawmakers, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, have signed on to it.",
      "Other groups have also supported the bill, such as the National Association of Counties, which represents county governments. That group says that eliminating the GPO would help county governments recruit workers at a time when many are facing labor shortages.",
      "What happened next to the bill?",
      "To force the legislation forward, the sponsors of the bill, Rep. Graves and Rep. Spanberger, this fall used a rarely successful process called a discharge petition.",
      "They collected the minimum 218 signatures needed from House lawmakers to dislodge the bill from committee and send it to the floor for a vote.",
      "The move is often seen as an affront to House leaders, particularly the House speaker and the majority leader who determine the floor schedule.",
      "But Spanberger and Graves \u2014 who both did not seek reelection \u2014 had little to lose. Besides, Johnson backed the bill before becoming speaker.",
      "Did the House Freedom Caucus block the Social Security bill?",
      "Two leaders of the conservative House Freedom Caucus intervened when the rest of Congress was away from Capitol Hill, mostly in home states for Election Day.",
      "The Freedom Caucus chairman Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., and former chair Rep. Bob Goode, R-Va., used a routine pro forma session of the House on Nov.\u00a05 to swiftly table part of the measure.",
      "The Freedom Caucus tends to block new spending. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the bill would add some $196 billion to the federal deficit over a decade.",
      "Graves said that's the amount people are missing out on without reinstating full Social Security benefits.",
      "But in tabling the legislation the conservatives actually set back its procedural rule, but not the bill itself.",
      "The legislation is expected to move forward with a House vote anyway, possibly in the week ahead.",
      "Could the Social Security Fairness Act still pass?",
      "Yes, but that said, passage will now be tougher, requiring a supermajority threshold rather than a simple majority as had been planned under the rule that the Freedom Caucus leaders turned back.",
      "If it passes the House, it's unclear if the bill has enough support to clear the Senate. But the wide margin in the House indicates potentially broad support.",
      "It would then go to President Joe Biden's desk. If signed into law, the summary says the changes are effective for benefits payable after December 2023.",

    "summary": "Medicare's Part B monthly premium is outpacing both inflation and Social Security's cost-of-living adjustment.",
    "story": [
      "America's seniors will pay more for their health care in the new year, as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has announced that premiums for its Part B plan will increase by about 6% in 2025.",
      "Part B covers visits to doctors, outpatient care, preventative services such as vaccines, medical equipment like wheelchairs as well as home health care. (Part A, which covers inpatient care in hospitals and other facilities, is premium-free for all but about 1% of beneficiaries due to taxes paid by most retirees while they worked.)",
      "What is the Medicare Part B premium for 2025?",
      "The standard monthly premium for Medicare Part B enrollees will climb by $10.30, or about 6%, to $185.00 from $174.70 in 2024, CMS said\u00a0Friday.",
      "Meanwhile, the annual deductible for all Medicare Part B beneficiaries will rise to $257 in 2025 from $240.",
      "The reason for the 2025 premium and deductible increases is due to \"projected price changes and assumed utilization increases that are consistent with historical experience,\" according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.",
      "The premium stood at $164.90 in 2023, when the cost fell just over $5 from the year before, a rare decline.",
      "How does that compare with the Social Security COLA?",
      "Medicare's Part B premiums have generally outrun inflation as well as Social Security's annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA).",
      "Yearly inflation climbed 2.4% in September, while the Social Security COLA for next year will be 2.5%, or an average of $50 more per household.",
      "What do higher-income Medicare enrollees pay?",
      "Given that a beneficiary's Part B monthly premium is based on one's income, wealthier Americans also pay an Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amount, or IRMAA, which impacts about 8% of those with Medicare Part B, CMS stated.",
      "Those who are married and lived with their spouses at any time during the year, but who file separate tax returns with modified adjusted gross income of $106,000 or less, will pay just the Medicare Part B premium of $185.00 a month.\u00a0Beneficiaries with incomes above $106,000 but below $394,000 are looking at paying IRMAA of $406.90 plus the standard $185.00, or $591.90 a month.\u00a0Seniors with incomes in excess of $394,000 will pay $443.90 in IRMAA and the standard $185.00, or a total of $628.90 a month.",

      "Medicare enrollees who are already getting Social Security benefits can expect the new 2025 Part B premium to be automatically deducted from their Social Security checks in January.",

    "summary": "Donald Trump reiterated he doesn't intend to sell his stock in Trump Media, and called for an investigation into short sellers.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump took to Truth Social on Friday to reiterate that he doesn't plan to sell shares of Trump Media & Technology Group. He also called for an investigation from \"the appropriate authorities\" into \"market manipulators or short sellers,\" whom executives at the company and shareholders have previously blamed for volatility in the stock, which trades under the ticker symbol DJT.",
      "DJT shares jumped shortly after Trump's post, gaining as much as 16% on Friday. The stock rose $3.15, or 11.4%, to $30.84 in early afternoon trading, partly reversing a 23% plunge on Thursday that had trimmed some of the company's gains in the run-up to the November 5 election.",
      "Trump, who is the biggest shareholder of Trump Media with a 57% stake, said the business has been the target of \"probably illegal rumors and/or statements\" that he said allege he plans to sell shares of the company, which owns the Truth Social platform. In September, Trump had vowed not to sell his stake after a lock-up period expired for Trump Media insiders, allowing them to sell for the first time since the stock went public in March.",
      "Trump Media, whose DJT ticker is the same as Trump's initials, has seen extreme volatility on Nasdaq, with its shares swinging wildly on news related to the president-elect. That has prompted comparisons of DJT with meme stocks, or companies that trade on social media buzz rather than financial fundamentals such as revenue and profit growth.",
      "Trump's call for an investigation into trading of the stock highlight potential conflicts of interest between his role as the nation's chief executive and his business interests, with his holdings in the company valued at $3.6 billion as of Friday afternoon. As president, Trump will not only have oversight of many federal agencies, but will also appoint the head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the agency that regulates the securities industry.",
      "Although there's no requirement that presidents sell their financial assets when they take office, most U.S. presidents have opted to put their business holdings into a blind trust,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan law and policy institute. A blind trust is managed by an independent trustee, and the president or other official who created the trust isn't allowed to advise or consult with the trustee on business decisions.",
      "During Trump's first term as president, he chose not to place his company, the Trump Organization, into a blind trust, opting instead to\u00a0hand over management\u00a0of the company to his oldest two sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, along with its longtime chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg. (Weisselberg was\u00a0released from jail\u00a0in July after pleading guilty to giving false testimony about the size of Trump's triplex apartment as part of a civil fraud trial.)",
      "Trump's arrangement during his first administration was flagged by some ethics experts as problematic, with former chief White House ethics lawyer Norm Eisen\u00a0writing\u00a0in 2017 that it failed to resolve the conflicts of interest between Trump's business holdings and his role as president.",
      "Trump Media stock price chart",
      "Trump Media has attracted short sellers, or investors who seek to make a profit when a stock tumbles. That drew\u00a0accusations\u00a0from Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes, a former Republican congressman, that these investors have manipulated the stock. Nunes has requested investigations by lawmakers and the Nasdaq stock market, where DJT is listed.",
      "Because of Trump's majority ownership of DJT stock, the stock would likely drop if he sold his shares \"for any reason,\" noted S3 Partners in a November 6 research note.",
      "In his post on Truth Social Friday, Trump said he believes in Trump Media, and refuted claims that he is interested in selling shares.",

    "summary": "The largest private prison companies in the U.S. stand to benefit from Trump's vow to increase deportations.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration could be a boon for business for private prison companies in the U.S. if the president-elect delivers on his promise to crack down on illegal immigration.",
      "CoreCivic and Geo Group, the two biggest private prison operators in the U.S., both contract with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to house detained, undocumented migrants. Their stocks soared Wednesday following Trump's election win, with investors betting the companies will see increased profits from a tough-on-immigration administration.",
      "CoreCivic, which closed at $13.50 a share on November 5, is trading at $22 a share, while Geo Group, which closed at $15 a share Tuesday, is currently trading at $23.75.",
      "\"Obviously, investors believe there is going to be a significant increase in opportunity for both of these firms under the Trump administration,\" Noble Capital Markets analyst Joe Gomes told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Geo Group executives acknowledged on the company's third-quarter earnings call Thursday that it expects the incoming administration to enact stricter border security policies and that the company stands \"ready to provide additional resources to help ICE meet future needs.\"",
      "CoreCivic executives also said they believe the election result will drive demand for its services.",
      "ICE is biggest customer",
      "During Trump's first term in office, from 2017-2021, immigration detention expanded at record levels, according to an ACLU report. In 2019, ICE detained an average of over 50,000 people each day. At times, that number exceeded 56,000 \u2014 about 50% more than peak levels during the Obama administration, according to the report. During his first term in office, Trump expanded the federal government's use of private prison companies to detain immigrants.",
      "As of January 2020, 81% of people detained in ICE custody across the U.S. were held in facilities owned or managed by private prison corporations, according to the ACLU report.",
      "In his second term, President-elect Trump promises a radical shift in policy at the U.S.-Mexico border from his predecessor. That includes a pledge to oversee the largest deportation operation in American history, which could bring significantly more business to CoreCivic and Geo Group.",
      "For the first nine months of 2024, ICE accounted for 30% of each company's revenue.",
      "Both Geo Group and CoreCivic said they currently have excess capacity to accommodate a larger population of detainees. CoreCivic executives noted that they're taking steps to prepare to activate additional capacity to meet ICE's needs. That could include reconfiguring facilities to accommodate a bigger intake area, they noted.",
      "\"There is room for an uptick in occupancy from a capacity standpoint and both companies expect an ask from the Trump administration for more beds. The question is how much, and we just don't know right now,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Brian Violino told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Monitoring",
      "Geo Group also provides monitoring services for ICE under its Intensive Supervision Appearance Program (ISAP), a monitoring program using wearable technology that serves as an alternative to detention.",
      "\"If there is a finite number of beds and a significant number of people are detained, which Trump is discussing in his plans, there could be an increased usage in this alternative to detention,\" Violino said.",
      "Geo Group executives said they have the necessary technology and staffing resources to scale up the contract to more than several million participants, if necessary.",
      "Funding from Congress",
      "The degree to which ICE expands its contracts with the two largest private prison companies depends on how big of an increase in funding Congress authorizes. While Republicans won the Senate majority in Tuesday's election, it remains to be seen which party will obtain control of the U.S. House of Representatives.",
      "\"That's a big part of the story, and if it's a Republican sweep, it will be easier for Trump to get funding from Congress to support this operation he's looking to do,\" Violino said.",

    "summary": "Scammers impersonating as companies or recruiters try to trick people into giving money or personal information.",
    "story": [
      "Between finding openings, sending out your resume and interviewing, looking for a job is tough. Now a growing trend of\u00a0scammers\u00a0impersonating recruiters is making it even harder.",
      "In the last year, job scams have been on the rise, according to Eva Velasquez, president and CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit that helps consumers when their identities are compromised.",
      "Because most job seekers turn to online platforms for employment, scammers impersonate companies and recruiters to trick people into giving them money or personal information.",
      "\"We've really seen tremendous growth in job scams,\" Velasquez said. \"I think that's just due to the fact that we fundamentally changed the way we recruit and hire people.\"",
      "It happened to Tehseen Islam, a 28-year-old quality assurance analyst. She had been looking for a job for a few months when she finally got an offer from a well-known marketing technology company. Or at least she thought she did.",
      "After a weeklong process that included an online form with interview screening questions, Islam was offered the job and received a check. She was asked to deposit it and send the company $1,000 to pay for shipment of equipment she'd need for the job.",
      "A few days later, her bank notified her that the check had bounced and, because it looked like she was cooperating with scammers, it was ending all banking relationships with her. That's when she learned the job was a scam.",
      "\"I'm a little traumatized,\" said Islam, who lost the $1,000 and unknowingly shared personal information with scammers.",
      "If you're a job seeker, here are some recommendations from experts on how to avoid job scammers:",
      "Job scams are a type of\u00a0impersonation scam.",
      "Scammers tend to use the name of an employee from a large company and craft a job posting that matches similar positions. An initial red flag is that scammers usually try to make the job very appealing, Velasquez said.",
      "\"They're going to have very high salaries for somewhat low-skilled work,\" she said. \"And they're often saying it's a 100% remote position because that's so appealing to people.\"",
      "Some scammers post fake jobs, but others reach out directly to job seekers through direct messages or texts. If the scammers are looking to steal your personal information, they may ask you to fill out several forms that include information like your Social Security number and driver's license details.",
      "The only information a legitimate employer should ask for at the beginning of the process is your skills, your work experience, and your contact information, Velasquez said.",
      "Other details don't generally need to be shared with an employer until after you've gotten an offer.",
      "Whether you're replying to a job posting or a recruiter, you must research the company, especially if you didn't initiate the conversation, Velasquez said.",
      "Fake recruiters often contact job seekers through social media or text messages. If someone reaches out to you, verify their identity before responding to their message.",
      "Here are a few recommendations while you research the recruiter or the company:",
      "\u2014 Don't respond to the message right away.",
      "\u2014 Go online and research if the company has current job openings on its official website.",
      "\u2014 Research the name of the recruiter and check if the person has a verifiable social media presence.",
      "\u2014 If the company has a job opening on its website, apply directly through the website.",
      "If you receive a message from a recruiter, it's best to not respond unless you know that the source is reputable. Avoid clicking on any links sent to you, whether to apply for a position or to fill out a questionnaire.",
      "In Islam's case, the scammers sent her a form with interview screening questions where they asked for her personal information.",
      "A common tactic is for scammers to send you a fake signing bonus and then ask you to send some money back, supposedly to cover expenses. This is a way for scammers to steal money from job seekers, said Alvaro Puig, consumer education specialist at the Federal Trade Commission.",
      "\"If you deposit a check and it's fake, your account will show the money is there. But then days later, the bank will discover that it was a fake check,\" Puig said.",
      "So, if you take out money from your account and send it to the fake recruiter, the money will be coming from your bank account and it will be impossible to get back.",
      "When job hunting through platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed, Velasquez recommends being very cautious with job openings and recruiters you trust. While these platforms are reputable and many of their job postings are real, the companies cannot verify every single employment opportunity posted. This creates an opportunity for scammers to post fake job listings and trick people.",
      "\"Don't let platforms that you know are legitimate allow other people to borrow that trust,\" Velasquez said.",
      "After her experience with job scammers, Islam has been more careful with the job openings she trusts. Now, she has a list of steps she follows, including verifying a recruiter's email through a free email address validator, such as Emailable or Clearout, and calling the company directly.",
      "\"This is adding a lot more time to my job search now but I can't just blindly trust that this person is who they say they are,\" Islam said.",
      "If you or a family member is a victim of a scam, it's good practice to report it on the\u00a0FTC's website.",

      "The Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday that it would seek to pull a widely used ingredient in cough and cold medicines from the market, after the agency's scientists concluded that the oral version of the drug is ineffective as a nasal decongestant.",
      "The FDA's proposal comes more than a year after the agency's outside advisers voted against continued use of the ingredient, called oral phenylephrine, citing concerns with the initial data used to support its approval and new data questioning its effectiveness.",

      "The agency's proposed order would remove oral phenylephrine from the \"monograph\" of ingredients that drugmakers are allowed to use in cough and cold medicines which are sold on store shelves without a prescription.",
      "The public has until May 7 next year to weigh in on the proposal. After that comment period, if the FDA decides to finalize its proposal to revoke oral phenylephrine's status as \"generally recognized as safe and effective,\" over-the-counter drugmakers would be forced to stop using the ingredient.",
      "\"The FDA would provide manufacturers with appropriate time to either reformulate drugs containing oral phenylephrine or remove such drugs from the market,\" the agency said in its release.",
      "The Consumer Healthcare Products Association said Thursday it was \"disappointed\" in the FDA's proposal. The industry trade group renewed its claim that no changes \"are warranted\" for oral phenylephrine and cited previous FDA and advisory committee decisions that did not call for pulling the ingredient.",

      "The FDA's proposal caps a push by pharmacy professors at the University of Florida who have urged the agency for years to pull the product, pointing to new data showing phenylephrine did no better than a placebo when swallowed.",
      "The latest data shows that only a tiny fraction of phenylephrine is absorbed into the body when digested from a pill or syrup containing phenylephrine. This is different from other formulations like the inhaled nasal spray versions of the drug, where larger percentages of the drug can make it into the bloodstream.",

    "summary": "A district court judge appointed by former President Barack Obama temporarily blocked a Louisiana law ordering schools to display the Ten Commandments.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge has temporarily blocked a Louisiana law that would have required public schools statewide to display the Ten Commandments in their classrooms by Jan. 1. U.S. District Judge John W. deGravelles of Baton Rouge, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, ruled Tuesday that the law violates the free exercise and establishment clauses of the First Amendment.",
      "The ruling found the Louisiana law was \"unconstitutional on its face and in every application,\" prohibited Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill and defendants in this case from enforcing the mandate, and required them to notify public schools of the change.",
      "The Louisiana Attorney General's Office on Tuesday alleged the judge's ruling only applies to the five school districts in the state named in the lawsuit \u2014 East Baton Rouge Parish Schools, Livingston Parish Schools, St. Tammany Parish Schools, Orleans Parish Schools and Vernon Parish Schools.",
      "And in a statement provided to CBS News, Murrill said that \"we strongly disagree with the court's decision and will immediately appeal, as HB 71's implementation deadline is approaching on January 1, 2025.\"",
      "Tuesday's decision came alongside a preliminary injunction issued in a lawsuit brought by parents of Louisiana public school students, who are represented by a legal team from the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the Freedom From Religion Foundation.",
      "Defendants include Louisiana Superintendent of Education Cade Brumley, along with members of the state education board and other local school boards, all of whom the attorney general represents.",
      "Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, a Republican whose push to integrate elements of his own Christian faith into secular life has been central to his political platform, signed the Ten Commandments legislation into law in June. Referred to as HB 71 in the ongoing lawsuit, it ordered all public K-12 classrooms and state-funded universities in Louisiana to display a poster-sized printout of the commandments \u2014 a set of moral directives essentially meant to lay the foundation of certain religious sects, including the Christian church \u2014 in \"large, easily readable font\" starting next year.",
      "Proponents of the law argued it would reinstate a former relic of \"state and national history, culture, and tradition\" in Louisiana's public education spaces and claimed the measure was not only rooted in religion. But those who opposed the legislation raised questions about its constitutionality.",
      "In an original complaint challenging the Ten Commandments law, the ACLU claimed it amounted to a violation of church and state and would effectively discriminate against students, particularly students who are not Christian. Their lawsuit sought a court order declaring HB 71 infringed on the constitutional religious rights laid out by the First Amendment, which forbids the government from \"establishing\" a religion, or favoring one religion over others, and protects the religious liberties of individual citizens.",
      "\"The state's main interest in passing H.B. 71 was to impose religious beliefs on public-school children, regardless of the harm to students and families,\" read the original complaint. \"The law's primary sponsor and author, Representative Dodie Horton, proclaimed during debate over the bill that it 'seeks to have a display of God's law in the classroom for children to see what He says is right and what He says is wrong.'\"",
      "The ACLU said in a statement its lawsuit represented a group of plaintiffs \"who are Jewish, Christian, Unitarian Universalist, and non-religious.\" Each felt \"the newly enacted statute violates longstanding U.S. Supreme Court precedent\" along with the U.S. Constitution, the statement added.",
      "Meanwhile, Christopher Dier, an American history teacher based in New Orleans, has filed a separate lawsuit against the new law in federal court in New Orleans. Dier's lawyers on Tuesday submitted a copy of deGravelles' ruling to the judge overseeing Dier's case as evidence to strengthen their claim that the new law is a violation of religious freedoms.",
      "\"If I had to put the Ten Commandments in my classroom, it would make me feel as if I'm a state agent, coercing students to follow one specific religion, which is not the goal of public-school educators, especially history teachers,\" said Dier, who was awarded Louisiana teacher of the year in 2020. \"We want our students to feel included.\"",
      "Nicole Hunt, an attorney with the Christian advocacy group Focus on the Family, disagrees that the displays of the Ten Commandments would single out any students or teachers in schools who do not have Christian beliefs.",
      "\"As a parent, I would be excited to see the Ten Commandments posted on my student's wall,\" Hunt told CBS News. \"They serve not only as moral guidelines for the individuals and for society, things like do not murder do not commit adultery, these are things that help to create a thriving community, and a thriving nation.\"",

      "The 52-year-old second-term governor, if confirmed, would have one of the most powerful jobs in Washington, controlling a $62 billion discretionary budget (plus $23 billion for disaster response and recovery) and roughly 260,000 employees. DHS is the third largest department in the U.S. government, behind the Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs.",
      "The sprawling department includes the U.S. Secret Service, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Homeland Security Investigations, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the U.S. Coast Guard and the Transportation Security Administration, among others.",

      "Trump has already appointed two immigration hardliners to the incoming administration: Tom Homan, his former Immigration and Customs Enforcement director, will serve as \"border czar and senior adviser Stephen Miller will be deputy chief of staff for policy.",
      "CNN first reported the development, which comes as Trump makes a slew of announcements for nominations for top roles in his incoming administration. Noem, a Republican governor, had been among a list of possible running mates for Trump earlier this year. But questions swirled about her political future after she detailed in her new book a story about killing her dog decades ago, sparking intense criticism, as well as claims that appeared to be false about meeting Kim Jong Un.",
      "Noem gained national attention following a refusal to employ a mask mandate policy in the state during the COVID-19 pandemic. When she took office in 2019, she became the first woman to serve as governor of South Dakota.",
      "The president-elect has announced a number of nominees and appointments since winning a decisive victory in the 2024 election last week.",
      "On Friday, Noem criticized Democratic governors who have pledged to resist Trump's immigration policies, calling the move by politicians like California Gov. Gavin Newsom \"extremely irresponsible.\"",
      "\"If I had a new president in the White House, and even if he wasn't from my political party, the first thing I would do would be call him up and see if I could get a meeting,\" Noem said on NewsNation.",

      "The new Congress",
      "House Republicans reveled in their victories last week, expressing confidence that they would retain control of the lower chamber in the new year with just a handful of seats to go. Speaker Mike Johnson wrote a letter to colleagues asking for their continued support for his leadership, now that the election has delivered a \"mandate\" for a unified Republican government.",
      "\"If we meet this historic moment together, the next two years can result in the most consequential Congress of the modern era,\" Johnson continued, noting that \"to truly make America great again, we will need to begin delivering for the people on day one.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats continued to hold onto some hopes of flipping the House, to be the only check on Republican political power in Washington. Still, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, who leads the Progressive Caucus, acknowledged Monday that Democrats have a \"very slim path to the majority.\"",
      "\"We are going to do our work to help rebuild and to come back from this loss and recalibrate,\" Jayapal said at a news conference to introduce the newly elected progressives.",
      "On the other side of the Capitol, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell praised the quality of Republican candidates in Senate races this cycle, saying the day after the election that he's \"never seen a better performance.\" With the new majority of at least 52 seats, the outgoing leader argued that Republicans did \"pretty well\" with narrow majorities during the last administration, citing three new Supreme Court justices and tax reform.",
      "\"It's harder, but I think we were successful before with a narrow majority and I think we will be again,\" McConnell said.",
      "Republicans to hold leadership elections",
      "In the Senate, Republicans will vote Wednesday to elect a new leader, since McConnell announced he would step aside earlier this year. A high-stakes race to replace the longest-serving leader in the chamber's history has been taking place behind the scenes.",
      "GOP Whip John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, and Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, are considered the front-runners in the race to replace McConnell. But Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, has seen a surge of support from members of Trump's orbit \u2014 from Tucker Carlson to Elon Musk \u2014 that has drawn more attention to the race.",
      "How the outside input weighs on the race remains to be seen. Senate Republicans will meet behind closed doors and cast secret ballots to elect a new leader, making them less likely to be swayed by outside pressures. But an endorsement of a candidate from Trump himself could change the dynamic. He has already weighed in with a demand about recess appointments.",
      "Meanwhile, House Republicans are also set to conduct leadership elections this week. With a stronger-than-expected showing across the House races, the current leadership slate is expected to enjoy widespread support to remain at the helm of the chamber. But Trump's selection of GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik to serve as ambassador to the U.N. created another opening in the leadership races.",
      "Lame duck to-do list: funding government, Biden's judicial nominations",
      "Congress is returning to pressure to avert a government shutdown after lawmakers approved a continuing resolution to keep the government funded through Dec. 20 earlier this year.",
      "The pre-holiday deadline to prevent a shutdown is commonplace for Congress, though it frustrates some House Republicans looking to avoid a vote on a massive spending bill known as an \"omnibus.\" Johnson said in September that he opposes an omnibus funding package around the holidays, suggesting that he would work to approve the12 full-year spending bills individually after the election. But the new balance of power in Washington next year almost certainly changes the calculus.",
      "House Republicans have so far approved a handful of the full-year spending bills, although they've done so on a partisan basis that makes them nonstarters in the Senate. And the upper chamber has yet to vote on any individual spending bills this year. The reality makes another stopgap measure punting a broader funding fight into the new year likely.",
      "Lawmakers may also address funding for disaster relief following the devastation caused by Hurricanes Helene and Milton in the southeastern U.S. earlier this year. And an annual defense policy bill is also a top priority before the year's end.",
      "Meanwhile, Senate Democrats are expected to vote on judicial nominations, as President Biden has sought to match or even surpass the total number of judicial confirmations in Trump's first term. The issue takes on heightened importance for Democrats with another Trump term on the horizon.",

    "story": [
      "As Democrats work to sort out last week's election results and determine why they lost Latino men in droves, a Latino Democrat and senator-elect has some advice for party leaders and top consultants: \"Go touch grass and meet real Latinos.\"",
      "CBS News Tuesday projected Gallego as the victor in Arizona's U.S. Senate contest against Republican Kari Lake. He believes much of his party is out of touch with a key demographic he says they can't win national elections without.",
      "\"There is no winning nationally without Latinos,\" Gallego said in an extensive interview with CBS News senior White House and political correspondent Ed O'Keefe Tuesday. \"...There's no path forward into the Democratic Party, into a national party, without Latinos.\"",
      "Exit polls show Vice President Kamala Harris lost Latino men to President-elect Donald Trump \u2014 a significant blow to a party that's long relied on them as part of a broad coalition. The results were openly feared most of the past year by Democratic Party leaders and operatives.",
      "Going forward, Gallego said candidates need to go out and find Latinos where they already are. Gallego focused on bringing his campaign to Latino voters \u2014 sometimes, without talking about politics at all. His campaign hosted rodeos, boxing match watch parties, and carne asada cookouts. His team took food to construction shift workers at work sites after they'd clocked out in the early morning. Knocking on people's doors, after shift workers are exhausted and preparing for the next day, won't work, he said.",
      "\"Talk to them. And talk to them as often as possible,\" Gallego said. \"And don't expect you to be able to talk to them one way through TV.\"",
      "There are \"millions and millions\" of Latino men out there, Gallego said, and they're not afraid to speak their mind.",
      "Democrats on the national stage also missed the mark in how they spoke about immigration. Gallego's first Spanish-language TV ad was about border security. Latinos in Arizona looked at the migration crisis at the border, with refugees pouring into the country, and called it \"chaos,\" Gallego said.",
      "While campaigning, \"We didn't actually speak about immigration reform because we know that the Latino voter just doesn't believe it anymore,\" Gallego said, meaning, Latino voters don't believe Washington will actually pass a massive immigration reform bill in the near future.",
      "Instead, Congress needs to focus on fortifying U.S.-Mexico border security first to build trust, he said.",
      "But that message, O'Keefe suggested, may be a hard pill to swallow for fellow Democrats.",
      "\"I'm a pharmacist about to give out very hard pills in the Senate,\" Gallego said.",
      "Gallego also hinted that Democrats missed the mark on addressing inflation. Born on the south side of Chicago to a Colombian mother and a Mexican father, with his mother raising four children alone, Gallego said he knows what it's like to grow up struggling. He saw the flashing warning signs on inflation, not just in the polls, but as he talked with his working-class family members and constituents.",
      "\"Growing up working class, there's nothing more hurtful than working hard and then not being able to provide for your family,\" Gallego said. \"And I instinctively knew that's what these men were going through.\"",
      "\"This is the first time I've ever seen men say I can't do this,\" Gallego said. \"I can't keep working, and it's still not making a difference, and that's when I realized it was really kind of a problem.\"",
      "Raised by his mother, Gallego became a U.S. Marine and served in the Iraq war. He moved to Arizona for a local political job, ran and won a seat in the state House before winning his first congressional race in 2014, representing most of Phoenix and Glendale.",
      "He began on Capitol Hill with an outspoken progressive reputation and was among the Democrats calling on the U.S. Senate to abandon the filibuster. But Gallego has shifted his politics to the center in recent years, a reflection of the state's roughly three-way voter registration split between Democrats, Republicans and independents.",
      "He launched his Senate campaign nearly two years ago, focusing early advertising and outreach on his military service, a key credential in a state with a hefty military and veteran population and a history of electing military veterans, including the late Republican Sen. John McCain, to Congress. With nominal Democratic primary opposition and polls giving him an early lead, independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema announced in March she would not run for reelection, avoiding a three-way contest.",
      "Until Sinema won her Senate race in 2018, a Democrat hadn't been elected to the Senate in Arizona in three decades, though Sinema went on to leave the party. Then in 2020, Sen. Mark Kelly, a Democrat, won a competitive Senate race to serve the remainder of McCain's term after his death.",
      "In his race, Gallego wasn't about to give up on Trump voters \u2014 or any voters, he said.",
      "A rising star in the party \u2014 a veteran and Latino who was victorious in a state Trump won \u2014 Gallego brushed off questions about a future bid for president.",
      "\"Can I rule out running? I can \u2014 I can rule out a lot of things,\" Gallego said. \"First thing I want to focus on is this U.S. Senate race.\"",
      "\"That's not a no,\" O'Keefe pointed out.",

      "\"I'm sorry for all of the harm that I've brought and I've caused,\" he said Tuesday. \"I understand that all of the responsibility and consequences falls upon my shoulders alone.\"",
      "For over a year, investigators said Teixeira, who had top secret security clearance as an IT worker at the Otis Air National Guard Base, accessed the classified documents illegally and either hand-copied the information or printed the records before posting the data in the Discord chat rooms. He even messaged individuals in his forums and offered to find specific information about \"happenings that pertain to your country,\" court records said.",
      "The national defense information began appearing online in February 2022, but investigators didn't link the leaks to Teixeira for over a year. Prosecutors alleged Teixeira knew his conduct was illegal and accused him of violating his oath to serve.",
      "As the investigation into the leaks zeroed in on Teixeira's unit, prosecutors alleged in previous court documents that Teixeira began instructing others in the Discord group to \"delete all messages.\"",
      "\"[i]f anyone comes looking, don't tell them sh**,\" he allegedly wrote to one user. And he told another, \"Try to delete all my messages in civil discussions.\"",
      "\"In the aggregate, the defendant's criminal conduct over the course of more than a year 'critically and negatively impacted' the Department of Defense's mission, endangered his fellow soldiers, other citizens, and allied governments throughout the world,\" prosecutors argued last month, urging the judge to impose a heavy sentence.",
      "Teixeira's defense attorney, however, asked for a sentence of 11 years in prison, telling the judge in court filings, \"His intent was never to harm the United States,\" but to \"educate his friends about world events to make certain they were not misled by misinformation.\"",
      "\"That makes no sense, with all due respect,\" the judge shot back in court on Tuesday when Teixeira's defense attorney repeated that point and said his client had an \"obsessive need to tell the truth.\"",
      "\"What you have convinced me of is he had an obsessive need to talk,\" the judge retorted. \"I see why you're saying he wasn't trying to harm the government.\"",
      "Revealing that Teixeira was diagnosed with autism, his lawyer wrote in an October court filing that \"his motives and decisions were na\u00efve, not nefarious.\" Teixeira accepted responsibility for the admitted crimes, including by participating in an hourslong briefing with members of the intelligence community, the defense filings argued.",
      "\"The actions of Jack Teixeira are inexcusable,\" the attorney wrote, describing his client not as a criminal leaker but as a misguided young person swept up in an online ecosystem. \"However, Jack is still essentially a child \u2013 at the very least, a 'youthful offender' \u2013 who has his whole life in front of him.\"",
      "Prosecutors disagreed with this characterization, telling the judge his age should not affect the sentence. \"Our military is built on the backbone of people his age and younger,\" Dolan said, arguing that Teixeira accepted responsibility to defend the nation. \"This was not based on impulse. If it was, it was an impulsive decision that he made every single day that he went to work for a year,\" the prosecutor added.",
      "But Teixeira's attorney, Michael Bachrach, pushed back in court, pointing out the 11 years in prison he requested amounted to about half Teixeira's life.",
      "\"It does seem that your autism has affected your ability to make friendships and to understand other people's hurts perhaps,\" the judge told Teixeira. \"It isn't that that's something that explains what you did. I think it is something that you need to think about how you're going to avoid anything like this going forward.\"",
      "Following Teixeira's arrest, the Air Force inspector general found that individuals in his Massachusetts unit failed to take proper action after at least four separate security incidents. Members of his unit \"enabled\" the leaks by not properly supervising his access to classified information, the review concluded. The Air National Guard took action against 15 individuals for \"dereliction in the performance of duties\" as a result of the report's findings.",
      "Texeira also faces charges of disobeying orders and obstructing justice in a military court martial, which are expected to be adjudicated in March.",

      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump announced Tuesday that he has selected former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee to serve as the U.S. ambassador to Israel.",
      "\"Mike has been a great public servant, governor, and leader in faith for many years,\" Trump said in a statement. \"He loves Israel, and the people of Israel, and likewise, the people of Israel love him. Mike will work tirelessly to bring about Peace in the Middle East!\"",
      "The post requires approval by the Senate, though Huckabee is unlikely to face major obstacles to confirmation in the upper chamber, where Republicans are expected to hold at least 52 seats in the next Congress.",
      "Huckabee is among the early picks announced by the president-elect as he begins building out his Cabinet and other key posts. Among those are Rep. Elise Stefanik as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and Rep. Michael Waltz as national security adviser. Sources say he is expected to tap Florida Sen. Marco Rubio for secretary of state, though the selection is not finalized.",
      "Huckabee served as Arkansas' governor from 1996 to 2007 and unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2008 and 2016. After leaving office, he hosted a show on Fox News and a radio program. He is a staunch defender of Israel and has said he has visited the country more than 100 times over the course of 50 years.",
      "During his first term, Trump moved the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem during his first term, which President Biden maintained.",
      "If confirmed next year, Huckabee will take over the post amid Isreal's war with Hamas and Hamas' holding of dozens of Israeli hostages, including four American citizens. Discussions about a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas have repeatedly stalled, and on Saturday, Qatar, a mediator with Hamas, announced it had suspended its efforts and would resume them when \"the parties show their willingness and seriousness to end the brutal war and the ongoing suffering of civilians.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 14:52:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has vowed to combat \"the chronic disease epidemic in this country\" in the Trump administration, with the slogan \"Make America Healthy Aagain.\"",
    "story": [
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has outlined a number of promises to \"Make America Healthy Again\" under President-elect Donald Trump, vowing to combat an \"epidemic\" of chronic diseases that he has described as an \"existential\" threat to America's future.",
      "All are under the banner of fighting what Kennedy sees as a common thread behind a broad swath of ailments: that Americans have been \"mass poisoned by big pharma and big food,\" and that federal agencies have failed to stop it. In response, he has also floated a number of specific policy ideas to remake the federal government's public health institutions.",
      "\"[Trump] asked me to end the chronic disease epidemic in this country. And he said, I want to see results, measurable results in the diminishment of chronic disease within two years. And I said, Mr. President, I will do that,\" Kennedy said on Nov. 2.",
      "Authority for a MAHA agenda",
      "Kennedy's allies say Trump's election is also a mandate for their platform of health proposals, which they say delivered key votes for the president-elect. Trump has promised to let Kennedy \"go wild\" on health issues.",
      "\"The American people re-elected President Trump by resounding margins because they trust his judgement and support his policies, including his promise to Make America Healthy Again alongside well-respected leaders like RFK Jr.,\" Karoline Leavitt, Trump-Vance Transition spokeswoman, told CBS News in a statement.",
      "Some ideas in Kennedy's wide-ranging platform have evolved since his original longshot\u00a0presidential campaign. He has acknowledged Trump does not agree with him on every policy.",
      "The president-elect has listed oil and gas as one off-limits issue for Kennedy. In the past, Kennedy has been critical of \"big oil\" and natural gas, over the fatal toll of fossil fuel pollution and climate change.",
      "Several of Kennedy's ideas would require presidential or congressional action to implement, though it is possible that they could be supercharged by emergency powers.",
      "\"I'm going to urge President Trump on day one to do the same thing they did in COVID, which is to declare a national emergency, but not for infectious disease, but for chronic disease,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 26.",
      "Staff changes at federal agencies",
      "Kennedy claims a number of health issues have worsened due to federal inaction, including autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, sleep disorders, infertility rates, diabetes and obesity.",
      "He aims to address that by replacing many staff throughout the agencies, which Kennedy has accused of being too sympathetic to large food and drug companies. As a co-chair of Trump's transition, Kennedy has been vetting a slate of staffers who could fill top positions throughout the Trump administration.",
      "Kennedy has said Trump tasked him with returning agencies \"to their rich tradition of gold-standard, evidence-based science.\" He has also said \"medical expertise\" is not the priority for all staff picks.",
      "\"What we don't really need at HHS is more medical expertise. What we need is an expertise on decoupling the agency from institutional corruption. Because it's the corruption that has distorted the science,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 30.",
      "Kennedy has said he hopes \"to have every nutritional scientist\" across the Department of Health and Human Services and U.S. Department of Agriculture \"fired on Day One.\"",
      "Kennedy himself has been floated to head the Department of Health and Human Services, though some allies say he could be more effective in a \"czar\" type role out of the White House.",
      "\"Get the chemicals out\" of food",
      "When talking about his platform, Kennedy often lampoons products like McDonald's French fries or Fruit Loops cereal as examples of how foods sold in the U.S. are made with ingredients that are banned or discouraged abroad, or have changed for the worse.",
      "\"It's easy to fix. We have a thousand ingredients in our foods that are illegal in Italy and other countries in Europe,\" he said on Oct. 29.",
      "Trump agrees with his plans to \"get the chemicals out\" of America's food supply, Kennedy says, which also includes upending the use of common pesticides and herbicides by American farmers.",
      "Kennedy has described the food in the U.S. as \"just poison,\" citing his own anecdotal experience with his son struggling with eczema while eating pasta in the U.S.",
      "\"When he ate any kind of pasta in this country, he would get these terrible, terrible outbreaks, you know, really agonizing. And he moved to Italy and he lived off of pasta for a year and a half and he never got a case,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 19.",
      "Kennedy suspects that was caused by glyphosate, used in Roundup brand weed-killers, which Italy moved to start restricting in 2016. Italy's decision was over worries that it could pose a cancer risk, and some advocacy groups in the U.S. have also voiced similar concerns.",
      "Agricultural trade associations have defended glyphosate as \"one of the safest, most effective\" tools farmers have to manage weeds and support \"important conservation practices.\"",
      "Kennedy's plea to crack down on food additives and chemicals comes as the FDA is in the middle of launching its own new effort \u2014 and is calling on Congress to step up funding for \u2014 scrutinizing chemicals currently allowed in foods.",
      "Food industry groups have generally voiced support for the FDA to step up its vetting of chemicals in food, in hopes that it \"negates the ill advised and disruptive state by state patchwork\" of legislatures drawing up their own restrictions.",
      "Reducing unhealthy and processed foods in federal programs",
      "Kennedy has also promised to \"get processed food out of school lunch immediately\" and voiced frustration over the amount of federal food assistance for low-income Americans that goes towards sugary drinks and processed food.",
      "One way Kennedy could try to get at this issue is through the federal dietary guidelines process, jointly run by the USDA and HHS, which is in the final stages of crafting the next edition of recommendations that influence a broad range of government nutrition programs.",
      "\"Kids shouldn't be eating grains. They should definitely not be eating seed oils. And they for sure should not be eating sugar. And yet that is what we're forcing them to eat,\" he said on Sept. 26.",
      "On seed oils, Kennedy has claimed that the switch away from oils like beef tallow which were high in saturated fats in favor of vegetable oils was a mistake, and is to blame for a rise in obesity rates. That puts him at odds with longstanding recommendations to limit saturated fats.",
      "\"The guidance around this has been reviewed many times since, and has only become stronger in its conclusion for the role of saturated fat, particularly in its relationship with higher risks of cardiovascular disease,\" Deirdre Tobias, a researcher on this year's Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, said last month.",
      "Grains have been more divisive at this year's committee and the broader scientific community, which has debated setting lower limits to overall grain consumption alongside recommendations to switch from refined to whole grains.",
      "Setting new limits is difficult, scientists on the panel have said, because the only source of some key nutrients for many Americans is cereals and breads fortified with vitamins.",
      "Kennedy has also been critical of the panel of outside researchers put together to create the scientific report underpinning the recommendations, but acknowledges broader changes will also be needed to move the needle.",
      "While Kennedy says he personally would \"never eat anything in a package\" as a rule of thumb, he acknowledges \"most people don't have access to the resources I have.\"",
      "\"We need to start forcing these companies to internalize their costs. So the illusion of cheap food goes away, right? Because if you're drinking Coke and it seems cheap and it gives you diabetes over the long run, that's not very cheap,\" he said on Sept. 30.",
      "Curbing the influence of drugmakers",
      "Kennedy has called for a \"review\" of guidelines that govern advertising by pharmaceutical companies.",
      "The FDA currently regulates advertising about prescription drugs, going after drugmakers that misrepresent their products. Responsibility for some other medical products is shared between the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission.",
      "Kennedy has urged Trump to go further, saying he is advising the president-elect to \"ban pharmaceutical advertising on TV\" over concerns that it is influencing news coverage of health issues.",
      "He has also urged reform of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, which charges pharmaceutical companies millions of dollars for the cost of the FDA vetting their applications to decide whether to approve new drugs.",
      "\"We need to end the corruption. 50% of FDA's budget comes not from the taxpayer, but from the pharmaceutical industry,\" he said on Sept. 26.",
      "Kennedy has not said how Congress or the Trump administration would make up the difference from the fees if they were cut, which amount to around $3 billion out of FDA's budget.",
      "Undoing the fees could leave taxpayers effectively subsidizing a hefty bill previously paid for by drugmakers \u2014 or a return to the significant delays for new medications that initially spurred the creation of the fees.",
      "Promoting alternatives to drugs",
      "Kennedy has accused the FDA of waging a \"war on public health\" which he says includes \"aggressive suppression\" of anything \"that advances human health and can't be patented by Pharma.\"",
      "In his view, that includes treatments like psychedelics, which recently fell short of FDA approval, and foods like raw milk, which officials have stepped up warnings against amid this year's unprecedented bird flu outbreak on dairy farms.",
      "Kennedy has also praised the dietary supplement industry for a court win against the FDA, after the agency tried to take action against what it said was an illegally marketed anti-aging drug.",
      "Also on Kennedy's list are things like \"clean foods\" and exercise, which he wants to allow Medicare and Medicaid to cover.",
      "The promise has echoes of the \"food is medicine\" initiative, which has called for the health care system to offer more financial support for healthier lifestyle habits.",
      "\"If a doctor's patient has diabetes or obesity, the doctor ought to be able to say, I'm going to recommend gym membership, and I'm going to recommend, good food and Medicaid ought to be able to finance those things the same as they would Ozempic,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 30.",
      "Kennedy has also promised to promote healthier lifestyles in other ways, ranging from requiring nutrition classes in federally funded medical schools to reviving the presidential fitness test in schools.",
      "\"Informed choices\" on vaccines",
      "Kennedy has a long record criticizing the safety of vaccines, including recent misleading claims that shots have an \"exemption from pre-licensing safety testing\" before they are approved.",
      "In fact, the FDA requires new vaccines be studied for their safety and efficacy in large trials, results of which are published in peer-reviewed journals and publicly disclosed.",
      "His activism on the issue dates back decades, including a now-retracted article he published in Rolling Stone in 2005 claiming a link between autism and an ingredient called thimerosal that had been used in vaccines before 2001 \u2014 which medical research has disproven. His focus has broadened since then.",
      "\"This doesn't mean vaccines is the only cause of autism. Our kids today are swimming around in a toxic soup coming mainly from their foods that operate along the same biological pathways. But some of it's coming from pharmaceutical drugs,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 19.",
      "Kennedy has insisted that is not \"anti-vaccine\" and would not seek to ban them under Trump, instead saying he wants to \"restore the transparency\" around them \u2014 echoing lawsuits by the group he chaired, Children's Health Defense, over its Freedom of Information Act requests.",
      "\"[Trump] doesn't want me to take vaccines away from people. If you want to take a vaccine, you ought to be able to take it. We believe in free choice in this country. You ought to know the risks and benefits of everything you take,\" Kennedy said on Nov. 2.",
      "But Kennedy has also asserted \"there's no vaccine that is safe and effective,\" and encouraged people to \"resist\" CDC guidelines on vaccines for kids \u2014 raising concern among public health officials, who point to the success of vaccination in saving millions of children worldwide from debilitating illness or premature death from preventable diseases.",
      "Opposing water fluoridation",
      "Ahead of the election, Kennedy said one of Trump's first acts in the White House would be to \"advise all U.S. water systems to remove fluoride from public water.\"",
      "While a number of health risks have been tied to higher levels of fluoride, most are extremely rare in the U.S. and involve far greater exposure than what is added to drinking water.",
      "Fluoride has been incorporated into a majority of U.S. water systems for decades. The American Dental Association estimates that the practice has reduced tooth decay by about 25%, though some research suggests modern use of toothpaste with fluoride has reduced the policy's benefits.",
      "Kennedy's announcement does come as the Environmental Protection Agency is now under a federal court order to take action over one specific risk: the concern that fluoride might lower children's IQ \"at dosages that are far too close to fluoride levels in the drinking water of the United States,\" stemming in large part from a report published by the National Institutes of Health.",
      "Beyond influencing what rule the Trump administration's EPA ends up pursuing in response to the order, Kennedy could also take aim at fluoride through another route: changing the CDC's widely-cited statement about the practice, which hails water fluoridation as one of the greatest \"public health achievements of the 20th century.\"",
      "Kennedy himself has described fluoride as \"a poison\" and praised the nonprofits for suing over the issue.",
      "\"The simple answer is I don't like it,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 30.",

Trujillo said most people don't see Wiles' motherly and grandmotherly side. \"She always made sure her people were taken care of,\" he said. \"She's very soft spoken, but she holds everyone accountable, and it's always done through love and kindness but never a place of hate.\"",
      "Management style",
      "Staffers say Wiles runs a tight and focused ship. Trump's 2024 campaign did not go through the big, dramatic shakeups or infighting that characterized his previous campaigns. Wiles' appointment signals that as president-elect, he wants to run his administration in a similar way.",
      "Wiles' legacy, Trujillo said, is her ability to cultivate talent. \"Susie in politics is the greatest coach of all time...she's going to be able to recruit the best talent.\"",
      "And while Wiles shies away from the spotlight, she made a rare comment on X when businessman Mark Cuban, in an interview on ABC's \"The View,\" accused Trump of not associating with \"strong, intelligent women.\" In response, Wiles\u00a0posted\u00a0for the first time this year: \"I'm told [Mark Cuban] needs help identifying the strong and intelligent women surrounding Pres. Trump. Well, here we are!\"",
      "Background",
      "After Trump won the 2016 election, Wiles, who was the chief strategist in Florida for his campaign, was dispatched in late September of 2018 to help Ron DeSantis with his 2018 bid to be Florida governor. At the time, he was trailing Democrat Andrew Gillum in several polls.",
      "After helping DeSantis win, however, Wiles was shut out of his inner circle, according to\u00a0The Atlantic's Tim Alberta. Wiles told Alberta that working for DeSantis was the \"biggest mistake\" of her career. She returned to the Trump campaign and ran his Florida campaign in 2020, and then after his loss, she went on to run Trump's Save America PAC.",
      "As Trump's 2024 co-campaign manager, Wiles, along with Chris LaCivita, hatched a plan to recruit, register and turn out Trump's low-propensity voters, Alberta reported. During the primary campaign, they pursued people in the reddest areas of the country who liked Trump but weren't habitual voters and in many cases, weren't even registered to vote. During the general campaign, Wiles and LaCivita raised a volunteer army to take on the legions of canvassers paid by Kamala Harris' cash-rich coffers.",
      "Wiles is a native of New Jersey, the daughter of the renowned late NFL kicker and sportscaster Pat Summerall. Soon after she graduated from college at the University of Maryland, she worked for Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign, and later went on to work in Florida politics. In 2010, she helped Sen. Rick Scott win his election against Democrat Bill McCollum, and she has also been a political consultant in Florida.",

    "summary": "The long-awaited ruling, related to presidential immunity, could have profound consequences for the case.",
    "story": [
      "New York \u2014\u00a0President-elect Donald Trump's criminal conviction lives on, at least for another week.",
      "A New York judge on Tuesday deferred making an immediate decision on whether presidential immunity should have prevented jurors from seeing certain evidence at Trump's trial this spring \u2014 and if the verdict should be tossed.",
      "Justice Juan Merchan said he will rule next week on whether a July Supreme Court ruling granting Trump presidential immunity for official acts precludes a jury from finding him guilty after a criminal trial this spring.",
      "Merchan did not directly address sentencing, which had been scheduled for Nov. 26.",
      "A prosecutor for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg emailed Merchan Sunday night, saying Trump asked for a pause \"based on the impact on this proceeding from the results of the Presidential election.\"",
      "\"The People agree that these are unprecedented circumstances,\" wrote the prosecutor, Matthew Colangelo, who added there's a need to balance the interests of \"a jury verdict of guilt following trial that has the presumption of regularity; and the Office of the President.\"",
      "Trump lawyer Emil Bove followed up in his own email to Merchan, writing that a \"stay, and dismissal, are necessary to avoid unconstitutional impediments to President Trump's ability to govern.\"",
      "The long-awaited ruling, on whether evidence shown at trial should have been shielded from jurors, due to presidential immunity, could have profound consequences for the case.",
      "Trump was the first former president ever to be convicted of crimes. On Nov. 5, he also became the first person with a criminal record ever to be elected president.",
      "Trump's lawyers vowed the day a unanimous jury found him guilty of felonies in May to fight his conviction. They were given an extraordinary opportunity not long after when the Supreme Court ruled former presidents are immune from prosecution for official acts. The decision said evidence related to Trump's work as president could not be used at trial.",
      "Trump's legal team, which is led by Todd Blanche, seized on the landmark ruling, demanding Trump's conviction be set aside, and his sentencing canceled. They argued jurors should never have heard testimony related to Trump's communications with former White House communications director Hope Hicks, or his former executive assistant and director of White House Operations Madeleine Westerhout.",
      "Prosecutors argued in response that the Supreme Court ruling didn't apply to evidence shown at trial. They also said the material protested by Trump's lawyers were \"a sliver of the mountains\" of evidence the jury considered.",
      "The jury ultimately concluded that Trump committed 34 felonies in signing off on a scheme to cover-up reimbursements to Michael Cohen, his former attorney and fixer. Cohen had paid $130,000 to adult film star Stormy Daniels, days before the 2016 presidential election, to buy her silence about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump years early. The agreement has often been referred to as a \"hush money\" deal.",
      "Trump insists he is not guilty of falsifying business records \u2014 the charge he was convicted on \u2014 and has vehemently denied Daniels' story.",
      "The Supreme Court's decision in July was the latest curveball in a case that dates back to 2018, when the Manhattan District Attorney's office first began investigating the \"hush money\" deal.",
      "Trump, amid his first term as president, fought the investigation as it expanded into a wide-ranging probe of his finances. The case's first landmark Supreme Court ruling came in 2020, when the nation's highest court ruled the Constitution does not preclude a state criminal subpoena of a sitting president. The ruling allowed the Manhattan District Attorney, then Cyrus Vance Jr., access to Trump's tax returns.",
      "The borough's next district attorney, Alvin Bragg, took up the case but narrowed its focus, bringing it back to the \"hush money\" deal. On March 31, 2023, a grand jury made Trump the first ever former, and future, president indicted for crimes.",
      "Trump's seven-week trial began just more than a year later, on April 15. The jury returned his conviction after a day and a half of deliberations.",
      "Trump, sullen but defiant, walked out of the courtroom and in front of cameras just steps away immediately returned to his campaign for the presidency.",

By comparison, they donated a total of over $35,000 to Harris' campaign. Foreign nationals are barred from contributing to federal elections, and only LVMH employees who are U.S. citizens or permanent legal residents can legally donate.",
      "Open Secrets analysis also shows LVMH did not contribute to any campaigns through PACs in 2024. The U.S. subsidiaries of foreign-based companies can legally form PACs funded by American employees or direct contributions to Super PACs as long as no foreign nationals direct the contribution.",

    "summary": "Former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows was charged with two counts in the case brought by Fulton County prosecutors over alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election in Georgia.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday turned away former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows' bid to move his state prosecution to federal court in the case stemming from an alleged effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election in Georgia.",
      "The court's denial of Meadows' appeal leaves in place a lower court decision that returned the prosecution to state court. Meadows and President-elect Donald Trump, for whom he worked, were charged alongside 17 others by Fulton County prosecutors for their alleged efforts to reverse Trump's electoral loss in Georgia in 2020.",
      "They pleaded not guilty to all charges. Proceedings have been on hold for months as a Georgia appeals court is set to consider in December whether to allow Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis to continue prosecuting Trump and his allies.",
      "Meadows served as Trump's chief of staff from March 2020 to January 2021 and was a prominent figure in the president-elect's attempts to stay in office for a consecutive term after the November 2020 presidential election.",
      "Two counts were brought against him by Fulton County prosecutors: the first alleges that he engaged in a wide-ranging racketeering conspiracy with Trump, and the second alleges he participated in an effort to solicit a public officer, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, to violate his oath of office.",
      "Meadows is portrayed in the indictment returned in August 2023 as a go-between for Trump and others involved in coordinating the strategy for contesting the 2020 election and disrupting the joint session of Congress on Jan. 6, 2021. He participated in a Jan. 2, 2021, phone call between Trump and Raffensperger, during which the then-president asked Raffensperger to \"find\" 11,780 votes, enough to make him the winner of Georgia's election.",
      "After Meadows was charged, he sought to transfer the case to federal court under a federal officer removal statute and argued that the actions alleged in the indictment related to his role as chief of staff.",
      "The district court, however, sent the case back to the Fulton County Superior Court. While U.S. District Judge Steve Jones conceded that some of the charged conduct involved Meadows' official duties, there was not enough evidence to establish that a \"heavy majority\" of the acts alleged against him related to his role as chief of staff.",
      "\"Meadows's alleged association with post-election activities was not related to his role as White House Chief of Staff or his executive branch authority,\" Jones wrote in his September 2023 decision.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit upheld the district court's decision, finding that the federal officer removal statute does not apply to former federal officers and \"his participation in an alleged conspiracy to overturn a presidential election was not related to his official duties.\"",
      "\"At bottom, whatever the chief of staff's role with respect to state election administration, that role does not include altering valid election results in favor of a particular candidate,\" Chief Judge William Pryor wrote for the three-judge panel.",
      "Meadows appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that whether a chief of staff prosecuted based on actions related to his work for the president can remove his case to federal court is not a close call.",
      "Calling the 11th Circuit's decision \"miserly and counterintuitive,\" Meadow's lawyers warned in a filing that allowing it to stand would open former federal officers up to politicized state prosecutions for unpopular federal policies.",
      "\"The chief of staff is a unique federal officer, the top aide to a coequal branch of government personified by the president,\" they wrote. \"If former officers cannot remove at all, and if even a current chief of staff cannot remove a case arising out of acts taken in the White House in service of the president, then the floodgates are open, and 'nightmare scenarios' will not take long to materialize.\"",
      "Fulton County prosecutors urged the Supreme Court to reject Meadows' appeal and leave the 11th Circuit's decision in place. They noted that Trump did not even move his case to federal court, and said Meadows failed to \"articulate any coherent source of authority for the president or his staff to supervise or affect a state's administration of elections.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 07:02:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Oil and natural gas companies will have to pay a federal fee if they emit methane above certain levels under a rule being finalized by the Biden administration that incoming Trump officials are likely to reverse.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Oil and natural gas companies for the first time will have to pay a federal fee if they emit dangerous methane above certain levels under a rule being made final by the Biden administration.",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency rule follows through on a directive from Congress included in the 2022 climate law. The new fee is intended to encourage industry to adopt best practices that reduce emissions of methane - the primary component of natural gas - and thereby avoid paying.",
      "Methane is a climate \"super pollutant\" that is far more potent in the short term than carbon dioxide and is responsible for about one-third of greenhouse gas emissions. The oil and natural gas sector is the largest industrial source of methane emissions in the United States, and advocates say reduction of methane emissions is a crucial way to slow climate change.",
      "The rule, set to be announced Tuesday at an international climate conference in Azerbaijan, comes hours after President-elect Donald Trump named former New York congressman Lee Zeldin to head the agency in Trump's second term. If confirmed by the Senate, Zeldin is expected to move to reverse or loosen dozens of environmental regulations approved under President Biden as Trump seeks to establish U.S. \"energy dominance\u2033 worldwide.",
      "Trump is likely to target the methane fee amid a flurry of expected actions he has promised to deregulate the oil and gas industry.",
      "As outlined by the EPA, excess methane produced in 2024 could result in a fee of $900 per ton, with fees rising to $1,200 per ton in 2025 and $1,500 per ton by 2026. Industry groups are likely to challenge the rule, including any effort to impose a retroactive fee.",
      "The rule wouldn't become final until early next year, following publication in the Federal Register.",
      "EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement that the rule will work in tandem with a new EPA rule on methane emissions imposed this year. The rule targets the U.S. oil and natural gas industry for its role in global warming as Mr. Biden seeks to secure his legacy on fighting climate change.",
      "The fee, formally known as the Waste Emissions Charge, will encourage early deployment of available technologies to reduce methane emissions and other harmful air pollutants, Regan said. The fee \"is the latest in a series of actions under President Biden's methane strategy to improve efficiency in the oil and gas sector, support American jobs, protect clean air and reinforce U.S. leadership on the global stage,\" he said.",
      "Industry groups and Republican-led states have challenged the earlier methane rule in court, but lost a bid for the Supreme Court to block the rule while the case continues before lower-level judges.",
      "Opponents argue that the EPA overstepped its authority and set unattainable standards with the new regulations. The EPA, though, said the rules are squarely within its legal responsibilities and would protect the public.",
      "Many large oil and gas companies already meet or exceed methane-performance levels set by Congress under the climate law, meaning they are unlikely to be forced to pay the new fee, Regan and other officials said.",
      "Even so, the EPA estimates that the rule will result in cumulative emissions reductions of 1.2 million metric tons of methane (the equivalent of 34 million metric tons of carbon-dioxide) through 2035. That figure is similar to clean-air gains from taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year, the EPA said. Cumulative climate benefits could total as much $2 billion, the agency said.",
      "Like the earlier methane rule, the new fee faces a near-certain legal challenge from industry groups. The American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's largest lobbying group, called a fee proposed earlier this year a \"punitive tax increase\" that \"undermines America's energy advantage.''",
      "The API said it looks forward to working with Congress to repeal the \"misguided new tax on American energy.\"",
      "Environmental groups, for their part, have hailed the impending methane fee, saying oil and gas companies should be held accountable for pollution that contributes to global warming. Oil and gas companies routinely calculate that it's cheaper to waste methane through flaring and other techniques than to make necessary upgrades to prevent leaks, they said.",
      "The EPA said it expects that over time, fewer oil and gas companies will be charged for excess methane as they reduce emissions in compliance with the rule.",

    "story": [
      "Waves of U.S. Capitol riot defendants are citing Donald Trump's election in requests to delay their criminal prosecutions because of his public pledge to pardon some of the people convicted of crimes on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "In court filings reviewed by CBS News, defense attorneys asked federal judges in Washington, D.C., to postpone proceedings in some of the Jan. 6 cases until 2025, when President-elect Donald Trump takes office.",
      "The filings complicate the Justice Department's ability to conclude its prosecutions \u2014 hundreds of which remain active \u2014 before the changeover in power.",
      "William Pope, a Jan. 6 defendant from Kansas, has filed a new request for a delay, blistering the Justice Department for continuing apace with his prosecution.\u00a0Pope's filing cited Trump's reelection, arguing, \"Any further action in these cases is not an 'administration of justice' in the public interest as the government claims, but a belligerent disregard for the will of the American people, from which all law and governmental power in this country is derived.\"",
      "In a new request to delay his sentencing, defendant Terry Allen's attorneys filed a motion saying, \"History has shown that President Donald Trump is not shy when it comes to exercising his pardon powers and there is clearly no reason to believe he won't do as he says.\" Allen's attorneys noted that in Trump's first term, he \"pardoned, commuted, or rescinded the convictions of 237 people,\" and \"[m]any were controversial.\"",
      "Some defendants are quoting Trump's campaign statements in their new court filings. Attorneys for defendant Larry Brock argued that Trump \"explicitly campaigned on justice for the January 6 defendants.\" They cited Trump's July 31 interview with the National Association of Black Journalists, in which he said he'd \"'absolutely' pardon those convicted in the January 6th prosecutions because 'they were convicted by a very tough system.'\" They also quoted Trump's claim about Jan. 6 convicts: \"'[S]ome call them prisoners. I call them hostages...release the J6 hostages, Joe. Release them, Joe. You can do it real easy, Joe.'\"",
      "Brock, a retired U.S. Air Force lieutenant colonel, was accused of rifling through papers on the desks of senators while amid the mob.",
      "Defense attorney Joseph McBride, who has defended several Jan. 6 criminal defendants told CBS News that requests would be made \"across the board\" to delay cases until Trump takes office. \"It would be foolish not to,\" he said. \"The Justice Department Is still arresting people, which is nuts and pointless. The pardon thing is looming. And I don't think any of these prosecutions will continue beyond (Trump taking office).\"",
      "Former federal prosecutor Scott Fredericksen told CBS News he thinks the Justice Department is going to be forced to confront the question of what to do with the cases.",
      "\"The department will probably say, 'We're going to continue with the cases,' and that the discussion of pardons is not sufficient to warrant delays,\" Fredricksen said.",
      "The Justice Department didn't immediately return requests for comment. In court filings, it has opposed requests for delays. In the case of Terry Allen, prosecutors disagreed that a continuance of the case was warranted because \"the defendant's justification at this time is mere speculation.\"",
      "\"The Court should proceed as it would in any other prosecution,\" prosecutors argued. \"Courts in this jurisdiction have denied similar motions.\"",
      "Opposing a request to delay the trial of defendant Stephen Baker, the Justice Department argued, \"There is a public interest in the prompt and efficient administration of justice. The government and the Court have endeavored to deliver that interest. The government disagrees that a continuance is warranted here, and the Court should proceed as it would in any other prosecution.\"",
      "But the numbers of delay requests are expected to grow significantly. McBride, the New York-based defense attorney, told CBS News requests are expected by all similarly situated defendants. He said defense attorneys must argue for all of their clients and may not \"pick and choose\" to ask for delays only for some.",
      "In his court filing, Pope included a photo of himself standing next to Trump.",
      "\"It is now up to the Court to decide if it wishes to expend judicial resources by enduring a taxing schedule in this case,\" the filing said. \"Ultimately, I will get the same result with a trial or with no trial.\"",
      "The Justice Department has launched over 1,500 criminal cases in its prosecution of the Capitol siege.\u00a0 According to federal records, approximately 950 defendants have pleaded guilty, and 200 more have been found guilty at trial.",
      "Arrests continue, including new cases unsealed over the past few weeks.",
      "Fredericksen said a Trump-appointed attorney general could move to have the department dismiss pending Jan. 6 cases \u2014 and could opt to reopen and dismiss cases against those who have already been convicted and sentenced to prison.",

    "summary": "Seal-shaped boards decked with bright horizontal lights were less likely to be attacked by great white sharks, researchers found.",
    "story": [
      "Covering your surfboard in bright lights sounds like an open invitation to great white sharks, but research released Tuesday by Australian scientists found it might actually stave off attacks.",
      "Biologist Laura Ryan said the predator often attacked its prey from underneath, occasionally mistaking a surfer's silhouette for the outline of a seal.",
      "Ryan and her fellow researchers showed that seal-shaped boards decked with bright horizontal lights were less likely to be attacked by great white sharks.",
      "This appeared to be because the lights distorted the silhouette on the ocean's surface, making it appear less appetizing.",
      "\"There is this longstanding fear of white sharks and part of that fear is that we don't understand them that well,\" said Ryan, from Australia's Macquarie University.",
      "The study, published in the journal Current Biology, was conducted in the waters of South Africa's Mossel Bay, a popular great white feeding ground.",
      "Seal-shaped decoys were strung with different configurations of LED lights and towed behind a boat to see which attracted the most attention.",
      "Brighter lights were better at deterring sharks, the research found, while vertical lights were less effective than horizontal.",
      "Macquarie University Professor Nathan Hart, one of the study's authors, said the lights caused a \"complex interaction\" with the shark's behavior.",
      "\"It's like an invisibility cloak but with the exception that we are splitting the object, the visual silhouette, into smaller bits,\" Hart said.",
      "The study's authors released a video showing some of the research in action.",
      "Ryan said the results were better than expected and is now in the process of building prototypes for use on the underside of kayaks and surfboards.",
      "Australia has some of the world's most comprehensive shark management measures, including monitoring drones, shark nets and a tagging system that alerts authorities when a shark is near a crowded beach.",
      "Ryan said her research could allow less invasive mitigation methods to be used.",
      "More research was needed to see if bull and tiger sharks -- which have different predatory behavior \u2014 responded to the lights in a similar way, the authors said.",
      "There have been more than 1,200 shark incidents in Australia since 1791, of which 255 resulted in death, official data shows.",
      "Great white sharks were responsible for 94 of those deaths.",
      "The overall number of deadly shark attacks worldwide in 2023 remained relatively low, but it was still twice the previous year's total, according to the latest iteration of the\u00a0International Shark Attack File\u00a0\u2014 a database of global shark attacks run by the University of Florida.",

    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 07:02:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Oil and natural gas companies will have to pay a federal fee if they emit methane above certain levels under a rule being finalized by the Biden administration that incoming Trump officials are likely to reverse.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Oil and natural gas companies for the first time will have to pay a federal fee if they emit dangerous methane above certain levels under a rule being made final by the Biden administration.",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency rule follows through on a directive from Congress included in the 2022 climate law. The new fee is intended to encourage industry to adopt best practices that reduce emissions of methane - the primary component of natural gas - and thereby avoid paying.",
      "Methane is a climate \"super pollutant\" that is far more potent in the short term than carbon dioxide and is responsible for about one-third of greenhouse gas emissions. The oil and natural gas sector is the largest industrial source of methane emissions in the United States, and advocates say reduction of methane emissions is a crucial way to slow climate change.",
      "The rule, set to be announced Tuesday at an international climate conference in Azerbaijan, comes hours after President-elect Donald Trump named former New York congressman Lee Zeldin to head the agency in Trump's second term. If confirmed by the Senate, Zeldin is expected to move to reverse or loosen dozens of environmental regulations approved under President Biden as Trump seeks to establish U.S. \"energy dominance\u2033 worldwide.",
      "Trump is likely to target the methane fee amid a flurry of expected actions he has promised to deregulate the oil and gas industry.",
      "As outlined by the EPA, excess methane produced in 2024 could result in a fee of $900 per ton, with fees rising to $1,200 per ton in 2025 and $1,500 per ton by 2026. Industry groups are likely to challenge the rule, including any effort to impose a retroactive fee.",
      "The rule wouldn't become final until early next year, following publication in the Federal Register.",
      "EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement that the rule will work in tandem with a new EPA rule on methane emissions imposed this year. The rule targets the U.S. oil and natural gas industry for its role in global warming as Mr. Biden seeks to secure his legacy on fighting climate change.",
      "The fee, formally known as the Waste Emissions Charge, will encourage early deployment of available technologies to reduce methane emissions and other harmful air pollutants, Regan said. The fee \"is the latest in a series of actions under President Biden's methane strategy to improve efficiency in the oil and gas sector, support American jobs, protect clean air and reinforce U.S. leadership on the global stage,\" he said.",
      "Industry groups and Republican-led states have challenged the earlier methane rule in court, but lost a bid for the Supreme Court to block the rule while the case continues before lower-level judges.",
      "Opponents argue that the EPA overstepped its authority and set unattainable standards with the new regulations. The EPA, though, said the rules are squarely within its legal responsibilities and would protect the public.",
      "Many large oil and gas companies already meet or exceed methane-performance levels set by Congress under the climate law, meaning they are unlikely to be forced to pay the new fee, Regan and other officials said.",
      "Even so, the EPA estimates that the rule will result in cumulative emissions reductions of 1.2 million metric tons of methane (the equivalent of 34 million metric tons of carbon-dioxide) through 2035. That figure is similar to clean-air gains from taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year, the EPA said. Cumulative climate benefits could total as much $2 billion, the agency said.",
      "Like the earlier methane rule, the new fee faces a near-certain legal challenge from industry groups. The American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's largest lobbying group, called a fee proposed earlier this year a \"punitive tax increase\" that \"undermines America's energy advantage.''",
      "The API said it looks forward to working with Congress to repeal the \"misguided new tax on American energy.\"",
      "Environmental groups, for their part, have hailed the impending methane fee, saying oil and gas companies should be held accountable for pollution that contributes to global warming. Oil and gas companies routinely calculate that it's cheaper to waste methane through flaring and other techniques than to make necessary upgrades to prevent leaks, they said.",
      "The EPA said it expects that over time, fewer oil and gas companies will be charged for excess methane as they reduce emissions in compliance with the rule.",

    "story": [
      "Beirut \u2014 Declassified 1970s-era U.S. spy satellite imagery has led a British-Iraqi archeological team to what they believe is the site of a seventh-century battle that became decisive in the spread of Islam throughout the region.",
      "The Battle of al-Qadisiyah was fought in Mesopotamia \u2014 in present-day Iraq \u2014 in the A.D. 630s between Arab Muslims and the army of the Sassanid Persian dynasty during a period of Muslim expansion. The Arab army prevailed and continued on its march into Persia, now Iran.",
      "A joint team of archeologists from the U.K.'s Durham University and the University of Al-Qadisiyah stumbled across the site while undertaking a remote sensing survey to map the Darb Zubaydah, a pilgrimage route from Iraq's Kufa to Mecca in Saudi Arabia built more than 1,000 years ago. The findings were published Tuesday in the journal Antiquity.",
      "While mapping the route, the team noticed that a site some 20 miles south of Kufa in Iraq's southern Najaf province \u2014 a desert area with scattered plots of agricultural land \u2014 had features that closely matched the description of the al-Qadisiyah battle site described in historic texts.",
      "William Deadman, a specialist in archaeological remote sensing at Durham University, said the Cold War era satellite images are commonly used tools by archeologists working in the Middle East because the older images often show features that have been destroyed or altered and wouldn't show up on present-day satellite images.",
      "\"The Middle East has developed so much in the last 50 years, both agricultural expansion and urban expansion,\" he said. Some of the distinguishing features at the al-Qadisiyah site, such as a distinctive trench, were \"much more pristine and clear\" in the 1970s images, he said.",
      "A survey on the ground confirmed the findings and convinced the team that they had correctly identified the site.",
      "The key features were a deep trench, two fortresses and an ancient river that was reportedly once forded by elephant-mounted Persian troops, said Jaafar Jotheri, a professor of archeology at the University of Al-Qadisiyah who's part of the team that made the discovery. The survey team also found pottery shards consistent with the time period when the battle took place.",
      "A revealing, well-known battle",
      "Jotheri said Iraqis of his generation, who grew up under the rule of Saddam Hussein, were all familiar with the battle in minute detail, down to the names of the generals on both sides.",
      "The battle at the time had political connotations \u2014 Iraq was engaged in a devastating war with Iran through much of the 1980s. Saddam pointed to the Battle of Qadisiyah as a harbinger of victory for Iraq.",
      "Like most children growing up in that era, Jotheri said he'd watched a popular movie about the battle multiple times as it was on regular rotation on television.",
      "In the post-Saddam era, al-Qadisiyah has become something of a political litmus test. Iraqis' views of the battle vary depending on their feelings toward Iran, which has expanded its influence in the country since the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq that toppled Saddam.",
      "\"There is some political and religious context in this battle because now, of course, we have religious differences, ethnic differences, political differences in Iraq and we read or we view everything based on our \u2026 differences,\" Jotheri said. But he added, \"We all agree that it is a very important battle, a decisive one, and we all know about it.\"",
      "Discovery was part of a regional trend",
      "The team plans to begin excavations at the site in the coming year, Jotheri said.",
      "The discovery comes as part of a broader project launched in 2015 to document endangered archaeological sites in the region.",
      "It also comes at the time of a resurgence of archeology in Iraq, a country often referred to as the \"cradle of civilization,\" but where archeological exploration has been stunted by decades of conflict that halted excavations and led to the looting of tens of thousands of artifacts.",

    "story": [
      "When a volcanic eruption buried the ancient city of Pompeii, the last desperate moments of its citizens were preserved in stone for centuries.",
      "Observers see stories in the plaster casts later made of their bodies, like a mother holding a child and two women embracing as they die.",
      "But new DNA evidence suggests things were not as they seem \u2014 and these prevailing interpretations come from looking at the ancient world through modern eyes.",
      "\"We were able to disprove or challenge some of the previous narratives built upon how these individuals were kind of found in relation to each other,\" said Alissa Mittnik of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany. \"It opens up different interpretations for who these people might have been.\"",
      "Mittnik and her colleagues discovered that the person thought to be a mother was actually a man unrelated to the child. And at least one of the two people locked in an embrace \u2014 long assumed to be sisters or a mother and daughter - was a man. Their research was published Thursday in the journal Current Biology.",
      "The team, which also includes scientists from Harvard University and the University of Florence in Italy, relied on genetic material preserved for nearly two millennia. After Mount Vesuvius erupted and destroyed the Roman city in 79 A.D., bodies buried in mud and ash eventually decomposed, leaving spaces where they used to be. Casts were created from the voids in the late 1800s.",
      "Researchers focused on 14 casts undergoing restoration, extracting DNA from the fragmented skeletal remains that mixed with them. They hoped to determine the sex, ancestry and genetic relationships between the victims.",
      "There were several surprises in \"the house of the golden bracelet,\" the dwelling where the assumed mother and child were found. The adult wore an intricate piece of jewelry, for which the house was named, reinforcing the impression that the victim was a woman. Nearby were the bodies of another adult and child thought to be the rest of their nuclear family.",
      "DNA evidence showed the four were male and not related to one another, clearly showing \"the story that was long spun around these individuals\" was wrong, Mittnik said.",
      "Researchers also confirmed Pompeii citizens came from diverse backgrounds but mainly descended from eastern Mediterranean immigrants \u2013 underscoring a broad pattern of movement and cultural exchange in the Roman Empire. Pompeii is located about 150 miles (241 kilometers) from Rome.",
      "The study builds upon research from 2022 when scientists sequenced the genome of a Pompeii victim for the first time and confirmed the possibility of retrieving ancient DNA from the human remains that still exist.",
      "\"They have a better overview of what's happening in Pompeii because they analyzed different samples,\" said Gabriele Scorrano of the University of Rome Tor Vergata, a co-author of that research who was not involved in the current study. \"We actually had one genome, one sample, one shot.\"",
      "Though much remains to be learned, Scorrano said, such genetic brushstrokes are slowly painting a truer picture of how people lived in the distant past.",
      "In August, archaeologists at Pompeii announced they had unearthed the remains of two more victims -- a man and a woman discovered inside what was likely the bedroom of their home, where they'd become trapped as the rest of the structure filled with debris. The woman was found on the bed with a collection of gold, silver and bronze coins, as well as a pair of gold earrings, a pair of pearl earrings and other jewelry.",

      "Three NASA astronauts who just wrapped up a 235-day mission to the International Space Station discussed their flight with reporters Friday, but steadfastly refused to comment on a medical issue of some sort that resulted in one astronaut spending the night in a hospital after landing.",
      "The unidentified astronaut flew back to the Johnson Space Center in Houston the day after splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico on Oct. 25, rejoining their crewmates. But NASA, citing medical privacy issues, provided no details other than to say the astronaut \"is in good health and will resume normal post-flight reconditioning with other crew members.\"",
      "\"I know there may be some interest in our post-flight medical event, where we diverted to a hospital,\" Crew 8 pilot Mike Barratt, a physician-astronaut, told reporters Friday. \"You know, space flight is still something we don't fully understand. We're finding things that we don't expect sometimes, and this was one of those times.",
      "\"We're still piecing things together on this. And so to maintain medical privacy and to let our processes go forward in an orderly manner, this is all we're going to say about that event at this time.\"",
      "Barratt, Crew 8 commander Matt Dominick, astronaut Jeanette Epps and Russian cosmonaut Alexander Grebenkin were launched from the Kennedy Space Center on March 3 and docked at the space station two days later. They returned to Earth last month after an extended stay in space.",
      "Barratt, Dominick and Epps all appeared healthy and in good spirits Friday as they continue their re-adjustment to gravity. Grebenkin flew back to Moscow shortly after splashdown, but in a social media post just after the crew's return to Earth, he was smiling and said to be in good shape.",
      "While the presumably minor medical issue remains a mystery, the crew shared highlights of their stay in space, including details about a water leak during preparations for a June spacewalk that triggered a blizzard in the space station's airlock.",
      "After a spacesuit \"discomfort\" problem forced Dominick and astronaut Tracy Dyson to call off a planned spacewalk on June 13, Dyson and Barratt suited up for another excursion on June 24.",
      "While floating in the airlock with the outer hatch open to space, an umbilical failed to \"seat\" properly and water began spewing into the chamber.",
      "\"Oh, my goodness,\" Dyson said when she noticed the water spewing out. \"There's a lot of water flowing. There's literally water everywhere. ... I've got ice all over my helmet.\"",
      "\"It was not a trivial leak,\" Barratt reflected Friday. \"Anybody who was watching NASA TV at the time could see there was basically a snowstorm, a blizzard spewing from the air lock, because we already had the hatch open. We were seeing flakes of ice in the air lock. Tracy was seeing a lot of them on her helmet, on her gloves, whatnot.",
      "\"So it was...dramatic is the right word, to be real honest. I think literally, Tracy's actions were nowhere short of a heroic to be able to re-mate that umbilical with her hands covered with ice and kind of being vision impaired and getting the air lock closed.\"",
      "Barratt said he grabbed her space-suited legs so Dyson could \"lever that thing closed, and she just made it happen. So yeah, there was a bit of drama. Everything worked out fine. And again, normal processes and procedures saved our bacon.\"",
      "NASA plans to resume spacewalks in January, and Barratt said the suits will be in good shape.",
      "\"I think we're leaving them a brand new umbilical, a really clean interface on that side where we had the problem and the suits are charged and really ready to go,\" he said. \"So I think we are more than ready for the next EVA campaign. I just wish we were doing it.\"",
      "That said, he pointed out, \"none of our spacesuits are spring chickens. And so we will expect to see some hardware issues with repeated use. So again, it's one of those things that we are always, at every second, ready to stop...or work a contingency procedure.\"",

      "\"I think this shows that these narratives are pushed when they serve a purpose, and they are stage setting often for efforts to dispute unfavorable results,\" said Max Read, a senior researcher at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. \"And then once that stage setting and those claims are no longer needed, they're not pushed anymore.\"",
      "The shift was stark in Elon Musk's \"Election Integrity Community,\" a group of nearly 65,000 started by the platform owner's political action committee encouraging members to report \"voter fraud or irregularities.\"",
      "The group had already become a repository for speculation and unfounded rumors before Election Day. When the polls opened, hundreds of posts an hour were shared until the early hours of the morning on Wednesday, when the race was called for Trump in Pennsylvania, all but eliminating a winning path for Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "After that, the posting drastically diminished.",
      "Read's team at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue also found that mentions across the platform of voting machines in Pennsylvania and Michigan soared on Tuesday afternoon but dropped to hardly any by Wednesday morning.",
      "On Tuesday morning, a software error caused voting machines to be temporarily down in Cambria County, a county in southwestern Pennsylvania with a population of about 131,000. Voters used paper ballots and a court order extended voting hours from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. But some on social media baselessly suggested the technical issues were something nefarious, a plot to discard votes in a county Trump won by a wide margin in both of the last two elections.",
      "Danielle Lee Tomson, who leads the Center for an Informed Public's research on election rumors at the University of Washington, said the narrative around Pennsylvania voting machines echoed the conversation around election issues in Maricopa County, Arizona, in 2022. In that election, some ballots were printed with ink too light to be read by tabulators, so they were placed in a secure box and counted separately at the state's election headquarters. Claims that the errors were intentional fueled a lawsuit challenging the results that was later dismissed.",
      "\"On Election Day, we can always expect there to be irregularities or glitches or problems at polling sites,\" Tomson said. \"The question is will those issues be contorted into a larger narrative that election fraud is happening.\"",
      "While the volume of election rumors has drastically decreased, false claims are still spreading about races that have not yet been called. In Arizona, where Republican Senate candidate Kari Lake trails Democratic candidate Ruben Gallego, social users on the right are using the fact that Gallego had more votes than Harris by Friday to cast doubt on the validity of his lead.",
      "Meanwhile, turnout numbers are being twisted by both the left and the right to cast doubt on election results. While millions of votes are still being counted, some point to higher turnout in 2020 as evidence that there are 20 million \"missing votes.\" On the right, some claim this is evidence that 2020 was stolen from Trump; on the left, some say it's grounds for a recount.",
      "But the volume of posts questioning Harris's loss was nowhere near the \"Stop the Steal\" efforts that followed Trump's 2020 election loss, according to both Tomson and Read's research. No elected officials cast doubt on the outcome the way Trump pushed election denial when he lost in 2020. Harris urged all Americans to accept the results of the election in her concession speech on Wednesday.",
      "\"A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election, we accept the results,\" Harris said. \"And anyone who seeks the public trust must honor it.\"",

    "summary": "\"Social media is doing harm to our kids and I'm calling time on it,\" says Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanse.",
    "story": [
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced Thursday what he called a \"world-leading\" plan to implement a social media ban for all children under the age of 16. While much of the detail of the proposed legislation has yet to be made clear, the Australian leader said at a news conference that the bill involves an age verification process where \"the onus will be on social media platforms to demonstrate they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access\" to their platforms.",
      "Under the proposed legislation, social media companies would face sizable fines for allowing younger children to access their platforms, but there would be no penalties for users or parents of users who ignore the law, the Australian government\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "\"Social media is doing harm to our kids and I'm calling time on it,\" Albanese declared Thursday. \"I've spoken to thousands of parents, grandparents, aunties and uncles. They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online, and I want Australian parents and families to know that the government has your back.\"",
      "The government said the proposed legislation would not allow exemptions for children whose parents consent to their use of social media platforms. The bill also will not include \"grandfathering arrangements\" that could exempt young people who already have social accounts.",
      "Australian Minister of Communications Michelle Rowland told reporters social media companies had been consulted about how to practically enforce such a ban, and she mentioned Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, X and YouTube as platforms that would likely be affected by the legislation.",
      "CBS News has sought comment from all five social media companies about the Australian government's plans.",
      "Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, said in a statement that the company has already created several safety tools for teens on its services.",
      "\"There's a solution that negates many of these concerns and simplifies things immeasurably for parents: parental consent and age verification should happen on the app store. And we think Australia should make it law,\" the company said.",
      "Last month, a coalition of over 140 Australian and international experts signed an open letter\u00a0to Albanese outlining concerns about the proposed age limit.",
      "\"The online world is a place where children and young people access information, build social and technical skills, connect with family and friends, learn about the world around them and relax and play,\" the letter says. \"We are concerned that a 'ban' is too blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\"",
      "In April, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators including Republican Ted Cruz of Texas and Democrat Brian Schatz of Hawaii\u00a0introduced legislation that, among other provisions, would \"prohibit children under the age of 13 from creating or maintaining social media accounts, consistent with the current practices of major social media companies,\" and \"Prohibit social media companies from recommending content using algorithms to users under the age of 17.\"",
      "A 2023\u00a0advisory\u00a0from the U.S. Surgeon General's office said there were mental health benefits for children and teens when they reduce or eliminate exposure to social media for longer than a month.",
      "Most social media companies have policies that bar children under the age of 13 from setting up accounts, but a 2022 study conducted by the U.K.'s media regulator Ofcom found that nearly 80% of children in the country had social media accounts by the age of 12.",

U.S. District Judge John W. deGravelles of Baton Rouge, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, ruled Tuesday that the law violates the free exercise and establishment clauses of the First Amendment.",
      "The ruling found the Louisiana law was \"unconstitutional on its face and in every application,\" prohibited Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill and defendants in this case from enforcing the mandate, and required them to notify public schools of the change.",
      "The Louisiana Attorney General's Office on Tuesday alleged the judge's ruling only applies to the five school districts in the state named in the lawsuit \u2014 East Baton Rouge Parish Schools, Livingston Parish Schools, St. Tammany Parish Schools, Orleans Parish Schools and Vernon Parish Schools.",
      "And in a statement provided to CBS News, Murrill said that \"we strongly disagree with the court's decision and will immediately appeal, as HB 71's implementation deadline is approaching on January 1, 2025.\"",
      "Tuesday's decision came alongside a preliminary injunction issued in a lawsuit brought by parents of Louisiana public school students, who are represented by a legal team from the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the Freedom From Religion Foundation.",
      "Defendants include Louisiana Superintendent of Education Cade Brumley, along with members of the state education board and other local school boards, all of whom the attorney general represents.",
      "Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, a Republican whose push to integrate elements of his own Christian faith into secular life has been central to his political platform, signed the Ten Commandments legislation into law in June. Referred to as HB 71 in the ongoing lawsuit, it ordered all public K-12 classrooms and state-funded universities in Louisiana to display a poster-sized printout of the commandments \u2014 a set of moral directives essentially meant to lay the foundation of certain religious sects, including the Christian church \u2014 in \"large, easily readable font\" starting next year.",
      "Proponents of the law argued it would reinstate a former relic of \"state and national history, culture, and tradition\" in Louisiana's public education spaces and claimed the measure was not only rooted in religion. But those who opposed the legislation raised questions about its constitutionality.",
      "In an original complaint challenging the Ten Commandments law, the ACLU claimed it amounted to a violation of church and state and would effectively discriminate against students, particularly students who are not Christian. Their lawsuit sought a court order declaring HB 71 infringed on the constitutional religious rights laid out by the First Amendment, which forbids the government from \"establishing\" a religion, or favoring one religion over others, and protects the religious liberties of individual citizens.",
      "\"The state's main interest in passing H.B. 71 was to impose religious beliefs on public-school children, regardless of the harm to students and families,\" read the original complaint. \"The law's primary sponsor and author, Representative Dodie Horton, proclaimed during debate over the bill that it 'seeks to have a display of God's law in the classroom for children to see what He says is right and what He says is wrong.'\"",
      "The ACLU said in a statement its lawsuit represented a group of plaintiffs \"who are Jewish, Christian, Unitarian Universalist, and non-religious.\" Each felt \"the newly enacted statute violates longstanding U.S. Supreme Court precedent\" along with the U.S. Constitution, the statement added.",
      "Meanwhile, Christopher Dier, an American history teacher based in New Orleans, has filed a separate lawsuit against the new law in federal court in New Orleans. Dier's lawyers on Tuesday submitted a copy of deGravelles' ruling to the judge overseeing Dier's case as evidence to strengthen their claim that the new law is a violation of religious freedoms.",
      "\"If I had to put the Ten Commandments in my classroom, it would make me feel as if I'm a state agent, coercing students to follow one specific religion, which is not the goal of public-school educators, especially history teachers,\" said Dier, who was awarded Louisiana teacher of the year in 2020. \"We want our students to feel included.\"",
      "Nicole Hunt, an attorney with the Christian advocacy group Focus on the Family, disagrees that the displays of the Ten Commandments would single out any students or teachers in schools who do not have Christian beliefs.",
      "\"As a parent, I would be excited to see the Ten Commandments posted on my student's wall,\" Hunt told CBS News. \"They serve not only as moral guidelines for the individuals and for society, things like do not murder do not commit adultery, these are things that help to create a thriving community, and a thriving nation.\"",
      "\"It's a symbol of religious freedom in America,\" she added.",

    "summary": "After Hurricane Helene, Taylor Schenker found herself with about 200 family photos that didn't belong to her. Now, she's hoping to reunite them with the people they belong to.",
    "story": [
      "We've seen the images of destruction, debris and flooding left behind from Hurricane Helene. But other images also came out of the storm: family photos \u2013 snapshots of happy memories and important milestones \u2013 left behind in the mess.",
      "After the deadly hurricane in October, Taylor Schenker, who lives in Canton, North Carolina, nearby hard-hit Asheville, found herself with about 200 family photos that didn't belong to her.",
      "It started after the storm. Schenker's house weathered Helene well, but she said her friend's entire home was destroyed by flooding from the Swannanoa River. At least 220 people across six states died in the hurricane, including over 40 in Buncombe County, which includes Asheville.",
      "Schenker and her friend went for a walk to check out the home, which was one of the many in Asheville that was destroyed.",
      "\"We spent about four hours digging through the mud, looking for any belongings of hers we could find, because her house literally just doesn't exist anymore,\" Schenker told CBS News last month. \"And during that process, I found about four of five individual photographs and we laid out the photos \u2013 along with some clothes and we found an American flag \u2013 along the bank, hoping they would be reunited with people.\"",
      "Schenker said thinking about the photos she left behind kept her up that night. \"Just thinking, 'Here are these little photographs that miraculously made it through all of this and now are sitting here and what if it rains or what if the wind blows and they aren't able to be reunited with their family,'\" she said. \"That would be such a shame because they made it through all of this. And I know how special a memory like that can really be for somebody.\"",
      "So, Taylor went back the next day to get the photos and ended up finding more. She said it was obvious the photos belonged to multiple families.",
      "\"It was [a photo of] a middle school basketball team. It was a photo of a beloved dog. I found a wedding photo of a bride hugging somebody,\" she said. \"You take photos because you have a moment you want to remember and so, they did all seem just special.\"",
      "Realizing how many important family memories she now had in her possession, she started the Photos from Helene Instagram page \u2014 a virtual lost-and-found. She hoped people would recognize the photos on her page and word of mouth would help reunite them with their rightful owners.",
      "The Instagram page is filled with school portraits, Christmas cards, images of childhood friends and families on vacation. She even found a photo of Michael Jordan dunking the ball that a local man says his dad snapped years ago.",
      "Schenker took them home, dusted them off and categorized them in folders and bins for safekeeping until they could be returned to their owners.",
      "A post shared by Photos from Helene (@photosfromhelene)",
      "Schenker said she found about 100 photos herself, but picked up about another 100 from other people who found them, including search and rescue teams. At the time of our interview in late October, she said she had returned about 15% of the photos she has collected. She still adds new photos to Instagram daily.",
      "Each reunion is a heartwarming reminder that what she's doing is important. \"Being able to have that moment where you hand something so special to somebody and then also just give them a hug \u2013 because they've lost likely their entire home in this situation \u2013 it's such a privilege to have an insight into this moment in their lives through these photographs and be able to give them back to them,\" she said.",
      "Schenker mails photos to people who are no longer in the area, but she also hand delivers the ones that belong to families who stayed close by. In one case, a college-aged son found his family's photos on her Instagram, reached out to Schenker and connected her with his mom.",
      "\"We have now found five photos of this one family, of these two sons, and when I met with the mom to reunite the photos, she shared that one of her sons had actually passed,\" Schenker said. \"And so, when they lost their home, they lost all memory of this child. Which is absolutely devastating in addition to the devastation that has already happened.\"",
      "She said she recently went for another so-called photo walk \u2013 where she digs through debris to find images \u2013 and recognized the woman's late son in yet another photo.",
      "Becky and Nancy Tate, a mother-daughter duo, also found old family photos through the Instagram page. \"It was an extremely strange feeling to just be scrolling on social media and randomly see a picture of me when I was 10 in front of a Christmas tree,\" Nancy Tate told CBS News on Instagram. \"That's how I found out about Photos from Helene, a total fluke and scrolling and seeing a picture of me covered in dirt.\"",
      "\"A very surreal feeling to know all of your belongings and photos have been lost, and then to realize that some person you've never met is trying to help people locate these pictures, just out of the kindness of their heart,\" Nancy said. \"That truly sums up the Asheville community.\"",
      "Nancy tagged her mom in the Instagram comments, saying her mom cried when she saw it. Becky told CBS News she felt a combination of joy and shock \u2013 \"a time of high adrenaline and disbelief.\"",
      "Schenker said that many families who lived in the same neighborhood before the hurricane have recognized other people's photos on the Photos from Helene Instagram page and helped connect each other to Schenker.",
      "\"The process is definitely fulfilling,\" she said. \"It's fun to see the moment that a photograph is reunited and to see the people in the comments tagging each other and saying, 'Hey, is this you?' or 'Oh my gosh, you just reminded me of this moment in my life that I had totally forgotten about.'\"",
      "She said she chose her Instagram's name because most of the photos we've seen come out of the hurricane show the devastation left behind \u2013 but her photos from Helene are happy memories of Asheville and the lives lived there.",
      "\"You still can't go to the grocery store without seeing piles of debris,\" she said. \"And I think that has definitely made me and others celebrate these wins even bigger. Because you have to in order to get through the day to day now.\"",

He also said Tuesday he had chosen former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee as ambassador to Israel and his longtime friend Steven Witkoff to be a special envoy to the Middle East.",
      "Ratcliffe, who was a GOP congressman from Texas, served as director of national intelligence in the final months of Trump's first term, leading the U.S. government's spy agencies during the coronavirus pandemic.

    "summary": "Senator-elect Ruben Gallego has some advice for Democrats: \"Go touch grass and meet real Latinos.\"",
    "story": [
      "As Democrats work to sort out last week's election results and determine why they lost Latino men in droves, a Latino Democrat and senator-elect has some advice for party leaders and top consultants: \"Go touch grass and meet real Latinos.\"",
      "CBS News Tuesday projected Gallego as the victor in Arizona's U.S. Senate contest against Republican Kari Lake. He believes much of his party is out of touch with a key demographic he says they can't win national elections without.",
      "\"There is no winning nationally without Latinos,\" Gallego said in an extensive interview with CBS News senior White House and political correspondent Ed O'Keefe Tuesday. \"...There's no path forward into the Democratic Party, into a national party, without Latinos.\"",
      "Exit polls show Vice President Kamala Harris lost Latino men to President-elect Donald Trump \u2014 a significant blow to a party that's long relied on them as part of a broad coalition. The results were openly feared most of the past year by Democratic Party leaders and operatives.",
      "Going forward, Gallego said candidates need to go out and find Latinos where they already are. Gallego focused on bringing his campaign to Latino voters \u2014 sometimes, without talking about politics at all. His campaign hosted rodeos, boxing match watch parties, and carne asada cookouts. His team took food to construction shift workers at work sites after they'd clocked out in the early morning. Knocking on people's doors, after shift workers are exhausted and preparing for the next day, won't work, he said.",
      "\"Talk to them. And talk to them as often as possible,\" Gallego said. \"And don't expect you to be able to talk to them one way through TV.\"",
      "There are \"millions and millions\" of Latino men out there, Gallego said, and they're not afraid to speak their mind.",
      "Democrats on the national stage also missed the mark in how they spoke about immigration. Gallego's first Spanish-language TV ad was about border security. Latinos in Arizona looked at the migration crisis at the border, with refugees pouring into the country, and called it \"chaos,\" Gallego said.",
      "While campaigning, \"We didn't actually speak about immigration reform because we know that the Latino voter just doesn't believe it anymore,\" Gallego said, meaning, Latino voters don't believe Washington will actually pass a massive immigration reform bill in the near future.",
      "Instead, Congress needs to focus on fortifying U.S.-Mexico border security first to build trust, he said.",
      "But that message, O'Keefe suggested, may be a hard pill to swallow for fellow Democrats.",
      "\"I'm a pharmacist about to give out very hard pills in the Senate,\" Gallego said.",
      "Gallego also hinted that Democrats missed the mark on addressing inflation. Born on the south side of Chicago to a Colombian mother and a Mexican father, with his mother raising four children alone, Gallego said he knows what it's like to grow up struggling. He saw the flashing warning signs on inflation, not just in the polls, but as he talked with his working-class family members and constituents.",
      "\"Growing up working class, there's nothing more hurtful than working hard and then not being able to provide for your family,\" Gallego said. \"And I instinctively knew that's what these men were going through.\"",
      "\"This is the first time I've ever seen men say I can't do this,\" Gallego said. \"I can't keep working, and it's still not making a difference, and that's when I realized it was really kind of a problem.\"",
      "Raised by his mother, Gallego became a U.S. Marine and served in the Iraq war. He moved to Arizona for a local political job, ran and won a seat in the state House before winning his first congressional race in 2014, representing most of Phoenix and Glendale.",
      "He began on Capitol Hill with an outspoken progressive reputation and was among the Democrats calling on the U.S. Senate to abandon the filibuster. But Gallego has shifted his politics to the center in recent years, a reflection of the state's roughly three-way voter registration split between Democrats, Republicans and independents.",
      "He launched his Senate campaign nearly two years ago, focusing early advertising and outreach on his military service, a key credential in a state with a hefty military and veteran population and a history of electing military veterans, including the late Republican Sen. John McCain, to Congress. With nominal Democratic primary opposition and polls giving him an early lead, independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema announced in March she would not run for reelection, avoiding a three-way contest.",
      "Until Sinema won her Senate race in 2018, a Democrat hadn't been elected to the Senate in Arizona in three decades, though Sinema went on to leave the party. Then in 2020, Sen. Mark Kelly, a Democrat, won a competitive Senate race to serve the remainder of McCain's term after his death.",
      "In his race, Gallego wasn't about to give up on Trump voters \u2014 or any voters, he said.",
      "A rising star in the party \u2014 a veteran and Latino who was victorious in a state Trump won \u2014 Gallego brushed off questions about a future bid for president.",
      "\"Can I rule out running? I can \u2014 I can rule out a lot of things,\" Gallego said. \"First thing I want to focus on is this U.S. Senate race.\"",
      "\"That's not a no,\" O'Keefe pointed out.",
      "\"It's not a yes, either,\" Gallego said, adding a Spanish word for patience: \"C\u00e1lmate.\"",

Texas, Alabama and Indiana were the top three states with new patients purchasing emergency contraceptives on those dates, Monica Cepak, CEO of Wisp, said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "\"We saw a similar situation unfold when\u00a0Roe v. Wade was overturned and are not surprised that women are once again taking their healthcare into their own hands by stockpiling these medications,\" Cepak said.",
      "Appointments and searches for long-acting reversible birth control methods also surged following the election.",
      "Planned Parenthood, a nonprofit that provides sexual and reproductive health services and information, reported appointments for intrauterine devices, or IUDs, increased by 760% on Nov. 6. Appointments for birth control implants increased 350% compared with the previous day and vasectomy appointments increased by 1200%, the organization said.",
      "\"Americans may be rightfully feeling fearful and worried about the prospect of further restrictions on our freedom to control our bodies. Waking up on November 6, they rushed to Planned Parenthood for help,\" Danika Severino Wynn, vice president of care and access for Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said.",
      "Wynn said Planned Parenthood tracked similar trends in 2022 following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, as well as after the 2016 presidential election. According to a 2019 study published\u00a0JAMA Internal Medicine, the daily rate of insertions of long-acting reversible contraceptives increased more than 21% in the 30 days after Trump's win in 2016, compared with the 30 days before.",
      "Trump has boasted about his role in overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark case in which the Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution generally protected the right of women to have an abortion before the point of viability. In an interview with CBS News in August, Trump said he had \"no regrets\" over his Supreme Court picks that led to the reversal. During Trump's first term, his administration also restricted the availability of funding for contraception, leaving many worried about what a second term could bring.",
      "His stance on other reproductive rights issues has wavered. In a May interview, Trump was asked if he supports any restrictions on a person's right to contraceptives, to which he responded, \"We're looking at that.\" He later retracted this by saying on Truth Social he has \"NEVER, AND WILL NEVER ADVOCATE IMPOSING RESTRICTIONS ON BIRTH CONTROL, or other contraceptives.\" The inconsistency left some questioning what his exact plan would be when he takes up his second term.",
      "Dr. Elise Berlan, a faculty physician at Nationwide Children's Hospital, said her advice for people who are worried is to talk to a trusted professional.",

    "summary": "The National Toy Hall of Fame in Rochester, New York, has enshrined a new class of honorees.",
    "story": [
      "My Little Pony finally made it to the winner's circle.",
      "After years as an also-ran, the pastel-colored ponies were enshrined in the National Toy Hall of Fame on Tuesday, along with Transformers action figures and the Phase 10 card game.",
      "The honorees rose to the top in voting by a panel of experts and the public from among 12 finalists. This year's field included: the party game Apples to Apples, balloons, \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" gamebooks, Hess Toy Trucks, Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game, remote-controlled vehicles, Sequence, the stick horse and trampoline.",
      "\"These are three very deserving toys that showcase the wide range of how people play,\" Christopher Bensch, vice president for collections and chief curator, said in a statement. \"But for My Little Pony in particular, this year is extra validating. The beloved toy was a finalist seven times before finally crossing the finish line!\"",
      "Hasbro's mini-horses, distinguishable by different \"cutie marks\" on their haunches, were introduced in the 1980s and reintroduced in 2003, outselling even Barbie for several years.",
      "The collectibles were recognized for encouraging fantasy and storytelling \u2014 the kind of creative play the Hall of Fame demands of inductees \u2014 along with popularity over time.",
      "\"The My Little Pony line has endured for decades because it combines several traditional forms of doll play with children's fascination with horses,\" said Michelle Parnett-Dwyer, curator of dolls and toys. \"The variety of figures promotes collecting as a pastime, too.\"",
      "Transformers",
      "Transformers came along in the 1980s, when Hasbro bought the rights to several existing Japanese toy lines featuring transforming robots. They were first marketed with a cartoon and have since graduated to a series of live-action films. Social media sites allow for debates over which figures are must-haves, as well as demonstrations of the sometimes complex process of manipulating them from robot to vehicle or other alternate form.",
      "Regular new Transformers characters keep collectors coming back, Bensch said, \"but the toys are also popular because they are so suited to the ways kids play. The toy line feeds kids' imaginations and fantasy play.\"",
      "Phase 10",
      "Also inducted was Phase 10, which was introduced by inventor and entrepreneur\u00a0Ken Johnson\u00a0in 1982. Today, Mattel sells 2 million decks of the card game annually in 30 countries and more than 20 languages. That makes it one of the bestselling card games in the world, according to the Strong National Museum of Play in Rochester, where the Toy Hall of Fame is housed.",
      "In the style of rummy, the game challenges players to collect groups of cards to complete 10 phases in sequential order before their opponents.",
      "\"Whether played in its original form or in one of its variations, Phase 10 has become an iconic game title that continues to encourage multigenerational social and competitive play,\" said Mirek Stolee, the museum's curator of board games and puzzles.",
      "Anyone can nominate a toy for the Hall of Fame. Museum staff narrows the field to 12 finalists each year. Fans can cast votes online for their favorites and their results are counted alongside ballots from a national advisory committee of historians, educators and others with industry expertise.",

    "title": "Trump to nominate Mike Huckabee to be U.S. ambassador to Israel",
    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 15:13:11 -0500",
    "summary": "Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee has said he has visited Israel more than 100 times over the course of five decades.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump announced Tuesday that he has selected former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee to serve as the U.S. ambassador to Israel.",
      "\"Mike has been a great public servant, governor, and leader in faith for many years,\" Trump said in a statement. \"He loves Israel, and the people of Israel, and likewise, the people of Israel love him. Mike will work tirelessly to bring about Peace in the Middle East!\"",
      "The post requires approval by the Senate, though Huckabee is unlikely to face major obstacles to confirmation in the upper chamber, where Republicans are expected to hold at least 52 seats in the next Congress.",
      "Huckabee is among the early picks announced by the president-elect as he begins building out his Cabinet and other key posts. Among those are Rep. Elise Stefanik as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and Rep. Michael Waltz as national security adviser. Sources say he is expected to tap Florida Sen. Marco Rubio for secretary of state, though the selection is not finalized.",
      "Huckabee served as Arkansas' governor from 1996 to 2007 and unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2008 and 2016. After leaving office, he hosted a show on Fox News and a radio program. He is a staunch defender of Israel and has said he has visited the country more than 100 times over the course of 50 years.",
      "During his first term, Trump moved the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem during his first term, which President Biden maintained.",
      "If confirmed next year, Huckabee will take over the post amid Isreal's war with Hamas and Hamas' holding of dozens of Israeli hostages, including four American citizens. Discussions about a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas have repeatedly stalled, and on Saturday, Qatar, a mediator with Hamas, announced it had suspended its efforts and would resume them when \"the parties show their willingness and seriousness to end the brutal war and the ongoing suffering of civilians.\"",
      "Sen. Bill Hagerty, a Republican from Tennessee, said in an interview with \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that he believes \"the environment has totally changed\" following Trump's victory over Vice President Kamala Harris last week.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he has spoken with Trump three times in recent days and called the conversations \"good and very important.\" Israeli President Isaac Herzog met with Mr. Biden at the White House on Tuesday.",
      "More than 1,200 civilians were killed and 250 were abducted when Hamas launched its terror attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Roughly 100 hostages are believed to be still in Gaza, although a third are thought to be dead. More than 43,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, though it is unclear how many are civilians and how many are militants.",
      "Following the start of Israel's war with Hamas, Iran-allied Hezbollah, began firing rockets, missiles and drones from Lebanon into Israel.",

    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 14:52:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has vowed to combat \"the chronic disease epidemic in this country\" in the Trump administration, with the slogan \"Make America Healthy Aagain.\"",
    "story": [
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has outlined a number of promises to \"Make America Healthy Again\" under President-elect Donald Trump, vowing to combat an \"epidemic\" of chronic diseases that he has described as an \"existential\" threat to America's future.",
      "All are under the banner of fighting what Kennedy sees as a common thread behind a broad swath of ailments: that Americans have been \"mass poisoned by big pharma and big food,\" and that federal agencies have failed to stop it. In response, he has also floated a number of specific policy ideas to remake the federal government's public health institutions.",
      "\"[Trump] asked me to end the chronic disease epidemic in this country. And he said, I want to see results, measurable results in the diminishment of chronic disease within two years. And I said, Mr. President, I will do that,\" Kennedy said on Nov. 2.",
      "Authority for a MAHA agenda",
      "Kennedy's allies say Trump's election is also a mandate for their platform of health proposals, which they say delivered key votes for the president-elect. Trump has promised to let Kennedy \"go wild\" on health issues.",
      "\"The American people re-elected President Trump by resounding margins because they trust his judgement and support his policies, including his promise to Make America Healthy Again alongside well-respected leaders like RFK Jr.,\" Karoline Leavitt, Trump-Vance Transition spokeswoman, told CBS News in a statement.",
      "Some ideas in Kennedy's wide-ranging platform have evolved since his original longshot\u00a0presidential campaign. He has acknowledged Trump does not agree with him on every policy.",
      "The president-elect has listed oil and gas as one off-limits issue for Kennedy. In the past, Kennedy has been critical of \"big oil\" and natural gas, over the fatal toll of fossil fuel pollution and climate change.",
      "Several of Kennedy's ideas would require presidential or congressional action to implement, though it is possible that they could be supercharged by emergency powers.",
      "\"I'm going to urge President Trump on day one to do the same thing they did in COVID, which is to declare a national emergency, but not for infectious disease, but for chronic disease,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 26.",
      "Staff changes at federal agencies",
      "Kennedy claims a number of health issues have worsened due to federal inaction, including autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, sleep disorders, infertility rates, diabetes and obesity.",
      "He aims to address that by replacing many staff throughout the agencies, which Kennedy has accused of being too sympathetic to large food and drug companies. As a co-chair of Trump's transition, Kennedy has been vetting a slate of staffers who could fill top positions throughout the Trump administration.",
      "Kennedy has said Trump tasked him with returning agencies \"to their rich tradition of gold-standard, evidence-based science.\" He has also said \"medical expertise\" is not the priority for all staff picks.",
      "\"What we don't really need at HHS is more medical expertise. What we need is an expertise on decoupling the agency from institutional corruption. Because it's the corruption that has distorted the science,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 30.",
      "Kennedy has said he hopes \"to have every nutritional scientist\" across the Department of Health and Human Services and U.S. Department of Agriculture \"fired on Day One.\"",
      "Kennedy himself has been floated to head the Department of Health and Human Services, though some allies say he could be more effective in a \"czar\" type role out of the White House.",
      "\"Get the chemicals out\" of food",
      "When talking about his platform, Kennedy often lampoons products like McDonald's French fries or Fruit Loops cereal as examples of how foods sold in the U.S. are made with ingredients that are banned or discouraged abroad, or have changed for the worse.",
      "\"It's easy to fix. We have a thousand ingredients in our foods that are illegal in Italy and other countries in Europe,\" he said on Oct. 29.",
      "Trump agrees with his plans to \"get the chemicals out\" of America's food supply, Kennedy says, which also includes upending the use of common pesticides and herbicides by American farmers.",
      "Kennedy has described the food in the U.S. as \"just poison,\" citing his own anecdotal experience with his son struggling with eczema while eating pasta in the U.S.",
      "\"When he ate any kind of pasta in this country, he would get these terrible, terrible outbreaks, you know, really agonizing. And he moved to Italy and he lived off of pasta for a year and a half and he never got a case,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 19.",
      "Kennedy suspects that was caused by glyphosate, used in Roundup brand weed-killers, which Italy moved to start restricting in 2016. Italy's decision was over worries that it could pose a cancer risk, and some advocacy groups in the U.S. have also voiced similar concerns.",
      "Agricultural trade associations have defended glyphosate as \"one of the safest, most effective\" tools farmers have to manage weeds and support \"important conservation practices.\"",
      "Kennedy's plea to crack down on food additives and chemicals comes as the FDA is in the middle of launching its own new effort \u2014 and is calling on Congress to step up funding for \u2014 scrutinizing chemicals currently allowed in foods.",
      "Food industry groups have generally voiced support for the FDA to step up its vetting of chemicals in food, in hopes that it \"negates the ill advised and disruptive state by state patchwork\" of legislatures drawing up their own restrictions.",
      "Reducing unhealthy and processed foods in federal programs",
      "Kennedy has also promised to \"get processed food out of school lunch immediately\" and voiced frustration over the amount of federal food assistance for low-income Americans that goes towards sugary drinks and processed food.",
      "One way Kennedy could try to get at this issue is through the federal dietary guidelines process, jointly run by the USDA and HHS, which is in the final stages of crafting the next edition of recommendations that influence a broad range of government nutrition programs.",
      "\"Kids shouldn't be eating grains. They should definitely not be eating seed oils. And they for sure should not be eating sugar. And yet that is what we're forcing them to eat,\" he said on Sept. 26.",
      "On seed oils, Kennedy has claimed that the switch away from oils like beef tallow which were high in saturated fats in favor of vegetable oils was a mistake, and is to blame for a rise in obesity rates. That puts him at odds with longstanding recommendations to limit saturated fats.",
      "\"The guidance around this has been reviewed many times since, and has only become stronger in its conclusion for the role of saturated fat, particularly in its relationship with higher risks of cardiovascular disease,\" Deirdre Tobias, a researcher on this year's Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, said last month.",
      "Grains have been more divisive at this year's committee and the broader scientific community, which has debated setting lower limits to overall grain consumption alongside recommendations to switch from refined to whole grains.",
      "Setting new limits is difficult, scientists on the panel have said, because the only source of some key nutrients for many Americans is cereals and breads fortified with vitamins.",
      "Kennedy has also been critical of the panel of outside researchers put together to create the scientific report underpinning the recommendations, but acknowledges broader changes will also be needed to move the needle.",
      "While Kennedy says he personally would \"never eat anything in a package\" as a rule of thumb, he acknowledges \"most people don't have access to the resources I have.\"",
      "\"We need to start forcing these companies to internalize their costs. So the illusion of cheap food goes away, right? Because if you're drinking Coke and it seems cheap and it gives you diabetes over the long run, that's not very cheap,\" he said on Sept. 30.",
      "Curbing the influence of drugmakers",
      "Kennedy has called for a \"review\" of guidelines that govern advertising by pharmaceutical companies.",
      "The FDA currently regulates advertising about prescription drugs, going after drugmakers that misrepresent their products. Responsibility for some other medical products is shared between the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission.",
      "Kennedy has urged Trump to go further, saying he is advising the president-elect to \"ban pharmaceutical advertising on TV\" over concerns that it is influencing news coverage of health issues.",
      "He has also urged reform of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, which charges pharmaceutical companies millions of dollars for the cost of the FDA vetting their applications to decide whether to approve new drugs.",
      "\"We need to end the corruption. 50% of FDA's budget comes not from the taxpayer, but from the pharmaceutical industry,\" he said on Sept. 26.",
      "Kennedy has not said how Congress or the Trump administration would make up the difference from the fees if they were cut, which amount to around $3 billion out of FDA's budget.",
      "Undoing the fees could leave taxpayers effectively subsidizing a hefty bill previously paid for by drugmakers \u2014 or a return to the significant delays for new medications that initially spurred the creation of the fees.",
      "Promoting alternatives to drugs",
      "Kennedy has accused the FDA of waging a \"war on public health\" which he says includes \"aggressive suppression\" of anything \"that advances human health and can't be patented by Pharma.\"",
      "In his view, that includes treatments like psychedelics, which recently fell short of FDA approval, and foods like raw milk, which officials have stepped up warnings against amid this year's unprecedented bird flu outbreak on dairy farms.",
      "Kennedy has also praised the dietary supplement industry for a court win against the FDA, after the agency tried to take action against what it said was an illegally marketed anti-aging drug.",
      "Also on Kennedy's list are things like \"clean foods\" and exercise, which he wants to allow Medicare and Medicaid to cover.",
      "The promise has echoes of the \"food is medicine\" initiative, which has called for the health care system to offer more financial support for healthier lifestyle habits.",
      "\"If a doctor's patient has diabetes or obesity, the doctor ought to be able to say, I'm going to recommend gym membership, and I'm going to recommend, good food and Medicaid ought to be able to finance those things the same as they would Ozempic,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 30.",
      "Kennedy has also promised to promote healthier lifestyles in other ways, ranging from requiring nutrition classes in federally funded medical schools to reviving the presidential fitness test in schools.",
      "\"Informed choices\" on vaccines",
      "Kennedy has a long record criticizing the safety of vaccines, including recent misleading claims that shots have an \"exemption from pre-licensing safety testing\" before they are approved.",
      "In fact, the FDA requires new vaccines be studied for their safety and efficacy in large trials, results of which are published in peer-reviewed journals and publicly disclosed.",
      "His activism on the issue dates back decades, including a now-retracted article he published in Rolling Stone in 2005 claiming a link between autism and an ingredient called thimerosal that had been used in vaccines before 2001 \u2014 which medical research has disproven. His focus has broadened since then.",
      "\"This doesn't mean vaccines is the only cause of autism. Our kids today are swimming around in a toxic soup coming mainly from their foods that operate along the same biological pathways. But some of it's coming from pharmaceutical drugs,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 19.",
      "Kennedy has insisted that is not \"anti-vaccine\" and would not seek to ban them under Trump, instead saying he wants to \"restore the transparency\" around them \u2014 echoing lawsuits by the group he chaired, Children's Health Defense, over its Freedom of Information Act requests.",
      "\"[Trump] doesn't want me to take vaccines away from people. If you want to take a vaccine, you ought to be able to take it. We believe in free choice in this country. You ought to know the risks and benefits of everything you take,\" Kennedy said on Nov. 2.",
      "But Kennedy has also asserted \"there's no vaccine that is safe and effective,\" and encouraged people to \"resist\" CDC guidelines on vaccines for kids \u2014 raising concern among public health officials, who point to the success of vaccination in saving millions of children worldwide from debilitating illness or premature death from preventable diseases.",
      "Opposing water fluoridation",
      "Ahead of the election, Kennedy said one of Trump's first acts in the White House would be to \"advise all U.S. water systems to remove fluoride from public water.\"",
      "While a number of health risks have been tied to higher levels of fluoride, most are extremely rare in the U.S. and involve far greater exposure than what is added to drinking water.",
      "Fluoride has been incorporated into a majority of U.S. water systems for decades. The American Dental Association estimates that the practice has reduced tooth decay by about 25%, though some research suggests modern use of toothpaste with fluoride has reduced the policy's benefits.",
      "Kennedy's announcement does come as the Environmental Protection Agency is now under a federal court order to take action over one specific risk: the concern that fluoride might lower children's IQ \"at dosages that are far too close to fluoride levels in the drinking water of the United States,\" stemming in large part from a report published by the National Institutes of Health.",
      "Beyond influencing what rule the Trump administration's EPA ends up pursuing in response to the order, Kennedy could also take aim at fluoride through another route: changing the CDC's widely-cited statement about the practice, which hails water fluoridation as one of the greatest \"public health achievements of the 20th century.\"",
      "Kennedy himself has described fluoride as \"a poison\" and praised the nonprofits for suing over the issue.",
      "\"The simple answer is I don't like it,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 30.",

But the October price decline signasl that shoppers could get more relief ahead in the grocery aisles, with a Credit Karma survey in May\u00a0finding that about one-quarter of Americans had skipped a meal due to food costs.",
      "Grocery inflation more broadly has also cooled after hitting a pandemic-era peak of 13.5% in August 2022. In September, the cost of food that consume at home rose 1.3%, below the Federal Reserve's goal of driving inflation down to a 2% annual rate. And grocery prices may remain relatively flat in 2025, with the USDA projecting that food-at-home costs will increase only 1.6% next year.",
      "More broadly, online prices across all product categories dropped 2.9% in October from a year earlier, Adobe said. The decline was led by drops in prices for clothing and toys, which fell about 10% and 4%, respectively.",

    "story": [
      "A Texas man has been sentenced to life in prison for the murder of his cousin after a family pet helped identify him as the killer, authorities said.",
      "The body of Mandy Rose Reynolds was found burning in a storage container in a field in McLennan County, Texas on April 5, 2023, according to the district attorney's office. The remains were burned beyond recognition, and a .380 shell casing was found inside the container. Responding officers also found a white dog which barked frantically and refused to leave the scene or be captured, officials said. The body was removed, and the next morning, a citizen reported seeing the dog sitting in the same spot it had been.",
      "Officials took custody of the dog, which they later learned was named Titan. They found the canine had a microchip and were able to identify it as having belonged to Reynolds. This led police to suspect Reynolds was the person whose body had been found. They went to her home and found it completely empty, with all her possessions, including her car, missing.",
      "Two days later, a man was spotted driving Reynolds' car near Wichita, Kansas. Police attempted to pull the driver over, but he started a high-speed chase, reaching speeds of over 100 miles per hour before crashing into another vehicle. The driver then fled on foot, running into a grocery store and hiding behind canned goods. He was quickly found by police and taken into custody. A .380 handgun was found inside the car.",
      "The driver was identified as Derek Daigneault, 29, a cousin of Reynolds'. Police began to investigate his movements between the discovery of Reynolds' body and the car chase. Security footage from an area Wal-Mart showed Daigneault purchasing a storage container that matched the one Reynolds' body was found burning in. He had also purchased a shovel and a gas can in the same visit.",
      "Video showed Daigneault driving away from the store in Reynolds' car, officials said. In the footage, Titan can be seen sticking his head out the window of the vehicle. He also had Reynolds' phone, which police used to track his location.",
      "The gun in the vehicle was determined to be Reynolds' grandmother's weapon and matched the shell casing found with her body, according to CBS affiliate KWTX.",
      "Daigneault was reportedly on felony probation with a warrant out for his arrest at the time of the murder, KWTX reported. He convinced Reynolds to drive from San Marcos, Texas to Kansas to pick him up, and she allowed him to stay with her for about a month before the murder, the station reported.",
      "Daigneault has previous felony convictions for aggravated burglary, attempted aggravated robbery, aggravated assault, possession of methamphetamine, attempted interference with law enforcement, criminal discharge of a firearm at a residence, fleeing officers, aggravated battery and criminal possession of a weapon by a felon, according to KWTX.",
      "Jurors deliberated for about 40 minutes before returning with a life sentence on November 7. Daigneault\u00a0  will be eligible for parole in 30 years, KWTX reported. An attorney for Daigneault said they will appeal the verdict.",
      "In a statement, McLennan County assistant district attorneys Ryan Calvert and Alyssa Killin, who prosecuted the murder, called Titan a \"heroic and loyal dog\" and said he served as one of the \"keys to this case.\"",

    "story": [
      "Covering your surfboard in bright lights sounds like an open invitation to great white sharks, but research released Tuesday by Australian scientists found it might actually stave off attacks.",

    "summary": "The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, resigned after a review found he and other Anglican Church leaders covered up \"prolific and abhorrent\" abuse of boys and young men.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, head of the Anglican Church, resigned Tuesday after a review found that he and other senior church leaders had covered up the \"prolific and abhorrent\" abuse of over 100 boys and young men in the United Kingdom and other countries by a British lawyer who helped lead Christian summer camps in the U.K. and other countries.",
      "John Smyth was accused of attacking boys and young men he met at Christian camps in the 1970s and 1980s. He died in South Africa in 2018 at the age of 77 without ever facing any legal proceedings.",
      "\"The last few days have renewed my long felt and profound sense of shame at the historic safeguarding failures of the Church of England,\" Welby said in a statement announcing his resignation. \"For nearly twelve years I have struggled to introduce improvements. It is for others to judge what has been done.\"",
      "An independent Church of England review into the handling of complaints against Smyth found last week that, \"despite the efforts of some individuals to bring the abuse to the attention of authorities, the responses by the Church of England and others were wholly ineffective and amounted to a coverup,\" the leader of the review said.",
      "\"I am so sorry that in places where these young men, and boys, should have felt safe and where they should have experienced God's love for them, they were subjected to physical, sexual, psychological and spiritual abuse,\" Welby said in an initial statement responding to the review's findings. \"I am sorry that concealment by many people who were fully aware of the abuse over many years meant that John Smyth was able to abuse overseas and died before he ever faced justice.\"",
      "Welby has said he was unaware of Smyth's abuse until 2013, the year he became the archbishop.",
      "\"Nevertheless the review is clear that I personally failed to ensure that after disclosure in 2013 the awful tragedy was energetically investigated,\" Welby said. \"Since that time the way in which the Church of England engages with victims and survivors has changed beyond recognition. Checks and balances introduced seek to ensure that the same could not happen today.\"",
      "The Archbishop of Canterbury is the most senior figure in the Church of England, also known as the Anglican Church. The U.S.-based Episcopal Church, which has 1.6 million members, is part of the worldwide Anglican Communion and there are over 7,000 Episcopal churches across the U.S.",
      "Welby has played a central role in many high-profile events, including officiating the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, and delivering the sermon at the state funeral of Queen Elizabeth II.",
      "\"I think, rightly, people are asking the question: 'Can we really trust the Church of England to keep us safe?' And I think the answer at the moment is 'no,'\" Bishop of Newcastle Helen-Ann Hartley told CBS News' partner network BBC News, calling on Welby to resign.",
      "Andrew Morse, who told the BBC he was abused for years by Smyth as a teenager, had also called for Welby to resign. He said Welby's \"admission that in 2013, which is really modern day in comparison to the 1970s and 1980s, that he didn't do enough, that he wasn't rigorous\u2026 is enough in my mind to confirm that Justin Welby, along with countless other Anglican churchmen, were part of a cover-up about the abuse.\"",
      "Morse said he was beaten several times by Smyth during his youth, and that further abuse could have been stopped if Welby had acted when he found out about Smyth's actions in 2013.",
      "\"It is those African lives and those African victims that are very much on my conscience \u2014 and I would hope on the archbishop's conscience too.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 12:20:05 -0500",
    "summary": "Facing low birth rates and an aging population, Russia is set to ban any information deemed to promote a \"rejection of childbearing.\"",
    "story": [
      "Moscow\u00a0\u2014 Russian lawmakers on Tuesday passed controversial legislation banning \"propaganda\" that urges people to opt against having children, the latest measure targeting what Moscow depicts as Western liberal ideas. Facing an ageing population and low birth rates, Moscow is seeking to reverse a demographic slump \u2014 accentuated by its ongoing full-scale invasion of neighboring Ukraine \u2014 that threatens its economic future.",
      "Members of the Russian parliament's lower house, the Duma, voted unanimously in favor of the draft bill, which would apply to materials online, in media, advertising and in films that promote a \"rejection of childbearing.\"",
      "The bill targets \"destructive content\" that promotes a \"conscious\" rejection of having children.",
      "The bill's authors have said it will not be used as punishment for \"a personal choice or lifestyle\" but only for promoting such a lifestyle, although it is unclear how this would be differentiated in practice.",
      "Under the ban on \"child-free propaganda,\" violations would be punishable by fines up to 400,000 rubles (about $4,000) on individuals and up to 5 million rubles, or about $51,000, for businesses. The bill also includes a provision to deport foreigners found guilty of disseminating the banned information.",
      "\"This is a fateful law... Without children, there will be no country. This ideology will lead to people stopping giving birth to children,\" the Duma's speaker Vyacheslav Volodin said ahead of the vote.",
      "He also said the legislation was about \"protecting citizens, primarily the generation growing up, from information spread in the media space that negatively affects the development of personality.\"",
      "The effort was \"so new generations of our citizens grow up orientated towards traditional family values\", he said.",
      "Nina Ostanina, a Communist Party lawmaker who heads the Duma committee on family policy, said the bill aims to \"guard our youth from unnecessary ideologies.\"",
      "The legislation will now be considered by the upper house of parliament on November 20, before coming before President Vladimir Putin, who is expected to sign it into law.",
      "It comes on top of existing bans on \"propaganda\" of LGBTQ relationships or changing gender.",
      "The Duma also unanimously passed legislation Tuesday banning foreigners living in countries that allow gender reassignment from adopting Russian children. The bill is aimed at stopping Russian-born children being able to legally change their gender.",
      "Moscow has long portrayed itself as a bulwark against liberal values, but that trend has hugely accelerated since the Kremlin launched its Ukraine offensive, further rupturing ties with the West.",
      "The bill would ban adoption by citizens of countries that authorize \"the change of sex by medical intervention, including with the use of medicine,\" or allow individuals to change their gender on official identity documents.",
      "Since 1993, foreigners have adopted 102,403 children from Russia, Volodin said, warning that \"Western policy towards children is destructive.\"",
      "Russia previously banned all U.S. adoptions in 2012 with a bill named after a Russian toddler who died of heat stroke in 2008 after his adoptive American father forgot him in a car.",
      "Russia has created an inhospitable environment for LBGTQ people for years. In July 2023, it banned the \"international LGBT movement\" as extremist and made gender reassignment illegal.",
      "Putin himself has repeatedly mocked people who have undergone gender reassignment as well as LGBTQ people.",

      "\"Is that something that happened or didn't?\" Farrell asked her in court, according to the BBC. Hand told the court she could not recall if she had said that to her boyfriend at the time.",
      "McGregor has faced previous sexual assault allegations in the United States.

    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 10:48:03 -0500",
    "summary": "Could the tariffs Trump's threatened to slap on Chinese imports backfire and help Beijing? Some experts say they will.",
    "story": [
      "Hong Kong \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to slap up a tariff of up to 60% on all goods imported to the U.S. from China. While that may sound like a potent economic threat to a country where economic growth is already faltering, could it actually be just what China needs?",
      "\"I do expect U.S.-China economic relations to be more volatile under Trump, but I think overall, this may turn out to be better for China,\" Chen Zhiwu, the top finance professor at the University of Hong Kong and a former professor at Yale University, told CBS News.",
      "Chen said if Trump does follow through with his threat of such steep tariffs on China, it \"might force the leadership in Beijing to have no other choice but to focus on the economy \u2014 especially given that the Chinese economy right now is in very big trouble.\"",
      "Since the start of Trump's first term in the White House, and through President Biden's term, China's economic growth has slowed from roughly 7% to 4.5%. The country's property market has crashed because of massive overbuilding, leading to the rise of empty ghost cities. Youth unemployment rocketed to a new high of nearly 19% in September, dimming prospects for China's future workforce.",
      "Beijing's intense focus over the past decade on bolstering its military to meet its geopolitical ambition of rivaling the U.S. and its European and Asia-Pacific allies has further sacrificed opportunities for domestic economic growth, said Chen.",
      "\"If you count the number of warships, China has by far the highest number of warships than any country, higher than even the U.S.' naval ships. What industries have grown the most so far this year? Definitely those warfare-related industries have gone up the most, but those consumer-oriented industries have had no growth or negative growth,\" he said.",
      "Most of China's top 20 aerospace and defense stocks have recorded double-digit growth over the past year alone.",
      "Tariffs \"a good thing for China for the long term\"?",
      "\"The pressure the U.S. is putting on China will become a good thing for China for the long term,\" agreed Wang Xiangwei, a former editor-in-chief of the Hong Kong-based newspaper South China Morning Post.",
      "China has relied on two primary engines to support rapid economic growth over the past 40 years, since former leader Deng Xiaoping initiated reforms and started opening the country up, Wang told CBS News. Those have been manufacturing cheap exports for the world by leveraging China's long-cheap labor force, and later, spending billions on domestic infrastructure including roads, rail and airports.",
      "But labor has become more expensive with the rise of China's booming middle class, and the government is running out of new things to build across the country.",
      "How China came to dominate the EV market, and what the U.S. can do to catch up",
      "How China came to dominate the EV market, and what the U.S. can do to catch up",
      "Beijing has found it difficult, meanwhile, to fire up a potential third engine of economic growth: The capacity of the country's 1.3 billion people to consume domestically made products.",
      "Trump's threatened tariffs could give a needed external push for that to change, said Wang.",
      "\"I believe China's going to suffer in the short term. In the long term, he's [Trump] going to help China to make that painful transition,\" Wang said, noting that in the U.S., domestic consumption accounts for 70% to 80% of the national GDP, while in China, it's \"only about 60%.\"",
      "In effect, pushing China's own people to buy more of their country's own goods and services could, in the view of the two analysts, prove to be Beijing's best protection against Trump's threatened tariffs.",
      "\"The best tool would be to stimulate consumption growth inside China,\" said Chen. \"At the moment, the leadership has not really tried to help the Chinese consumers by sending them government checks and even tax costs to corporations. I think if the Chinese government really moves in that direction more aggressively, then it would help the Chinese economy generate more internal domestic consumption demand to make up for some of their possible lost exports to the U.S.\"",
      "Beijing needs Washington, but tariffs could have a complex impact",
      "During Trump's first term as president, he imposed tariffs ranging from 10% to 25% on Chinese agricultural products imported to the U.S., including seafood, pork and dairy. Beijing retaliated with its own tariffs, kicking off a trade war between the world's two biggest economies.",
      "Nearly eight years later, however, Beijing appears less able to wage such a war, due to its close economic links with the U.S.",
      "\"In terms of retaliation choices for China, it's very limited,\" said Chen. \"China imports a lot of agricultural products like soybeans, corn. They may try to import more such agricultural products from Brazil, and also from Russia as one of their ways to retaliate against the U.S. But at the end of the day, China imports so much [computer] chips from Nvidia, Intel, especially Qualcomm,\" Wang said. \"Those products are what China needs. So, China cannot produce internally.\"",
      "In effect, if Beijing does impose retaliatory tariffs, it could be shooting itself in the proverbial foot. Tariffs would make all those products, vital to China's continued economic and technological development, more expensive for its own people.",
      "But another possible impact of Trump's expected protectionist policies could actually be to push some of America's oldest allies and trade partners closer to China, reversing the so-called decoupling of the U.S. and Western European economies from Beijing that Washington has pushed under Mr. Biden.",
      "5 ways Trump's next presidency could affect the U.S. economy and your money",
      "5 ways Trump's next presidency could affect the U.S. economy and your money",
      "\"The Biden administration did such a good job to more or less unite that,\" said Chen. \"If Trump makes the EU and NATO member countries upset, that makes it more possible for Germany, for France or Italy or even the U.K. to warm up more with China on the trade front. So, that may help neutralize, to some extent, the negative impact of the expected Trump tariffs on Chinese goods.\"",
      "Trump has claimed repeatedly that foreign companies would foot the bill, effectively absorbing the additional costs of exporting to the U.S. market imposed by his tariffs, but many economists disagree, and say it would effectively be a tax on American consumers.",
      "According to findings released by the National Retail Federation last week, U.S. consumers could lose between $46 billion and $78 billion in spending power per year on everything from clothes and toys to household appliances and travel goods if there is a 60% blanket tariff on Chinese goods.",
      "\"Retailers rely heavily on imported products and manufacturing components so that they can offer their customers a variety of products at affordable prices,\" NRF Vice President of Supply Chain and Customs Policy Jonathan Gold said. \"A tariff is a tax paid by the U.S. importer, not a foreign country or the exporter. This tax ultimately comes out of consumers' pockets through higher prices.\"",
      "All of that said, and despite Trump's history of anti-China rhetoric, it remains unclear how quickly his administration might actually move to roll out sweeping tariffs, with some economists speculating that the president-elect plans, initially at least, to use the threat of additional levies as a cudgel to negotiate more favorable trade terms with Beijing. Trump could also choose to gradually phase in tariffs, delaying their full impact on China's economy.",
      "Will China attack Taiwan, and would Trump come to the rescue?",
      "Trump's return to the White House may also help Beijing further its interests with Taiwan, the democratically governed island of 23 million people just off China's east coast that the country considers a renegade province. President Xi Jinping has vowed to bring Taiwan back under Beijing's control, by force if necessary.",
      "Since the U.S. government enacted the Taiwan Relations Act in 1979, the U.S. is strategically committed to aid in Taiwan's defense in the event of any aggression, including by selling weapons to the island's government.",
      "Open to interpretation, however, and left deliberately vague in the U.S. law, is whether Washington is obligated to directly defend Taiwan, using the power of the American military, if it does come under attack.",
      "President Biden, during his first term, said Washington would, breaking with the long-time policy of \"strategic ambiguity\" that the Biden White House later returned to.",
      "\"The sovereignty over Taiwan is the red line of all the red lines,\" Wang told CBS News. \"Trump, in his presidential campaign speeches, he made it very clear\u2026 [that he's] unlikely to send troops to defend Taiwan.\"",
      "\"I believe that China's not going to invade Taiwan anytime soon,\" Wang added, noting that Beijing has \"so many problems it'll have to fix at home.\"",
      "If Beijing did invade Taiwan, the fallout would be felt worldwide.",
      "\"That would be a devastating hit to the global economy,\" said Chen. \"I hope that it would not happen. So, maybe now, given the challenges with the Chinese economy, the leadership is realizing that without a stable economy, then all its global geopolitical ambitions would not have any economic foundation.\"",

    "summary": "1970s-era U.S. spy satellite imagery has led archeologists to what they believe is the site of a seventh-century battle that was decisive in the spread of Islam in the region.",
    "story": [
      "Beirut \u2014 Declassified 1970s-era U.S. spy satellite imagery has led a British-Iraqi archeological team to what they believe is the site of a seventh-century battle that became decisive in the spread of Islam throughout the region.",
      "The Battle of al-Qadisiyah was fought in Mesopotamia \u2014 in present-day Iraq \u2014 in the A.D. 630s between Arab Muslims and the army of the Sassanid Persian dynasty during a period of Muslim expansion. The Arab army prevailed and continued on its march into Persia, now Iran.",
      "A joint team of archeologists from the U.K.'s Durham University and the University of Al-Qadisiyah stumbled across the site while undertaking a remote sensing survey to map the Darb Zubaydah, a pilgrimage route from Iraq's Kufa to Mecca in Saudi Arabia built more than 1,000 years ago. The findings were published Tuesday in the journal Antiquity.",
      "While mapping the route, the team noticed that a site some 20 miles south of Kufa in Iraq's southern Najaf province \u2014 a desert area with scattered plots of agricultural land \u2014 had features that closely matched the description of the al-Qadisiyah battle site described in historic texts.",
      "William Deadman, a specialist in archaeological remote sensing at Durham University, said the Cold War era satellite images are commonly used tools by archeologists working in the Middle East because the older images often show features that have been destroyed or altered and wouldn't show up on present-day satellite images.",
      "\"The Middle East has developed so much in the last 50 years, both agricultural expansion and urban expansion,\" he said. Some of the distinguishing features at the al-Qadisiyah site, such as a distinctive trench, were \"much more pristine and clear\" in the 1970s images, he said.",
      "A survey on the ground confirmed the findings and convinced the team that they had correctly identified the site.",
      "The key features were a deep trench, two fortresses and an ancient river that was reportedly once forded by elephant-mounted Persian troops, said Jaafar Jotheri, a professor of archeology at the University of Al-Qadisiyah who's part of the team that made the discovery. The survey team also found pottery shards consistent with the time period when the battle took place.",
      "A revealing, well-known battle",
      "Jotheri said Iraqis of his generation, who grew up under the rule of Saddam Hussein, were all familiar with the battle in minute detail, down to the names of the generals on both sides.",
      "The battle at the time had political connotations \u2014 Iraq was engaged in a devastating war with Iran through much of the 1980s. Saddam pointed to the Battle of Qadisiyah as a harbinger of victory for Iraq.",
      "Like most children growing up in that era, Jotheri said he'd watched a popular movie about the battle multiple times as it was on regular rotation on television.",
      "In the post-Saddam era, al-Qadisiyah has become something of a political litmus test. Iraqis' views of the battle vary depending on their feelings toward Iran, which has expanded its influence in the country since the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq that toppled Saddam.",
      "\"There is some political and religious context in this battle because now, of course, we have religious differences, ethnic differences, political differences in Iraq and we read or we view everything based on our \u2026 differences,\" Jotheri said. But he added, \"We all agree that it is a very important battle, a decisive one, and we all know about it.\"",
      "Discovery was part of a regional trend",
      "The team plans to begin excavations at the site in the coming year, Jotheri said.",
      "The discovery comes as part of a broader project launched in 2015 to document endangered archaeological sites in the region.",
      "It also comes at the time of a resurgence of archeology in Iraq, a country often referred to as the \"cradle of civilization,\" but where archeological exploration has been stunted by decades of conflict that halted excavations and led to the looting of tens of thousands of artifacts.",
      "In recent years, the digs have returned and thousands of stolen artifacts have been repatriated.",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 12:24:53 -0500",
    "summary": "\"Operating a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier is an exclusive club, one that China looks set to join,\" says a researcher behind the analysis of satellite images and government documents.",
    "story": [
      "Bangkok \u2014 China has built a land-based prototype nuclear reactor for a large surface warship, in the clearest sign yet Beijing is advancing toward producing its first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, according to a new analysis of satellite imagery and Chinese government documents provided to The Associated Press. China's navy is already the world's largest numerically, and it has been rapidly modernizing. Adding nuclear-powered carriers to its fleet would be a major step in realizing its ambitions for a true \"blue-water\" force capable of operating in seas far from China in a growing global challenge to the United States.",
      "\"Nuclear-powered carriers would place China in the exclusive ranks of first-class naval powers, a group currently limited to the United States and France,\" said Tong Zhao, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, D.C. \"For China's leadership, such a development would symbolize national prestige, fueling domestic nationalism and elevating the country's global image as a leading power.\"",
      "Researchers at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California said they made the finding while investigating a mountain site outside the city of Leshan in the southwest Chinese province of Sichuan, where they suspected China was building a reactor to produce plutonium or tritium for weapons.",
      "Instead they concluded that China was building a prototype reactor for a large warship. The project at Leshan is dubbed the Longwei, or Dragon Might, Project and is also referred to as the Nuclear Power Development Project in documents.",
      "Neither China's Defense Ministry nor Foreign Affairs Ministry responded to requests for comment.",
      "There have long been rumors that China is planning to build a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, but the research by the Middlebury team is the first to confirm that China is working on a nuclear-powered propulsion system for a carrier-sized surface warship.",
      "\"The reactor prototype at Leshan is the first solid evidence that China is, in fact, developing a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier,\" said Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at Middlebury and one of the researchers on the project. \"Operating a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier is an exclusive club, one that China looks set to join.\"",
      "Drawing on satellite images and public documents including project tenders, personnel files, environmental impact studies \u2014 and even a citizen's complaint about noisy construction and excessive dust \u2014 they concluded a prototype reactor for naval propulsion was being built in the mountains of Mucheng township, some 70 miles southwest of Sichuan's provincial capital Chengdu.",
      "The reactor, which procurement documents indicate will soon be operational, is housed in a new facility built at the site known as Base 909, which houses six other reactors that are operational, decommissioned or under construction, according to the analysis. The site is under the control of the Nuclear Power Institute of China, a subsidiary of the China National Nuclear Corporation, which is tasked with reactor engineering research and testing.",
      "Documents indicating that China's 701 Institute, formally known as China Ship Research and Design Center, which is responsible for aircraft carrier development, procured reactor equipment \"intended for installation on a large surface warship\" under the Nuclear Power Development Project as well as the project's \"national defense designation\" helped lead to the conclusion the sizable reactor is a prototype for a next-generation aircraft carrier.",
      "Satellite mages from 2020 to 2023 have shown the demolition of homes and the construction of water intake infrastructure connected to the reactor site. Contracts for steam generators and turbine pumps indicate the project involves a pressurized water reactor with a secondary circuit \u2014 a profile that is consistent with naval propulsion reactors, the researchers say.",
      "An environmental impact report calls the Longwei Project a \"national defense-related construction project\" that is classified \"secret.\"",
      "\"Unless China is developing nuclear-powered cruisers, which were pursued only by the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, then the Nuclear Power Development Project most certainly refers to a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier development effort,\" researchers wrote in a detailed 19-page report on their findings shared exclusively with the AP.",
      "Jamie Withorne, an analyst at the Oslo Nuclear Project who was not involved in the research and reviewed the findings, said Middlebury's team made a \"convincing argument.\"",
      "\"From the identifying reports, co-location with other naval reactor facilities, and correlating construction activity, I think it can be said that it is likely the Longwei Project is housed at Base 909, and it could potentially be located at the identified building,\" she said.",
      "The research does not, however, provide clues as to when a Chinese nuclear-powered carrier could be built and become operational, she said.",
      "Sarah Laderman, a senior analyst with Open Nuclear Network, a program of the U.S.-based NGO PAX sapiens foundation, said the findings were \"carefully conducted and thoroughly researched.\"",
      "\"Given the evidence presented here, I see a compelling case made that China seems to be working towards building a nuclear propulsion system for its naval surface ships (likely aircraft carriers) at this location,\" said Laderman, who is based in Vienna and was not involved in Middlebury's research.",
      "China's first carrier, commissioned in 2012, was a repurposed Soviet ship, and its second was built in China but based upon the Soviet design. Both ships \u2014 named the Liaoning and the Shandong \u2014 employ a so-called \"ski-jump\" type launch method, with a ramp at the end of a short runway to help planes take off.",
      "The Type 003 Fujian, launched in 2022, was the country's third carrier and its first to be indigenously designed and built. It employs an electromagnetic-type launch system like those developed and used by the U.S. Navy. All three carriers are conventionally powered.",
      "Sea trials hadn't even started for the Fujian in March when Yuan Huazhi, political commissar for China's People's Liberation Army Navy, confirmed the construction of a fourth carrier. Asked if it would be nuclear-powered, he said at the time that would \"soon be announced,\" but so far it has not been.",
      "There has been speculation that China may begin producing two new carriers at once - one Type 003 like the Fujian and one nuclear-powered Type 004 - something that it has not attempted before but that its shipyards have the capacity to do.",
      "Matthew Funaiole, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies' China Power Project, said he doubts China's next carrier will be nuclear-powered. Instead, he said, he would expect the People's Liberation Army Navy's fourth carrier to focus on optimizing the existing design of the Fujian carrier with \"incremental improvements.\"",
      "Nick Childs, senior fellow for naval forces and maritime security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said the Chinese \"have taken an incremental approach to their carrier development with a number of ambitions that will evolve over time.\"",
      "\"For now, their deployments have been relatively cautious, remaining largely within range of shore support, but projecting influence and to some extent coercion within their near waters.\"",
      "Eventually, however, \"larger carriers more akin to their U.S. counterparts will give them more options to project power,\" Childs said.",
      "It takes several years to build a carrier and bring it into operation, but developing nuclear propulsion for its next generation of warships would eventually give China more power to run advanced systems, such as electromagnetic launchers, radars and new technology weapons, Childs said.",
      "\"As well as obviating the need for the ship to refuel regularly and therefore giving it much greater range, nuclear power means that without the need to carry fuel oil for the ship there will be room aboard for fuel and weapons for its aircraft, extending their capabilities,\" Childs said.",
      "\"Much will depend on what overall size the next carrier is, but the addition of nuclear power will represent a significant step further in China's carrier development with a vessel more comparable to the U.S. Navy's carriers.\"",
      "Zhao, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said nuclear-powered carriers would provide the Chinese military \"with greater flexibility and endurance to operate around strategic hotspots, especially along the First Island Chain, where most territories disputed by China are located,\" said Zhao.",
      "The First Island Chain includes the self-governed island of Taiwan, which China claims as its own and vows to annex it by force if necessary.",
      "The U.S. is obligated by a domestic law to supply Taiwan with sufficient weapons to deter invasion, and it could provide assistance to the island from its bases in the Pacific in the event of an invasion or blockade. Tensions also have risen in the South China Sea between China and neighboring nations over territorial disputes and maritime claims.",
      "\"These carriers could also extend Chinese operations deeper into the Western Pacific, further challenging the U.S. military's ability to 'intervene' in regional matters that China views as best resolved by countries from the region only,\" Zhao said.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has tasked defense officials with building a \"first-class\" navy and becoming a maritime power as part of his blueprint for the country's rejuvenation.",
      "The country's most recent white paper on national defense, dated 2019, said the Chinese navy was adjusting to strategic requirements by \"speeding up the transition of its tasks from defense on the near seas to protection missions on the far seas.\"",
      "The People's Liberation Army Navy is already the world's largest navy with more than 370 ships and submarines. The country also boasts powerful shipbuilding capabilities: China's shipyards are building many hundreds of vessels each year, whereas the U.S. is building five or fewer, according to a U.S. congressional report late last year.",
      "However, the Chinese navy lags behind the U.S. Navy in many respects. Among other advantages, the U.S. currently has 11 carriers, all nuclear powered, allowing it to keep multiple strike groups deployed around the world at all times, including in the Indo-Pacific.",
      "But the Pentagon is growingly increasingly concerned about China's rapid modernization of its fleet, including the design and construction of new carriers.",
      "That aligns with China's \"growing emphasis on the maritime domain and increasing demands\" for its navy \"to operate at greater distances from mainland China,\" the Defense Department said in its most recent report to Congress on China's military.",
      "And China's \"growing force of aircraft carriers extend air defense coverage of deployed task groups beyond the range of land-based defenses, enabling operations farther from China's shore,\" the report said.",

      "Tel Aviv \u2014 Early this fall in Gaza, aid workers doled out one food portion per mealtime, per family to starving civilians displaced by Israel's raging war with Hamas. But as Israel choked off aid deliveries to the Palestinian territory, the meals dwindled. Last week, the United Nations again warned that some Gazans are facing famine conditions.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News senior White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich reports the latest on the growing divide.",
      "The media warned for months that Donald Trump would have \"no guardrails\" in a second term, and would probably hand out top positions to a bunch of right-wing crazies.",
      "Instead, he picked Marco Rubio yesterday as secretary of State, a 14-year Senate veteran and son of Cuban immigrants who has been informally advising him on foreign policy.",
      "MEDIA LIBERALS SAVAGE KAMALA AS TRUMP PICKS EXPERIENCED HARD-LINERS",
      "The president-elect has also tapped a number of Hill veterans who are conventional conservatives, agree with him on key issues and could just as easily have been named by Mitt Romney.",
      "Also yesterday, Trump selected Kristi Noem, the South Dakota governor, as Homeland Security secretary, after she overcame the dog-shooting incident that knocked her out of the veepstakes.",
      "Trump has been rolling out these appointments at hyper-speed, just a week after the election. He has stayed off TV and hasn\u2019t made any inflammatory posts. He\u2019s trying to demonstrate a seriousness about governing, by hitting the ground running.",
      "In the past, presidents and presidents-elect have appeared on air, praising their nominee or maybe two, and yielding to a short, grateful speech by the chosen ones. But Trump appears to be skipping all that.",
      "All the top jobs haven\u2019t been filled, obviously, but even some top Democrats are praising the choice of Rubio (while some in the MAGA movement are disappointed). He\u2019s unquestionably a hawk, and will be the face of American foreign policy as he travels around the world.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump is pictured in front of the White House. (Getty Images/AP Images)",
      "Sure, he said some terrible things about Trump, who derided him as Little Marco, when both ran in 2016. I watched Rubio on the trail that year and he\u2019s a very charismatic speaker.",
      "But the two have long since mended fences. Rubio tried to push immigration reform a decade ago as part of various Senate gangs, but has since distanced himself from the effort.",
      "I keep seeing television chyrons that, almost in accusatory fashion, say Trump is hiring \"loyalists.\" Excuse me\u2013do you think that Joe Biden, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton didn\u2019t hire loyalists? Presidents want aides who generally agree with them and won\u2019t turn into troublemakers. Biden hired such longtime advisers as Ron Klain, Mike Donilon and Steve Richetti.",
      "From a conservative point of view, when Biden hired top officials who wanted to strengthen environmental rules, boost labor unions and spend hundreds of billions of dollars to dig out of the pandemic, that was a hard-line departure from Trump 1.0. Now Trump will reverse many Biden policies with the stroke of a pen.",
      "DEPRESSED MEDIA REACT TO TRUMP VICTORY: HOW COULD THIS POSSIBLY HAVE HAPPENED?",
      "The other picks so far: Upstate New York congresswoman Elise Stefanik, a member of the House leadership and impeachment defender, has been tapped for U.N. ambassador.",
      "Trump also chose former Long Island congressman Lee Zeldin to run the EPA. He\u2019s a mainstream conservative who has crusaded against excessive environmental regulations and gotten a lifetime score of 14 percent from the League of Conservation Voters. He told Fox News that the administration will \"roll back regulations\" that are causing businesses to \"struggle\" and are \"forcing\" them to move overseas.",
      "After that, Trump tapped Florida GOP congressman Mike Waltz, a former Green Beret, as White House national security adviser, which doesn\u2019t require Senate confirmation. He\u2019s a China hawk and Ukraine skeptic. \"Stopping Russia before it draws NATO and therefore the U.S. into war is the right thing to do,\" Waltz wrote. \"But the burden cannot continue to be solely on the shoulders of the American people, especially while Western Europe gets a pass.\"",

      "By the way, Trump has shrunk what\u2019s expected to be a very small GOP edge in the House by picking two members. But in Rubio\u2019s case, Gov. Ron DeSantis can appoint a replacement who would serve until the midterm elections.",
      "As I\u2019m typing this, Trump just named Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor and presidential candidate, as ambassador to Israel. Huckabee has led many delegations to the country and is staunchly pro-Israel.",
      "And after I filed this, Trump named Bill McGinley, who worked on election integrity for the RNC and was general counsel for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, as his White House counsel.",
      "And after I filed the insert, another announcement: John Ratcliffe being tapped for CIA director. The former Texas congressman, known for criticizing the FBI as biased against Trump, became his director of national intelligence in 2020.",
      "Last night, Trump made his first hire from Fox News. Pete Hegseth, an Army combat veteran and co-host of \"Fox & Friends Weekend,\" has been named Defense secretary. Trump noted that Hegseth\u00a0did tours in Guantanamo Bay, Iraq, and Afghanistan, was awarded two Bronze Stars, and just published the best-selling \"The War on Warriors.\"",
      "Trump tried to get him confirmed the previous year, but Ratcliffe withdrew after GOP senators and ex-intel officials raised concerns about him, amid media disclosures that he\u2019d embellished his prosecutorial efforts in immigration and terrorism cases. So he certainly qualifies as a highly partisan pick.",
      "The two appointees who can fairly be described as aggressive hard-liners\u2013critics would say extremists\u2013are Stephen Miller and Tom Homan\u2013both hired to deal with Trump\u2019s top priority, the border.",
      "Miller, who spearheaded immigration policy in the first Trump term, has been promoted to deputy chief of staff, and even that title doesn\u2019t capture the clout he\u2019ll have as a trusted member of the inner circle. He pushed the family separation policy that was extremely controversial.",
      "WHY THE MEDIA WAITED TILL NOW TO ADMIT HARRIS RAN A LOUSY CAMPAIGN",
      "Homan, who ran ICE in the first term, is being called the border czar. When asked if there was a way to avoid separating families, as happened last time, he said sure\u2013deport them all together.",
      "He said at a conference over the summer: \"Washington Post can do all the stories they want on me about \u2018Tom Homan\u2019s deportin\u2019 people, he\u2019s really good at it!\u2019 They ain\u2019t seen s*** yet! Wait till 2025!\"",
      "Miller and Homan will be responsible for carrying out mass deportations of the roughly 11 million illegal immigrants living in America, or at least starting the process so the president-elect can say he kept his promise. Critics call the goal utterly unrealistic.",
      "Now there are others who will also enjoy huge influence. Elon Musk, who donated $119 million to help Trump, is now the most powerful private citizen ever\u2013heading a waste commission, posting hundreds of messages on X, sitting in on Trump call to Volodymyr Zelenskyy \u2013 all while seeking billions in federal contracts.",

      "RFK Jr. will get some title, but Trump has to decide whether to go along with his hotly disputed ideas on vaccines and removing fluoride from water systems.

      "Phishing emails are one of the most common tricks scammers use, but they\u2019re usually easy to catch if you pay attention. Awkward grammar, random details and, most importantly, an unofficial email address are dead giveaways. For example, you might get an email saying your Apple ID\u2019s been disabled, but the sender\u2019s email won\u2019t actually be from Apple. Now, though, scammers are finding ways to get around this.",

      "What you need to know",
      "The\u00a0FBI has seen a spike in criminal forum posts about emergency data requests and stolen email credentials from police departments and government agencies. Cybercriminals are getting into compromised U.S. and foreign government email accounts and using them to send fake emergency data requests to U.S.-based companies, which exposes customer data for further misuse in other crimes.",
      "In August 2024, a popular cybercriminal on an online forum advertised \"high-quality .gov emails\" for sale, meant for espionage, social engineering, data extortion, emergency data requests and more. The listing even included U.S. credentials, and the seller claimed they could guide buyers on making emergency data requests and even sell real stolen subpoena documents to help them pose as law enforcement.",
      "Another cybercriminal boasted about owning government emails from over 25 countries. They claimed anyone can use these emails to send a subpoena to a tech company and get access to usernames, emails, phone numbers and other personal client info. Some con artists are even hosting a \"masterclass\" on how to create and submit their own emergency data requests to pull data on any social media account, charging $100 for the full rundown.",
      "Illustration of a scammer at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "WINDOWS FLAW LETS HACKERS SNEAK INTO YOUR PC OVER WI-FI",
      "How this phishing scam works",
      "When law enforcement, whether federal, state or local, wants information about someone\u2019s account at a tech company, like their email address or other account details, they typically need a warrant, subpoena or court order. When a tech company receives one of these requests from an official email address, they\u2019re required to comply. So, if a scammer gets access to a government email, they can fake a subpoena and get information on just about anyone.",
      "To bypass verification, scammers often send emergency data requests, claiming that someone\u2019s life is at risk and that the data is needed urgently. Because companies don\u2019t want to delay in case of an actual emergency, they may hand over the information, even if the request turns out to be fake. By portraying it as a life-or-death situation, scammers make it harder for companies to take time to verify the request.",
      "For example, the FBI reported that earlier this year, a known cybercriminal posted pictures on an online forum of a fake emergency data request they\u2019d sent to PayPal. The scammer tried to make it look legitimate by using a fraudulent mutual legal assistance treaty, claiming it was part of a local investigation into child trafficking, complete with a case number and legal code for verification. However, PayPal recognized that it wasn\u2019t a real law enforcement request and denied it.",

      "CYBERSCAMMERS USE AI TO MANIPULATE GOOGLE SEARCH RESULTS",
      "What can companies do to avoid falling for these phishing scams?",
      "1) Verify all data requests: Before sharing sensitive information, companies should verify every data request, even those that look legitimate. Establish a protocol for confirming requests directly with the agency or organization that supposedly sent them.",
      "2) Strengthen email security:\u00a0Use email authentication protocols like DMARC, SPF and DKIM to block emails from unauthorized sources. Implement anti-phishing filters to detect suspicious content in messages.",
      "3) Train employees on phishing awareness: Regular training sessions on phishing scams can help employees recognize red flags, such as urgent language, unusual requests or emails from unknown addresses. Employees should be encouraged to report suspicious emails.",
      "4) Limit access to sensitive data: Restrict who can view or share sensitive customer data. Fewer people with access means fewer chances for accidental or intentional data leaks.",
      "5) Implement emergency verification procedures: Have a clear verification process in place for \"emergency\" data requests, including steps for double-checking with higher management or legal teams before responding to any urgent request for customer information.",
      "Illustration of a scammer at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Is there something you need to do?",

      "1) Double-check email addresses and links: Even if an email looks official, take a moment to check the sender\u2019s email address and hover over any links to see where they actually lead. Be cautious if anything looks off. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "3) Stay updated on phishing scams:\u00a0Keep an eye on the latest phishing tactics, so you know what to look out for. Regular updates help you spot new types of scams before they affect you.",

    "story": [
      "Chef Robert Irvine of the Robert Irvine Foundation speaks with Fox News Digital about the importance of supporting veterans and first responders this Veterans Day and some unique ways to do so.",
      "Cyberscammers are some of the most heartless people out there. They don\u2019t even spare our military heroes.",
      "Last year, these criminals stole $477 million from veterans, military personnel and their spouses, according to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). That\u2019s a $63 million jump from 2022, showing that the military community is a big target for scammers. The number of military members who lost money to these attacks went up by 7% to 30,948, per the FTC\u2019s latest data.",
      "These scammers use all kinds of tricks to get veterans to hand over personal info or hard-earned cash, including veterans' benefit scams and IRS scams. I break down five of the most common scams targeting our military heroes and how to stay safe from them.",

      "Image of military personnel (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Romance scams",
      "Romance scams have become an increasingly painful reality for veterans, as scammers target them through fake online relationships to exploit their emotions and financial stability. Often, these scammers pose as attractive, understanding individuals on dating apps, social media platforms or even support forums specifically tailored for veterans. They\u2019ll build a relationship over weeks or months, using flattery and fabricated stories to create a strong emotional connection with their target.",
      "Once the scammer believes they\u2019ve gained enough trust, they\u2019ll ask for money, typically by inventing a sudden, urgent situation. It might be a \"medical emergency,\" a supposed travel expense to come to visit or even a claim that they need help with a legal matter. The requests start small but can quickly escalate as the scammer continues to manipulate the victim's emotions.",
      "This continues to be the most common fraud targeting veterans, costing them and their families over $40 million in 2020, according to Aura. Among all romance scam victims, those ages 50-69 were hit the hardest, losing $179.65 million in just the first three quarters of 2022. That figure has almost certainly surged in 2024.",

      "NEARLY 1 MILLION MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES FACE DATA BREACH",
      "Veterans benefit scams",
      "Some scammers pretend to offer help with veterans' benefits. They promise to help increase benefits or expedite claims, but they\u2019re really after personal information or a fee. A scammer might claim you\u2019re eligible for new or additional benefits, contacting you by phone, email or text. When dealing with unsolicited advice, remember that if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Phishing scams from fake government agencies",
      "Phishing scams are a social engineering trick where scammers send emails that look like they\u2019re from official places, like the government or your bank. These legit-looking emails act as bait, but the real goal is to grab your banking or credit card info.",
      "Sometimes, these scam emails will ask you to click a link or download an attachment, which can install malware on your device. Scammers are also known to send phishing links through LinkedIn, Facebook or other social media.",
      "One classic example is the IRS scam. Though it targets everyone, military members are prime targets. Scammers pretend to be IRS agents, threatening jail time, fines or other penalties if they don\u2019t get immediate payment. They even spoof IRS caller IDs to make their calls look real.",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "Rental property scams",
      "Rental property scams are a common way scammers try to exploit people looking for a place to rent. In these scams, fraudsters often post fake listings for apartments or houses on popular rental websites or social media platforms. The listing might look too good to be true, like a beautiful place at an unbelievably low price.",
      "The scammer will usually claim to be out of town or unavailable to meet in person, asking potential renters to send a deposit or rent payment upfront to \"secure\" the property. In some cases, they may even send fake lease agreements or claim that the property is already rented, but they can still \"help\" find a similar place.",
      "BEWARE OF THIS SOCIAL SECURITY SCAM BY CROOKS TRYING TO TRICK YOU",
      "Car sales and financing scams",
      "Car sales and financing scams targeting veterans are unfortunately common. Scammers know that veterans may have limited experience with certain financial deals, so they exploit that by offering unrealistic car sales or financing options. These scams can take various forms, and the result is often financial loss and stress.",
      "Image of military personnel honoring our troops (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "6 ways veterans can protect themselves from scams",
      "1) Be cautious with unsolicited offers: Whether it\u2019s a phone call, email or text, if someone claims to offer help with veterans' benefits or promises something too good to be true, don\u2019t take the bait. Verify the legitimacy of any offer directly through official channels like the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) or trusted veteran organizations.",
      "2) Watch out for emotional manipulation in online relationships: Romance scammers often prey on veterans' emotions. Avoid sharing personal or financial details with people you meet online, especially if the relationship feels rushed or too perfect. If someone asks for money after just a few weeks or months, it\u2019s likely a scam.",
      "3) Verify government communications: Scammers often impersonate government agencies like the IRS or VA. If you get a message that threatens penalties or asks for personal information, don\u2019t respond. Instead, contact the agency directly using official contact details to confirm whether the message is legitimate.",
      "4) Be skeptical of rental or car sale deals that seem too good to be true: If a rental listing or car sale seems too cheap or perfect to be true, it probably is. Always visit the property or dealership in person, and never send money upfront without seeing the product or having a signed agreement.",
      "5) Protect your personal information: Avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from unknown sources. Scammers use phishing emails and fake websites to steal personal and financial information. Ensure your devices have updated security software and be extra cautious when handling sensitive data online.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6)\u00a0Invest in data removal services: Consider using data removal services to protect your personal information from being harvested by scammers. These services can help remove your data from public databases and people-search websites, reducing the risk of identity theft and unwanted solicitations.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Scammers rely on misinformation to trick you. However, by staying informed and being extra careful when navigating the internet, you can stay safe. These bad actors are constantly finding new ways to target veterans, from romance scams to fake government offers. Being cautious, verifying offers and keeping your data secure are the best ways to avoid falling victim to these heartless fraudsters.",

      "With cybercriminals lurking around every corner, protecting your identity and finances can feel daunting. But what if I told you that a VPN could be your secret weapon?",
      "By masking your IP address and encrypting your data, a VPN makes you nearly invisible to online threats.",
      "Let\u2019s dive into how this powerful tool can safeguard your online activities and keep your financial transactions secure.",
      "I\u2019M GIVING AWAY A $500 GIFT CARD FOR THE HOLIDAYS",
      "A woman using a VPN on a tablet\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is a VPN?",
      "A VPN, or virtual private network, is a service that encrypts your internet connection, ensuring that your online activities remain private and secure. By routing your internet traffic through a secure server, VPNs mask your IP address, making it difficult for hackers and malicious entities to track your online behavior.",
      "A VPN being used on a laptop\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "CAN YOU BYPASS VPN BLOCKS AND PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY?",
      "How VPNs work",
      "VPNs operate through two primary mechanisms \u2014 IP address masking and data encryption. When you connect to a VPN, it hides your real IP address by assigning you a new one from its server network, effectively preventing websites and cybercriminals from tracking your location or identifying you based on your IP address.",
      "Simultaneously, VPNs encrypt all data transmitted between your device and the internet, rendering it unreadable to anyone who might attempt to intercept it. This encryption process ensures that sensitive information, such as credit card details, remains confidential throughout your online activities. By combining these two powerful features, VPNs create a secure tunnel for your internet traffic, significantly enhancing your online privacy and security.",

      "Identity theft occurs when someone illegally obtains your personal information to commit fraud. This can lead to unauthorized transactions and damage to your credit status. So, how can a VPN prevent identity theft? By encrypting your internet connection, VPNs protect against data breaches and unauthorized access to personal information, especially on unsecured networks like public Wi-Fi.

      "Online transactions are vulnerable to interception by cybercriminals looking to steal financial information such as credit card numbers and banking credentials. A VPN can be used as a shield for financial data. VPNs ensure that all data exchanged during online transactions is encrypted, making it nearly impossible for hackers to access sensitive financial information. When using public Wi-Fi networks, which are often targeted by cybercriminals, a VPN provides an additional layer of security by encrypting all data transmissions.",

    "story": [
      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson discusses OpenAI ending its safety task force, actress Scarlett Johansson claiming the company copied her voice and the growing popularity of the voice notes phone feature.",
      "ChatGPT is an amazing tool, and its developer, OpenAI, keeps adding new features from time to time.",
      "Recently, the company introduced a new memory feature in ChatGPT, which essentially enables it to remember things about you. For example, it can recall your age, gender, philosophical beliefs and pretty much anything else.",
      "These memories are meant to remain private, but a researcher recently demonstrated how ChatGPT's artificial intelligence memory features can be manipulated, raising questions about privacy and security.",
      "I\u2019M GIVING AWAY A $500 GIFT CARD FOR THE HOLIDAYS",
      "ChatGPT introduction screen. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is ChatGPT's Memory feature?",
      "ChatGPT\u2019s memory feature is designed to make the chatbot more personal to you. It remembers information that might be useful for future conversations and tailors responses based on that information, even if you open a different chat. For example, if you mention that you\u2019re vegetarian, the next time you ask for recipes, it will provide only vegetarian options.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "You can also train it to remember specific details about you, such as saying, \"Remember that I like to watch classic movies.\" In future interactions, it will tailor recommendations accordingly. You have control over ChatGPT\u2019s memory. You can reset it, clear specific memories or all memories, or turn this feature off entirely in your settings.",
      "A prompt on ChatGPT. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "WINDOWS FLAW LETS HACKERS SNEAK INTO YOUR PC OVER WI-FI",
      "The security vulnerability in ChatGPT",
      "As reported by\u00a0Arstechnica, security researcher Johann Rehberger found that it\u2019s possible to trick the AI into remembering false information through a method called indirect prompt injection. This means the AI can be manipulated into accepting instructions from unreliable sources like emails or blog posts.",
      "For instance, Rehberger demonstrated that he could trick ChatGPT into believing a certain user was 102 years old, lived in a fictional place called the Matrix and thought the Earth was flat. After the AI accepts this made-up information, it will carry it over to all future chats with that user. These false memories could be implanted by using tools like Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive to store files, upload images or even browse a site like Bing \u2014 all of which could be manipulated by a hacker.",
      "Rehberger submitted a follow-up report that included a proof of concept, demonstrating how he could exploit the flaw in the ChatGPT app for macOS. He showed that by tricking the AI into opening a web link containing a malicious image, he could make it send everything a user typed and all the AI's responses to a server he controlled. This meant that if an attacker could manipulate the AI in this way, they could monitor all conversations between the user and ChatGPT.",
      "Rehberger's proof-of-concept exploit demonstrated that the vulnerability could be used to exfiltrate all user input in perpetuity. The attack isn't possible through the ChatGPT web interface, thanks to an API OpenAI rolled out last year. However, it was still possible through the ChatGPT app for macOS.",
      "When Rehberger privately reported the finding to OpenAI in May, the company took it seriously and mitigated this issue by ensuring that the model doesn\u2019t follow any links generated within its own responses, like those involving memory and similar features.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Johann\u00a0Rehberger\u2019s ChatGPT conversation. (Johann Rehberger)",
      "CYBER SCAMMERS USE AI TO MANIPULATE GOOGLE SEARCH RESULTS",
      "OpenAI\u2019s response",
      "After Rehberger shared his proof of concept, OpenAI engineers took action and released a patch to address this vulnerability. They released a new version of the ChatGPT macOS application (version 1.2024.247) that encrypts conversations and fixes the security flaw.",
      "So, while OpenAI has taken steps to address the immediate security flaw, there are still potential vulnerabilities related to memory manipulation and the need for ongoing vigilance in using AI tools with memory features. The incident underscores the evolving nature of security challenges in AI systems.",
      "The company says, \"It\u2019s important to note that prompt injection in large language models is an area of ongoing research. As new techniques emerge, we address them at the model layer via instruction hierarchy or application-layer defenses like the ones mentioned.\"",

      "1. Regularly review privacy settings:\u00a0Stay informed about what data is being collected. Periodically check and adjust privacy settings on AI platforms like ChatGPT and others to ensure you\u2019re only sharing information you\u2019re comfortable with.",
      "2. Be cautious about sharing sensitive information:\u00a0Less is more when it comes to personal data. Avoid disclosing sensitive details such as your full name, address, or financial information in conversations with AI.",
      "3. Use strong, unique passwords:\u00a0Create passwords that are at least 12 characters long, combining letters, numbers, and symbols, and avoid reusing them across different accounts. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA): Add an extra layer of security to your ChatGPT and other AI accounts.\u00a0By requiring a second form of verification, such as a text message code, you significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access.",
      "5. Keep software and applications up to date:\u00a0Stay ahead of vulnerabilities.\u00a0Regular updates often include security patches that protect against newly discovered threats, so enable automatic updates whenever possible.",
      "6. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0 In an age where AI is everywhere, protecting your data from cyber threats is more important than ever. Adding strong antivirus software to your devices adds a critical layer of protection. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices.",
      "7. Regularly monitor your accounts:\u00a0Catch issues early. Frequently check bank statements and online accounts for any unusual activity, which can help you identify potential\u00a0breaches quickly.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "As AI tools like ChatGPT get smarter and more personal, it's pretty interesting to think about how they can tailor conversations to us. But, as Johann Rehberger\u2019s findings remind us, there are some real risks involved, especially when it comes to privacy and security. While OpenAI is able to mitigate these issues as they arise, it also shows that we need to keep a close eye on how these features work. It's all about finding that sweet spot between innovation and keeping our data safe.",

      "Data theft and ransomware attacks against health care and critical third-party providers are still happening at an alarmingly high rate in 2024, which is shaping up to be as severe as last year, the worst on record for health care breaches.",

      "Impact of ransomware on health care",
      "Microsoft points out that beyond the financial risk to health care organizations, ransomware attacks can have life-threatening consequences. When health care providers lose access to diagnostic equipment or patient records due to ransomware, patient care is severely disrupted. For example, stroke code activations are nearly double during hospital attacks, with confirmed strokes increasing by 113.6%, and cardiac arrest cases rise by 81% and survival rates drop from 40% to just 4.5%.",
      "Health care facilities near hospitals hit by ransomware attacks also feel the impact, facing a surge in patients needing urgent care that they may not be equipped to handle. As a result, patients often face longer wait times.",
      "What\u2019s more troubling is that these attacks aren\u2019t limited to urban areas. Rural health clinics are also prime targets for cyberattacks. These facilities are particularly vulnerable to ransomware because they often lack the resources to prevent or respond to security incidents. And since these clinics are the only health care option within miles, a successful attack can be devastating for many rural communities.",

      "HEALTH CARE RANSOMWARE ATTACK EXPOSES PERSONAL HEALTH INFORMATION OF OVER 100 MILLION",
      "Why health care is the prime target?",
      "Ransomware attacks on health care have shot up 300% since 2015, making it one of the top 10 most targeted industries in the second quarter of 2024. This rise is mostly because health care organizations store extremely sensitive data, and hackers know there\u2019s big money to be made. With lives on the line, hospitals can\u2019t risk poor patient outcomes if their systems go down or the exposure of patient data if they don\u2019t pay. This reputation for paying ransoms just makes health care an even bigger target.",
      "Some of the blame also falls on health care organizations. They tend to have lower cybersecurity budgets compared to other industries, making it harder to defend against these kinds of attacks. Many facilities don\u2019t have staff dedicated to cybersecurity; some don\u2019t even have a chief information security officer or a security operations center. Instead, cybersecurity often gets lumped in with regular IT duties. Plus, doctors, nurses and other health care staff might not get any cybersecurity training, so they might not even recognize a\u00a0phishing email when they see one.",

      "Welby\u2019s resignation comes against the backdrop of widespread historical sexual abuse in the Church of England.

      "On Monday, Welby\u2019s office issued a statement reiterating that position and expressing his \"horror at the scale of John Smyth\u2019s egregious abuse.\"",
      "Church officials were first made aware of the abuse in 1982, when they received the results of an internal investigation into Smyth. The recipients of that report \"participated in an active cover-up\" to prevent its findings from coming to light, the Makin Review found.",

      "\"Nuclear-powered carriers would place China in the exclusive ranks of first-class naval powers, a group currently limited to the United States and France,\" said Tong Zhao, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, D.C. \"For China\u2019s leadership, such a development would symbolize national prestige, fueling domestic nationalism and elevating the country\u2019s global image as a leading power.\"",

      "Neither China\u2019s Defense Ministry nor Foreign Affairs Ministry responded to requests for comment.",
      "Satellite images and public documents helped identify likely carrier project",
      "There have long been rumors that China is planning to build a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, but the research by the Middlebury team is the first to confirm that China is working on a nuclear-powered propulsion system for a carrier-sized surface warship.",
      "\"The reactor prototype at Leshan is the first solid evidence that China is, in fact, developing a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier,\" said Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at Middlebury and one of the researchers on the project. \"Operating a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier is an exclusive club, one that China looks set to join.\"",
      "Drawing on satellite images and public documents including project tenders, personnel files, environmental impact studies \u2014 and even a citizen\u2019s complaint about noisy construction and excessive dust \u2014 they concluded a prototype reactor for naval propulsion was being built in the mountains of Mucheng township, some 70 miles southwest of Sichuan's provincial capital Chengdu.",
      "In this photo released by Xinhua News Agency, conventionally powered Chinese aircraft carriers Liaoning and Shandong carry out a dual aircraft carrier formation exercise for the first time in the South China Sea in late October 2024. (Chen Mengxi/Xinhua via AP)",
      "The reactor, which procurement documents indicate will soon be operational, is housed in a new facility built at the site known as Base 909, which houses six other reactors that are operational, decommissioned or under construction, according to the analysis. The site is under the control of the Nuclear Power Institute of China, a subsidiary of the China National Nuclear Corporation, which is tasked with reactor engineering research and testing.",
      "Documents indicating that China\u2019s 701 Institute, formally known as China Ship Research and Design Center, which is responsible for aircraft carrier development, procured reactor equipment \"intended for installation on a large surface warship\" under the Nuclear Power Development Project as well as the project\u2019s \"national defense designation\" helped lead to the conclusion the sizable reactor is a prototype for a next-generation aircraft carrier.",
      "Satellite mages from 2020 to 2023 have shown the demolition of homes and the construction of water intake infrastructure connected to the reactor site. Contracts for steam generators and turbine pumps indicate the project involves a pressurized water reactor with a secondary circuit \u2014 a profile that is consistent with naval propulsion reactors, the researchers say.",
      "An environmental impact report calls the Longwei Project a \"national defense-related construction project\" that is classified \"secret.\"",
      "\"Unless China is developing nuclear-powered cruisers, which were pursued only by the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, then the Nuclear Power Development Project most certainly refers to a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier development effort,\" researchers wrote in a detailed 19-page report on their findings shared exclusively with the AP.",
      "Jamie Withorne, an analyst at the Oslo Nuclear Project who was not involved in the research and reviewed the findings, said Middlebury's team made a \"convincing argument.\"",
      "\"From the identifying reports, co-location with other naval reactor facilities, and correlating construction activity, I think it can be said that it is likely the Longwei Project is housed at Base 909, and it could potentially be located at the identified building,\" she said.",
      "The research does not, however, provide clues as to when a Chinese nuclear-powered carrier could be built and become operational, she said.",
      "Sarah Laderman, a senior analyst with Open Nuclear Network, a program of the U.S.-based NGO PAX sapiens foundation, said the findings were \"carefully conducted and thoroughly researched.\"",
      "\"Given the evidence presented here, I see a compelling case made that China seems to be working towards building a nuclear propulsion system for its naval surface ships (likely aircraft carriers) at this location,\" said Laderman, who is based in Vienna and was not involved in Middlebury\u2019s research.",
      "Pursuit of a nuclear-powered carrier",
      "China\u2019s first carrier, commissioned in 2012, was a repurposed Soviet ship, and its second was built in China but based upon the Soviet design. Both ships \u2014 named the Liaoning and the Shandong \u2014 employ a so-called \"ski-jump\" type launch method, with a ramp at the end of a short runway to help planes take off.",
      "The Type 003 Fujian, launched in 2022, was the country's third carrier and its first to be indigenously designed and built. It employs an electromagnetic-type launch system like those developed and used by the U.S. Navy. All three carriers are conventionally powered.",
      "Sea trials hadn\u2019t even started for the Fujian in March when Yuan Huazhi, political commissar for China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy, confirmed the construction of a fourth carrier. Asked if it would be nuclear-powered, he said at the time that would \"soon be announced,\" but so far it has not been.",

(Pu Haiyang/Xinhua via AP)",
      "There has been speculation that China may begin producing two new carriers at once \u2014 one Type 003 like the Fujian and one nuclear-powered Type 004 \u2014 something that it has not attempted before but that its shipyards have the capacity to do.",
      "Matthew Funaiole, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies\u2019 China Power Project, said he doubts China's next carrier will be nuclear-powered. Instead, he said, he would expect the People's Liberation Army Navy's fourth carrier to focus on optimizing the existing design of the Fujian carrier with \"incremental improvements.\"",
      "Nick Childs, senior fellow for naval forces and maritime security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said the Chinese \"have taken an incremental approach to their carrier development with a number of ambitions that will evolve over time.\"",
      "\"For now, their deployments have been relatively cautious, remaining largely within range of shore support, but projecting influence and to some extent coercion within their near waters.\"",
      "CHINA OFFICIALLY 'DOESN'T CARE' ABOUT TRUMP WIN; UNOFFICIALLY, EXPERTS SAY BEIJING IS RATTLED",
      "Eventually, however, \"larger carriers more akin to their U.S. counterparts will give them more options to project power,\" Childs said.",
      "It takes several years to build a carrier and bring it into operation, but developing nuclear propulsion for its next generation of warships would eventually give China more power to run advanced systems, such as electromagnetic launchers, radars and new technology weapons, Childs said.",
      "\"As well as obviating the need for the ship to refuel regularly and therefore giving it much greater range, nuclear power means that without the need to carry fuel oil for the ship there will be room aboard for fuel and weapons for its aircraft, extending their capabilities,\" Childs said.",
      "\"Much will depend on what overall size the next carrier is, but the addition of nuclear power will represent a significant step further in China\u2019s carrier development with a vessel more comparable to the U.S. Navy\u2019s carriers.\"",
      "Zhao, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said nuclear-powered carriers would provide the Chinese military \"with greater flexibility and endurance to operate around strategic hotspots, especially along the First Island Chain, where most territories disputed by China are located,\" said Zhao.",
      "The First Island Chain includes the self-governed island of Taiwan, which China claims as its own and vows to annex it by force if necessary.",
      "The U.S. is obligated by a domestic law to supply Taiwan with sufficient weapons to deter invasion, and it could provide assistance to the island from its bases in the Pacific in the event of an invasion or blockade. Tensions also have risen in the South China Sea between China and neighboring nations over territorial disputes and maritime claims.",
      "\"These carriers could also extend Chinese operations deeper into the Western Pacific, further challenging the U.S. military\u2019s ability to \u2018intervene\u2019 in regional matters that China views as best resolved by countries from the region only,\" Zhao said.",
      "U.S.-China rivalry",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has tasked defense officials with building a \"first-class\" navy and becoming a maritime power as part of his blueprint for the country\u2019s rejuvenation.",
      "The country\u2019s most recent white paper on national defense, dated 2019, said the Chinese navy was adjusting to strategic requirements by \"speeding up the transition of its tasks from defense on the near seas to protection missions on the far seas.\"",
      "The People's Liberation Army Navy is already the world\u2019s largest navy with more than 370 ships and submarines. The country also boasts powerful shipbuilding capabilities: China\u2019s shipyards are building many hundreds of vessels each year, whereas the U.S. is building five or fewer, according to a U.S. congressional report late last year.",
      "In this photo released by Xinhua News Agency, China's third conventionally powered aircraft carrier, the Fujian, conducts a maiden sea trial on May 7, 2024. (Ding Ziyu/Xinhua via AP, File)",
      "However, the Chinese navy lags behind the U.S. Navy in many respects. Among other advantages, the U.S. currently has 11 carriers, all nuclear powered, allowing it to keep multiple strike groups deployed around the world at all times, including in the Indo-Pacific.",
      "But the Pentagon is growingly increasingly concerned about China\u2019s rapid modernization of its fleet, including the design and construction of new carriers.",
      "That aligns with China's \"growing emphasis on the maritime domain and increasing demands\" for its navy \"to operate at greater distances from mainland China,\" the Defense Department said in its most recent report to Congress on China's military.",

    "title": "Trump's Cabinet moves hand Ron DeSantis a gift \u2014 but possibly with strings attached",
    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 21:45:09 GMT",
    "summary": "Ron DeSantis will have a chance to put another stamp on state politics with a big appointment if Marco Rubio becomes secretary of state. But one major question hangs over that opportunity: How badly does Donald Trump want his daughter-in-law, Lara, to become a U.S. senator?",
    "story": [
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. \u2014 Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis will have a chance to put another stamp on state politics with a big appointment if Sen. Marco Rubio becomes secretary of state. But one major question hangs over that opportunity: How badly does President-elect Donald Trump want his daughter-in-law, Lara, to become a U.S. senator?",
      "DeSantis, like any Florida governor, has the ability to unilaterally appoint the person who would fill a vacant Senate seat, which may come into play following Monday's news of Trump's expected nomination of Rubio to lead the State Department. Trump could still change his mind, cautioned three sources familiar with the selection process, who said the decision wouldn't be final until the president-elect makes a formal announcement.",
      "But if Rubio's Senate seat becomes open, there is little doubt DeSantis will face at least some pressure from Trump\u2019s team to appoint a candidate they want, which would almost certainly be Lara Trump, according to seven people tracking deliberations around the potential vacancy.",
      "DeSantis does not have to listen to Trump, after the two men saw their relationship fray amid DeSantis' national rise and his failed 2024 presidential campaign. But\u00a0the president-elect carried Florida by nearly 13 points this year, giving Trump a shot of political capital and at least the perception of leverage.",
      "\u201cI think that pick makes a lot of sense and would be great for Florida,\u201d said a Trump ally who acknowledged there is interest from Trump world in seeing DeSantis appoint Lara Trump. \u201cHe had a great night last Tuesday. He won by huge margins, including in Florida. I think it\u2019s pretty clear the move would not be controversial with Florida Republicans.\u201d",
      "But Trump's wishes are far from the only consideration when it comes to a Senate seat that hasn't been open in 14 years. Another route getting significant attention, according to five sources NBC News spoke with, would be the so-called placeholder strategy.",
      "Under that scenario, DeSantis would likely appoint James Uthmeier, his longtime chief of staff and top political adviser who also did legal work for Trump's first campaign and advised former Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. Uthmeier would then not run when the seat came up for a special election in 2026 to fill the remaining two years of Rubio's term \u2014 giving DeSantis an open Senate seat to run for ahead of a likely second campaign for president in 2028.",
      "\"I think the James option is very much open. If DeSantis wanted to run for the seat, James would get out of the way, and if he did not, a trusted DeSantis ally would run for re-election,\" a longtime DeSantis adviser said. \"DeSantis controls the outcome either way.\"",
      "How the appointment process plays out would depend on whether the nascent push for Lara Trump by some figures turns into a harder lobbying effort from Mar-a-Lago, Trump\u2019s political home base \u2014 and then how DeSantis reacts to that pressure, if it materializes.",
      "\u201cAre they going to be able to alpha dog him?\u201d the same source said of DeSantis.",
      "DeSantis' team is aware of the dynamic.",
      "\"I have heard that too,\" a DeSantis ally said of Lara Trump getting in the mix for the Senate appointment. \"But also have heard from someone very high up that there is some dissension on whether that's a good idea.\"",
      "There's another possibility, though it's an increasingly unlikely move: DeSantis would be allowed to appoint himself, a scenario that first presented itself over the summer when Trump was considering Rubio as a potential running mate.",
      "Two DeSantis advisers told NBC News that it is very unlikely DeSantis would appoint himself, even though the option remains open.",
      "Others on the list of potential appointments include Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nu\u00f1ez, state Attorney General Ashley Moody, state House Speaker Paul Renner, former state House Speaker Jose Oliva and Rep. Laurel Lee, R-Fla., who was the first member of Congress to endorse DeSantis\u2019 presidential run, which was considered controversial because most of Florida\u2019s Republican congressional delegation backed Trump.",
      "\u201cI think there are some scenarios more likely than others,\u201d a DeSantis ally said, signaling the placeholder strategy is likely. \u201cBut no matter what direction the governor takes, there is a lot of talent available for the pick.\u201d",
      "DeSantis' rough relationship with Trump was one reason his pick of Rubio for secretary of state surprised many Florida political watchers.",
      "DeSantis and Trump were close when the then-president propelled DeSantis\u2019 once long-shot bid for governor in 2018, but there was a nasty falling out between the two as it became clear DeSantis would run against Trump in 2024. Another complicating factor: After that 2018 election, DeSantis fired his campaign manager, Susie Wiles, who has since become a mainstay in Trump\u2019s political operation and will serve as his chief of staff.",
      "Wiles and DeSantis still have bad blood, which left some to posit she did not hand him a Senate appointment without a plan.",
      "\u201cMy sense is they have a plan for the Florida angle,\u201d said a longtime Florida operative familiar with the Trump team's decision-making process. \u201cThe last thing [Trump\u2019s team] wants is to hand Ron an opportunity to really shuffle things around and create some sustained power for his crew, so I\u2019ve got to believe they will push hard if Ron is resistant.\u201d",
      "Because Trump has no ability to force DeSantis\u2019 hand, the \u201cpush hard\u201d portion of things could come in the form of Trump\u2019s huge right-wing social media and podcast ecosystem, which has helped make or break Republican political careers in the past. Most recently, this loose coalition has been trying to push Sen. Rick Scott of Florida over the finish line in his effort to become Senate majority leader, according to multiple media reports.",
      "\u201cI am actually going to make a public call for Gov. DeSantis to appoint Lara Trump to fill Marco Rubio\u2019s term in office,\u201d Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida, an early Trump backer, told Benny Johnson, a prominent Trump supporter with more than 3 million followers on X. \u201cShe would avoid a really nasty primary in two years.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m giving her my full backing,\u201d she continued of Lara Trump, who is a North Carolina resident. \u201cI\u2019m giving her my full backing.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump named John Ratcliffe as his pick for CIA director in the next administration Tuesday.",
      "Ratcliffe, a former congressman from Texas,\u00a0was director of national intelligence in Trump's first term.",
      "\"I look forward to John being the first person ever to serve in both of our Nation\u2019s highest Intelligence positions,\" Trump said in a statement Tuesday evening. \"He will be a fearless fighter for the Constitutional Rights of all Americans, while ensuring the Highest Levels of National Security, and PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH.\"",
      "Ratcliffe, who was the\u00a0U.S. representative\u00a0for\u00a0Texas\u2019\u00a04th District\u00a0from 2015 to 2020, was a controversial pick for director of national intelligence in Trump\u2019s first term \u2014 so much so that the first attempt to install him, in 2019, failed.",
      "Ratcliffe had been a federal prosecutor in Texas, and he boasted on his website about having \u201cput terrorists in prison.\u201d\u00a0NBC News and other news organizations\u00a0found no evidence that he had ever prosecuted a terrorism case.\u00a0He also misrepresented his involvement in the U.S. v. Holy Land Foundation terrorism financing case, NBC News previously reported.",
      "In the wake of those stories, Trump announced\u00a0that Ratcliffe had removed himself from consideration for director of national intelligence.",
      "Trump nominated Ratcliffe again in 2020, and the Republican-controlled Senate confirmed him.",
      "Congressional aides say Ratcliffe is not likely to face major difficulties being confirmed for the CIA job in another Republican-controlled Senate.",
      "Former intelligence officers who worked with Ratcliffe said he is a relatively constructive figure compared with some other potential Trump appointees who are more hostile to the spy agencies. But it is unclear whether Ratcliffe would be ready to push back against proposals\u00a0from Trump's team that could politicize the country\u2019s most powerful intelligence agency.",
      "As a lawmaker, Ratcliffe gained attention from the White House for his sharp criticisms of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, suggesting that FBI and intelligence officials had shown political bias and possibly committed crimes.",
      "At his confirmation hearing in 2020 before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Ratcliffe tried to distance himself from Trump\u2019s repeated claims about how a \u201cdeep state\u201d of federal officials inside the intelligence agencies was plotting to undermine him.",
      "Asked whether he believed there was a \u201cdeep state\u201d within the intelligence community, Ratcliffe said: \u201cI don\u2019t know what that is.\u201d",
      "Ratcliffe will be expected to carry out Trump's agenda; Trump has vowed to root out what he calls \"rogue\" civil servants across the federal government. He has focused his ire on the intelligence agencies in particular, claiming they are out to undercut him.",
      "Trump supporters have called for removing security clearances for former senior intelligence officials who speak to the news media without permission from the intelligence agencies\u2019 leadership.",
      "Ratcliffe has spoken in favor of Trump\u2019s decision to strip former CIA Director John Brennan of his security clearance.",
      "As director of national intelligence, Ratcliffe appeared to go out of his way to help Trump politically, but he was said to have balked after the election when Trump and his aides were seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 election.",
      "In September 2020, he\u00a0declassified intelligence about a purported Russian assessment that others had labeled unreliable or possible disinformation, with the Russians supposedly saying former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton personally approved an effort \u201cto stir up a scandal against U.S. Presidential candidate Donald Trump by tying him to Putin and the Russians\u2019 hacking of the Democratic National Committee.\u201d In the disclosure, Ratcliffe said the U.S. intelligence community \u201cdoes not know the accuracy of this allegation or the extent to which the Russian intelligence analysis may reflect exaggeration or fabrication.\u201d",
      "The move drew heated criticism from Democrats. But some saw Ratcliffe in a more favorable light when, during the congressional investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, former Trump White House staffer Cassidy Hutchinson said in a video deposition that Ratcliffe warned White House staffers against trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election.",
      "\u201cMy understanding was ... Director Ratcliffe didn\u2019t want much to do with the postelection period,\u201d Hutchinson testified. \u201cDirector Ratcliffe felt like that it wasn\u2019t something the White House should be pursuing.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt felt it was dangerous for the president\u2019s legacy,\u201d she said. \u201cHe had expressed to me he was concerned it could spiral out of control and potentially be dangerous either for our democracy or the way things were going for [Jan.] 6.\u201d",
      "Former intelligence officials and Democratic lawmakers harbor concerns that Trump\u2019s fixation with political loyalty and rooting out supposedly antidemocratic federal bureaucrats could damage the spy agencies\u2019 work.",
      "At the 2020 confirmation hearing for Ratcliffe, Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, warned of a \u201cconstant struggle\u201d with intelligence agencies trying to provide presidents with information that fits their political agendas.",
      "\u201cEvery executive wants to hear what they want to hear. Every person that works for that executive wants to tell the boss what they want to hear,\u201d King said."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump plans to nominate South Dakota Republican Gov. Kristi Noem to be the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, four sources familiar with the decision confirmed Tuesday morning.",
      "\"Kristi has been very strong on Border Security,\" Trump said in a statement announcing he will make the nomination. \"I \u00a0have known Kristi for years, and have worked with her on a wide variety of projects \u2014 She will be a great part of our mission to Make America Safe Again.\"",
      "As homeland security secretary, Noem would oversee a number of key federal agencies, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Secret Service, the Transportation Security Administration and the Coast Guard.",
      "Trump has told Noem that she is his pick for DHS secretary, according to two sources familiar with the decision.",
      "Noem, 52, has no significant experience with homeland security issues but has voiced support for Trump's hard-line immigration policies. She has defended her fellow Republican governors in their efforts to crack down on migrants in their states.",
      "In January, for example, she said in remarks that there was an \"invasion\" at the U.S.-Mexico border and said that her administration was considering helping Texas deter immigration at the southern border by sending it security personnel and razor wire. In response, members of the Oglala Sioux Tribe in South Dakota banned her from their reservation.",
      "Noem has criticized President Joe Biden's handling of the border, echoing Trump's arguments that violent criminals are flooding into the country.",
      "\"He is ignoring federal law and allowing people into this country that are incredibly dangerous,\" she said in an interview in June on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"And just this week I think we had four different people that were attacked or raped or murdered by illegal immigrants that have come in over our open border. And that cannot continue to happen.\"",
      "Asked in the interview about Trump's possible plans to pardon convicted Jan. 6 rioters, she dodged the question and said t would be his prerogative.",
      "\"I believe that Donald Trump, when he comes back to the White House and is in charge of this country, we\u2019re going to have incredible opportunities to show that people in this country will be safer, that we\u2019ll have law and order back in our streets,\" she said. \"If you look at one of the most violent areas of our country is often Democrat-run cities, sanctuary cities with an open border.\"",
      "Noem had been viewed as a possible vice presidential running mate for Trump in this cycle, but she was dogged by her admission in her book published in the spring that she had once shot and killed her dog.",
      "\"I would say that that was a story from 20 years ago about me protecting my children from a vicious animal,\" she said on \"Meet the Press.\" \"So we\u2019ve covered that, and any mom in those situations when you have an animal that\u2019s viciously killing livestock and attacking people it\u2019s a tough decision.\"",
      "Noem, who has been governor of South Dakota since 2019, was a member of the House of Representatives from 2011 to 2019 and the state House from 2007 to 2011.",
      "Similar to Trump's other allies, Noem had signaled support for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. In separate interviews on CNN in April and May, she wouldn't say whether she would have certified that election and refused to say whether Vice President Mike Pence acted appropriately when he did certify Biden's victory.",
      "Noem is the latest in a flurry of picks Trump has made to join his second administration.",
      "He has so far announced Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., to be U.S. ambassador to the U.N.; Susie Wiles as White House chief of staff; former Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency; and Tom Homan to be \u201cborder czar,\u201d a role that Trump said will oversee all of the administration's deportation efforts.",
      "Homan, who was acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement during the first Trump administration, is an advocate of hard-line immigration policies and has vowed to carry out mass deportations, a major campaign promise of Trump's. Two people familiar with Trump's decision said that Homan was not vying for homeland security secretary.",
      "Trump is also expected to name Stephen Miller, another immigration hard-liner, to be White House deputy chief of staff for policy. Miller was a senior White House adviser during Trump's first term, when he helped plan two of the administration's most controversial policies: family separations and the so-called Muslim ban.",
      "NBC News has reported that Trump has also selected Rep. Michael Waltz, R-Fla., as national security adviser and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., as secretary of state."

      "The incoming Trump administration is considering locations and talking to private prison companies about drastically expanding immigrant detention centers that would hold immigrants before they are deported as part of President-elect Donald Trump's promised mass deportation plan, two sources familiar with the planning told NBC News.",
      "The goal is to double the number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention beds \u2014 41,000 are now allocated by Congress \u2014 to hold vast numbers of migrants for short periods of time while they await deportation after their arrests inside the U.S., the sources said.",

      "Cities with large populations of migrants \u2014 like Denver, Los Angeles, Miami and Chicago \u2014 could need additional detention sites built nearby to hold migrants arrested there.

      "NBC News projected Valadao as the victor Tuesday evening in his Central Valley district, where he won a close rematch against Democratic former state legislator Rudy Salas.",
      "Valadao is the lone House Republican who voted to impeach Trump who has not drawn Trump\u2019s wrath in the form of an endorsement against him, although Valadao has faced challenges from his right since his impeachment vote.",

      "Trump boosted Sessler again one week before Election Day, writing on Truth Social that Newhouse is \u201ca Weak and Pathetic RINO,\u201d or Republican in Name Only, and that Sessler \u201cwill do an incredible job \u2014 He is MAGA all the way, and has my Complete and Total Endorsement.\u201d",
      "But that was the extent of Trump\u2019s help in the race, and Sessler was vastly outspent on the airwaves after the August primary.",
      "A GOP super PAC called National Interest Action, which played in two other House primaries, dropped $1.6 million on ads to boost Newhouse after the primary, according to the ad-tracking firm AdImpact. Newhouse\u2019s campaign spent $471,000 on the air, to Sessler\u2019s $227,000.",
      "Newhouse\u2019s most-aired spot focused on immigration and his work in the House, painting Sessler\u2019s policies as too extreme.",
      "Newhouse and Valadao are the only two of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump who are still serving in the chamber. Four retired and four others \u2014 Wyoming\u2019s Liz Cheney, Michigan\u2019s Peter Meijer, South Carolina\u2019s Tom Rice and Washington state\u2019s Jaime Herrera Beutler \u2014 lost primaries to Trump-backed challengers in 2022.",
      "Three of the seven Senate Republicans who voted to convict Trump in his second impeachment trial will return to the chamber next year: Alaska\u2019s Lisa Murkowski, Louisiana\u2019s Bill Cassidy and Maine\u2019s Susan Collins.",

    "story": [
      "Republican Eric Hovde refused Tuesday to concede defeat in the Wisconsin Senate race, casting doubt on the results despite a lack of evidence of any wrongdoing in last week's election.",
      "In a 4\u00bd-minute video on X, Hovde said he was considering whether to seek a recount in the battleground state contest, which NBC News and other outlets projected last week that Sen. Tammy Baldwin had won. She leads by less than 30,000 votes, 49.4% to 48.5%, with 99% of the vote counted.",
      "Wisconsin allows candidates to request recounts, but they are required to cover the expenses if the margin of victory is larger than 0.25 percentage points.",
      "But Hovde also suggested that a recount would not fully address the \"voting inconsistencies\" he claimed occurred.",
      "\u201cWhile I\u2019m deeply concerned, asking for a recount is a serious decision that requires careful consideration,\" he said. \"Further, there are meaningful limits on a recount, because they don\u2019t look at the integrity of the ballot.\"",
      "Hovde pointed to the absentee ballots Milwaukee reported early Wednesday, which went heavily for Baldwin, as an \"improbable\" outcome, arguing the count did not match the in-person voting pattern in the city.",
      "Democrats have traditionally been more likely to vote absentee than Republicans, and Milwaukee is one of the main Democratic bastions in Wisconsin. In addition, election workers are not allowed to begin processing absentee ballots until Election Day, which often leads to those votes\u2019 getting reported later.",
      "Hovde also claimed that voter turnout in certain precincts in Milwaukee was higher than the numbers of registered voters on file. That does not account for voters who registered on Election Day, which is allowed in Wisconsin.",
      "In a statement, the Milwaukee County Election Commission said it \"unequivocally refutes Eric Hovde\u2019s baseless claims regarding the integrity of our election process.\"",
      "\"Every aspect of the MEC\u2019s operations was conducted with transparency and in strict adherence to established laws and procedures,\" the statement read.",
      "Shortly after Hovde posted his video, Baldwin criticized him on X.",
      "\"Eric Hovde is spreading lies from the darkest corners of the internet to undercut our free and fair elections,\" she said. \"Wisconsin voters made their voices heard. It\u2019s time for Hovde to stop this disgusting attack on our democracy and concede.\"",
      "Asked by NBC News the day before Election Day whether he would accept the results of his race, Hovde responded, \u201cOf course.\u201d",
      "President-elect Donald Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in Wisconsin."

      "Amid a presidential loss and hand-wringing over the wreckage, congressional gains for Democrats in New York state are one of the small bright spots shining out from the party\u2019s bleak results.",
      "The Democratic Party lost five competitive House races in this blue state two years ago \u2014 the exact margin by which they lost the House majority. Now, three of those districts are back in Democratic hands (plus a fourth Democrats claimed in an early 2024 special election), even as Vice President Kamala Harris underperformed her former running mate, President Joe Biden, in the state.",
      "New York\u2019s unlikely battleground state status might inform Democrats\u2019 path forward, including the receipts from early investment and sustained organizing on the ground, as well as candidates who ran ahead of the national ticket and who weren\u2019t afraid to buck the national party line.",
      "One key ingredient isn\u2019t available everywhere: Democrats redrew the state political maps early this year, though that move gave some Democrats heartburn at the time. Still, Democratic winners and leaders from the state still see broader lessons.",
      "\u201cIn places that Gov. Hochul lost by a lot, or that Vice President Harris lost by a lot, we either won or lost by less,\u201d Rep.-elect Josh Riley told NBC News days after he flipped New York\u2019s upstate 19th Congressional District. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s because \u2014 I like to think anyway \u2014 that that\u2019s because my approach to this hasn\u2019t been around partisanship and political parties. It\u2019s really focused on the concerns folks have when they\u2019re sitting down at the kitchen table.\u201d",
      "In Riley\u2019s district, a win meant earning the backing of Republicans and Democrats alike. Biden carried the district by 4 points in 2020, and preliminary data suggests the presidential split was much closer this time.",
      "\u201cWe should be respectful enough of people to see what they see with their own eyes,\u201d Riley said of the conversations he had in his district. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of Democrats running around saying \u2018the economy is good,\u2019 and then I go and talk to a young family who\u2019s telling me they had to cut back on their grocery bill because the rent is too damn high. I think it\u2019s just having a dose of reality of what folks are dealing with.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s also a matter of having the resources to get that message across.",
      "In the aftermath of 2022, three top New York Democrats \u2014 Gov. Kathy Hochul, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries \u2014 joined together via a coordinated committee that allowed them to pool cash and staff resources through the state party to support downballot candidates. The three leaders built a political apparatus that boasted 38 offices across seven competitive districts and just shy of 100 full-time staff. By Election Day, the coordinated campaign had engaged over 23,000 volunteers, knocked more than 1 million doors, and made 5 million phone calls, according to the group, capping off an \u201cunprecedented\u201d effort in the state.",
      "\u201cNew York recognized very early on that we had become a battleground state and we needed a battleground operation,\u201d\u00a0a source directly familiar with the coordinated campaign told NBC News, speaking anonymously to give a more candid assessment.",
      "Organizers drew inspiration from other states, like Wisconsin, that had recalibrated in the face of past electoral defeats. But staffers also challenged themselves to get creative, too, like providing organizers with wagons full of Diet Coke to pull around the Syracuse University \u2014 a notorious \u201cPepsi campus\u201d where Coke is hard to come by \u2014 leading up to Election Day, giving would-be voters a dose of caffeine along with voting location information.",
      "The source directly familiar with the coordinated campaign saw New York as a place \u201cthat has actually gone against the narrative\u201d in 2024, at least at the House level.",
      "\u201cIt was a Trump wave on top,\u201d this person said, \u201cbut that couldn\u2019t save incumbent House Republicans in part because I think we had built a sophisticated voter contact operation across all of these districts\u201d and because candidates \u201cunderstood the nature of their districts.\u201d",
      "Still, a Republican strategist who worked on the New York races was quick to remind that it wasn\u2019t a clean sweep of competitive seats for Democrats, who weren\u2019t able to flip the 1st or 17th districts. \u201cClearly they though there was more ground than there was,\u201d the strategist said while predicting continued fluctuations in New York.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to be looking at an overarching realignment that started in earnest in 2022, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s over yet,\u201d the strategist said, noting Trump's gains with voters of color and other voter groups in and around New York City.",
      "In the lead-up to Election Day, Republicans were keen to stoke concerns about Harris\u2019 negative effect on vulnerable downballot Democrats.\u00a0Internal polling from the House GOP campaign arm across the seven competitive House districts showed Harris trailing Biden\u2019s margins \u2013 and even giving Trump an edge. Ultimately, while Biden carried New York by 23 points in 2020, Harris\u2019 margin was nearly halved.",
      "\u201cI think [Harris] was helpful as compared to where we would have otherwise been, just because of how weakened Biden had been in the public eye,\u201d the source said, saying Harris energized the base. \u201cWe needed an energized base and then our candidates could go out there and persuade voters that they were the right candidates to defeat these [GOP] incumbents.\u201d",
      "Riley, one of the candidates able to do just that, says it isn\u2019t as complicated as some are making it out to be.",
      "\u201cIf all you did was talk to quote-unquote political experts and pundits, you\u2019d think there\u2019s some mystery to be solved here,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you spent a day talking to people on Birdsall Street, they\u2019re going to tell you they\u2019re angry that our immigration system is broken. And they\u2019re even angrier that politicians aren\u2019t being straight with them about it.\u201d"

    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 21:29:18 GMT",
    "summary": "What started as a joyous weekend to celebrate Tuskegee University\u2019s centennial homecoming, within seconds, descended into violent tragedy early Sunday.",
    "story": [
      "As successive gunshots rang out early Sunday morning in a parking lot at Tuskegee University in Alabama, Kierra Talley thought she was going to die. Talley, a junior at Alabama State University, was visiting Tuskegee with friends to celebrate the historically Black college\u2019s centennial homecoming celebration when, she said, chaos erupted.",
      "\u201cIt was people shooting back at each other \u2014 whether it was in the crowd, outside of the crowd, inside of a dormitory \u2014 people were shooting,\u201d said Talley, 20, who added that she saw at least four gunmen with \u201cheavy ARs\u201d and guns with \u201cswitches,\u201d a small device that turns a semiautomatic gun into a fully automatic firearm.",
      "\u201cThis wasn\u2019t one person,\u201d she said. \u201cI describe it as a massacre.\u201d",
      "One person was fatally shot in the ordeal and at least 16 others were injured, including a dozen with gunshot wounds, according to local police. The person killed was 18-year-old La\u2019Tavion Johnson, the local coroner said Monday. He was not a student at Tuskegee, the university said in a statement.",
      "Videos circulating on social media show what appears to be a portion of the gunfire as dozens of people ran behind cars to take cover, some attempting to sprint to safety and others jumping to the ground. The beginning of the first shooting video in one X post captured what sounded like one shot after another initially, until seconds later there was a steady stream of gunfire that appeared to come from multiple guns lasting several minutes.",
      "Classes were canceled for students Monday and Tuesday and grief counselors were provided.",
      "In a news conference Monday, Tuskegee University President and CEO Mark Brown said the school community is \u201cheartbroken by what happened,\u201d adding that though the block party was an unsanctioned event, the school takes \u201cfull responsibility.\u201d He noted that moving forward the university would be closed to anyone who was not a student, faculty or staff member.",
      "University officials declined to provide NBC News any further comment on the shooting or investigation.",
      "Police arrested 25-year-old Jaquez Myrick of Montgomery and charged him with possession of a machine gun, the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency said in a news release. It was not clear if Myrick was a student. He was taken into custody while attempting to leave the scene, however, the agency did not say whether he is a suspect in the shooting. As of Tuesday afternoon, he remains in Montgomery County jail under U.S. Marshals custody, officials said. It\u2019s not clear if he has an attorney.",
      "In a newly unsealed federal complaint, according to the Associated Press, Myrick told federal agents that he shot his gun, but denied shooting at anyone.",
      "The agency said it had no additional information to provide at this time. The FBI has also joined the shooting investigation and has asked the public for tips and set up a website to accept videos and images about the incident.",
      "Celebration turned into tragedy",
      "According to Talley, people were gathered in the parking lot for the school\u2019s annual block party, which marks the final large gathering of homecoming weekend. There were a record 47,000 attendees at the football game just hours earlier on campus and hundreds, including children, remained on campus dancing to music from car speakers and enjoying drinks late into the night.",
      "Around midnight, Talley said she saw a small fight break out between a few people, which, she said, led to some people running for safety. But once the fight ended, Talley said things calmed down and after some time even more people congregated in the parking lot. Though it\u2019s been unconfirmed by law enforcement, Talley believes the fight was a precursor to the shooting.",
      "About an hour later is when the first sounds of gunfire erupted, Talley recalled, as she hid behind her car in fear for her life. One of her friends, who goes by Tony P., she said, was shot twice and as of Tuesday remains in the hospital. Talley estimates the gunfire lasted for at least eight minutes before she saw the first officer on the scene. Another 15 to 20 minutes passed, she said, until she saw additional officers.",
      "The steady stream of gunfire made the minutes feel like an eternity, she said.",
      "\u201cSeeing and hearing how close they were was very traumatic,\u201d Talley said, \u201cespecially because it was shooters everywhere.\u201d",
      "The closest hospitals that victims were taken to were more than 25 miles away \u2014 East Alabama Medical Center in Opelika, Alabama, which is a 30-minute drive from the campus, and Baptist Medical Center South in Montgomery, which is nearly an hour away.",
      "Talley said she saw people bleeding out at the scene, and when she went to visit her friend at Baptist Medical Center South in Montgomery that night, she said she saw people with gunshot wounds on gurneys awaiting medical attention.",
      "\u201cThe medical service here is not up to par,\u201d she said, adding that \u201cpeople can\u2019t afford to have health care. \u2026 That is traumatizing and we\u2019re expected to be there and be strong.\u201d",
      "With a population of 9,000 residents, the city of Tuskegee has a median household income of $32,000. One in three residents live in poverty. Ninety percent of the community is Black and about 8% white, according to recent census data. About 2,900 students are enrolled at the university.",
      "Tuskegee freshman Joaquin Crayton Jr. believes the university holds some liability for the shooting and its aftermath, particularly in not keeping students safe. Crayton said he was on the outskirts of the party when he heard gunfire and took off running toward his residence hall, Banneker Hall. He said he ran there for safety only to learn that a gunman was searching the dormitory\u2019s hallways for someone.",
      "\u201cWhen you are fleeing and running for your life, you gain a different kind of perspective,\u201d Crayton, 19, said. \u201cI thought I was safe in my dorm. I wasn\u2019t. A man went into our dorm room with a loaded gun and was looking for someone.\u201d",
      "Crayton, an aerospace engineering major, said members of the student body and the school president held a virtual town hall on Monday to discuss the shooting, but he said it got \u201cnowhere\u201d with students consistently being muted after trying to speak up about their safety concerns. Crayton said he believes the university has not been forthcoming with information about the number of injured victims and its shortcomings in regard to student safety last weekend. Though the block party event may have been unsanctioned, he said, it happens every year and given the school\u2019s centennial celebration, he believes school leadership should have been more prepared.",
      "\u201cAs a collective we are pissed off about what the school is doing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt takes a different kind of trauma for different age groups of 18- to 22-year-olds to come together to make sure this never happens again.\u201d",
      "Recent gun violence at HBCU homecomings",
      "Tuskegee is not the only HBCU reeling from gun violence during homecoming celebrations. Last month, in Nashville, one man was fatally shot and nine others wounded, including three children, during Tennessee State University\u2019s homecoming parade as two groups traded gunfire. At Albany State University in Georgia the following week, one person was fatally shot and four others injured during homecoming weekend. And at Alabama State, school officials last month reported shots fired during their homecoming activities, though there were no reported injuries.",
      "Fighting back tears, Talley said: \u201cWhen is it going to stop?\u201d",
      "The business management major blames the Tuskegee shooting on the lack of personal accountability in the Black community; the lack of gun reform in Alabama; and too little national attention that mass shootings involving African Americans get in the media.",
      "\u201cTuskegee is already a small town,\u201d she said. \u201cIf nobody is saying anything about this town, then this town is just forgotten \u2014 in a society where people already want to erase HBCUs and Black culture.\u201d",
      "More than 24 hours removed from the experience, Talley said she is filled with a mix of emotions.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m angry. I\u2019m upset. I\u2019m pissed,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m grateful that it wasn\u2019t me, but I\u2019m beyond pissed.\u201d",
      "Less than three months into his college experience, Crayton said he feels let down and the student body feels \u201cdefeated.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur security failed us, the police failed us, our campus police failed us,\u201d he said. \u201cHow many people have to die?\u201d"

      "Two Somali men who prosecutors called pirates were sentenced to 30 years in prison Tuesday in the 2012 kidnapping of an American journalist who was held hostage for over two years.",
      "Abdi Yusuf Hassan and Mohamed Tahlil Mohamed \u2014 who had positions in Somalia\u2019s government \u2014 were \u201ckey players\u201d in the abduction of journalist Michael Scott Moore, said Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.",
      "Moore was in Somalia investigating piracy when men with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades ambushed his vehicle and took him hostage on Jan. 21, 2012, officials said.",
      "He was held hostage for 977 days as the pirates demanded a ransom, and at one point he was transferred to a boat that had been taken over by pirates and whose slain captain was kept in a freezer, the U.S. attorney\u2019s office said.",
      "Hassan, a naturalized U.S. citizen, was Somalia\u2019s interior minister but was also the head of the pirate group, prosecutors said.",

    "story": [
      "Former Massachusetts Air National Guard member Jack Teixeira was sentenced Tuesday to 15 years for stealing classified information from the Defense Department and sharing it online, the U.S. attorney for Massachusetts announced.",
      "Attorneys for Teixeira didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. Teixeira apologized, according to coverage of the hearing in U.S. District Court by NBC affiliate WJAR of Providence, Rhode Island.",
      "\u201cAll of the responsibility falls on my shoulders,\u201d Teixeira said. \u201cAnd I accept what that may bring.\u201d",
      "The U.S. attorney's office argued for a 200-month sentence, or roughly 17 years, the maximum under an agreement between Teixeira and federal prosecutors.",
      "Judge Indira Talwani\u00a0noted the document leak happened after extensive training that covered the consequences for leaks and after Teixeira was warned about the way he handled classified material, according to WJAR.",
      "\u201cDespite that, you posted on the internet hundreds of documents over the period of a year,\u201d she said.",
      "Teixeira's attorneys argued for a sentence on the low end of the range, noting that the maximum of 200 months would be more than the government sought against Julian Assange, who is accused of publishing a trove of classified documents.",
      "They argued that Teixeira's autism and isolation during the pandemic contributed to his behavior.",
      "In March, Teixeira pleaded guilty to six counts of willful retention and transmission of national defense information under the Espionage Act. The plea was part of the agreement, which included a recommended sentence of 11 to 17 years. He was arrested by the FBI in North Dighton, Massachusetts, in April 2023 and has been in federal custody since mid-May 2023.",
      "After sentencing Tuesday, Jodi Cohen, special agent in charge of the FBI's Boston office, described Teixeira as \"one of the most prolific leakers of classified information in American history.\"",
      "Cohen said at a post-sentencing news conference that Teixeira put classified information online almost every day for more than a year. \"He transmitted it to our adversaries and our allies across the world,\" she said.",
      "Acting U.S. Attorney Joshua S. Levy said Teixeira's crimes put U.S. personnel abroad at mortal risk and damaged relationships with allies and may have revealed some of the ways the country gathers such material.",
      "\"He leaked information that the government determined was likely to cause grave damage to the United States,\" he said at the news conference.",
      "Among the exposed documents was information about troop movements, he said.",
      "According to court documents, Teixeira transcribed classified documents that he then shared on Discord, a social media platform used mostly by online gamers. He began sharing the documents in or around 2022, in part to impress peers on the platform, prosecutors alleged.",
      "A document he was accused of leaking included information about providing equipment to Ukraine, while another included discussions about a foreign adversary's plot to target American forces abroad, prosecutors said.",
      "Teixeira entered the Air National Guard in 2019 and was an airman first class. He was based at Otis Air National Guard Base on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, where he was assigned to the 102nd Intelligence Wing as a cyber transport systems journeyman.",
      "He was able to access the documents because he held a top-secret security clearance since around July 2021 and had received training in the definition of classified information, classification levels and proper handling of the material, according to the indictment.",
      "While the documents were discovered online in March 2023, Teixeira had been sharing them online for more than a year, prosecutors said.",
      "Levy said the sentence could serve as a warning to anyone pondering such a leak. \"The judge recognized the gravity of this conduct and the enduring nature of the harm,\" he said.",
      "While sentencing closed a chapter of the case, Levy argued wreckage caused by the defendant will continue to resonate.",
      "\u201cWe won\u2019t know the full extent of Jack Teixeira\u2019s damage for several years,\" he said."

    "story": [
      "A barrage of misogynistic comments have permeated social media since Donald Trump became the president-elect last week, according to research from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a London-based think tank.",
      "\u201cYour body, my choice\u201d \u2014 a phrase popularized by white nationalist Nick Fuentes \u2014 became the reigning chant among men on the far right who commented on women\u2019s posts across social media, especially those who expressed sorrow at the election results, the report found.",
      "The phrase \u2014 a retaliatory play on \u201cmy body, my choice,\u201d which for decades has been a rallying cry for advocates of reproductive rights \u2014 surged shortly after Fuentes posted on X on Election Day: \u201cYour body, my choice. Forever.\u201d",
      "The phrase was mentioned thousands of times per day on various social platforms in the week after the election, peaking at more than 12,000 mentions Friday, according to the report, which was published Friday. The Institute for Strategic Dialogue found a 4,600% increase in mentions of the terms \u201cyour body, my choice\u201d and \u201cget back in the kitchen\u201d on X in a 24-hour period late last week, the report said.",
      "The institute said it also observed reports of people using misogynistic language to harass women offline, including alleged instances of young boys\u2019 repeating \u201cyour body, my choice\u201d on school campuses. Hats and T-shirts featuring the phrase have also popped up on some e-commerce sites.",
      "\u201cOne of the alarming characteristics of this trend is how quickly online influencers, known for propagating hate, can influence both online and offline behaviors, most especially the behaviors of young men,\u201d co-author Isabelle Frances-Wright, the Institute for Strategic Dialogue\u2019s U.S. director of technology, wrote in an email statement.",
      "The report adds to other examples of hateful rhetoric spreading after Trump\u2019s victory. Last week, scores of Black people across the country began receiving racist text messages telling them they had been chosen to pick cotton \u201cat the nearest plantation\u201d \u2014\u00a0prompting an investigation by the FBI and state law enforcement agencies. (The sources and motivations of the texts have not been established.)",
      "Gender played a central role in this year\u2019s election as Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 presidential campaign emphasized reproductive rights. Polls before the election had found a widening gender gap between the two candidates.",
      "Trump ended up outperforming many of those polls. NBC News exit polling found that he drew 45% of all female votes, compared with 53% for Harris \u2014 a significant improvement from 2020, when he lost among female voters by 15 percentage points to Joe Biden. Trump also made gains among young women.",
      "Trump and his supporters had targeted Harris with misogynistic comments throughout her campaign. Trump said in July that world leaders would view her \u201clike a play toy\u201d based on her appearance, and his allies have suggested that Harris\u2019 political success is attributable to diversity, equity and inclusion policies. An ad from Elon Musk\u2019s America PAC, which has been deleted, called Harris the C-word before it went on to call her a \u201cCommunist.\u201d",
      "The Institute for Strategic Dialogue report found that many extremist politicians and influencers from the \u201cmanosphere\u201d \u2014 a network of online spaces where men often preach traditional notions of masculinity and espouse misogynistic stereotypes about women \u2014 were\u00a0emboldened after Trump\u2019s re-election.",
      "As misogynistic voices online \u201cexploit Donald Trump\u2019s election as a rebuke of both reproductive rights and women\u2019s rights,\u201d the report said, \u201cthe impact on women could extend into the next presidential election and beyond.\u201d",
      "Fuentes\u2019 post, which got more than 50,000 likes, was viewed more than 90 million times on X within a week. Though many online condemned the sentiment, Fuentes\u2019 phrase quickly gained traction in right-wing circles.",
      "On platforms like TikTok, women posted about the misogynistic comments they had received parroting Fuentes\u2019 remarks, with many also rebuking the sentiment. A TikTok spokesperson confirmed that phrases like \u201cyour body, my choice\u201d violate community guidelines, except for instances of counter-speech. The platform has removed some videos in the last week, a spokesperson said."

    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 19:09:50 GMT",
    "summary": "First Amendment advocates are concerned that Musk could use his sway as a Trump adviser to retaliate against a long list of enemies.",
    "story": [
      "In July, tech billionaire Elon Musk said he hoped some states would consider criminal prosecutions of people participating in what he called an advertiser \u201cboycott\u201d of platforms like his social media app, X.",
      "In October, Musk turned his attention to a former State Department official, Victoria Nuland, saying she should be \u201cprosecuted\u201d after she went on television and criticized him as a tool of the Kremlin.",
      "And then last week, Musk revived a long-running feud with a group that monitors hatred online, the Center for Countering Digital Hate, saying that its members should be prosecuted for \u201ctheir many crimes.\u201d",
      "Musk, the world\u2019s richest person, has in the past two years called for several of his opponents to be prosecuted, and it\u2019s something that free speech advocates say they could overlook if he were only an ordinary private citizen.",
      "But now that Musk is gaining political power as a close ally of President-elect Donald Trump, his demands for criminal charges against critics are much more worrisome, according to scholars and groups devoted to the First Amendment.",
      "\u201cIf Elon Musk is appointed to some position within the administration, he will continue to jawbone \u2014 pressure others to be punished for their speech \u2014 and that raises very serious free speech concerns,\u201d said Nadine Strossen, a past president of the American Civil Liberties Union and a professor of law emerita at New York Law School.",
      "\u201cIn our system, the idea of holding somebody criminally liable for something they say is so antithetical to the concept of free speech,\u201d she said in an interview.",
      "Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX and the owner of X, has positioned himself as an intimate adviser of Trump after helping to propel the former president to a remarkable political comeback. Musk contributed at least $130 million of his own money and the megaphone of X, where he is listed as having 204 million followers.",
      "Strossen and other free speech advocates said they\u2019re concerned that Musk could use his influence to strike out at his enemies, or make sweeping changes that would help him do so, such as suggesting personnel for the Justice Department. Trump has already said he wants Musk to advise him on federal spending and efficiency.",
      "\u201cMusk\u2019s actions over the past few years call into question his stated commitment to free speech,\u201d Aaron Terr, director of public advocacy at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, said in an email. He cited X\u2019s increasing compliance with foreign governments\u2019 demands to censor content on the platform and the lawsuits against the Center for Countering Digital Hate and Media Matters.",
      "\u201cAny disputes Musk has with his critics should play out in the court of public opinion, not a court of law,\u201d Terr said.",
      "Musk and representatives at X did not respond to requests for comment on his calls for prosecution.",
      "According to NBC News' review of Musk\u2019s public statements, there\u2019s an established pattern of him attacking nonprofit groups, journalists and others who produce information that he disagrees with or that may not be helpful to his goals or image \u2014 a pattern that runs counter to frequent vows by him that he\u2019s a defender of the First Amendment\u2019s guarantee of free speech.",
      "An NBC News review of Musk\u2019s statements identified seven critics whom he has accused of criminal conduct: the three examples above, as well as the progressive news site Media Matters, lawyers who represent dissident Tesla shareholders, investors who have sold Tesla stock short and journalists who share details about where his private jet has traveled, which is publicly available information.",
      "Musk has also attempted to silence critics through civil lawsuits, suspensions on X, calls for ending donations and one call for unspecified general \u201crecrimination.\u201d",
      "Of the cases in which Musk pursued legal action, he has not won a court judgment against any of those critics or persuaded a prosecutor to bring criminal charges. X has a pending lawsuit against Media Matters and a pending appeal in a lawsuit that X lost against the Center for Countering Digital Hate. Musk and X have sometimes found allies among members of Congress or state attorneys general who have launched investigations.",
      "Media Matters and Nuland declined to comment. A Tesla shareholder lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Now, some First Amendment scholars say Musk\u2019s statements may chill speech further if they carry the weight of an implied threat from an incoming government official.",
      "Michael Gerhardt, a law professor at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, said that there\u2019s often a large power difference between Musk and his critics \u2014 and that the difference is growing.",
      "\u201cThe First Amendment obviously protects both Musk and his critics in making public pronouncements about each other,\u201d he said in an email.",
      "\u201cYet, Musk has the bigger bully pulpit, by virtue of his wealth and allies, and his relationship with Trump likely will allow him more leverage to drown out \u2014 and if necessary \u2014 to use his economic power to wear them down financially and to get Justice Department support in harassing and punishing them,\u201d he said.",
      "The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Musk has for years buried certain critics under an avalanche of legal troubles. Sometimes courts have stood in the way. This year, when X lost its lawsuit against the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a federal judge called the suit an attempt by X to use the courts to silence a critic.",
      "\u201cThis case is about punishing the Defendants for their speech,\u201d U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer wrote.",
      "The ACLU, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University filed an amicus brief in support of the Center for Countering Digital Hate.",
      "The feud between Musk and the Center for Countering Digital Hate  has continued. A report last month from a conservative news site, Racket News, said it obtained internal CCDH documents that listed the group\u2019s annual priorities as including \u201cKill Musk\u2019s Twitter,\u201d referring to the app now known as X.",
      "Imran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, said in a phone interview that Musk\u2019s accusation of \u201cmany crimes\u201d was baseless. He said that the organization would not be intimidated into silence, and that he has faith in the ability of U.S. courts to protect his group and other critics of Musk.",
      "\u201cElon Musk is an incredibly thin-skinned man who\u2019s incapable of taking honest criticism, even when based on verifiable facts, and has already weaponized courts to try and punish his perceived enemies,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWe live in a country of checks and balances, and we have faith in our judicial system and in the freedoms afforded to us by the Constitution,\u201d Ahmed said.",
      "Ahmed did not dispute the authenticity of the documents published by Racket News, but he said the phrase \u201cKill Musk\u2019s Twitter\u201d appeared to be from an individual\u2019s meeting notes, not an official policy document.",
      "Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, also criticized the Center for Countering Digital Hate on Thursday, sending the organization a demand for documents related to the \u201cKill Musk\u2019s Twitter\u201d language. Jordan\u2019s House subcommittee, the Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government, posted the demand on X.",
      "\u201cOur censorship investigation isn\u2019t going anywhere,\u201d the subcommittee\u2019s X account said. \u201cAll gas. No brakes.\u201d",
      "Ahmed said the center had received Jordan\u2019s letter \u201cand we intend to comply in a manner consistent with our legal obligations and constitutional rights, as we have in the past.\u201d",
      "The Center for Countering Digital Hate is only the latest in a long line of Musk\u2019s targets.",
      "X has an ongoing lawsuit in federal court in Texas against Media Matters over its reporting about neo-Nazi content on the platform. Musk\u2019s company alleges that Media Matters unlawfully interfered with X\u2019s contracts with advertisers, something Media Matters denies.",
      "In August, X successfully sued one critic out of existence: The advertising industry group GARM closed its doors two days after X sued it alleging it organized an illegal ad boycott.",
      "\u201cI strongly encourage any company who has been systematically boycotted by advertisers to file a lawsuit,\u201d Musk posted in August.",
      "\u201cThere may also be criminal liability via the RICO Act,\u201d he said, referring to an anti-racketeering law.",
      "A lawsuit by X against GARM\u2019s parent organization, the trade group World Federation of Advertisers, is ongoing in federal court in Texas. The federation declined to comment.",
      "X has suspended the accounts of some of Musk\u2019s critics including Travis Brown, a researcher of far-right influencers who developed several research tools that gathered data from the Internet Archive, X\u2019s API and other sources. X said Brown\u2019s account was suspended for violating its rules around data usage, according to Wired. Brown later said he was suing X in a German court, though he said in an email last week that the court had dismissed his claim for lack of jurisdiction. X has not commented on the suit. Brown\u2019s X account remains suspended.",
      "Also last year, X suspended the accounts of Aaron Greenspan and PlainSite, a website that Greenspan founded with a free database of hard-to-get public records. Greenspan, a critic of Musk, sued X and Musk and said in court papers that he was wrongly suspended for \u201cposting private information\u201d but not told any additional details. Lawyers for X said in court papers that the company had a right to suspend him under its terms of service. The accounts remain suspended, and Greenspan\u2019s suit is pending in federal court in San Francisco. Greenspan declined to comment.",
      "In 2022, Musk said he planned to take unspecified \u201clegal action\u201d against Jack Sweeney, a college student who had set up social media accounts to track the private jets of celebrities including Musk using publicly available flight data. Musk accused Sweeney of enabling an alleged stalker and banned his account from X, although police found no link between the reported stalking incident and the jet-tracking account, The Washington Post reported.",
      "Sweeney, whose work has angered other private jet users such as Taylor Swift, said in an interview last week that Musk never sued and that he\u2019s not worried.",
      "\u201cIf there was any grounds for these people to do so, they would have already,\u201d he said. \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t worry that I have an account for his. They are newsworthy people. It kind of just comes with the territory that people are interested in where you go.\u201d"

      "In the days since President-elect\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0won the\u00a0presidential race, Nicole Bivens Collinson\u2019s phone has barely stopped ringing.",
      "Collinson, who helps lead the international trade and government relations division at the lobbying firm Sandler, Travis & Rosenberg, said she is fielding \u201cdozens and dozens and dozens\u201d of calls from anxious U.S. companies looking to protect themselves from Trump\u2019s hardline tariff plans by finding loopholes and exemptions.",
      "\u201cAbsolutely everyone is calling,\u201d Collinson told CNBC. \u201cIt is nonstop.\u201d",
      "Over the course of the 2024 campaign, Trump made universal tariffs a core tenet of his economic platform, floating a 20% tax on all imports from all countries with a specifically harsh 60% rate for Chinese goods.",
      "That hyper-protectionist trade approach sent chills up the spines of economists, Wall Street analysts and industry leaders who warned that across-the-board tariffs could make production \u2014 and in turn, consumer prices \u2014 more expensive, just as they were recovering from pandemic-era inflation spikes.",
      "\u201cThe threat of tariffs has alarmed retailers and a wide range of other U.S. businesses,\u201d David French, senior vice president of government relations at the National Retail Federation, told CNBC.\u00a0\u201cOur members have been working on contingency plans since President Trump secured the nomination.\u201d",
      "Ron Sorini, a principal at the lobbying firm Sorini, Samet & Associates, echoed that sentiment, noting that he takes at least two to three calls a day to field companies\u2019 concerns about the proposed tariff ramp-up, especially in China.",
      "\u2033[Companies] question where they should go, and how do they get the components out [of China]? How do they get the whole supply chain out?\u201d Sorini said.",
      "When Trump unleashed his first set of\u00a0China tariffs\u00a0in 2018, securing an exemption became a golden ticket in corporate America, a way to safeguard a company\u2019s China-based supply chains rather than paying the hefty price of relocation.",
      "And to obtain that golden ticket, it paid to know the right people.",
      "A 2021\u00a0research study\u00a0found that applications for Trump\u2019s first-term tariff exemptions were more likely to be approved when they came from lobbying firms whose employees had made political contributions to the Republican Party.",
      "Now, with Trump set to retake the White House in a matter of weeks, tariff escalation is becoming a more likely reality.",
      "And in corporate America, the race is on to find the right lobbyists to help companies rub shoulders with the right people, to give them an advantage in securing tariff loopholes.",
      "\u201cFirms are prepared,\u201d SUNY Buffalo finance professor Veljko Fotak, one of the authors of the 2021 study, told CNBC. \u201cThe real winners of this process are going to be the lawyers and lobbyists.\u201d",
      "What tariffs will look like in the next Trump administration, and whether exemptions will be available at all, are both unknown.",
      "\u201cUntil that clarity comes, businesses will have to plan for a variety of scenarios,\u201d Tiffany Smith, vice president of global trade policy at the National Foreign Trade Council, told CNBC.",
      "In response to CNBC\u2019s request for comment about the Trump team\u2019s plan for exemptions and companies\u2019 concerns of the tariff proposals, Trump transition team spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt doubled down on the president-elect\u2019s campaign promises.",
      "\u201cThe American people re-elected President Trump by a resounding margin giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail. He will deliver,\u201d Leavitt told CNBC in a statement.",
      "In the meantime, companies have been trying to set up defenses against Trump\u2019s more aggressive trade approach. These include stockpiling goods in the short run, readying price hikes so they can pass the cost of import duties on to customers, and trying to move their production out of China.",
      "On Thursday, Steve Madden pledged to reduce its Chinese imports by 45% over the next year in anticipation of Trump\u2019s tariff plans.",
      "But exiting China is a significant undertaking for many U.S. companies, especially small businesses that may not have the buying clout or leverage to move production so easily.",
      "\u201cWhat I would urge is that folks look at the impact on small businesses. Those are the people that are really getting hurt.

      "Despite the chilly weather, Keith Urban brought a dose of Australian sunshine to the TODAY plaza.",
      "Just days after his 57th birthday, Urban visited TODAY on Oct. 30 to close out the Citi Concert Series with a high-energy set filled with guitar solos, new hits and crowd-pleasing classics.",

      "The road to his latest album wasn't entirely straightforward: Urban wrote an album titled \"615\" before shelving the project and going back to the drawing board for \"High.\"",
      "When asked by TODAY.com why he chose to scrap \"615,\" his answer is simple: \"I didn't like it.\"",

      "Here's what Urban had to say about his latest album, his personal guitar heroes and his favorite Australian animal.",
      "What inspired you to title your new album \"High\"?",
      "I called the latest album \u201cHigh\u201d because it was a good, strong, simple, euphoric word that has a lot of interpretations, which I also liked. Everybody gets to that place differently, but it\u2019s definitely the destination, and the record has a feeling of euphoria.",
      "Do you see yourself releasing any of the scrapped songs from \u201c615\u201d in the future?",
      "So, I made an album called \u201c615,\u201d and there were four songs that I took off that record which made it onto \u201cHigh.\u201d The rest of them, right now, they\u2019re out in the front yard, up on blocks with grass growing around them. So we\u2019ll see what happens.",
      "Who would you put on your Mount Rushmore of guitarists?",
      "Well, first of all, I\u2019m going to need more than four faces, probably. (Jimi) Hendrix, No. 1 for sure. No. 2 is always hotly contested: Stevie Ray Vaughan, Eric Clapton, Mark Knopfler, Angus Young. I could go on and on. It\u2019s too many, way too many.",
      "Where is the most unusual place you've performed?",
      "The most unusual place I\u2019ve performed? On the baggage carousel at an airport on the little carpeted strip in between where the bags go around. Yeah, totally humiliating.",
      "What\u2019s your most fun song to perform onstage?",
      "All of them, because I feel really grateful that I don\u2019t have to do a song that I don\u2019t like. I feel really, really lucky that that\u2019s happened to me: to have such a long career and have certain songs like \u201cBlue Ain\u2019t Your Color,\u201d or \u201cSomebody Like You,\u201d or some of these songs, that I couldn\u2019t not do them. But I love them just as much as I did when I recorded them.",
      "When did your iconic hairstyle become part of your look?",
      "I've never decided to make hair a part of my look. God bless my mom. I got my mom\u2019s hair, and my dad really didn\u2019t have much, and I\u2019m grateful that I got her gene. Go, mom.",
      "From LL Cool J: How have you maintained your long career?",
      "That's a great question. First of all, right back at you, dude \u2014\u00a0been around a long time, high level. Same answer you\u2019d probably have: passion, hunger, curiosity.",
      "I love playing music just as much as I did when I was sitting in my bedroom at 6 years old learning to play guitar. I don\u2019t feel any different. I\u2019m just as excited to write the next song, put on the next tour, make another album \u2014 like, literally giddy with excitement to do that. That\u2019s never changed. And that could have worked or not worked, as far as staying relevant or being able to have songs that connect. I\u2019ve just been really blessed and lucky, and the harder I\u2019ve worked, the luckier I\u2019ve become.",
      "Rapid fire round:",
      "There\u2019s too many! I do love In-N-Out. I do love Chick-fil-A. ... I'm going to say In-N-Out is my favorite. Yeah, period.",
      "Oh, Sydney summer. Nashville winters are brutal. January is like Monday. February is like Tuesday. March is like a Wednesday. And slowly, as you can see, you\u2019re getting towards the weekend in Nashville, and the summer is like Friday, Saturday, Sunday \u2014 perfect.",

      "David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson acknowledged there was \"a lot of tension\" between them on \"The X-Files\" that resulted in the co-stars not speaking for weeks off camera while working on the hit show.",

Duchovny played FBI Special Agent Fox Mulder, and Anderson played his partner, Special Agent Dana Scully, in the science fiction series about unsolved cases involving the paranormal.",
      "Anderson said she came on Duchovny's podcast to have \"a conversation that I don't feel like we ever had,\" which led to him reflecting on shooting the show together during the height of its popularity in the '90s.",
      "\"The part of this conversation that is the trickiest part for me is, I guess I would talk about like my failure of friendship, or my failure of companionship,\" Duchovny said.",
      "\"There was a long time working on the show where we were just not even dealing with one another off camera,\" he added. \"And there was a lot of tension, which didn\u2019t matter, apparently, for the work, because we\u2019re both f------ crazy, I guess, that we could just go out there and do what we needed to do.\"",
      "\"It\u2019s crazy that we were able to present on camera the various feelings and emotions and attraction and all that kind of stuff, but then not speak to each other for weeks at a time or whatever,\" Anderson said.",
      "\"I don\u2019t know, but I could have handled myself better,\" Duchovny said.",
      "Duchovny also opened up about leaving the show in the early 2000s and his emotions after Anderson left \"The X-Files\" following its revival in 2018.",
      "\"I never apologized to you for that,\" he told Anderson about his original departure from the show. \"I don\u2019t know that I even talked to you about it, and then you said you weren\u2019t going to do the show anymore, like, the last time we did it (in 2018). And I know that hurt my feelings.\"",
      "\"Oh, I didn't know,\" Anderson said.",
      "\"I get it, you know, like, OK, and I support it, whatever it is you want to do, but I was like, 'Oh, she\u2019s quitting me,' you know?\" Duchovny said. \"She doesn\u2019t like working with me anymore. It was like, that little kid inside is going, 'Hey!' And then I was like, but I didn\u2019t say anything to her back in the day.\"",
      "Later in their conversation, Anderson returned to the moment Duchovny left in 2001.",
      "\"We never talked about it,\" she said. \"I don\u2019t think I ever blamed you. ... I don\u2019t think I blamed you at all. I don\u2019t think I was upset.\"",
      "\"Well, thanks a lot,\" Duchovny said.",
      "After Duchovny departed, Anderson considered following him out the door.",
      "\"There was a point, I mean, for me at that time, it was, 'Can I too?'\" she said. \"At first I thought, 'Well, then we\u2019re both going to because clearly I can\u2019t go on without him, so surely I\u2019ll be able to.' And then they started talking about, 'Well, if you stay on, you can actually make some good money.'\"",
      "Duchovny also recalled a \"dysfunctional\" moment between the two in the midst of their stardom on the show.",
      "\"It was some Emmys, and it was the day after, and I had a private plane, and I was giving you a ride,\" he said. \"And you were late, and I was so angry. And then we sat on this private plane, flying to Vancouver from LA, not talking.",
      "\"And you wrote me a letter,\" he continued. \"So you\u2019re just like 6 feet away from me, writing a letter to me, and it\u2019s a beautiful letter. I don\u2019t remember it exactly, but it was appreciative, and it was like it was all the things that I wanted to hear. But it\u2019s just amazing that we couldn\u2019t just have that conversation. The fact that it\u2019s a private plane, it\u2019s just all ridiculous.\"",
      "\"I had no memory that we were even on a private plane together, let alone, yeah, I wrote you a letter on one,\" Anderson said. \"Interesting.\"",
      "Duchovny also remembered a moment with \"The X-Files\" creator Chris Carter amid some tension in the first season.",
      "\"I think we were kind of butting heads so early on in the first season that Chris asked us if we would go into fake couples (therapy). Like, would we go into TV character couple therapy? I remember sitting in his office with you, and Chris is like, 'Yeah, do you guys want to go into therapy.' And I was like, 'You mean as Mulder and Scully?' I\u2019m confused. I remember that.\"",
      "Another source of strife came in 2016 when Anderson fought for pay equity with Duchovny for the revival of the show. She told The Daily Beast at the time that she was only offered half the salary of Duchovny for the 2016 return and had spent three years during the original run of \"The X-Files\" trying to achieve pay equity with her co-star.",
      "\"That whole pay equity thing, that\u2019s in our past as well,\" Duchovny said. \"I was part of that.",
      "\"Selfishly, back then, I thought I was like being attacked,\" he continued. \"I thought, 'Oh, I\u2019m being attacked for being offered more money.'\"",
      "\"Attacked by who?\" Anderson asked.",
      "\"The world,\" Duchovny said.",
      "\"What, that they blamed you in some way?\" Anderson said.",
      "\"In a way,\" Duchovny said.",
      "\"Oh really, I didn\u2019t know that,\" Anderson said. \"I'm sorry. That's interesting that I wasn't paying attention to that side of it.\"",
      "\"Well, I didn't make you pay attention to it,\" Duchovny said.",
      "During their talk, the two also delved into Anderson's childhood and latest ventures, including her new book, \"Want,\" a collection of anonymous sexual fantasies submitted by women from around the world."

      "\"It\u2019s so amazing how healing music is,\" she said. \"Your dad\u2019s not with us, my dad\u2019s not with us, so this is a song that goes to the heart.\"",
      "Snoop singled out Stancil ahead of his decision to declare him the winner.",
      "\"Reba was crying, I was crying, I\u2019m trying to hold them, push them back up, but ... nothing I can do about them, they\u2019re just gonna keep falling down,\" the rapper said of his tears. \"Truly honored to have you on my team.\"",
      "Eagle and Tankersley also remain in the competition due to a Save and a Steal as the show moves toward the Playoff rounds.",
      "\"Austyns was the winner based off of spirit, personality, and how he composed himself to hold in all of that pain and all of that loss to give us a great performance,\" Snoop said. \"Can\u2019t stop emotion when emotion hits you. Tears start falling, chills on your back, that\u2019s real music, that\u2019s real singing.\""

      "After nearly a two year hiatus, Paramount+'s riveting Western series, \u201cYellowstone,\u201d finally returns to give its dramatic conclusion.",
      "The popular Paramount+ show has captured audiences since 2018 with the ups and downs of the Dutton family, the owners of Montana's Yellowstone Dutton Ranch \u2014 the largest ranch in the United States.",
      "Six years later, \u201cYellowstone\u201d is set to air its final episodes, but without the show's favorite land magnate, John Dutton, played by Kevin Costner. His last appearance on the show was during the first part of Season 5, which\u00a0was released in 2022.",

      "What happens in first episode of Season 5, Part 2 of 'Yellowstone'?",
      "The first episode finds viewers in the middle of major drama as emergency services and caution tape surround John Dutton\u2019s mansion. As Beth Dutton (Kelly Reilly) runs to the house with Kayce Dutton (Luke Grimes) not far behind her, it becomes imminently clear that something is wrong with their father.",
      "As the siblings enter the home, viewers find that Governor Dutton has supposedly died by suicide. Beth immediately accuses Jamie (Wes Bentley) of having killed their father. While this opener is a jarring way to start off the second half of Season 5 \u2014 the episode quickly pivots to another scene.",
      "Viewers are now taken back to six weeks prior to Dutton's death as they follow Beth, Kayce, and their families in the days leading up to the tragedy. During the episode, time jumps back and forth between what led up to John Dutton\u2019s death and its aftermath.",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com, Wendy Moniz, who plays Governor Lynelle Perry, says she believes the series handled John Dutton's storyline \"beautifully.\"",

      "How do they write off Kevin Costner\u2019s character in 'Yellowstone'?",
      "As the first episode unravels, viewers quickly learn that John Dutton's death was not in fact suicide. Rather, it was a murder-for-hire scheme set forth by Sarah Atwood (Dawn Olivieri) who was in cahoots with Jamie Dutton. Sarah, a lawyer who has been an issue for John in previous episodes, says that she and Jamie agreed on the plan, but Jamie says he wasn't on board.",
      "While  John Dutton\u2019s death is made clear in the first few minutes of the episode \u2014 viewers soon learn that his presence still looms in the minds of the Dutton family.",
      "But, will we see actor Kevin Costner is one last scene? That is yet to be determined.",
      "Is this really the end for 'Yellowstone'?",
      "Paramount+ confirmed that this would be the final season for the Dutton family \u2014 but fans, and some of the show's stars, think that there could be room for more.",
      "When asked if this was the last season for \"Yellowstone\" by TODAY.com, Ian Bohen, who plays Ryan, a Dutton family ranch hand, teases \"it may not\" be the end.",
      "\"I feel satisfied, and very happy with what we've done. You know stories can't go on forever,\" he says. \"We're going to position it to have some sort of conclusion in some of the relationships and this and that. But not necessarily over.\"",
      "What are the 'Yellowstone' spinoffs?",
      "The expanding \"Yellowstone\" universe already has two popular spinoffs within the franchise and more on the way. The various shows travel throughout time, chronicling the same family over the course of hundreds of years.",
      "This prequel was packed with star power, including country stars Faith Hill and Tim McGraw, and actor Sam Elliot. The show traveled back in time to chronicle how the Dutton family first settled in Montana.",
      "Oscar winner Helen Mirren and legendary actor Harrison Ford led the cast of this prequel, which showed the next generation of Dutton family. Season 2 is currently in production.",

      "Officials issued an emergency decree banning all protests in the city, which will remain in effect through Thursday, boosted security at Jewish sites and prohibited the use of certain face coverings.",

      "Amsterdam\u2019s municipal security committee said that the game was not high-risk \u201cfrom a football perspective\u201d and that there was \u201cno animosity\u201d between the two sets of supporters, according to an official report released Tuesday. The committee said it consulted with police, the teams, authorities on soccer hooliganism and European soccer\u2019s governing body, UEFA, before the assessment.",
      "Ajax, the Netherlands\u2019 most successful team, has historically drawn fans from Amsterdam\u2019s Jewish community, and supporters sometimes carry Star of David flags to matches. The club also has many Muslim supporters.",

      "They saw \u201cwillingness to take action, and in a few cases also mobilization at a specific location,\u201d the report added.",

      "Some had \u201ctaken off their belts\u201d and attacked a taxi. Other taxis were \u201cvandalized\u201d nearby.",

      "According to the report, \u201crelatively small\u201d confrontations continued to break out around the casino.",
      "Later, the triangle discussed canceling the game but concluded that was \u201cuntenable\u201d because large numbers of fans were already in the city.",

      "Pro-Palestinian groups had initially planned to protest outside the Johan Cruyff Arena during the game, but Halsema, the mayor, said at a news conference Friday that she moved the demonstration to a remote location.",
      "Amsterdam, like many cities across the world, has been the scene of large protests against Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, which has killed more than 43,000 people, according to health officials in the blockaded enclave. Israel\u2019s invasion of Gaza followed Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 terrorist attacks, in which about 1,200 people were killed and Palestinian militants took around 250 hostages.",

A sign in the stadium read, \u201cIn memory of the flood victims in Valencia.\u201d",
      "That led to widespread criticism on social media, although several Israeli fans interviewed after the match said they had not heard the call for silence.",
      "The game ended around 11 p.m. local time (5 p.m. ET). And after having watched their team get beaten 5-0, many Maccabi fans made their way back to their hotels and the city center.",

      "Within an hour of the match\u2019s ending, security was falling apart.",
      "Problems were expected partly because of social media messages \u201cconfirming that there are groups that are looking for a confrontation with Maccabi supporters,\u201d according to Tuesday\u2019s report. Officials cited screenshots from messaging apps that called for a \u201cJew hunt.\u201d",

      "William has thought about how he might make his mark and approach things differently in both his current role as the Prince of Wales and, one day, as king, NBC\u00a0News royal commentator\u00a0Daisy McAndrew said.",

      "LONDON \u2014\u00a0Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby resigned Tuesday after an independent investigation found he failed to alert authorities about a serial physical and sexual abuser who preyed on more than 100 young boys and men at Christian holiday camps on two continents.",
      "Welby learned in 2013, shortly after he took the reins of the global Anglican church, that John Smyth had victimized about 30 boys and young men in the United Kingdom and 85 more in Africa over five decades, the independent Makin Review found.",
      "But the abuse allegations against Smyth weren't made public until 2017, when police, prompted by a report by Britain\u2019s Channel 4 television station, launched an investigation.",
      "Welby, the spiritual leader of 85 million Anglicans worldwide, said in a statement that he was stepping down \"in sorrow\" and \"having sought the gracious permission of His Majesty The King.\"",
      "In his resignation letter, Welby acknowledged \u201cpersonal and institutional responsibility\u201d for \u201cwrongly\u201d believing there wasn\u2019t a need to make a formal report to police when he was first told about Smyth.",
      "He said the timing of his departure would be decided later because \u201cit is my duty to honor my constitutional and church responsibilities.\u201d",
      "Welby had faced mounting calls to resign since the damning 251-page report on Smyth, a prominent lawyer who volunteered at Christian holiday camps, was published Thursday.",
      "\u201cJohn Smyth was an appalling abuser of children and young men,\" the report said. \"His abuse was prolific, brutal and horrific. His victims were subjected to traumatic physical, sexual, psychological and spiritual attacks.\u201d",
      "It found that since July 2013, the Church of England knew \u201cat the highest level\u201d about Smyth and should have \u201cproperly and effectively\u201d reported him to the relevant authorities.",
      "\u201cThere was a distinct lack of curiosity shown by these senior figures and a tendency toward minimization of the matter, demonstrated by the absence of any further questioning and follow-up,\" the report said.",
      "The independent investigators also reported that Welby and Smyth crossed paths at Christian holiday camps run by a British trust from 1975 to 1979 and exchanged Christmas cards for several years.",
      "\"He knew John Smyth from the Iwerne camps and was in John Smyth\u2019s dormitory for two camps,\" excerpts of the report said. \u201cHe has described being \u2018impressed\u2019 by John Smyth and reacting to his apparent power of intellect and charismatic [in the lay sense] personality. He says that they were never close, however.\u201d",
      "Smyth was already under investigation by police in the United Kingdom when he died in 2018 at age 77 in Cape Town, South Africa.",
      "Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell, second only to the archbishop of Canterbury, said Welby\u2019s resignation was \u201cthe right and honorable thing to do.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs a church, we continue to work towards and must achieve a more victim-centred and trauma-informed approach to safeguarding within the Church of England, and this must address the broader questions of culture and leadership,\" he said in a statement.",
      "Andrew Morse, who said he was abused by Smyth as a teenager, told The Guardian that Welby\u2019s resignation was \u201ca positive step in a very bleak situation that has existed ever since Smyth started beating me and my friends more than 40 years ago.\"",
      "A petition calling for Welby's resignation, created by members of the national assembly of the Church of England, had garnered over 13,000 signatures at the time of his announcement Tuesday.",
      "Asked whether Welby should resign,\u00a0British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the matter was ultimately for the church to address, but he emphasized the \u201cclearly horrific\u201d allegations of abuse, adding that it was evident the victims had been \u201cfailed very, very badly.\u201d",
      "While Welby said he wasn't made aware of Smyth's abusive behavior until 2013, the Makin Review found that back in 1982 there had been an internal investigation into Smyth and that recipients of that report \u201cparticipated in an active cover-up\u201d to prevent its findings from coming to light.",
      "Smyth moved to Zimbabwe in 1984 and later to South Africa, the review found. He continued to abuse boys and young men in Zimbabwe, and there is evidence that the abuse continued in South Africa.",
      "Hannah Peart reported from London and Corky Siemaszko from New York City."

      "HONG KONG \u2014 Hong Kong\u2019s top leader warned President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday not to interfere in the Chinese territory\u2019s internal affairs after he said he would \u201c100%\u201d free the imprisoned pro-democracy activist and tycoon Jimmy Lai.",
      "Lai, 76, the founder of the defunct pro-democracy tabloid Apple Daily, has pleaded not guilty to three charges of sedition and collusion with foreign forces in a landmark national security trial that is widely seen as a test of Hong Kong\u2019s press freedom and judicial independence. He faces possible life imprisonment.",
      "Asked last month whether he could get Lai out of China, Trump told conservative podcast host Hugh Hewitt, \u201c100%, I\u2019ll get him out\u201d and said it would be \u201cso easy.\u201d",
      "At a news conference Tuesday, Chief Executive John Lee did not directly answer a question about Trump\u2019s remarks but said he hoped for \u201cmutual respect\u201d between Hong Kong and the U.S., one of its top trading partners.",
      "\u201cWe desire mutual respect with all countries, including the U.S., because trade is beneficial for both sides,\u201d he said.",
      "He said Hong Kong, whose government denies that judicial independence is under threat, also valued the rule of law.",
      "\u201cIn these respects, I hope that all countries will respect the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and avoid political interference that could affect the judiciary and normal commercial activities in Hong Kong,\u201d he said.",
      "Lai\u2019s trial, which began in December, is expected to resume next week, with Lai taking the stand for the first time as defense arguments begin.",
      "Lai, a billionaire media tycoon who had long been a thorn in the side of Beijing, was arrested in August 2020, shortly after the central Chinese government imposed a national security law that criminalizes secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces.",
      "Hong Kong and Chinese officials say the law was necessary to restore stability after sometimes-violent pro-democracy protests roiled the city for months in 2019. But critics say it has been used to crack down on dissent in Hong Kong, a former British colony that was promised its civil liberties would be preserved for 50 years when it returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.",
      "Hong Kong also enacted its own national security legislation in March.",
      "Lai, a British national, is being tried by three national security judges handpicked by Lee. He is accused under the national security law of colluding with foreign governments to call for sanctions and other hostile actions against China and Hong Kong, as well as conspiring to publish \u201cseditious\u201d materials\u00a0under a colonial-era law.",
      "He has been charged in multiple other cases and is already serving a prison sentence of almost six years after he was convicted of fraud in 2022.",
      "John Burns, an emeritus professor at the University of Hong Kong who specializes in the city\u2019s politics and governance, said Trump\u2019s comment was part of his \u201cmagical realism foreign policy\u201d and a combination of \u201cboasting\u201d and \u201csimple solutions.\u201d",
      "\u201cNot everything in this world is amenable to a deal,\u201d Burns said in an interview. \u201cAuthorities in Hong Kong would say that national security is not open for deals.\u201d",
      "Lai is \u201cprobably the most high-profile\u201d person out of the approximately 300 people arrested under the national security law, Burns said, adding that the central Chinese government \u201ccares a lot\u201d about his case.",
      "\u201cIf Trump said he could free almost anyone else, there\u2019d be more credibility than saying he could free Jimmy Lai,\u201d he said.",
      "A spokesperson for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Trump was a popular figure among 2019 protesters, some of whom waved American flags and held up posters asking him to \u201cliberate\u201d Hong Kong. During his first administration, Trump revoked Hong Kong\u2019s special trade status and signed into law legislation authorizing sanctions on Hong Kong and Chinese officials accused of rights abuses.",
      "The legislation was introduced by Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., whom Trump is expected to nominate for secretary of state.",
      "Lee, Hong Kong\u2019s former secretary for security, is among the officials sanctioned over their involvement in implementing the 2020 national security law.",
      "He also did not directly answer a question about the potential closing of Hong Kong\u2019s economic and trade offices in Washington, New York and San Francisco. In September, the House overwhelmingly passed a bill that would allow their closure if they are found not to be running with a \u201chigh degree of autonomy\u201d from China.",
      "The legislation could also be passed by the new Republican-majority Senate and then signed into law by Trump, who could also use it as a negotiating tool with Beijing.",
      "\u201cWe welcome normal business exchanges, economic activities and people-to-people exchanges with different economies, including the U.S.,\u201d Lee said, adding that there are more than 1,200 American companies with presences in Hong Kong.",
      "Last month, the international financial hub regained its ranking as the world\u2019s freest economy in a report by the Fraser Institute, a think tank based in Vancouver, British Columbia, after it slipped below Singapore last year for the first time since the index began in 1970. The report said that while the rankings had been reversed, Hong Kong\u2019s rating \u201ccontinues to fall precipitously.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe continue to sound the alarm bell about signs of declining economic \u2014 and other \u2014 freedoms in Hong Kong,\u201d it said.",
      "The Hong Kong government hailed the city\u2019s return atop the rankings, emphasizing that it \u201cprotects the rights and freedoms\u201d of Hong Kong residents in strict accordance with the law and that \u201cthe interests of enterprises and investors are also fully safeguarded in accordance with the law.\u201d"

She operated alongside Australian warships protecting our shores and played a role in the sinking of the Japanese submarine I124 off Darwin,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cIt was horrific. It was heartbreaking. It was wrong. And it should never have happened,\u201d Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said with around 200 abuse survivors and families watching on from the public gallery at Parliament in the capital, Wellington.",
      "\u201cToday, I am apologizing on behalf of the government to everyone who suffered abuse, harm and neglect while in care. I make this apology to all survivors on behalf of my own and previous governments.\u201d",
      "The government had completed or started work on 28 recommendations from the inquiry, the prime minister said, and will provide its full response early next year.",
      "Luxon said a National Remembrance Day would take place on Nov. 12 next year, and that work will begin to remove memorials such as street names, public amenities and other public honors of proven perpetrators. Instead, the country will honor the victims, many of whom were buried in unmarked graves at psychiatric and other sites that were places of care in New Zealand.",
      "A bill to include a range of measures to improve safety in state care was to have its first reading in Parliament on Tuesday.",
      "The Royal Commission of Inquiry was the longest and most complex inquiry undertaken by New Zealand. The inquiry spoke to more than 2,300 survivors of abuse in the country of 5.3 million.",
      "The inquiry detailed a litany of abuses in state and faith-based care, including rape, sterilization and the use of electric shocks, which peaked in the 1970s.",
      "Those from the Indigenous Maori community were especially vulnerable to abuse, the report found, as well as those with mental or physical disabilities.",
      "The final report outlined 138\u00a0recommendations, including calling for public apologies from New Zealand\u2019s government, as well as the pope and the Archbishop of Canterbury, heads of the Catholic and Anglican churches, respectively, who have condemned child abuse.",
      "It also called for new legislation, including mandatory reporting of suspected abuse, including admissions made during religious confession.",
      "The report estimated that the average lifetime cost to an abuse survivor was about 857,000 New Zealand dollars ($510,000) per person as of 2020, although it did not make a clear recommendation on how much survivors should be compensated."

    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 10:19:22 GMT",
    "summary": "Businesses and consumers in China found the annual Singles\u2019 Day shopping festival less attractive this year amid a sluggish economy.",
    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 Businesses and consumers in China found the annual Singles\u2019 Day shopping festival less attractive this year due to a sluggish economy, forcing e-commerce firms to look abroad for growth.",
      "Online service provider and e-commerce platform Alibaba started the now-famous event on Nov. 11, 2009, offering attractive discounts to entice shoppers to spend more. The extravaganza, also known as \u201cDouble 11,\u201d has since expanded to other platforms in China \u2014 such as JD.com and Pinduoduo \u2014 and abroad.",
      "It has long been regarded as a barometer of consumer sentiment.",
      "While Singles\u2019 Day was previously a one-day event, shopping platforms in China now kickstart the festival weeks ahead to drum up sales volume. Even some brick-and-mortar stores join the festival by launching sales campaigns and hanging promotional banners and posters in the hopes of luring shoppers.",
      "But amid China\u2019s lagging domestic economy, dragged down by a\u00a0real estate crisis and deflationary pressures, consumers no longer go all out during the shopping extravaganza.",
      "Meanwhile, e-commerce platforms grappling with a slowing domestic market have turned to overseas markets to seek new growth, offering promotions like global free shipping and allowing merchants to sell worldwide with ease.",
      "Alibaba, for example, said in a blog post on its Alizila site that some 70,000 merchants saw sales double with global free shipping. In markets like Singapore and Hong Kong, new customers also doubled, the e-commerce company said.",
      "Since the festival began in late October, \u201cI have only spent a few hundred yuan on daily necessities,\u201d said Wang Haihua, who owns a fitness center in the Chinese capital, Beijing.",
      "Wang said that the prices offered on e-commerce platforms during Singles\u2019 Day are not necessarily cheaper than usual. \u201cThey\u2019re all tricks and we\u2019ve seen through it over the years,\u201d she said.",
      "Zhang Jiewei, a 34-year-old who runs a barber shop in the city of Xi\u2019an, echoed Wang\u2019s sentiments, saying that he no longer trusts Singles\u2019 Day promotions as some merchants tend to raise the usual prices before offering a discount, giving consumers the illusion that they are getting a deal.",
      "\u201cI used to buy a lot two or three years ago and I even purchased a mobile phone (during Singles\u2019 Day),\u201d he said. However, following the Covid-19 pandemic, he stopped \u201cbecause of lower income.\u201d",
      "\u201cI am not going to buy anything this year,\u201d Zhang said.",
      "Some experts say that Beijing\u2019s\u00a0recent stimulus measures\u00a0have had little impact on increasing consumer confidence.",
      "\u201cPeople are not interested in spending and are cutting back on big-ticket items,\u201d said Shaun Rein, founder and managing director of China Market Research Group in Shanghai. \u201cSince October 2022, the weak economy means that everything has been on discount year-round; 11.11 is not going to bring in more discounts than the month before.\u201d",
      "Rein said he expects low growth for the Singles\u2019 Day shopping festival as consumers tighten their spending in anticipation of difficult economic times ahead.",
      "Categories such as sportswear and fitness, however, have been doing well as customers \u201ctrade down a Gucci bag for Lululemon sportswear,\u201d he said.",
      "Jacob Cooke, CEO of e-commerce consulting firm WPIC Marketing + Technologies, said that despite the luxury downturn, the shopping festival still showed strong sales for goods in premium price brands across categories like mother-baby, personal care and toys, as well as outdoor and sport.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a clear shift in consumer priorities towards experiences, hobbies and health,\u201d Cooke said. \u201cWith record-level platform subsidies and generous membership programs like Alibaba\u2019s 88VIP, consumers actually showed a preference for premium branded goods during this year\u2019s festival.\u201d",
      "Platforms such as JD.com and Alibaba previously used to publish the total value of the festival\u2019s transactions but have stopped since 2022. While yearly growth used to be in the double digits, estimates of recent figures have dwindled to low single-digit growth.",
      "Syntun, a data provider, estimated that last year\u2019s gross merchandising volume sales across major e-commerce platforms grew just 2% to 1.14 trillion yuan ($156.40 billion), a far cry from double-digit growth before Covid-19."

      "BAKU, Azerbaijan \u2014 U.S. climate envoy John Podesta urged governments to keep faith in the country\u2019s promise to combat global warming, saying\u00a0President-elect Donald Trump\u00a0can slow, not stop, the transition from fossil fuels when he returns to office in January.",
      "The annual U.N. climate summit began on Monday in Baku, Azerbaijan, with many country delegations concerned that Trump\u2019s victory in the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 5 will hinder progress to limit planetary warming.",
      "Trump has promised to again remove the United States, the world\u2019s most significant historic greenhouse gas emitter, from international climate cooperation and maximize the country\u2019s already record-high fossil fuel production.",
      "\u201cFor those of us dedicated to climate action, last week\u2019s outcome in the United States is obviously bitterly disappointing,\u201d Podesta said at the summit.",
      "\u201cBut what I want to tell you today is that while the United States federal government, under Donald Trump, may put climate action on the back burner, the work to contain climate change is going to continue in the United States.\u201d",
      "He said the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), President Joe Biden\u2019s landmark climate legislation providing billions of dollars in subsidies for clean energy, would continue to drive investments in solar, wind and other technologies and that U.S. state governments would also push emissions cuts through regulation.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that any of that is reversible. Can it be slowed down? Maybe. But the direction is clear,\u201d he said.",
      "Although Trump has promised to rescind the IRA, to do so would require an act of Congress \u2014 and that could be elusive due to support from\u00a0some Republican lawmakers whose districts benefit from IRA-linked investments.",
      "Apart from the election of Trump as president of the world\u2019s biggest economy, the talks in Baku are vying for attention with economic concerns and wars in\u00a0Ukraine\u00a0and\u00a0Gaza.",
      "That complicates the summit\u2019s ambition to resolve the\u00a0priority agenda item\u00a0\u2014 a deal for up to $1 trillion in annual climate finance for developing countries, replacing a target of $100 billion.",
      "U.N. climate chief Simon Stiell sought to whip up momentum.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s dispense with the idea that climate finance is charity,\u201d he said at the Baku stadium. \u201cAn ambitious new climate finance goal is entirely in the self-interest of every nation, including the largest and wealthiest.\u201d",
      "This year is on track to be the hottest on record. Rich and poor countries alike have been challenged by extreme weather events, including\u00a0flooding disasters in Africa, coastal\u00a0Spain\u00a0and the U.S. state of\u00a0North Carolina, and drought gripping\u00a0South America,\u00a0Mexico and the\u00a0U.S. West.",
      "But even agreeing on one of COP29\u2019s first tasks has proved a challenge: setting the agenda for negotiations has been delayed for several hours.",
      "Countries were also at odds over a proposal from\u00a0China\u00a0to include trade on the COP29 agenda.",
      "Trade has gained importance as an issue for China, already facing European Union tariffs, because of\u00a0Trump\u2019s campaign promise\u00a0to impose 20% tariffs on all foreign goods, and 60% on Chinese goods.",
      "Many also worry that U.S. disengagement could lead other countries to backpedal on existing climate pledges or scale back future ambitions.",
      "\u201cPeople will be saying, well, the U.S. is the second-biggest emitter. It\u2019s the biggest economy in the world. ... If they don\u2019t set themselves an ambitious target, why would we?\u201d Marc Vanheukelen, the E.U.\u2019s climate ambassador from 2019 to 2023, told Reuters.",
